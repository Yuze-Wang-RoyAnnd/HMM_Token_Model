the problem with this movie is that it is shot on the worst possible camera and the film is blurry and grainy. maybe it's just the fact that whoever was holding the camera couldn't hold still because they were having a seizure or something. there is also way too much poop and vomit in this movie. there is someone vomiting every twenty minutes and it makes me think that this was made by some bulimic or something. it was disgusting. then there is the annoying high pitched screaming that goes on and on and on and doesn't stop until the credits roll. i also didn't like when all her friends were being shot (or not i don't know)and she goes in the van and puts band aids on. that was just really really stupid to even have that in a movie. how much gas can a person siphon to get a van going? it must be a whole lot because they don't run out of gas for the rest of the movie. it was a terrible movie and i would highly suggest not ever seeing it in your whole entire life.
