(aka: trinity is still my name) this sequel looks like it was done to capitalize on the outstanding european box-office success of they call me trinity, only this time joseph e. levine and avco-embassy pictures wanted to capitalize on it in america as well. too bad they didn't get very far since the hill/spencer pictures have had only had marginal success here in the u.s., and this largely boring, drawn-out film doesn't help it out any.<br /><br />trinity and bambino swear to their dying father (harry carey jr.) that they will become successful outlaws and take care of each other. they later get involved with arms-traffickers who smuggle guns out of a monastery, and who mistakenly think they're a pair of federal agents. it all winds up falling flat in spite of a couple of funny scenes, especially the one where trinity and bambino are in a fancy french restaurant and don't know how to carry themselves. and the scenes with the card sharks was mildly humorous as well.<br /><br />the opening title music sung by gene roman sounds like a fair bobby goldsboro-like early 70s pop song while the music cues sprinkled throughout the movie are pretty good. not sure if i'd want to buy the cd soundtrack of it but some others might.<br /><br />the film could have had a half hour whacked off of it and it wouldn't have dragged on for so long. it looks like a lot of scenery is being chewed up here. in fact, i lost interest in it about 2/3rds of the way through. the dvd is also terrible, with a constant hum in the soundtrack and a poor print that looks like it should have been sent to that great scrap heap in the sky.<br /><br />a big step down from the previous film.<br /><br />4 out of 10
