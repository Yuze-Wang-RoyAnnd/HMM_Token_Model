i've tried to watch this show several times, but for a show called "that '70s show," i don't find much apart from a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the '70s -- the decade in which i grew up. of the episodes i have seen, most of the plots and jokes could be set in any time period. take away the novelty of (supposedly) being set in the '70s, and the show is neither interesting nor funny.<br /><br />if you're looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in america in the '70s, in my humble opinion you can do no better than "the wonder years."
