i caught "sorrows lost" at the new york film and video festival and i guess i had some high hopes for this film. sadly, this is just another visual fx calling card. the story is pretty lame. the bad lighting and camera work, along with the less than great editing and music all make the film seem low quality.<br /><br />is it really too much to ask that fx shorts have better stories and have the rest of the technical production be on par with the fx! you can't just get away with cool fx in shorts anymore, it's been 5 years since "405" made a big splash. at least that short quick, cool and was even a little funny! none of that can be said about "sorrows lost."
