let this serve as a warning to anyone wishing to draw attention to themselves in the media by linking their name to that of a well-loved and well-respected, not to say revered author, in order to draw attention to their home-movies out on dvd.<br /><br />hyped to the skies by its obviously talentless makers, in fact lied about only to be revealed, finally, as ludicrously inept in every department, the fans of wells and of his book have been after the blood of its writer-producer-director since it appeared on dvd.<br /><br />many good points have been made by the other comments users on this page. particularly the one about using this as a teaching aid for film school students, since this "film" does not even use the basic grammar of scripting, editing, continuity, direction throughout its entire 3 hours running time. it is possible the director did show up for the shoot. certainly there was no-one present who knew even remotely what they were doing.<br /><br />an ongoing thread continues to evolve on this imdb page which should at least furnish the watchers of this witless drivel with a few laughs for their $9.00 outlay.<br /><br />much was promised. absolutely nothing was delivered. except "monty python meets "war of the worlds" with all the humour taken out.<br /><br />indefensible trash. just unbelievable.<br /><br />there are real independent film-makers out there to be checked out. people who actually try to work to a high standard instead of flapping their gums about how great their movie is going to be.<br /><br />people could do worse than keep an eye on brit film-maker jake west's "evil aliens" for example.
