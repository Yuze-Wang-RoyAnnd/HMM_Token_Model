i enjoyed the previous ittenbach movie that i'd seen, "burning moon". but while that movie was rather grim and nasty, "premutos" seems to mostly play it for laughs. while its admirable how ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time (and the dvd documentary is worthwhile to see this), i found myself constantly battling not to fast-forward to the next gore scene. sure, there's gore, and if that's all you want then go ahead and enjoy. but be warned: there's an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition. many are comparing this to peter jackson's movies, especially "braindead". but looking at what jackson did on a similar budget in "bad taste", it's clear ittenbach is lacking one thing that jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for pretty good and plentiful gore effects, and for getting the most out of limited resources - but not worth the money i paid for it)
