portly nice guy falls for a luscious blonde; she likes him too, but not for the reasons you might think. little-seen black comedy from writer pat proft features very good performances by joe alaskey and donna dixon, yet it makes no lasting impact. it's just a quickie throwaway effort, helmed by norman bates himself, anthony perkins. even on the level of b-comedies, the somewhat-similar "eating raoul" is a better bet. there's definitely an amusing set-up here; unfortunately, the picture has nowhere to go in its second act. an interesting try, but it misfires.<br /><br />** from ****
