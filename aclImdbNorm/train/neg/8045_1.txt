i am so confused. what in the world was this movie about? what was the killer's motivation? he seemed quite angry, but i have yet to figure out why. nothing in this movie made sense. it had zero depth. or less than zero depth. which i guess would make it a hill. or a pile. of crap. the acting was horrible. when i searched for a few of the actors in this movie, they had been in very few things that i had heard of, and that came as absolutely no surprise. i can't decide whether to feel sorry for them for the embarrassment of being in a movie this bad, or to feel that they should never be offered another acting job again. starting . . . now! (seinfeld reference.) really, though, don't waste your time with this. there's so little substance that there's nothing there even just to make fun of. this was undoubtedly one of the worst slasher flicks -- no, one of the worst flicks of any kind, that i have ever had the misfortune to watch, and i've seen quite a few.
