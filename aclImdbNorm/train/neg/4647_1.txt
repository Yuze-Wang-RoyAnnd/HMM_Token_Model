half the reviews were good so i took a chance for $10. sure priscilla barnes had some sex talk but it wasn't much. the whole plot later that she may be the other actress mother & the documentary maker falling for the young woman is stretching it. its not funny its not that raunchy its not much of anything but a waste of time. boogie nights was based on real people that were in the adult industry this is based on nothing that ever happened in the industry. it could have shocked with whats popular today in adult films mocking todays gonzo videos and that big orgy that they had 5 minutes to shoot what a joke a bigger orgy has been done bigger & better decades ago in the early 1970s.
