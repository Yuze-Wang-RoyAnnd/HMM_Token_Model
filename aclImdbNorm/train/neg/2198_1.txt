a scientist and his girl friend are out driving when his speeding causes a car crash. he escapes unharmed but she is decapitated. he saves her head, brings it to his house and keeps it alive (!!!!). he then proceeds to search out models and strippers for the perfect body for the head. his crippled assistant watches over the head which starts talking and has a telepathic (or telepathetic) link to a deformed monster kept in the closet....<br /><br />as you can see, this is pretty stupid stuff, but i had a certain fondness for it. when i grew up in the late 1970s, a local tv station showed this movie about 20 times each year (no exaggeration). they showed it always on saturday afternoon tv--uncut. seeing this on tv back then was great! explicit blood and gore along with a gruesome monster and sleazy sexploitation--who cares if it was good? seeing it now i realize how lousy this really is.<br /><br />the acting is perfectly wretched, the production values are nonexistent, the script is pretty dumb and (aside from the still pretty disgusting gore) this is dull stuff. there's also a mild cat fight between two women and the admittedly great monster at the end. also add in an ending which leaves tons of loose ends. on one hand this is an interesting example of a 1960s exploitation film. on the other its utter trash. either way, it's not a good movie but is a must-see (for one time only) for horror and gore fans.<br /><br />also the head's laugh is pretty creepy. note the end credits which gets the title wrong (calling it "the head that wouldn't die")!
