my original review of this film was simply the word sh*t written 2000 times over. although this was a very accurate critique, i felt my review should be a little more descriptive.<br /><br />i will start with the lead actress; her facial expression doesn't change once in this film, she doesn't show fear, happiness or depression. her skills in body language pretty much come down to darting her eyes left and right and looking like she don't know jack. she is an emotionless husk who i'm guessing has had too much botox. her lack of facial expression through out the film is outmatched however by the deplorable love affair with the lead actor which seems to spring out of nowhere and has them making out on a beach and falling in love within a couple of hours of meeting one another. the lead actor, whose hair demands more attention than he did, was mediocre at best and did not once make me feel like he was genuinely in peril.<br /><br />the only thing that tops the hideous acting is the directing, storyline and inaccuracies in plot. i have seen tampon ads with more structure than this movie. the is no development in character, they just seem to say and do things that i could never believe a real person would.<br /><br />this film would not have been bad if it was trying to be crap on purpose like snakes on a plane but it was trying so hard to be a serious action flick that i couldn't even laugh. i believe i now have a brain tumour from watching this film and thinking up all the different ways i could have used that budget and cg team to create something far superior. if i bought this on dvd i would smash the dvd to pieces, burn it then dissolve it in hydrochloric acid for good measure. don't watch this film!
