whoa nelly! i've heard a ton of mixed reviews for this...but one of my go to hardcore horror reviewers really found it to be disappointing. man was he right on the nose! this movie was acted by pure amateurs. they had to have done one take, maybe two on each scene, the movie seemed soooo rushed. the script was also poor....they had lines that tried to be unique but failed. miserably. "get your meathooks off of me!" oh man, i hate it when movies try to do that. it happens all the time with comedies...but, with a horror movie and with below average actors....the results are incredibly pathetic. the lines and scenarios were all very predictable. but what made me feel so negative towards this movie was, again, the damn acting. it was awful. besides by the little asian guy who worked the booth. i thought he was great.<br /><br />the movie is about 5 stupid dumbsh!t tourist who are on a vacation in asia. they end up at the wrong place and fall into the hands of a mafia run sex/slaughterhouse. sounds like a cool story. but watching someone with a bad case of diarrhea is probably more fun and intense to watch. the only reason this is considered horror is because of the killing. there wasn't a trace of suspense.<br /><br />i like many other horror fans were dying to get their bloody little mitts on this. but unfortunately with a huge capital u, the movie was incredibly disappointing. i did enjoy the ankle break and the blood effects. the flabby chicks were also so so.<br /><br />everything about this movie screams amateur. this is ryan nicholson's first feature length, and for the most part he failed. there's no denying he has a sick sense of humor and taste for horror. i pray his next movie doesn't play out like another b horror flick...unless he tells us that's what it's gonna be. even after this disappointment i'm willing to give ryan another shot. from what i've seen of him, he's a true, dedicated man to the genre. good luck next time, because this was bad news.
