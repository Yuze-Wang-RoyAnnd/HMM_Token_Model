the only reason i don't give this movie fewer than 3 stars is because it isn't quite on par with a movie like manos: the hands of fate. this movie's greatest crime is the fact that it is head-meltingly boring & terribly, unforgivably british. the premise of this movie sounds potentially promising, the whole teleporting concept, but the direction they went with it was completely uninteresting. it was more a movie about research funding and bowties than projecting lasers. the actors were wooden, unemotional, and aloof. as was the love affair between the two scientists-- which was anything but intriguing. i never was able to tell what the attraction was between them as the chemistry was non-existent. nor did i really understand why the melty-faced main guy decided to slaughter everyone he met. at least now i know that i should always give someone a fair hearing before i cut off their research grants, else they go rampaging about, killing wantonly with goofy hand gestures.
