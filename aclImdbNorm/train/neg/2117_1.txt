brides are dying at the altar, and their corpses are disappearing. everybody is concerned, but nobody seems to be able to figure out why and how this is happening, nor can they prevent it from happening. bear with me. bela lugosi is responsible for this, as he is extracting spinal fluid from these young women to transfuse his ancient wife and keep her alive. continue to bear with me. finally, the authorities figure out that somebody must be engineering the deaths and disappearances, but of course, they can't figure out the improbable motive. let's just ignore the ludicrous pseudoscience and move on... if you can get through the first twenty minutes of this mess, you will be treated to lugosi whipping his lab assistant for disrespecting one of the brides he has murdered, explaining that he finds sleeping in a coffin much more comfortable than a bed, and other vague parodies of real horror films (the kind with budgets and plots). anyhoo - a female journalist follows her nose to the culprit (and remarkably the inept police are nowhere to be seen!), and then the fun really starts.<br /><br />the cinematography and acting are ok. there are a lot of well dressed, very good looking people in this film. the directing is fair, and the script is a little better than the material deserved. nevertheless, this film fails to sustain the interest of all but the most hardened b-film fan. the best thing about it.... it does eventually end, but not soon enough.
