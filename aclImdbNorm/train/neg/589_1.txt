honestly, i went to see the movie, not because of the actors, not because of the plot but because it was rated 17 here in luxembourg and a movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category. believe me, being a movie-freak, i have seen quite a lot of brutal films in my lifetime (ichi the killer, irreversible, hellraiser) but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture i have ever seen. <br /><br />the plot is plain stupid, the directing is awful, acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of so-called "horror soundtracks". there isn't a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie, and some of the scenes are really hard to stand. (especially the scene, where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby cries--horrible). i can't understand why the movie was rated 16 in germany, where normally the criteria are real tough (e.g. kill-bill (brutal but it made fun of itself and had great allusions to asian cinema and besides a magnificent directing) even a movie like state of grace is rated 18). no one can call this a horror movie, because actually it was more about showing gore than about scaring the public (showing the "creep's" face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision); for me (excuse my expression) it is just one insane director living out his disturbing fantasies. in some scenes you see violence, that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot nor does it explain anything. the plot has holes and flaws, the dialog is boring, honestly i can't mention a single positive aspect of the movie except for the british and scottish accent.<br /><br />if i had something to say, i would ban this movie from the theaters, i fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap.<br /><br />i'm looking forward to getting feedbacks to my thread and i'd be happy to discuss about one or the other topic.<br /><br />"livin' the dream baby, livin' the dream" david aames
