i admit to having been a fan of the original stage production. i never saw the movie version until very lately on cable, and watched it with anticipation, to see my memories brought alive again, because i adored the original show. imagine my dismay.<br /><br />this has to be the worst translation of a broadway show to film ever made. they changed the story, they changed the songs, they lost the soul. i was expecting a trip down memory lane, singing to the extraordinarily touching music and the mirror, at the ballet, and hello twelve, hello thirteen. not! not only did they adulterate the music to an almost unrecognizable point, but they messed up the storyline, adding songs and exterior plotlines (hello cassie and michael douglas) not present in the original, and injecting "drama" where it wasn't necessary. the original had enough pathos on its own. if you were a fan of the original broadway show, don't bother. i'm sorry i wasted my time, and diluted my memories, watching this tripe.
