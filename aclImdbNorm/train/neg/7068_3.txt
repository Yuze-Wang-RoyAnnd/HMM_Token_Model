chillers starts on a cold, dark stormy night as a bus drops off three passenger's outside a bus station, a young boy named mason (jesse emery), a college professor dr. howard conrow (david wohl) & a woman named sharon phillips (laurie pennington). inside they discover that they have missed their connecting bus & are stranded for the night. in the waiting area they find two other people, ronnie (jim wolf) & a sleeping woman named lindsay (marjorie fitzsimmons) who is currently having a terrifying nightmare...<br /><br />while swimming in an indoor pool lindsay encounters & befriends guy named billy waters (jesse johnson), the next time lindsay sees billy he dives into the pool & then seemingly disappears into thin air before he surfaces. shortly after lindsay discovers that billy water died in a diving accident 5 years ago...<br /><br />lindsay wakes up & tells the others about her nightmare, everyone else responds by saying that they too have suffered disturbing dreams recently & decide to share them to pass the time...<br /><br />next up is mason who tells a story of how he & two friends, scott (david r. hamm) & jimmy (will tuckwiller), are terrorised during a camping trip...<br /><br />then it's sharon whose story revolves around a newsman named tom williams (thom delventhal) who she phones up, in no time at all tom is at her front door but he actually turns out to be a vampire...<br /><br />it's ronnie's turn next & he describes how he discovers that he can bring the dead back to life, unfortunately he brings executed mass murderer nelson caulder (bradford boll) back to homicidal life...<br /><br />finally dr. conrow tells a tale of how two of his students brought an ancient aztec war-god named ixpe (kimberly harbour) back to life...<br /><br />then it's back to the bus station for one last (predictable) twist...<br /><br />written, produced & directed by daniel boyd chillers is one of the worst horror anthologies i've ever seen & i usually really like this sub-genre. the script by boyd lacks what is needed for films such as chillers to work, you can see the final twist coming a mile off & each story is really lame. the first one is totally pointless & didn't seem to have an ending & the best thing about these anthologies are the short snappy stories that are rounded off with a neat twist. the second story is predictable &, again, just ends without any payoff. so it continues throughout chillers that each story is deeply unsatisfying to watch & have no reward for doing so. the character's & dialogue are poorly written, the stories seem to have no original ideas of their own & as a whole the film totally sucks. at least each story doesn't last long & i liked the idea behind the linking segments.<br /><br />director boyd was obviously working with a very low budget & it shows. all i can say is if you want to watch a 15 odd minute short story set entirely within a swimming pool then chillers is for you. the stories are neither clever, scary or have any sort of tension or build up to anything. having said that it does have a few nice scenes & some surprising competence shines through on occasion. violence & gore wise there isn't much happening in chillers, a ripped out heart, a decapitated head & a bitten off hand is as gory as it gets.<br /><br />technically chillers is poor stuff that won't impress anyone. basic cinematography, bad music, cheap special effects & below average production values. chillers also features one of the worst closing theme songs ever, period. the acting is also of a very low standard.<br /><br />i am sure a lot of effort was put into chillers as a low budget film & at least the filmmakers tried so i will give credit for that at least, but that still doesn't stop me from thinking it's crap. similar anthology films like tales from the crypt (1972), asylum (1972), the vault of horror (1973), dr. terror's house of horrors (1965), creepshow (1982) & tales from the darkside: the movie (1990) are far superior to chillers so watch one of those instead.
