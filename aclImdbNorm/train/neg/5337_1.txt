there's so many negative reviews about "stay away, joe" in here i just can't stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen. here's a side you haven't heard yet.<br /><br />elvis presley's movies are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason: they are perfect films for a pure relaxation because i don't have to think when i watch them. that means i don't have to worry about missing a complex plot because there never is a proper plot to start with. i can just kick off my shoes, grab a beer, sit back, switch off my brains and enjoy all the general wackiness and catchy easy-going rock n' roll tunes from the grooviest decade of them all.<br /><br />in my books "stay away, joe" definitely falls into the "so bad it's good"-category. now if you're like me and appreciate "the trash value", this is the ultimate 1960's camp experience. it's so bad that it's almost surrealistic to watch and just when you think that it can't possibly get any worse it surprises you in the most imaginable ways. in the end you're so amazed by all the new levels of stupidity you just don't know whether to laugh or cry. in a nutshell: i love it because it's so damn amusing that there once was a generation that actually made films like this. i still give it 1 out of 10 though - once it hits the bottom 100 it will became an instant bad movie classic.
