the poverty row horror pictures of the 1930s and '40s depress the hell out of me. god knows i have nothing against low-budget films, but the ones produced in that period have such a dreary, shabby look about them--and, in the final analysis, just aren't very good. "the corpse vanishes" is slightly more entertaining than bottom-of-the-barrel dreck like "the invisible ghost" and "the ape man", but it's no classic. bela lugosi, long past his "dracula" heyday, plays yet another mad doctor; the unbearable elizabeth russell plays his wife. they sleep in coffins because, as lugosi explains to a doubtful young female reporter (luana walters), a coffin is much more comfortable than a bed. ho hum. angelo rossitto and minerva urecal are also on hand, which might please hardcore fans of '30s and '40s films.
