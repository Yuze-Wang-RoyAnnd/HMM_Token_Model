whoa boy.<br /><br />ever wanted to watch a documentary about a megalomaniacal jerk ruining his own life and alienating everyone around him? well they exist, in many forms. but have you ever wanted to watch said documentary about one who didn't ultimately succeed in doing anything despite everyone's praises about how much of an artistic "genius" he is? well you could probably just grab a camera and find someone like that in any local scene (i know they're everywhere and i don't even follow the local scene), or you could save yourself the trouble by spending money watching this tripe.<br /><br />the premise is good and, honestly, it's not as if the filmmakers knew precisely where it was going considering that's one of the difficulties of doing a documentary. we are made to follow two bands, the brian jamestown massacre, lead by anton, and the dandy warhols, lead by courtney. i've heard of the dandy warhols before watching this movie... not so the brian jamestown massacre. why? well from this documentary's perspective, because the brian jamestown massacre's intergroup dysfunction refused them the ability to really make it in the music industry. however, instead of this becoming an analysis of the two separate bands and how one was able to succeed, the focus becomes much more on anton and his insanity.<br /><br />because, see, anton is a "genius." because he plays rock music. he really "understands the evolution of music"... because he plays rock music with a lot of different instruments. his music is considered "post-modern retro but the future"... because it's rock music. he wants to bring out a "revolution"... through rock music. okay so let's face it... twenty minutes in and this is one of the stupidest kids i'd care to watch a documentary about.<br /><br />the documentary itself doesn't really lend itself to showcasing any of anton's talent, because in the nature of editing down 2000 hours of material into a quarter short of two hours we don't really have the time to focus on that. so instead we watch anton, "the genius", the socio-maniacal loser, be a jerk for the two hours and are just told to understand that he made really great music. whether he did or not i won't know, because its not like the documentary had enough time to prove it. what i do know is that then we're left with a story about some self-centered obnoxious twerp running around the country calling himself a god of music and doing nothing to back it up. why even bother watching that? people like anton don't deserve the attention they seek, the hope and admiration of all those different people, and especially a post-failure paean to lost potential. this movie plays like a two-hour rough-cut vh1 special for a reason: he goes on and on about the music, but it's all about the image and the attention. look at the guy, look at how he dresses, look at how he acts, look at how he tries to create controversy because he can't afford marketing.<br /><br />honestly the only interesting character in this film is joel, and that's because of anyone in this documentary, joel is the only person who seems to have any fun. maybe it's because he's the tambourine man. the rest of them are all "rock stars"! they deserve our attention, and admiration, and interest, and engagements! they are out there to "save rock and roll." do you remember when the white stripes were supposed to "save rock and roll"? yeah, that was because of anton, and it's "selfish of them not to mention me (anton) as an inspiration." what a load. people like anton are best left forgotten. this documentary explains why mainstream music is so dull--because music execs have to deal with people like anton for a living and ultimately can only really throw their support behind someone safe and passionless. thanks a lot, anton. your antics ruined music for everyone you touched, whatever the opinion to the contrary is. and if people "in the know" about anton disagree and he really was a genius, it still shows how bad this documentary is that it cuts it down that way.<br /><br />--polarisdib
