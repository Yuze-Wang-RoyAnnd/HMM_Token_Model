ugly shot, poorly scripted and amateurishly paced sequel to joe dante's 1981 classic. "the howling" is one of the two or three only good werewolf-films ever made and yet it got 'rewarded' by a series of obnoxious and unendurable sequels like this one. if it's any consolation, "stirba" is a sequel in name only and there's absolutely no connection with the characters or events that were introduced in dante's film. the plot here revolves on a bloodthirsty cult of transsylvanian werewolves
