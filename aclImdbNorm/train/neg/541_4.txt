i found this film to be quite an oddity. from the very get go i found it extremely hard to like this movie, and now after a little thinking about it i can pretty much pinpoint the reason why. jean-marc barr, although i love him to bits (i think zentropa is one of the best movies ever made) is quite miscast here, and although i can't figure for the life of me who would be better, i am sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this film work. everything else is fine, except for the stabs at weak comedy (a meet the parents joke is not really needed, filmmakers!) and i really like richard e. grant as the british major. it just suffers from one thing.. jean-marc.
