did anyone edit this film? or was it only the dvd release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes? it's ok though, i fell asleep watching it the first time. then i fell asleep the second time and the third time. the plot is actually not the worst i've seen, but it's close. the acting is not the worst i've seen either...but it's close. the production .... well, i can honestly say that it was the worst i had ever seen in my life! not trying to be spiteful, but unhinged could have used some more production.<br /><br />please don't think i'm a hater of horror films, or even that i didn't enjoy this film. i just felt i was laughing at the film much more than i felt i was laughing along with it. the gruesome moments were not too poorly done, but could have been done better even with a shoestring budget.<br /><br />characters seemed awkwardly developed, or ignored all together, twist ending was pretty bad, and the exposition took forever without exposing much.<br /><br />i'd recommend avoiding this movie.<br /><br />1/10
