this is the kind of movie i fear the most. arrogant and irresponsible, it presents a sketch of the colombian conflict so cliched and dumb it represents an insult to all colombian people. the performances are godawul, from grisales (her naked scene is absolutely pitiful), to bejarano, to fanny mickey (who looks right out of a tim burton nightmare), to d'iaz, who makes a notable effort to bring life to a character so one-dimensional, so cliched and so badly written all he's left to work with is a mustache. not to mention the gratuitous ending, a gore fest so cheesy that it would make ed wood cringe. it fails in all ways, cinematography, art direction, costumes, makeup, editing, and most of all directing, jorge al'i triana has always been a lousy filmmaker but at least his previous movies had some dignity. i can't say anything good about this waste of money, except that i hope colombian filmmakers learn a lesson about honesty, integrity and responsability from this mean-intended fiasco.
