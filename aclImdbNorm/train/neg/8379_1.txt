like some of the other reviewers have alluded to previously, i'd like to know what moron actually read the script and went', "yea!!! this is it. this is the next film we are going to green light!!" and whoever that person is, should have his or her head examined for actual brain activity. because whoever is responsible for actually dishing out money to have this made after reading the script, well, i'd love to give you my email address and maybe you'd like to just give away some more money. this film is atrocious in every way.<br /><br />the wayans are funny, at least they can be. they have made some good films and had some incredibly funny performances along the way. but in here, not only does the premise defy all logic, not only is the acting terrible, not only is the entire movie offensive from start to finish, not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find, but they actually want you to pay to see this film. maybe if it was free...naaah, it would still be a waste of time.<br /><br />usually i'd be inclined to write some long winded, detailed review about why this film is so bad, but just suffice to say that let my brevity do the talking. this is the lowest common denominator film making and it is about as unfunny as a heart attack.<br /><br />0/10..makes my top ten list of worst films of all time!
