william russ is the main character throughout this made for tv movie. he left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts. but he tries to keep away from his family. thats where peter falk (colombo) comes in, playing several different roles, to convince him to come home.<br /><br />the story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (peter falk) and use him to a fairly nice degree. but william russ wasn't truly a star. however, it appears his acting is still ok.<br /><br />i found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable. in fact, the last 20 minutes i could almost dictate word for word before it happened. a good movie should never be like that.<br /><br />overall, it was a sub-par movie. in a letter grading system, it would receive a "d".
