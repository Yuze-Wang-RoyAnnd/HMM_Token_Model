if you want to checkout a good jason scott lee film, i recommend the following:<br /><br />dragon: the bruce lee story<br /><br />rapa nui<br /><br />"timecop 2: the berlin decision" is an awful film. awful production values. awful acting. awful script. i would not recommend this film to be watched by anyone who seriously believes that tripe like this is quality entertainment or advances asian american awareness in hollywood (this film does neither.).<br /><br />i would at the very least say that this film is passable entertainment on a rainy day if you ever come across it while channel surfing. if you are curious, perhaps a rental from netflix, but this film is definitely not for keeps.<br /><br />if you are one of the few people who watched this film as a means to raise your asian american film awareness, and came away disappointed, then i recommend the following films for your personal viewing. these are well-written films with high production values that feature a talented cast of asian american actors:<br /><br />better luck tomorrow <br /><br />mulan
