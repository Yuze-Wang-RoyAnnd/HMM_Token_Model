i am from the dallas/fort worth area and lived in arlington for a few years. this movie was way off as far as making it look like arlington. i saw mountains in the background of one scene! texas doesn't have mountains. i guess that happens when a movie that is supposed to be in texas is filmed in canada. the accents are also really bad. they should have gotten actors from texas to play the parts. there a lot of aspiring actors from texas out in hollywood. the movie is really sad though, because it is a true story. i pray that the killer is found and convicted. the one good thing is that bc of her death, we now have the amber alert to help find missing children quickly after they are abducted.
