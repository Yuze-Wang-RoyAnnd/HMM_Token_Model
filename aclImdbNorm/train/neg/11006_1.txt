this film stars, among others, "slapchop" vince offer (who also wrote, edited and directed) and joey buttafuoco--not exactly names that scream out "quality". and with such uplifting skits as "supermodels taking a dump" (it's exactly what it sounds like), a guy who robs a sperm bank (the "rhymer"), necrophilia with a rotting corpse, black market fetuses (featuring a guy scooping what are supposed to be them out of a jar), lots and lots of gay jokes, a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortions. the skits are painfully unfunny (such as "batman and rhymer"), the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crude...and stupid. i truly believe a group of 8 year-olds could have easily made a funnier film with the same budget.<br /><br />apparently this film resulted in a lawsuit by "slap shot" vince against the scientologists. frankly, i wouldn't know who to root for in this case!!! apparently, he alleged that somehow scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this film. no matter that the film is repellent junk from start to finish and 99% unfunny (by comparison, ebola is funnier)...and these are the nicest things i can say about the movie.<br /><br />by the way, that is bobby lee (from "mad tv") wearing a diaper and participating in the dumb fake porno film. it's amazing his career could overcome this.
