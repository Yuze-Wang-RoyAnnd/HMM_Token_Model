i am astounded at the positive reviews for this thoroughly uninspiring film.<br /><br />often with foreign films i skip over reviews that complain about slow pace and seeming "absence of action" as many of the best international films do not live up to the western hollywood model of cinematic storytelling.<br /><br />i enjoy the frequent artfulness and lack of clich'e in the foreign film arena. i enjoy that many foreign films don't tie things up in a neat palatable little bow.<br /><br />that said, this particular film offered no redemptive value for the time i wasted watching it. no meaningful character development, no engaging story arc, no way to get emotionally involved with any of the characters on screen. <br /><br />synopsis: a bunch of emotionally immature uptight prejudiced colonials mistreat their slaves, and a little girl gets hurt by her only friend when the "house-boy" finally gets fed up and takes his abuse out on her. <br /><br />while the above paragraph is poignant and dramatic, this movie will bore you while playing out the scenario. i was so unengaged that it took three sittings to finish it, and i wouldn't have even done that were it not for the positive ratings. <br /><br />unless you have an academic interest in the period i strongly suggest steering clear of this one.
