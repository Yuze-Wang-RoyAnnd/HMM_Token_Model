a half-hearted attempt to bring elvis presley into the modern day, but despite a sexy little shower scene and a pseudo-playboy magazine subplot, presley is surrounded by the same old coy, winking clich'es. a woman picks e.p. up on the beach and then proceeds to take over his life--and he doesn't seem to care! dick sargent is grueling in another sidebar, but don porter and rudy vallee (!) try hard as elvis' two bosses (he's moonlighting, you see). some of the songs are quite good, especially "almost in love", but if you want to see a looser, hipper, updated elvis sex-comedy--look elsewhere. when elvis and his fatal attraction get into bed together, there's actually a wooden board in between them! get real. ** from ****
