i watched this movie on the grounds that amber benson rocks and nick stahl is generally pretty cool - i figured that any film featuring two actors i like and respect couldn't be all bad. and in that sense, i was right - considering the cringe-making dialogue they were given, both of them perform reasonably well. not well enough to stop the movie from sucking, you understand, but well enough that i was able to make it through the 75-odd minutes of movie (and that's the main sign of an awful film: when, at 40 minutes through, you're already praying for it to be over).<br /><br />it's hard to know where to start with the problems in "taboo". the dialogue, as mentioned, is appalling; wooden and completely unnatural. january jones' acting is unbelievably bad, and since she's the character we spend most of our time following around the house, this is an unforgivable flaw. the plot manages to be so convoluted that it makes no sense while simultaneously being so clich'ed as to be completely predictable (literally, not one of the major 'twists' in this film would surprise anyone but a toddler). a few interesting shots aside, the director tries far too hard with far too little success, awkward tracking shots and jittery camera-work distracting from what little element of story there is.<br /><br />three of this movie's stars are awarded for the fact that it contains amber benson, and the last is tossed in on the grounds that one of the jokes made me snigger a little bit. i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, ever, under any circumstances. avoid at all costs.
