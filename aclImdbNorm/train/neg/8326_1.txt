this is the most ludicrous and laughable thriller i've ever seen. oh....where to start....<br /><br />plot (what little there is): clayton beresford jr. (hayden christensen), a young billionaire, with a bad heart is desperately in need of a transplant. clay has been secretly engaged to his mother's pa, samantha, played by jessica alba. on the night that these two secretly get married, it just so happens that a heart donor with the same rare blood type is found. go and figure the odds of that one! once on the operating table, clay finds out the anesthesia isn't working, and he can feel everything and hear everything.<br /><br />fortunately clay seems to be able to filter out the pain of a razor sharp scalpel cutting open his chest by simply concentrating on his memories of samantha, which we are told he's doing through an annoying voice-over which never seems to stop.<br /><br />if you didn't burst out in laughter yet, you will surely start to when you see the surgical scenes. <br /><br />how could a young billionaire agree to have a heart transplant performed by one surgeon, one nurse, an attending physician and an drunk anesthesiologist? there were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was getting pulled. not to mention the medical behavior, which is too preposterous to be taken seriously...the operating room isn't even kept sterile...people are practically able to just walk in and out of the room without even having washed up... during the operation the viewer gets to hear clay's thoughts, none of which are too fascinating. ah...but here's what it's all about ...the doctors are trying to kill him in order to take his money. believing him to be unconscious, the villains speak freely. gosh! what will happen? <br /><br />well... at least there's no interference from anyone else in the hospital, while an incompetent doctor who's got four malpractice lawsuits running against him is performing major heart surgery. not even clay's overprotective mother seems to be able to check on his status. the only one interested in keeping updated is samantha...but oh no...could sweet sam be in on it....you'll quickly find out through some scooby doo dialog...<br /><br />in the end, it wouldn't even matter whether or not clay underwent anesthesia awareness, because the end would have turned out the same way in both cases.<br /><br />if you can ignore the feeling that the director/writer is trying to make fun of the patients who fell victim to anesthesia awareness, maybe there's some dumb fun to be had...<br /><br />enjoy...
