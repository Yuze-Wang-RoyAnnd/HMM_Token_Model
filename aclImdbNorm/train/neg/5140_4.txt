demer daves,is a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and "broken arrow" remains in everybody's mind.as far as melodrama is concerned,he should leave that to knowing people like vincente minelli,george cukor or the fabulous douglas sirk. the screenplay is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you are watching such a tepid weepie.natalie wood 's character was inspired by fannie hurst's "imitation of life" (see stahl and sirk),but who could believe she's a black man's daughter anyway?susan kohner was more credible in "imitation of life")and sinatra and curtis are given so stereotyped parts that they cannot do anything with them:the poor officer,and the wealthy good-looking -and mean- sergeant.guess whom will natalie fall in love with?france is shown as a land of tolerance ,where interracial unions are warmly welcome.at the time(circa 1944) it was dubious,it still is for narrow-minded people you can find here there and everywhere.
