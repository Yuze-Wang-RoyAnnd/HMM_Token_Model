it is difficult to find any positives in this movie. seems as though the producer needed to make a buck without much effort & hence we are treated to a full showing of galaxy which is the lamest excuse for a movie in history. the police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms. more action shots of the two cops & a lot less of galaxy would have been the way to go. of course that would add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with that wretched rerun. ms albright does excellent looking sexy & her acting is first rate. ms stabs whom i had heard of but not seen on screen before also looked very desirable but seems to lack basic acting talent. apart from ms albright this is real garbage.
