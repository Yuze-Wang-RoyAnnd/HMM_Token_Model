aldolpho (steve buscemi), an aspiring film maker, lives in a battered nyc apartment and relies on his mother to help make the rent. he has a beautiful neighbor named angelica (jennifer beals)who may or may not be married but who aldolpho would love to star in his movie. when al unexpectedly gets a financial promise of funding for his film from a strange man named joe, he thinks he's got it made. that is, until joe takes al along on an adventure to steal a porsche for part of the financial backing. will the film be made before aldolpho is completely without a moral backbone? and, will angelica star in the film? this is, in this viewer's opinion, an awful movie. the script is abysmal, with a plot that wanders willy nilly. beals practically snarls all of her lines and buscemi, though likable, is nondescript. there is a good deal of distasteful material and unsavory characters to boot. finally, the production values are very poor, too, making the film look second rate at all times. if you have time on your hands, it is still a good idea not to take a chance with this movie. but, if you are the proverbial glutton for punishment, go ahead and watch the darn thing. beals does look beautiful, after all.
