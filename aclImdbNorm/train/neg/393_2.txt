for anyone craving a remake of 1989's slaves of new york. what are there, seven of you? here it is... was.<br /><br />this undercooked movie has studiously vapid characters (well they're club-kids, ya big jerk!) that are in holding patterns. the big question seems to be, just how long can a young adult remain juvenile? it took three people to write this 'story'? good god, it was easier to come up with citizen kane. rather than take viewers back, this movie should just embarrass anyone who was a scene-ster in the early 90s.<br /><br />the idea that a fifty year old woman envies a bunch of self-absorbed kids from a different era is the world as only self-absorbed, twenty-somethings could imagine it. the odd sidebar about library work is not the sub-plot one expects from the equivalent of parker posey's breakin 2: electric bugaloo. her "i'm serious about graduate school!" while a stripper grinds on her is hysterical. posey's shtick is always amusing, but there are projects that are beneath her. i was asleep before it crossed the 40 minute mark.
