i was looking over our dvd tower last night for something to watch. we were between netflix mailings and it was a quiet saturday night. i pulled one out that i never heard of before and realized it was borrowed from a friend. from the jacket, it sounded like a rip-off of "the big chill" but, with the all-star cast, felt it might be worth watching. boy was i wrong!!! not only was it like "the big chill," it was a rip-off almost character by character. the bill paxton character was a copy of william hurt ("where have you been all this time" role) -spoiler warning- and, lo and behold, he remains behind to take care of the old place(cabin/camp). kimberly williams = meg tilly; jerk womanizer matt craven = jeff goldblum etc., etc. i found myself wondering why i'm even watching these people. there was insufficient character development for me to find any interest in them. how did "unca lou" even find these characters after 20 years? plus it wasn't even funny, except when perkins fell, err 'flopped' out of bed the first morning, it was a sign and i missed it. after it was over, i asked my wife, "were there any endearing characters in this film? ... are you sleeping over there?" she replied, "no, i'm still thinking...no, none i can think of."
