night of the comet starts as the world prepares for a once in a lifetime event, the passing of a 65 million plus year old comet. instead of watching the light show regina belmont (catherine mary stewart) decides to spend the night with cinema projectionist larry dupree (michael bowen) in his booth... they awake the next morning & as larry attempts to leave the cinema he is attacked & killed by a zombie, the same zombie attacks regina but she manages to escape where upon she discovers that almost everyone on the entire planet has been turned into red dust. almost everyone because by some amazing coincidence the only other person to survive happens to be her sister samantha (kelli maroney), they desperately search for more survivors & meet up with a long distance trucker named hector gomez (robert beltran). meanwhile an evil bunch of scientists need human blood to develop a serum to save themselves from turning into dust & they're on the look out for unwilling donors...<br /><br />written & directed by thom eberhardt i found night of the comet a pretty rubbish viewing experience, i'm surprised at the amount of positive comments on imdb about it because i just thought it was boring crap that never lived up to it's potential. the script starts off 100 miles an hour with the obliteration of the entire population of earth & a zombie attack but then it goes absolutely nowhere & then eventually introduces the sinister blood stealing scientists towards the end of the film because by that time the slim story has run it's course. there are plot holes too, if these scientists want blood why shoot the three or four gang members & save the two sisters when the guys would have provided more blood for their experiments, killing them just seemed a totally bizarre & an almost suicidal thing to do considering they need blood to develop a cure, it just doesn't make sense i mean if your going to die & you need to experiment on human blood would rather have five or six donors providing blood or just two? i'm not having the fact that the two sisters survived independently of each other, i mean what are the odds on that? when hector confronts the female scientist for the first time she never mentions samantha or where she was or where the underground facility was where they took regina before she committed suicide so how did hector know these things? i also thought after the first twenty odd minutes the film slows down to a snails pace & became incredibly boring & dull to watch, after hearing so many good things about it night of the comet comes across to me as nothing more than an overrated boring piece of crap.<br /><br />director eberhardt does a really good job, i liked the look of the film with it's red tinted sky & he manages to create a really cool atmosphere of isolation. unfortunately there are far too many shots of empty streets, there are constant montage's of empty streets, deserted roads & abandoned buildings & it gets extremely repetitive & dull. ok we get it there's no one else about so there's no need to keep ramming it down our throats by constantly showing roads without cars on them. the zombies are totally wasted, there are two zombie attacks in the entire film & that's two individual zombies as well although there are a couple of effective nightmare scenes. night of the comet pays homage, or rips-off whichever you prefer, several other much better films including the obligatory end of the world shopping spree in a mall lifted from dawn of the dead (1978). forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any.<br /><br />technically night of the comet is pretty good, the special effects are decent enough & the production crew were obviously very good at closing streets off. the acting was alright expect for maroney as samantha the air-head blonde who became highly irritating.<br /><br />night of the comet was a big disappointment for me, i had hoped for so much more. persoanlly i found this film dull, boring, uneventful & the puke inducing sequence where the sisters go shopping to the tune of 'girls just wanna have fun' is probably the worst moment in the film. really bad & i just don't get why so many people like this, i'm sure i'll get slaughtered for saying it so let the abuse begin i can take it...
