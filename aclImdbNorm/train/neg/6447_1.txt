i purchased this film for $5 in a bargain bin at my local video store for one reason only, chase masterson, but i should have crumbled up the five, thrown it in a toilet and flushed. the film is about a bunch of twenty somethings that peaked in high school and reunite on the anniversary of their idiot friends death, who got drunk and wandered into the woods and died. there problem is a reptilian monster is hunting them down one by one. the acting is abysmal, these worthless people were apparently cast offs on shows like 90210 and dawsons creek. the directing was on par with a twelve year old and the script was probably done by a thirteen year old. the entire set looks like someone's backyard in malibu. the people on here that have praised this film are obviously friends of the director and/or actors. avoid this pile of garbage at all costs.
