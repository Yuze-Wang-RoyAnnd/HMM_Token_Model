i have no idea what idiots gave this movie a palm d'or at the 1999 cannes film festival because it was atrocious! i actually watched the entire thing simply because i couldn't believe that someone would make such a worthless film. there is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects. also, if you do decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this film, be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand-held camcorder and half the time you can't even see the main subjects. this style has been used much more successfully in movies such as "blair witch" because it creates suspense. in rosetta, there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything. i should have known better when it came on at 2 o'clock in the morning that it was going to be horrible.
