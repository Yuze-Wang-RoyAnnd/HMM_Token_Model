i was one of the few non-liberals who showed up to see steve's video. it was quite an experience... in propaganda film-making and boredom.<br /><br />i was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of michael moore's visit to my local school, uvsc, but it turned out to be another liberal, slash-and-burn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community. it sure seems self-serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues.<br /><br />what's more surprising is to see all the '10' votes his homeys have posted here. did they even see the video? golly gee batman, this must rank with all the president's men! their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film. <br /><br />yeah, like stacking the votes at imdb will help a lame movie. maybe my vote will help balance this out.
