here's one you can watch with a straight face, with a script so bad, even will ferrell wouldn't be in it.<br /><br />there are two laughs in hot rod.<br /><br />1. the punch-dance. rod "needs to go to his quiet place" and before anyone can say kevin bacon, he is footloosing a passionate, overwrought bodyswerve to the strains of a band who wishes they had the big-hair faux-metal chops of europe.<br /><br />2. john farnham's you're the voice. in one of those epic sequences where the star and his cohorts do the slomo walk down main street and the townfolk follow on their heels in support, the soundtrack is the gag. how did the film-makers even come across this aussie recording artist? a major australian vocalist (and a genuine talent) who shot to fame in the early '70s covering raindrops keep fallin' on my head, then disappeared until 1986 for the big comeback with you're the voice, john farnham's anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy, it leveled mountains in switzerland.<br /><br />besides these two high points in the film - both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing - the rest of the film is like choking on someone else's vomit.<br /><br />andy samberg is rod, a failed stunt jumper who has never made a jump. maybe it's got something to do with the fact he's driving a moped into the heart of darkness. or his fake mustache. yeh, someone actually thought that was funny.<br /><br />without one jump under his starry belt, he plans for a 15-bus extravaganza - which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian, like jason biggs or rob schneider - to win the day and save his stepfather and simultaneously wipe out cancer and whatever... who watches these movies for plot anyway? along the way (as usual for moronic leads in these comedies), he scores a salubrious chick (isla fisher), who must surely be retarded to consider swapping chromosomes with this loser.<br /><br />sissy spacek (carrie, 1976) has so little to do she almost phoned in her performance - then changed her mind and just hung up. ian mcshane must've lost a bet to be here.
