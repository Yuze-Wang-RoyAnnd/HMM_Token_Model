revolt of the zombies is bad. there is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie. it is dull, lifeless, poorly acted, and poorly scripted. i've often complained that the original dracula is a little slow for my taste, well this movie makes dracula look like a roller coaster ride. the 65 minute running time seemed like 165 minutes.<br /><br />the story: an expedition is sent to cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through "zombification". one man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him. once this happens, he releases the zombies under his control to horrific consequences. that's it. that's the whole story.<br /><br />for most of the movie, i was trying to figure out where i had seen the male lead. he looked so familiar. i had plenty of time to think this over. nothing was happening in the movie. just before the "zombies revolted", it hit me. it was dean jagger. i had seen him recently as the general in white christmas. this is how i "entertained" myself throughout most of the movie.<br /><br />i'm just glad i didn't buy the dvd for this movie. king of the zombies is on the other side and it's a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie. for what it's worth, i'll give it a 2/10. (i won't go to 1/10 because, believe it or not, i've seen worse.)
