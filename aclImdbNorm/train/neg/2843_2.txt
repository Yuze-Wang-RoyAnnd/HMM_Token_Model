oh yes, sakura killers is a goofy, horrible ninja movie, make no mistake. but it's also an incredibly enjoyable one. this is largely thanks to the awesome presence of one chuck connors, who is billed as starring in the movie but really only shines in a few scenes. i suppose he's supposed to be sort of an obi wan kenobi type ("the tough ninja-buster", the box copy exclaims) but his 'wisdom' is laughable. "move without thinking"??? my friend says this is the sign of mental retardation, not of supreme concentration.<br /><br />but really, his two aides, sonny and dennis, have such horrible dialogue that 'brooklyn', as we call the colonel, tends to shine in comparison. especially watch for dennis' logic regarding the 'genetic splicing' the sakura are involved with. if you know anything about cloning you will die laughing. and yes, this is a major plot point, folks.<br /><br />a terribly fun movie, sakura killers is a hard-to-find gem. i won't spoil the 'trick' ending for you either, except that it's a perfect set up for a sakura killers 2. too bad chuck connors died. :-( because he does have a the smoothest ways of blowing away ninjas.
