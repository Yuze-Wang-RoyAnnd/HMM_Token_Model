although there's flying guillotines as part of the title of this movie, it has no connections to the original flying guillotines (1975) and its sequel flying guillotines ii (1978). the two originals are masterpieces of kung-fu movie and still stands out as a classic. this is a much inferior copy of the original, and even as a regular kung-fu movie, it's below average.<br /><br />first of all, this movie doesn't have much acting. it's one senseless fight scene after another, and flying guillotine doesn't even play a major part in them. story is about some shaolin monks who are tracking down some villains who've took off with a sacred book, and an evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the plot. the same evil prince has plans to lure the monks in and use the flying guillotines on them.<br /><br />there are four movies with flying guillotine as part of its title. this in my opinion is of least quality. the design of the flying guillotine in this movie is different from the other three indicating that this movie was produced by a different entity from the other three.<br /><br />the movie has no chemistry asides from being unintentionally funny due to poor production. <br /><br />best skip this and watch the two originals.
