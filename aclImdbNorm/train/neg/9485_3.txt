because others have gone to the trouble of summarizing the plot, i'd like to mention a few points about this film. there may be spoilers here; i don't care enough to filter them out.<br /><br />- given the film's low budget, the creature design was quite good. it's actually nice to see a direct-to-video horror film that's not slathered with awful cgi. unfortunately the digital film quality's quite grainy in places, and it's most noticeable in the well-lit white halls of the asylum.<br /><br />- ridiculous lighting design plagues parts of this film, to say nothing of the variations in the passage of time. i understand the director might have been trying to simulate dementia, but in order for this to be effective consistent time flow needed to be established. as-is, it merely seems amateurish.<br /><br />- plot twists were numerous but consistently predictable. i neither had a doubt in my mind of the identity of the robed cultists, nor of the fact that some kind of lame evil-trumps-good development would surface at the end.<br /><br />- this may seem like quibbling, but characters in this film reliably fail to employ any kind of common sense. first of all, regulatory commissions would be all over a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patient and employee deaths cardiac arrest-induced. why would the head psychiatrist also be capable of performing autopsies? why wasn't a plot point made of these impressive qualifications, or of his introduction to his odd choice of religion? what's the background? what's supposed to make us care about anyone in this? and just as importantly, who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place, see everything that was so frighteningly wrong with it, and then conclude that it was still a fine place to pursue a residency? this film didn't even respect its characters enough to give their intelligence the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />bottom line: see the wicker man instead.
