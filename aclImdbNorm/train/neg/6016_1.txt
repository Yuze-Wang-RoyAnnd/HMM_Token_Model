this movie which was released directly on video should carry a warning label that it is dangerous to human health and may subject the viewer to terminal boredom. it is yet another thinly veiled, evangalizing "rapture" religious movie with the good guys (the believers) suddenly vanishing and the bad guys (the non-believers)left behind. it's an interesting concept, especially since we see it happen on a flight captained by a non-believer who is having a sinful affair with a stewardess aboard (needless to say that sinner doesn't disappear either!). unhappily, with all the pilots being non-believers, the plane did not crash or the movie would have been mercifully over. though this could have be interesting without the heavy religious browbeating, as a whole the plodding movie makes one gag, the acting is horrible and the obviously computer-generated simulations are very fake looking. plus it's yet another movie shot in canada that purports to be new york city. spare me...i'll just read the bible.
