(spoilers ahead) russian fantasy "actioner" (and i use the term loosely) that i've been trying to watch for over a year. i've finally gotten to the end and now i wish i didn't put in the repeated effort.<br /><br />in an effort to save two hours of your life i'm going to tell you he plot- a guy who has the ability to project a long blade out of his arm returns home to see his mom. things turn ugly after he is beaten up by the mafia boyfriend of an old girl friend. he takes revenge on the guy when he brings the girl home. the guys mafia mom sends her men out to get revenge while the cops begin looking for him as well.<br /><br />very little is said. no explanation is really given for anything (like why they lock id girlfriend in an asylum) and the action, for the most part is all off screen. the film essentially consists of a guy who looks like adrian brody looking intense and not saying anything, killing people (off screen-most of the action happens off screen). it looks good, is well acted and had there been some form of reason for what is going on it might have been a good film. hell, i would have liked some sense of real character development or back story (all we know is that the guy was picked on as a kid). the movie runs the better part of two hours and it feels like its six. if they weren't going to tell us anything they could have at least picked up the pace so it seemed like it was moving too fast. no instead we get the hero on a boat. the hero in a bus, the hero walking, the hero looking disturbed.hero with his girl. it really annoyed me since i think this could have been a good film if they had simply done something or had someone actually say something meaningful other than give instructions to "get this guy".<br /><br />4 out of 10. its about four hours (all my attempts to see this) i'll never get back. only for those who want to see a brooding russian action film with very little action
