what is the point of creating sequels that have absolutely no relevance to the original film? no point. this is why the prom night sequels are so embarrassingly bad.<br /><br />the original film entailed a group of children hiding a dark secret that eventually get them all killed, bar one, in a brutal act of revenge. can someone please explain to me what a dead prom queen-to-be rising from the grave to steel the crown has to do with the first movie then? prom night 2 had continuous plot holes that left the audience constantly wondering how did that happen and why should that happen? but in the end, i guess you could call it one of those movies that is so bad, you end up laughing yourself through it.
