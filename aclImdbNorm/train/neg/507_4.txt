in contrast to my fellow reviewers, i always try to find something redeeming in any film i see.yes, the quality of the dubbing and lighting is abysmal, the acting is wooden and the opening sequence highly misleading what with all those lascivious female lesbian vampires with blood dripping.something must be lost in the translation of the word "bloodsucker" from the italian in the title; almost as if the producers were originally going to film a gothic vampire tale and then changed their minds but could not afford to give up their dramatic opening sequence, so tacked it onto the film anyway.<br /><br />this film made in 1975 has recently been issued on dvd and comes with its own theatrical trailer which in some respects is more daring than seen in the film!now anyone who buys this film has probably already read its synopsis anyway and knows what to expect - italian softporn from the mid 1970s.i bought it because i am attracted to christa nelli (credited most often as "krista nell").the absence of a cast of characters i find most frustrating in a lot of these eurosleaze films from the 60s & 70s.i had hoped imdb would show the cast of characters as one hears their names in the film but without a cast list, it is very difficult to link them to the actor concerned.i think krista nell played "cora" but underneath that massive hair style, costume and make-up it is difficult to distinguish her for sure.<br /><br />there is mostly a two dimensional portrayal by the actors of their parts and no one really stands out.maybe something is lost in the dubbing process.what were the positive points?well the music was atmospheric and of course if you're into beautiful lesbian soft porn its there.the external locations used were good and i would like to know where they filmed the castle on its island.it purports to be set in "ireland" (north or the republic?)in 1902, so everyone sports period piece costumes.some of the scenes i found unintentionally funny especially those sex scenes!!anyway an enjoyable romp.i rated it 4/10.
