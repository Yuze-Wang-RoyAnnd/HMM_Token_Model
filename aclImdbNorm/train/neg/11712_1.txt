the only reason i remember this movie is because it was (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money ever spent. i was 17 and my friend was 18. we were the age when action movies were our thing to enjoy most (ok 2nd most). we walked out feeling so insulted, we wanted our money back, but the time could never be regained.<br /><br />the editing is what killed this movie. as the truck gets attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers attached the movie completely insults the intelligence of the audience by having these rogue bad guys in 4x4 vw bugs shooting rockets at the truck. please, rockets at a truck known to be carrying plutonium? what's worse is the these vw's manage to get 15-18 shots off of a 4 rocket launcher. you would see on vw with 4 rockets fire 2 of them, cut around the truck with the last one attached, come back a second later with two rockets attached, fire another, then go in front of the truck and now it's back to a full set of 4 rockets.<br /><br />we toughed it out hoping for a big finish that never happened. it looks like they just ran out of money and stopped.<br /><br />just ridiculous.
