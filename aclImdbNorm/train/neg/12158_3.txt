.... may seem far fetched.... but there really was a real life story.. of a man who had an affair with a woman, who found out where he and his new wife were staying,, and she killed the wife,, making it look like a murder rape.......<br /><br />in her delusion she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him.. so she quit her job in wisconsin... and moved to minnesota..........<br /><br />last i heard she was in a mental institution, security prison....<br /><br />she was still wearing the "engagement ring." that she has purchased for herself... and had told everyone that he had bought it for her.<br /><br />the events took place in a small town in wisconsin,,,,,,, and the murder happened in minnesota......<br /><br />there even was a feature story in "people" magazine... spring of 1988, i want to say on page 39. i remember this as i was in college at the time,, and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the security hospital....
