i am quite sure that this was the worst movie ever made. if you can't make a 13 year old boy laugh at silly humor you should give up comedy forever. unfortunately joan rivers chose differently. the movie is full of predictable gags (some of these are racist) and very unfunny jokes. particularly memorable is the scene where the doctor tells the lead character that the rabbit has died and he is pregnant (as i write this, i cannot believe this was actually a movie scene). the man rushes to a dead rabbit on the doctors desk and tries to give it mouth to mouth. rotflmao! not! the punch line that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is "i knew i should have been on top." ha ha ha ha ah ugh ........
