this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen. i'm still not sure if it was serious, or just a satire. one of those movies that uses every stupid who dunnit clich'e they can think of. arrrrgh.<br /><br />don johnson was pretty good in it actually. but otherwise it sucked. it was over 10 years ago that i saw it, but it still hurts and won't stop lingering in my brain. <br /><br />the last line in the movie really sums up how stupid it is. i won't ruin it for you, should you want to tempt fate by viewing this movie. but i garantee you a *nghya* moment at the end, with a few in between. if you have nothing better to do, and you like to point and laugh, then maybe it might be worth your while. additionally, if you're forced to go on a date with someone you really don't like, suggest watching this movie together, and they'll probably leave you alone after they see it. that's a fair price to pay, i guess.
