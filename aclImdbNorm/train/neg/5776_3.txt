bad acting, bad southern accents, inconsistent cinematography, horrible script...<br /><br />i was looking forward to this film at a recent film festival and was so discouraged after seeing it. it contains quote/unquote name talent, but they do not deliver. of course the basis for this is the uneven and uninteresting story that is told.<br /><br />don't bother
