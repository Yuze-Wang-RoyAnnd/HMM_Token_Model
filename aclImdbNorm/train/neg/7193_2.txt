i had absolutely nothing to do the past weekend, and tagged along with my friends to check out a movie...any movie. and since the only movie we'd not seen was inspector gadget, we decided to go in for that.<br /><br />big mistake. this is a movie that might appeal only to kids. oh, and it's not like i don't enjoy movies targeted at the younger audience. but this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention. if you have nothing to do at home, go to sleep. better than wasting hard-earned cash on this. go check out the film if you're a kid or if you're a parent with a kid :)
