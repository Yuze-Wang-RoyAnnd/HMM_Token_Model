don't let the premise fool you--this was one funny movie. the problem--it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. the story sets you up nicely for an ending that never comes. even worse, the set-up is never explained. you will leave the theater asking "is that it?" i rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat. nicholas cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role, but he had very little to work with. there are odd quirks, and interesting turns everywhere, which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie. let this one come out on video before wasting your money.
