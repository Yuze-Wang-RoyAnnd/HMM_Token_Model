i can sit through this movie once, but i doubt i could make it through a second time. mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of lindsay lohan. the fun of matt dillon(think something about mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting micheal keaton. this is not the fun romp the love bug was but it is watchable. one of my main detractions from the movie was the fact that herbie had evolved into r2d2 antics for the most part. i was bored with the headlight eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me. go see this with your little ones, i.e. the "single digit bracket" kids and don't expect a lot from this film.<br /><br />_x
