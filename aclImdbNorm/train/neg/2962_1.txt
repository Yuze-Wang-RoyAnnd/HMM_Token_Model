movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining. so can whoopi goldberg movies. but whoopi and dinosaurs?<br /><br />after the first 20 minutes of "theodore rex", i had come to one conclusion: this movie is evil. evil, vile, wicked and reprehensible in its spite for the audience. nothing this bad is made by accident; this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber.<br /><br />first of all, whoopi does not make good action movies (watch "fatal beauty" if you think i'm lying), but the film makers don't care - she's a tough cop here, yet again. <br /><br />seen a million cop buddy flicks this week? well, here's number one million and one, pal.<br /><br />don't like cute, humanistic animated dinosaurs since that spielberg tv show about them? too bad, here's another one and he's a cop, too!<br /><br />you one of those people that hates car chases, shoot-outs, sloppy dialogue, boring futuristic fx and seeing talented people (goldberg, mueller-stahl, roundtree) stuck in a movie that looks like a tax write-off? a big tax write-off?<br /><br />and you read this review all the way to the end. you deserve a sequel. seriously.<br /><br />no stars, not a one. and if they really make a sequel to "theodore rex", hollywood deserves to be attacked a whole herd of wise-cracking foam rubber dinosaurs.<br /><br />now, i'd pay to see that.
