watching it lives by night makes you wonder, just who in the world greenlit this crap. a newlywed couple go spelunking on their honeymoon, get attacked by bats and the husband starts to run around in his pajamas attacking various people. and where exactly are they? they're in the desert, then they're skiing, then they're in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby. the town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against whiny doctor boy. the ski hospital is run by a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like mary tyler moore or marilyn quayle. there's no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you filled with anger. special effects and makeup guru stan winston did the effects for this movie. i guess you have to start somewhere.
