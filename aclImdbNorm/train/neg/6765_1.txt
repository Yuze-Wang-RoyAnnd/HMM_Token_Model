*spoilers* some people claim that natural born killers is brilliant criticism of the media obsession with violence. but this contention ignores the actual content of the film. oliver stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious, inhuman murderers of innocent people and contrasted this with a morbid media fascination. instead he lends them justification. the movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt. engaging in vicious stereotyping, stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures - dumb rednecks, broken-english speaking immigrants, lazy fat people. the one person that the homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype. of course they befriend the old, hallucinogen-using american-indian - because they're trendy, dude? let's make him an admirable character. fat, chinese clerks and "hicks" are uncool, so let's make it seem like the deserve to die. instead of twisted,hateful that are corrupted by their misdeeds, their rampage makes them happier and more in love. mickey and mallory are made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are bound to entice more impressionable people. justice is mocked. the police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and scowling compared to the gq murderers. again, this is not in the media reports within the film but in the "reality" in the film. there is no nuance or subtlety in the film - just overblown performances and visuals. the film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. the proof that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reactions to it. some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for murders that they committed. the film's "message" is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous real-life results. the clever message is nowhere to be seen.
