this film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control. it's exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures. for once hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots. however, what i found hard to take about the film was that although anja sch"ute was about 19 when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are. this whole lolita thing especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy. the heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is. come on, sex is a nice past time- between consenting adults. another thing i found odd was that neither beart nor sch"ute have a nude scene in the film, well, not a proper one at least.
