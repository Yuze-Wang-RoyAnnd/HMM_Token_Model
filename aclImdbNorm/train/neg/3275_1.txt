do not watch this movie if you loved the classics such as tom wopat, john schneider, catherine bach, sorrell booke, james best, denver pyle, sonny shroyer, and ben jones! this movie will dissappoint you badly! first of all, this movie starts out with bo and luke running moonshine for jesse. bo and luke would not do that ever on the real series! this movie portrays unimaginable characters doing things that never would have happened in the series. in the series, uncle jesse was honest, and law-abiding. in this movie, he is a criminal who is making moonshine and smoking weed with the governor of georgia. plus, if this was an extension adding on to the dukes of hazzard reunion! and the dukes of hazzard in hollywood, i have one question: how could uncle jesse be making moonshine when he died before the dukes of hazzard in hollywood movie? and how is boss hogg alive when he died before the reunion movie in 1997! movie and rosco ran hazzard? it seems magical that these characters came back to life, when they have been dead for 11 and 8 years? if hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they should have brought back james best, john schneider, tom wopat, ben jones, and catherine bach like they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family friendly movie with the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is compared to this disgusting, disgraced movie! if you want to see good dukes movies, either buy the original series, or go out to walmart.com and buy the dvd set of 2 that includes the reunion, and dukes of hazzard in hollywood movies! they both star the original cast, and are family friendly! don't waste your time on a movie that isn't worth the cd it's written on!
