three stooges - have rocket, will travel - 1959 this was the first feature length film to star the stooges and it is pretty bad. it makes the three stooges go around the world in a daze (from 1963) look like a masterpiece.<br /><br />the stooges are janitors at a rocket place. they climb into a rocket and it goes to venus. they meet some stuff there including a talking unicorn they call "uni" which they bring back to earth with them. "uni" speaks like an average, pleasant person - 'oh, hello. how are you? lovely planet here. hope you like it.' hilarious.<br /><br />very few gags and so many of the scenes just go on and on and on.<br /><br />the stooges arrive back from space and the film is over as far as the story goes, but no one told that to the film makers for the picture continues for another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing much happens. the stooges leave the party and then the film is almost over.<br /><br />high point of the film - the end where the stooges sing a dapper little song about their journey. the larry and curly joe hit moe in the face with two pies. brutal.<br /><br />another writer mentioned the fine musical score. huh? the only music i even noticed were two classic tunes - i'll take romance and there goes that song again, both of which are played at the party. and *that* really is the high point of the picture - music from old columbia films.<br /><br />the tall sexy blonde was nice.<br /><br />awful - a brand new vhs video from the 99 cents only store.
