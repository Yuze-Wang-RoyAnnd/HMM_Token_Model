i wouldn't recommend this unless you're keen on david copperfield and want to "complete the set". there are some good performances (e.g. uriah heep) and well directed moments (e.g. the beating), but on the whole it really pales in comparison with the 1999 bbc version, as well as earlier versions. <br /><br />there are inexplicable changes to the story that really serve no great purpose except, possibly, to dumb it down (the stolen jewels being a case in point). the american cast were poorly chosen: sally field is a good actress, but she is wrong as betsy trotwood, and her english accent is only slightly better than dick van dyke's cockney. i can see why michael richards was chosen to play mr micawber; he hams it up rather too much, however, and becomes irritating. he also speaks his lines in an accent that goes beyond eccentric and becomes simply preposterous. anthony andrews is menacing as mr murdstone, but one almost expects him to don a black cape and tie david's mother to a railway line (though this is perhaps partly the fault of dickens). <br /><br />i got this for free with a newspaper. it helped pass a sunday afternoon, but i felt more disappointed than charmed at the end of it
