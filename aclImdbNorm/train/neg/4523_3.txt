when this movie was released, it spawned one of the all-time great capsule movie reviews: sphinx stinks. it does, but in a mesmerizing sort of way. the casting is silly, starting at the top: frank langella and sir john gielgud as egyptians? not enough makeup in cairo for that, at least not while this film was being made. but it's rather amusing to see them try. the performances run the gamut from mummy-like (sorry, the obvious observation) to over-the-top, with very few stops in between. the lesley-anne down character seems as though she couldn't find egypt on a map, much less expound upon its archaeological treasures. that's due at least in part to some really bad writing, one of the curses that will be visited upon every viewer of this movie. it's my opinion that movies involving a curse or that draw their basis from a subject that is somewhat esoteric, such as egyptology, are ripe for silly, overwritten dialogue. it doesn't disappoint, and the convergence proves a double-whammy. the plot has one driving source of dramatic tension: can this get dumber and less believable? the answer is, usually, yes. the location shots are beautiful, and the set design is generally very good, the only consistent reminders that this wasn't some low-budget production. that and the fact that there are so many well-known faces doing service in such an unintentional laugher. cheap, no; cheesy, yes.
