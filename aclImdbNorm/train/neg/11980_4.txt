this one was marred by potentially great matches being cut very short.<br /><br />the opening match was a waste of the legion of doom, but i guess the only way they could have been eliminated by demolition was a double-dq. otherwise, mr. perfect would have had to put in overtime. kerry von erich, the i-c champ, was wasted here. and this was the third ppv in a row where perfect jobbed. remember, before that he never lost a match.<br /><br />the second match was very good, possibly the best of the night. ted dibiase and the undertaker were excellent, while the jim neidhart had one of his wwf highlights, pinning the honky tonk man. koko b. ware continued his tradition of being the first to put over a new heel (remember the big bossman and yokozuna?). this was a foreshadowing of bret hart's singles career, as he came back from two-on-one and almost survived the match. he and dibiase put on a wrestling clinic, making us forget that the point of the match was dibiase's boring feud with dusty rhodes.<br /><br />even though the visionaries were the first team to have all of its members survive (and only the second since '87 to have four survivors), this match was not a squash. this was the longest match of the night, and jake did a repeat of his '88 performance when he was left alone against four men and dominated. i think he could have actually pulled off an upset. these days, the match would have ended the other way around.<br /><br />one of the shortest ss matches ever was also one of its most surprising. possibly the most underrated wrestler ever, tito santana was the inspirational wrestler of the night, putting on war paint and pinning boris zukhov, tanaka, and even the warlord in the final survival match. it was so strange to see him put over so overwhelmingly, then go right back to his mediocre career. sgt. slaughter also did well, getting rid of volkoff and the bushwhackers, but that just wasn't a surprise. tito was.<br /><br />i think the only point of the survival match was to have hogan and the warrior win together at the end.<br /><br />this show was boring and the matches were too short. the undertaker's debut was cool, but tito santana is the reason i will remember this one.
