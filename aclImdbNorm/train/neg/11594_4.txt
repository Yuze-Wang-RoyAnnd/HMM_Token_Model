like freddy's revenge, this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesn't go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it. basically alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends. this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise-cracks are quite poor, so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy. <br /><br /> i've not alot to say about this. it's moderately interesting to see the characters of alice and dan returning from four, but not worth watching a movie over. uninspriring and unenjoyable, possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series.
