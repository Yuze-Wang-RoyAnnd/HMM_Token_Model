what a preposterous story ,murder blackmail,child sex allegations ,gays and the catholic church.....absolute tripe. how is it that most uk based tv dramas ,sit coms etc have to include the obligortory gay,its really getting tiresome now. everybody accepts that there are gay people in society just has there are other minority groups,but we don't want it ramming down our throats(i'll pass on this one) in every single show. apart from the above, the drama went from what could have been an interesting little story into a pantomime,the priest was a paedophile and there are gays running about every where,oh yes just to be totally pc one of the gay couple was black.i am surprised at c ecclestone for even contemplating this when he read the script.
