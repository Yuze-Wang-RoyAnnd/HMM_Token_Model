and shot in vancouver with the 'mountains' of the low country of south carolina visible in the background. for heaven's sake, they should have reset the location. there are no coastal mountains in south carolina. period.<br /><br />lame visuals. they should have been beautiful. and the story limped along.<br /><br />i really don't understand why it was such a hit as a book, although i have to admit it's one i haven't read as yet. usually i read the book and give the film a miss. there was nothing in this movie that made me want to buy the book, or even borrow it from the library.<br /><br />verdict: the mermaid chair seemed pretty shallow to moi.
