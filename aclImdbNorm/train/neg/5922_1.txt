my mother keeps a cassette of this film as a general threat to any film loving person who annoys her. everything about it stinks.<br /><br />as such it is a true classic.<br /><br />who gave it 10/10? were you inadvertently watching a good film and accidentally voted for this one?<br /><br />everyone involved in the movie making process should be forced to watch at least a small section of this film. it should be an indelible stain on the minds on all that hold film sacred and be revered as the tide mark of the cinematically dire.
