do not be suckered into renting this movie. it has nothing to do with an escape from death row, despite the (english) title. i can't think of a single good thing to say about the movie. poor acting, poor editing, poor directing... laughable "plot", and the sound/music was so irritating, it's a wonder this movie doesn't come with a warning label. the only possible way to sit through this movie and enjoy it is for it's historical cheesiness quality. they just don't make films this bad anymore.
