the box for "to die for" suckered me in -- a shirtless hunky guy and the promise of some laughs and sex. there was plenty of thomas arklie (simon), who's easy on the eyes, but no laughs and little sexiness.<br /><br />the couple, mark and simon, have allegedly been together several years, but neither character is interesting enough to care about, so it's hard to imagine that they care about each other. the fault seems to lie in the script, not the performances; both actors do the best they can with what they're given. <br /><br />the ending is sappy and unaffecting (well, not totally unaffecting; i felt relief that it was over). <br /><br />if you're looking for a movie about gay relationships and aids that's funny, "parting glances" is far better.
