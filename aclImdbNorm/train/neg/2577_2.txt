this story had a different angle that intrigued me, enough to buy a previously-viewed vhs sight-unseen. that was a mistake.<br /><br />in what could have been a very nice story - about badly crippled people at a hospital, and their various personalities - turned quickly into a very profane soap opera with unlikeable characters.<br /><br />we have "bloss" (william forsythe) the stereotype racist white person, who says the f-word every other sentence and is so despicable they didn't give him a first name in the movie. he's a lot of fun to be around. then, there is "raymond hill" (wesley snipes), a fast-talking womanizer. snipes must have liked those fast-talking "hip" arrogant roles because he played in a number of them, like in "white men can't jump." then there is sweet helen hunt playing "anna" that wonderful caring, loving person who is having an adulterous affair with the leading character in the film, "joel garcia" (eric stoltz).<br /><br />yup, this is heartwarming, feel-good type stuff. it just makes my heart melt watching these nice folks. but, if you are one of those who loves sleazy characters portrayed by sleazy people in this sleazy film.....you might really like this! add in a dose of hollywood political correctness and there you go! what more could anyone want?
