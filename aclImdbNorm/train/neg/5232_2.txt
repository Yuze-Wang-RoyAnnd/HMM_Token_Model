becky harris plays the female shopper whose misfortune it is to be in the store at the wrong time and obviously only purpose to be in this film is to supply a reason to wear out remote controls! miss harris seems to me to be in her fifties or older when she first comes on the scene. once the red haired thug is done with her it becomes apparent that this is no aarp queen. if these are not some of the finest assets ever displayed on celluloid, i want someone to clue me in. absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and i literally wore out my vhs copy capturing her charms. i would like to know if this movie is available on dvd.<br /><br />the rest of this movie really is not worthy of mention. i was hoping to see something fairly convincing and intelligent, however i was disappointed on both counts. god bless becky harris!
