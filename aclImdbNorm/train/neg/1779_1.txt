it could have been a marvelous story based on the ancient races of cat people, but it wasn't.<br /><br />this work could have been just that; marvelous and replete with mythological references which kept my fascination fueled. the lead characters (charles brady played by brian krause; and his mother mary, played by alice krige) were shallowly done, had no depth of personality and were hardly likable or drawing. not even m"adchen amick (who played tanya robertson)'s character fit into that description. <br /><br />however, as i've said many times before, when you adapt a stephen king novel for tv, you simply must take into account the fact that his books aren't written for tv, and his screenplay talent sadly lacks the fire and depth he exhibits as a novelist. <br /><br />this is another botched attempt to take the magick of stephen king writing, whether that is of his novels or an original screenplay. to simply cut and paste his work onto the small screen. his novels get completely bastardized in the process and all you end up creating is a nice movie; nothing less but certainly nothing more. his screenplays are hit and miss. unfortunately, this screenplay translation was a miss. <br /><br />sorry, sorry, sorry movie.<br /><br />this movie gets a 1.0/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
