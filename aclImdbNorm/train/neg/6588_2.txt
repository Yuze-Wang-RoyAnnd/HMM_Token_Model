the following are some of the most blaring problems with this movie: 1) clich'es abound. seriously, awful "twists" are everywhere.<br /><br />2) the narrative jumps around in time, which would be fine if done well, but it's not.<br /><br />3) lame characters that don't develop so much as either remain utterly static, or drastically change for no good reason.<br /><br />4) big one: horrible acting. over the top from nearly every person.<br /><br />the following are some of the best points from the movie: 1) the lead is damn good looking.<br /><br />as i see it, there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie: a) people who can sit through 90 minutes of tripe simply because the lead is attractive.<br /><br />b) people who often think to themselves, "i like hollywood dreck rife with clich'es and overacting, but if only i could watch it in korean..." there's a lot of good korean cinema out there, so why waste your time with garbage?
