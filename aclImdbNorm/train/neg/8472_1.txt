the movie opens upon julian sands, lying on his back, a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it, about two feet above him. that was so provocative, and i thought, "here we go! a good vampire movie!" <br /><br />and then it died. that was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination. it was slow, uneventful drivel thereafter. i was vastly disappointed, as my previous experience with sands' acting was quite enjoyable. however, this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />even julian sands's questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie.<br /><br />it rates a 1.1/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
