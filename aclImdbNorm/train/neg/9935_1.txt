it utterly defeats me why godard is taken so seriously - and one plus one is a great example of his ineptitude as both a filmmaker and an 'intellectual' polemicist. it's hard to credit that godard actually believed all that marxist and maoist kant. anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as godard was making his films supporting them. as a filmmaker, ask yourself: would you have boring voice-overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience, and then, when you couldn't think of anything else to do, layer another voice-over to the first voice-over, which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case? brilliant, jean-luc! as for godard insisting on making a film with the rolling stones: of course he did; wouldn't you? it was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place: the genius of the stones eclipsing a talentless and babbling political idiot set loose with a camera. the bookshop scene wasn't worthy of even the worst fringe theatre, and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it - as could be readily seen. copping-out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream film-making is no more than a safe get-out to offer those who clearly see godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience. ironic that godard's one-time great friend, truffaut, with nuit americain, made the best film about film-making ever, and godard made the worst with le mepris! incidentally, godard didn't choose the stones' track of sympathy with the devil. it just happened to be the track they were working on when the 'film' started shooting at barnes olympic studios.
