there has been a lot of love that has been put into wes anderson's "fantastic mr fox", unfortunately all the love is for himself. granted, there has been a lot of time and effort been put into making this ever so self-consciously quirky universe but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try and make it funny. the worrying thing is that i think it was, and this is the best that wes anderson could come up with.<br /><br />the animation is good in the close-up shots of the animals, however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess. there wasn't really anything special about the acting either, with wes opting to choose his buddies and big names over more specialised voice actors that could have probably made the film better. i'm pretty sure george clooney's voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in south park, one of them where he played a dog.<br /><br />the film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically, despite the film being set in england, all the good animals are typical americans playing baseball, whilst the bad guys are stereotypical english with the most insulting english accents. i cannot stress how much of a waste of time this film is. i didn't laugh once.
