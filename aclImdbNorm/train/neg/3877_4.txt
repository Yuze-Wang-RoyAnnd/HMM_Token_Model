i just watched the incredible melting man for the second time, and it was even more boring than when i first watched it. i don't understand why it has become such a 'cult classic' when it is so tediously dull. the opening scene looks promising, when the fat nurse drops the canister of blood and runs for her dear life. after this all that really happens is the melting man stalks around some woods and houses, whilst having flashbacks of his life as an astronaut. the makeup is quite good, and his melting gooey face looks fairly realistic. there is a cool scene where he throws a mans head in a river, and it floats until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts open. there's not much to wet yourself over though, most scenes are shot in darkness and you can't really see what is happening. there isn't much gore, at least in the vipco dvd i watched. <br /><br />no, the incredible melting man is not that great at all. i'll give it marks for its cheese factor but that's about it. if you want a true sci-fi/horror cult classic, watch the deadly spawn instead!
