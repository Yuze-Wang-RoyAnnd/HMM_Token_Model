look,i'm reading and reading this comments and there's a lot of it that i wanna say but i will try to make it short but clean...<br /><br />first of all, lets forget all of the things how bad this movie was made...how it didn't show anything of notorious and i agree with the most people here saying that it was "hollywood", i mean, what did you expect a real life story? when will people wake up and see that u will never ever find the real truth about 2pac and biggie... its all covered up and buried deep down.<br /><br />second, i'm not against neither 2pac or biggie i love them both but 2pac and lil kim did get embarrassed in this movie for sure...<br /><br />next, for all of ya that are saying that the movie is awesome and cant see the truth, either u are too blind too see it because u think u know something about big or you don't know anything about him at all and u love this hollywood teenage movies. use your mind and see though the clouds... there is a lot of it you could say when it gets to this topic, i did not say 60% of what i have to say because its a very wide topic but for the movie i can only say that it could have been a little bit, i mean a much better done. but anyways i'm just some person giving her opinion....no hard feelings...<br /><br />look, i love hip hop and i live for it but after seeing this movie every person with a little intelligence could see that this is not how someone is suppose to live. with all do respect for 2pac and big, like all the other artists who are making for a living like this should turn the other page because u are ruining the youth....bringing the wrong message to the children and that is: not going to school but living from the streets, hustling and just grabbing for the paper....<br /><br />the true hip hop is suppose to be about love and intelligence, be smart and all.<br /><br />ok i know that many of you will think that i'm crazy, but this is just my point of view. look i am maybe wrong about something and im not saying this is a completely bad movie because even if i'm in hip hop for 17, 18 years i still don't know anything bout 2pac or biggie no matter how many articles i read or how much i support them and listen to their music...like most of you all out there. only people who were really close to them and the killers know the truth behind all this.<br /><br />and for the end i just wanna say for all of ya biggie and tupac fans and family, this two men were and will be the greatest of all time, no matter how they lived their lives but please in the future try to be better, learn and love each other, think good even for the ones that don't like you, because at the end...its not about how many money or fame u could get and how fast u could get to the top, its about accomplishing your self to the fullest and feeding your soul, your body and mind...because if u manage to do that, you will be living a life even after death!!!! peace and love to ya all!!!! rip biggie,2pac,aaliyah,left eye,jam master jay and the others who make a change in this world!!!!
