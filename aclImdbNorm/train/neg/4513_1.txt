even though the book wasn't strictly accurate to the real situation it described it still carried a sense of japan. i find it hard to believe that anyone who was involved in making this film had ever been to japan as it didn't feel japanese in the slightest. almost everything about it was terrible. i will admit the actors were generally quite good but couldn't stand a chance of saving it. before the film started i was surprised that there were only ten people in the cinema on a friday night shortly after the movie had opened in japan. 30 minutes in i was amazed they stayed. i stayed so i would have the right to criticize it. the whole movie was punctuated my groans and suppressed laughs of disbelief from my japanese girlfriend. everyone i saw walking out of that cinema had looks of confusion and disappointment on their faces. <br /><br />to the makers of this movie, you owe me two hours.
