i'm sorry, but this is such a bad movie it's hilarious. football hooligans arguing in a travel lodge? suits? shades?! alan clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he made this, it is as far from the truth as you can get.<br /><br />the casting was atrocious...gary oldman as a football hooligan? he doesn't look scary, act scary or even come across as someone who would like football. and as for yeti? what the hell? suits, shades and sitting in a travelodge childishly taunting each other with "its about time you got your nappy on". please.<br /><br />and the yeti's gang spraying the icc's underwear? <br /><br />i don't see how anyone can even take this film seriously!.<br /><br />4/10. its possibly the most inaccurate portrayal of the crisis of the late eighties hooliganism i have ever seen.
