angela johnson (pamela springsteen--yes she's related to bruce), the killer from the first film, is up to her old tricks again. she's one of the counselors at camp rolling hills. as long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing things are fine. but a few step over the line and angela kills them--cracking bad jokes all the way.<br /><br />the original "sleepaway camp" was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it. this is vicious and nasty too but has no good points to it. the plot has been done to death and this adds nothing new to the formula. there are plenty of gory killings in here (people are burnt alive, heads are cut off, throats slashed) but all the gore is so obviously fake it actually become comical. this also has the smallest amount of campers i've ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles (especially higgins). as expected there's the gratuitous female nudity (here provided by the tremendously untalented valerie hartman) and the obligatory good girl/good boy team (renne estevez and tony higgins). with the sole exception of springsteen and higgins the acting is lousy--even by slasher movie standards. there's also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse! boring and sick with a stupid plot, pointless nudity and bad gore. skip it.
