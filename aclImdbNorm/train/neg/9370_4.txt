although this isn't a "great film," there's something compelling and memorable about it. like another commenter on the film, i saw this in childhood. it's been thirty three years since 1952, but i have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously cumbersome title. see it if you have the opportunity. you'll feel like a voyeur of small town life as it evolves through the decades. more than any other film, this one brings a human face to the historical drama of early twentieth century "progress." it's engaging enough for a young viewer and memorable enough for an older one. furthermore, it's easy to like the characters and watch their passage through time.
