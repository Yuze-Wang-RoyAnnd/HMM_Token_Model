a poorly written script with no likeable characters. as for it being a comedy, i forgot to laugh. it's about 2 conceited friends who scam to get women in too bed with them (no sex scenes) and another friend(who is semi-discustingly weird)who sometimes also scams but mainly is considered as being the guy who masterbates. the 3 friends separately meet and fall for the same woman (amanda peet). somehow this is done without really any romance. the 3 guys stop being friends as they separately dated her. she scammed them out of their friendship because they scammed women. -- a bad movie
