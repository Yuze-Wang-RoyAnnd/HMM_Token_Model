what?!?? why are people saying this is "mind blowing?" just face it the ending is on of the worst endings in the history of cinematography! 4 left and the whole world has ended! not to mention the character 9 was a idiot the whole time he got everyone killed. 1 was right the whole time, if he sacrificed 9 then non of this would have happened. people giving there lives for a stupid cause and for what?... to make it rain? i admit the movie had it's parts, and the whole concept was fascinating. but a lot of it was clich'es one after another. and did anybody else get this feeling that this is a lot like "lord of the rings?" characters died for stupid reasons, there was almost no character development, and honestly ask yourself is it good to have only four guys left in the world; its pointless and stupid. it was one of the shortest movies i've ever seen, and thank god! how is robots turning against humans creative in any way! it's been done like a hundred times! this movie is really stupid, go see a movie that's worth watching like star trek, the hangover, or inglorious basterds, those were good movies!
