it really is that bad of a movie. my buddy rented it because he, well, is an idiot. but then again, i must be an idiot too because i watched the whole damn thing! the actors were on par with high school drama geeks who think that are going places. the only place they will be going is back to waiting tables at luby's. all i could think of while i was watching this "gem" was how it actually got made. i mean, some "screenwriter" actually thought that this premise was fresh, original and lucrative. then some moron with money believed in the script so much that he decided to fork some cash over with the naive misconception that he was going to make a return on it. actors were cast, locations were scouted, make-up artists were hired, computer animators fresh out of al collins graphic design school were brought in and this turd started to take form.<br /><br />there obviously were a ton of things that i hated about this move but the one thing the drove me the craziest was the overuse of music. every single minute of this flick was scored. there was not a single break in music. and at times it was mixed higher than the dialogue, not that it made you miss some vital plot point or anything.<br /><br />after it was over, we decided to watch mystic river. it was like driving a 1980 vw diesel rabbit then switching to a bmw 740il. you couldn't get two more opposite movies in terms of quality.
