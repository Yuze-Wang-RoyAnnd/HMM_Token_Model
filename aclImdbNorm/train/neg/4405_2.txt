all i can say is, before watching the movie i did not have a hint indication who annemarie schwarzenbach was or what was her life story..and i have to confess that the movie was hardly a help to reach these data.. and even it was not successful to persuade me to do some research by typing few words on google website; however, all i can say is that the actress jeanette hain was great with her mute facial expression she really played well and showed a deep depression mental status, as it is in real.<br /><br />after all , based on the script the movie has happened in turkey and tehran as well as afghanistan.. but believe me i am familiar with the area , it was all about an arabic desert in morocco.. turkish people and persian people are completely different in face and culture as well as in language which is not arabic..<br /><br />i suppose for making a film like this- documentary type- a thorough research about all these minor elements is mandatory..
