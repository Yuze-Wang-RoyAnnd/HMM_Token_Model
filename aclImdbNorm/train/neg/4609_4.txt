this was a crappy movie, with a whole lotta non-sense and too many loose-ends to count. i only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors (ron livingston) made a cameo in it, and i continued watching it because as a girl, i love any movie that includes male nudity for a change. later, i found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get, and each time it got...more... ridiculous.<br /><br />sean crawley (good-looking chris l. mckenna, whom i've never seen before - but loved his little nude scene)is making ends meet as a painter, when he meets electrician duke wayne (george wendt from "cheers"). thinking he's getting more work from duke, sean agrees to meet contractor ray matthews (daniel baldwin, playing a stereotypically evil guy). ray is being investigated by a city hall accountant (ron livingston in a cameo, who i've been in love with from "office space" up to "sex & the city"). ray end up offering the apparently desperate-for- cash sean $13k to kill the accountant, and sean accepts the job. sean stalks out the accountant, whose wife (kari wuhrer) he finds himself attracted to, completes the hit, and leaves - taking the file of information against ray with him. sean quickly learns he was being used, that ray never intended to pay him, and sean uses the file as leverage to get his money.<br /><br />up to this point, it's a descent flick...generally worth watching. but as soon as ray, duke and their crew kidnap sean to muscle the information about the file out of him, it just got dumber and dumber (and still dumber...), until finally it seemed like the film's writer, charlie higson, had snapped out of a 10-day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something. without simply detailing the movie, let's just say that in every-single-scene you watch after the kidnapping, you find yourself gasping "what the f**k!," baffled by the ongoing nonsense as sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption. in the end, so many loose-ends are left in the movie, that you begin to regret that you even watched it.<br /><br />this is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable, and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it's full value. it's supposed to be a psychological thriller, and mckenna is a decent actor, but it's hard to give yourself to the movie when you have "norm" from "cheers" and a baldwin brother doing the dirty work, and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense. guys will love the violence, blood and guts scenes, and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots. girls will enjoy handsome sean's gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie, when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie. personally, i hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks (ron livingston) is only in the first one-third of the movie.
