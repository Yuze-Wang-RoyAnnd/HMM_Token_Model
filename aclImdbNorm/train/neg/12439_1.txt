the first "home alone" was one of the funniest movies of the 90's. the second was just as funny with the same cast and jokes! now comes "home alone 3". i was curious how they could continue with the same story considering kevin would've been 17 by 1997. he could take care of himself, right? so, what does the director decide to do? he takes a child just as annoying and makes him sick. the kid is like 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house? what kind of team of burgerlers are these idiots? i don't really want to get too into detail if you want to sadly see this movie. but please, i'd recommend that you'd stay away from it. it's not worth your precious time. go fold a piece of paper, do chores, balance a pencil on your nose, or take a nap! it's better to do then to watch "home alone 3"!<br /><br />1/10
