this is hands down the worst movie i can ever remember watching. everything was unbelievably clich'e and retarded. the acting was horrible too. the camera work wasn't bad but that still couldn't redeem it. the writer/director of this film must suffer from down's syndrome if he believed this movie would help his career. i want the hour and a half of my life back that i wasted watching this crap. i would rather watch a video of the grass growing than this. i cant believe imdb is making me write 10 lines in order to post this but i feel that this movie is so bad that i must continue to warn others about it. the reason i came about this movie is that my girlfriend requested it from the local library thinking that it was the kris kristoferson movie which ended up being entitled "disappearances". i don't know whose fault it was for this garbage ending up in my dvd player but i feel that someone owes me at least $20 for my time, pain and suffering. in conclusion, the director/writer of this movie better hope i ever recognize him on the street.
