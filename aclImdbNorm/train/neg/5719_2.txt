this movie is a lot like the movie hostel, except with *bad* acting and not much suspense. the gore elements are there, but you don't really feel anything for the characters, making the violence not very effective. some parts are just strange... like forcing a snake down someones throat. what's up with that? is that supposed to be scary or gory? it's just kind of stupid. as for torture, there really isn't any (except for the guy getting blow-torched in the beginning, which they don't show anyway). the main bad guy keeps saying "make them die slowly", yet the butcher kills them all very fast. the deaths are all relatively quick. yes, i did watch the "unrated" version. so, overall, not the worst gore movie i've seen, but not at all good either. you won't miss anything if you skip this one.
