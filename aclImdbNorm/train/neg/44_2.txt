not sure if i'm referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the director..."devil hunter" sure is one bizarre 'horror' movie.<br /><br />the plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like "cannibal ferox" and "cut and run." chick gets kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages.' the jungle looks more like a park somewhere in mexico. the tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in party city-style halloween costume renditions of tribal garb. and the savages range in race from white to asian to black to hispanic. i suppose franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp.<br /><br />to make matters worse, this film has ultra-minimal gore, no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis. not fun. i can find something to like in just about any sleazy italian or euro-trash film; this one just fell way short.<br /><br />2 out of 10, kids.
