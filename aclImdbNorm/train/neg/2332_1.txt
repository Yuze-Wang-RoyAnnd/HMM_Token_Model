what was the purpose of this film? i suggest it was to make a handful of actors and their producers and director a big payday for doing nothing. even my favorite actor, bruce dern, couldn't keep my interest in this boring movie. a braindead ex-pugilist falls in with a weird woman and her relatives. he starts out as a fix-it man for the woman, and winds up beating a man and getting caught up in a kidnapping scheme. it was so confusing i can't even write a decent critique. if you see this one, my sweet, make sure it is after dark so you can go right to sleep.
