watch the 1936 version. as personally annoying i find charles boyer's voice, he's more of a match to pay cosmopolitan, depressed rudolf--i mean omar sharif tries but, no--too cute and vibrant. catherine denueve (sp) besides being too old looks nothing like marie--nothing! she looks too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a fashion.<br /><br />the only actor in the entire movie who conveys the role they're playing is ava gardner whose appearance as empress elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief (and look up pictures of the empress there's more than a passing resemblance) as historically, empress elisabeth wasn't involved that much in rudolf's life.
