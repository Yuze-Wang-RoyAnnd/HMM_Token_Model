yes there are great performances here. unfortunately, they happen in the context of a movie that doesn't seem to have a clue what it's doing. during the first 45-60 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance. suddenly, about an hour in, the characters who, until this point, had always spoken to each other, suddenly start singing to each other. to further confuse things, a little further in, out of nowhere, they actually do about 15 minutes of sung-through dialog, then seem to drop that idea and move on to other things, such as a number that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen string section. on top of all this inconsistency in how the music is used, is the composers' clear inability to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed. while the first couple of pieces do sort of mimic the 1950s motown sound, the rest of the film is just (bad) broadway show music. then there's the pure silliness of snippets of a group doing a bad jackson family imitation and eddie murphy morphing from little richard to james brown to lionel richie. when he started channeling stevie wonder i couldn't help laughing out loud. this was clearly one of those films that make me appreciate how little time i have on earth and resent that i wasted two hours of it watching this film.
