as a former kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town i was looking forward to seeing this movie. but, what a disappointment! although the acting and the production values aren't bad, the script is awful, the plot is unrealistic, and the theme is disturbing.<br /><br />the main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children. i can hardly believe how regressive it is in it's view of women. has the writer been living under a rock? <br /><br />although i enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen, i wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone. it's terrible. it's an embarrassment to the city it's named after.
