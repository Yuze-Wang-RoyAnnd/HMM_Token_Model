i watched the canadian videotape of this movie as "the witching" which somehow made its way to new york state. audio was quite bad, i had to raise it to about 7/8 just to hear it and the soundtrack often was overwhelming the dialog. orson welles was a mumbler, worse than usual, and some of his dialog and of others was run through an echo chamber. a ghostly figure who keeps reappearing had her voice distorted. some closed captions would really have helped!<br /><br />a group of witches or satanists (the end credits say the group was not meant to represent any real group!) have a ritual in which they get naked and cause a miscarriage by stabbing a doll. the woman who had the miscarriage and her husband move to a town named "lilith," where he's been offered a job at a toy factory. despite one of the akas of this movie apparently being "the toy factory," we never see it, and it's only occasionally referred to at all.<br /><br />on the way to lilith, her husband gets impatient with some of her questions about what his new boss mr. cato wanted to know about their religious persuasion. he drives aggressively, and causes another car to go off the road and blow up. after the police arrive, she takes a doll that fell out of the car, the second of many handmade dolls in the movie.<br /><br />it turns out mr. cato and all the townspeople are witches, and that they are the ones who caused her miscarriage, though she doesn't realize it. they want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy, of which she was not really aware.<br /><br />some images in the movie have some impact, but on the whole the movie is not very involving. the movie does seem a bit of a mess, and this is no doubt largely due to its re- editing and the addition of new footage. the original version, according to the end credits, was called necromancy - a life for a life. the magic of dvd could let us see both versions on one disc, but re-releasing this movie probably isn't a priority.
