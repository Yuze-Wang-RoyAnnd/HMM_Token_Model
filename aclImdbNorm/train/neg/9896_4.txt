the dvd version consists of 2 episodes, the parricide of caesar being the juncture. in addition, the language was spanish without subtitles. hence, it's hard for me to review in depth this movie because because i didn't understand what was said.<br /><br />cleopatra being an historic icon, the part is very difficult and i found that for a newcomer, leonor varela just plays fine. she is strong-willed but also a very supportive, tender soul mate. thimothy dalton as caesar is perfect and their romance is the main thing of the first episode. so, it is not really a documentary, nor a peplum but a great love story.<br /><br />after the parricide, a new lover comes (marc-antoine) but the flavor is gone: we remember always our first love. so, i found the second episode dull and their tragic fate isn't told powerfully.<br /><br />nonetheless, the production is luxurious: the sets are big, tastefully decorated; the moroccan live location exotic and the wardrobes splendid. the producers have a lot of money for sure, but they spend nothing on the special effects. they are so poor (blue screens, ships, sphinx) that it's funny.<br /><br />finally, i would like very much to hear it in french or english to make a definitive opinion about this two movies.
