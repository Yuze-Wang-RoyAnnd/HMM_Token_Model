**spoilers**khamosh is totally unrealistic, lacks a plot, and was basically only made to see stars portray themselves. the most suspenseful scene in the movie was when shabana azmi is in the shower and then we see her tv playing the shower scene from psycho. this movie actually expected users to believe that naseeruddin shah's character has a good enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how many!<br /><br />***spoiler begins***<br /><br />at the end, the killer spills his guts to shabana azmi long enough to allow naseeruddin shah's character to run up and shoot him!<br /><br />***spoiler ends***<br /><br />it is a little humorous (only a little) in the beginning to hear the director and cast members throwing insults at each other and hearing shabana azmi exclaim, "oh sh-t!"<br /><br />overall, a baaaaaaaaaaad movie!<br /><br />rating: ** out of ********** (2 out of 10)
