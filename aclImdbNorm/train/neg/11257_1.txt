this movie feels so empty. in every scene in the movie the maximum number of actors on the screen is like 10. because everything was shot in front of a blue screen there are never really any extras and the movie just feels weird.<br /><br />the acting was horrible! it's so obvious this was in front of a blue screen because all of the action scenes you can see the actor/actress wondering around half running when they should be running for their lives.. looking at the floor for their marks...<br /><br />spoilers: also you'll find yourself banging your head watching the movie. at one point at sky captain's home base they have like 100 planes sitting on the airstrip. they have advanced warning an attack is coming... so what do they do? nothing. all of the planes get blown up and yet again the only person fighting back is the sky captain...<br /><br />the entire world is under attack and he's the only person ever fighting back. at the very end of the movie you see hundreds of plains taking off finally... but what do they do? nothing... the movie is over...
