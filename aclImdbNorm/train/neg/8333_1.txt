this is by far the worst film i have seen in my entire life. the acting is poor and the storyline is almost incomprehensible. whether or not you like lightships or any ships for that matter is irrelevant. as for special effects the film has none. the whole film crew were probably on the boat out in rough seas rather than in a studio and when some of the men are "stabbed" (if you can even call it that) their reactions are totally unreal. the guns are more quiet than a mute. how this film could have one two awards puts serious questions to the state of the human mind. well thats about it. this review is probably more fun to read than the film is to watch. if anyone is considering watching it or buying it i would seriously advise you against it for obvious reasons. i have said that it includes a spoiler. if the fact that some people get stabbed and a gun gets fired is a plot giveaway. i suppose it is because they are the only good parts of the film.
