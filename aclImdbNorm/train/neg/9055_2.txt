being a fan of billy bob thornton, and the diversity of his skills, i noticed this movie listed, and was surprised i hadn't heard of it.<br /><br />i'd traveled more than usual during both the period it was being filmed in 2000, and when it hit theaters more than 2-1/2 years later (that passage of time is the first clue all was not well with the production).<br /><br />now patrick swayze can't act for sour apples, but thornton has more than enough ability to make-up for the difference between them. and charlize theron is someone whom it would be a pleasure to see, even if it showed her watching paint dry.<br /><br />being curious, i checked this site's production info. it made a whopping < $600 per screen its opening weekend, and just over $400 each, after its month's theater run in latter 2002. overall gross was $261k, which i'd doubt could cover cast and crew's hotel and food for a week on location.<br /><br />the story is pretty benign, and even the use of the usually interesting locale of reno is as dull as the rest of the goings-on.<br /><br />it's something like several snl bits all pieced together, none individually too great at all, and the overall presentation even worse.<br /><br />whatever, the expenses for this production had to be considerable - even if all worked for less than their usual fees - so the one thing which made it a barely tolerable opus was the quality of the filming and billy bob's present (albeit understandably somewhat laconic here , compared with his usual work.<br /><br />think of the three superb, totally diverse characters he portrayed in "sling blade," "bandits" and "bad santa," and you know he realized this work was below standard, long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm this. one star for him, even here, and one because production was better than, say, the typical "lifetime" flick.
