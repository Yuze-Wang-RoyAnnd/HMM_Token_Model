i was disappointed. the film was a bit predictable and did not live up to the hype plastered all over the box. having said that, the characters were well developed, the windego myth was used in a unique premise and the house was pretty spooky but it just missed for me. i kept waiting for that big ahhhhh or boo! but it never came.<br /><br />furthermore the movie was plagued with poor filming of poor special effects. thus showing to much of a bad thing and not using atmosphere and viewer imagination to create the horror and suspense. try movies like session 9 or the cube if your looking for a low-budget but well conceived horror movie.
