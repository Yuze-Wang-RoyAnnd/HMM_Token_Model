it is incredible that with all of the countless crimes that have been uncovered and laid unequivocally at the doorstep of marxism, from the berlin wall to the gulag archipelago to the cultural revolution to the khmer rouge, one still finds admirers of communist totalitarianism in hollywood and are still making propaganda in its favor. it just shows the moral depravity of hollywood.<br /><br />in this particular film a psychotic murderer is glorified. needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included. that both the director and the actor expect audiences to sit through this seemingly interminable propagandistic film demonstrates the tunnel vision that they have in regards to their object of worship.
