i rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting but to my horror this movie was the worst movie i had ever seen! i read the comment from gumby-8 and he has to be a part of the cast or the crew. unless gumby-8 is a 4 year old child or some demented cult member no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential at all.<br /><br />i couldn't believe gumby-8's comments. <br /><br />quoting: "from the "dune" inspired opening animation to the quick pace...this film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeat viewing is not unexpected."<br /><br />the animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact of that the film keeps the eye moving, well that's because you keep looking for any type of suspense. i mean give me a break halloween was shot with a budget of $100,000.00 and a painted mask and also by the way became a cult classic. as far as "repeat viewing is not unexpected" i think he made a typo.<br /><br />another quote from gumby-8 the only fan: "the acting is also a strong aspect of the film."<br /><br />with all due respect for the actors, their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of robert napton.<br /><br />the catchy tagline: "beware the hour between dusk and darkness"<br /><br />that's because there is no dusk or darkness in this movie.<br /><br />mpaa rating "rated r for some violence/gore"<br /><br />the only gore you see is some red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see. as far as i know it might be a clump of grass.<br /><br />in summation, i have seen horror flicks from the 50's, 60's and 70's. i have seen what i thought to be the absolutely worst and some that were very good. the director of this film either did not make any attempt, was asleep, or took a hit of acid. whatever the case i think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction. i would give this film a rating of .5 for a 'b' movie.
