let me state first that i love westerns & civil war stories. i also consider john ford as an excellent director. i also have the same high feelings for john wayne & william holden's acting ability.<br /><br />i cannot remember if i saw this film when it first came out in 1959. last night was the first time i saw it since then.<br /><br />as per my 4 rating, one can say i did not like the movie.<br /><br />i now will attempt to tell some of its shortcomings.<br /><br />john lee mahin who wrote the screenplay from harold sinclair's novel, was a very gifted writer & wrote many fine scripts, this script is poorly written & badly researched. they make mention of the awful conditions of the andersonville prison, at the time of the movie andersonville was not in operation. they also use rifles that were not used at the time.<br /><br />john ford was directing films for over 40 years & won 4 oscars. he must have been ill during the making of this.his usual style was missing. it could be that this was film in the south & east and not in monument valley.<br /><br />he normally had a stock company of players he used in nearly all his film, most were missing this time. this time only minor cowboy stars hoot gibson & ken curtiss have roles & of course anna lee has a small role. there were no other familiar faces except for the 3 stars. (see below) mr. fords stock company made most of his films the classics they were; sadly missed here.<br /><br />now we come to the main stars john wayne & william holden. the duke also must have been ill,he seemed out of place here. this sort of role usually fit his style perfectly, he was just adequate here. wiliam holden did the best he could, but nowhere as good as he usually was.<br /><br />it was required that there be an actress in this type of movie. here in her first major role (second film) is constance towers, a very beautiful person, but not really an actress, she is still having roles on television. let me be kind and say she has had a long career,more based on her looks than acting talent. also in caas as ms. towers servant is tennis star althea gibson.i am glad she stuck to tennis.<br /><br />the rest of the production credits were far from the usual high standard of other john ford films there were a few military type songs supposedly done by the marching cavalry, not good at all. the action scenes were good but come at the end of film.<br /><br />ratings *1/2* (out of 4) 47 points (out of 100) imdb 4 (out of 10)
