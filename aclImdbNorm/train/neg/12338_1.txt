i saw this movie originally in the theater, when i was 10. even at that age the 'humor' was mildly insulting to my adolescent intelligence.<br /><br />in the past, whenever i would see ed begley jr. or jeff goldblum i would cringe and start to feel very uncomfortable and even slightly sad. until i was reminded of the existence of this movie today, i was unsure why i felt that way. apparently i blocked my memory of this movie yet my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators remained. apparently i forgot that i saw this movie but subconsciously mourned the pieces of my soul that had been stolen, nay eaten by the creators of this inhuman work.<br /><br />i haven't been brave enough to try watching it as an adult. i imagine that as part of the healing process that i should probably look at confronting this childhood fear so that i can *truly* put it behind me. some regression therapy and / or hypnosis might not be a bad idea either.
