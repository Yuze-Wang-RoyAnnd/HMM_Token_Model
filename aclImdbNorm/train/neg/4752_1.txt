i heard many stories about this film being great... well, i took my chance when i saw it for a cheap price at ebay last month.<br /><br />i watched it, and i have only a few comments about it:<br /><br />1) terrible story-line, 2) terrible acting, 3) bad fighting-scenes...<br /><br />i never seen any worse movie in my life so far!! when the storyline is bad, than at least make the fights something more interesting. but both are done ridiculously bad...<br /><br />* the only positive thing about this movie (in my opinion) is nikki berwick. god, she looks nice in this movie.<br /><br />that's about it...
