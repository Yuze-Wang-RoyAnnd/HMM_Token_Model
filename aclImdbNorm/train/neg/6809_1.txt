one stinko of a movie featuring a shopworn plot and, to be kind, acting of less than oscar caliber. but to me the single worst flaw was the total misrepresentation of a jet aircraft, and especially a 747. some of the major blunders:<br /><br />1. no flight engineer (or even a flight engineer station. 2. mis-identifying the f-16 interceptors as f-15's (no resmblance whatsoever). 3. loading passengers into an "aft baggage compartment" supposedly accesible from the cabin - even if such a compartment existed, placing that much weight that far aft would make the aircraft unflyable. 4. hollow point bullets that "won't damage the aircraft". 5. the entire landing procedure was so bad i wanted to puke. 6. an sr-71 (of all planes) with a pressure seal hatch 7. opening a cabin door outward - into the wind - in flight!!<br /><br />ah nuts, it was just a truly lousy movie. gotta make the list of bottom 10 of the year.
