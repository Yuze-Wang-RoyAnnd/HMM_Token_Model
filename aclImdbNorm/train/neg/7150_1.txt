after seeing the previews i felt that this movie was going to be a nice improvement over that fast & furious series. so, i already expected it to have a lacking storyline, but at least this time it won't be loaded with a bunch of powerless civics with fart cans. unfortunately, i was wrong. if you could only imagine a fast & furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you.<br /><br />this is the absolute worst movie i had ever seen (i'm being nice - no i would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said). not only was the storyline non-existent, but the action was crap too. i guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie. for an example, there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a slr mclaren to win. and after the bit where eddy griffin got in a fight with one of his "girls" (an imus comment would work in this case) the girl asks to pull over and get out of the plane and of course they do in the middle of the desert. after this wonderful scene i couldn't take it anymore. so, i only got to see half of this monstrosity. this is the first movie i had ever walked out on. afterwards, i had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells.<br /><br />i gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option. you're better off going to the local car show and stopping at a strip joint on the way home. i will keep all viewers in my prayers.
