don't even ask me why i watched this! the only excuse i can come up with that i was sick with bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. :) it's too terrible for words, the movie that is, not the bronchitis. the acting is deplorable, richard grieco hams it up as a trigger-happy, gun-slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops. nick mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and nancy allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film. the script is dismal, peppered with clich'ed lines, "are you ready, pardner?" purrs richard grieco to every single one of his victims. dire. avoid.
