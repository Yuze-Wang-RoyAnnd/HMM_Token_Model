if you loved "pulp fiction" and like hand held cameras you should love this film. i liked the quirky story (even though i feel that "pulp fiction" was the most over-rated movie since "the english patient") and found the characters unrealistic but interesting. it's not "on the waterfront" or "citizen kane" and is burdened by european pretentiousness. but the worst part by far is the hand held camera. it is so distracting and annoying i found myself waiting desperately for the movie to end. i don't know why new directors think this method of filming is so great. if you are prone to motion sickness, stay away, the hand held camera will have you nauseous in about 10 minutes.
