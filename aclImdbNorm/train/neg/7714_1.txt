awlright, damn it, the moocow will grudgingly admit the truth: i kinda' like this cheap, cheesy 70's parody. the idea that vast hordes of killer tomatoes are destroying the us is a great idea, and in spite of itself, the moovie does provide some decent chuckles, moostly the sight of terrified extras running away from large, obviously fake tomatoes. this film, along with the kentucky fried moovie, is one of the earlier attempts at spoofs, which became so popular in the 80's & 90's, thanks largely to airplane!. this one, like moost spoofs, is pretty poor. many attempts at humor are dismal failures, and will induce much groaning. but thanks to the ravenous tomatoes hordes, the obnoxious "puberty love" song, and the awesome helicopter crash scene, attack of the killer tomatoes does provide some goods, though largely for the wrong reasons. there are sooooo many things wrong with this film...and so right, it's hard to explain. enough people must also have enjoyed it as the tomatoes made a comeback in 2 moore films, and a cartoon series!! large chunks of time spent away from the tomatoes are pretty dull. and dig those 70's clothes, dude!! ;=8) this tomato is seedy and cheesy, but worth a chuckle or two; the moocow says grab a pizza and pop in the tomatoes!! :
