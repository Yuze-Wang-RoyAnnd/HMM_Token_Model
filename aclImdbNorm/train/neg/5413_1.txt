after the reasonably successful masti which was tad better inder kumar returned again with a comedy pyaare mohan based on the hollywood film see no evil, hear no evil <br /><br />the film reminds you of hum hai kamaal ke(1994) where kader and anupam play the blind and deaf<br /><br />this movie is a tedious exercise<br /><br />the film has jokes of such nonsense that you don't feel like laughing like snehal dabi's head getting stuck in the back of the horse and all those type comedies which we don't laugh at now but mock <br /><br />the film starts off in a clich'ed manner and some scenes are funny sadly such moments don't last long as the story never moves in this half even the comedy gets boring the twist is well handled and the second half becomes an action film where the blind guy and the deaf go to rescue the heroines and we have all ott chase scenes and fight scenes<br /><br />direction by inder kumar is bad music is okay, one song stands out i love you my angel<br /><br />vivek is awful in the comic scenes, his timing is very bad and is okay in serious scenes for some reason he keeps doing comedy and ruined his career fardeen khan is tad better but too wooden amongst the rest esha and amrita are the heroines boman irani annoys here snehal dabbi is okay
