an interesting idea (four african american women crushed under society's boot heel take their revenge by robbing banks) is ruined by f. gary gray's horribly slow direction and an excruciating script (by takashi bufford and kate lanier) full of unintentionally funny moments. instead of delivering a pointed commentary about the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men cruelly abuse and humiliate them, gray, bufford and lanier prefers to pummel their unsuspecting audience with highbrow notions of operatic tragedy. it's melodrama at its worst. gray has his actors linger over every tired line and john carter's lazy editing refuses to pick up the slack, choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the performers' bemused faces. and bemused they are: although actors such as jada pinkett, kimberly elise and vivica a. fox have some raw talent (queen latifah is the fourth and as an actress she's an excellent rapper), they need a surer hand than gray's to guide them and as a result they come off as shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera. steer clear.
