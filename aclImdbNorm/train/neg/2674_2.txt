someone had a great idea: let's have misty mundae do her own, r-rated version of lara croft - firing two guns not only in skimpy outfits, but topless as well. it was indeed a great idea. the problem is that the people who had it couldn't come up with any sort of script or budget to support it. therefore, we get a "film" that barely reaches medium length by replaying many of its parts (often in slow-motion), and was apparently shot entirely inside a garage. the appeal of misty mundae is still evident: she is unbelievably cute and has a natural girl-next-door beauty. however her two female co-stars here, with whom she shares a lengthy lesbian scene, are nowhere near her league. if "mummy raider" was presented as a youtube video, i'd rate it higher, but as a "film" destined for dvd consumption it cannot get more than 1/2 a * out of 4.
