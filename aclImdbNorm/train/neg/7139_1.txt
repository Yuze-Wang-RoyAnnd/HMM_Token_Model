redline is a knockoff of fast & furious, without any of the redeeming qualities. it doesn't need to have a convoluted plot with multiple twists and surprises, but it needs something! this is the equivalent of a porn film, where the storyline and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end. except that this is worse, because you don't get your money's worth. mind-numbingly boring, impossible race sequences, and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars, which almost acquire negative points for having appeared in this movie. sure, she's hot, but who's that desperate for an on screen female? i feel like the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and plot snippets, and shook an 8 ball every time they switched scenes. no serious person who races or knows anything about it would watch this movie and enjoy the race scenes.
