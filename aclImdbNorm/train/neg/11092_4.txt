when i saw this movie i heard all the hype, and i heard how people said that denzel deserved the oscar alongside his golden globe and i believed he must have done an outstanding job considering kevin spacey was excellent. i was wrong. i realize that people say this not to anger the african american community (if they are not african americans themselves). i always hear complaints on how african americans are never nominated and how they should have won. sometimes this is true (not as much nowadays) because whoppi goldberg should have won best actress for the color purple and the movie should have won best picture. the only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was, is because people see a movie about the (*semi-spoiler*) hardships of an african american during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece.<br /><br />denzel washington is an outstanding actor, but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever. i was bored with him in the movie, and his acting here was quite similar to his role in malcolm x but not as good. the audience is supposed to leave believing this man, rubin carter, is a saint. people left the movies worshipping this man, this hero, and they went out and bought his book, making this hero of a man rich.<br /><br />*spoilers* this movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit. of course the crimes he did commit (stealing mostly) was only to survive, nothing more. people felt sorry for him, even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society. everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint (except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife) but why wouldn't it-after all, it is his point of view. i do not like movies (especially hollywood interpretations) that are based on "true" stories because they usually distort the "true" parts into something else, something not so true. this was his point of view and a hollywood construction, yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably. well i researched his past a bit before making any assumptions, and he was a very violent man. not only that, there is still a possibility that he did murder those people. if you do not believe me, search for him on the internet, and read the articles some people have of him. the boxing match he claimed to have won so easily, was actually won by his opponent joey giardello and there are tapes to prove it. besides that, there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie. the supporting cast were the nicest people i have ever seen on the face of the earth and their "nice and perfect" persona looked difficult to keep up.<br /><br />this movie was a hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully. denzel's acting is stale, and the supporting cast's mickey mouse attitudes are annoying. the movie also begins very slow paced and is boring.
