poor performances by sinatra, martin and hyer. grossly underdeveloped supporting characters. annoying talky with no real plot. ending leaves you flatter than a pancake, with more loose ends than you could tie up in four sequels (that is, if you even cared about these wooden characters). maclaine is the only real asset. that penultimate sequence in which the "chicago hood" searches for the sinatra character is laughable. the music in that sequence also is poor. and in the final scene when martin's character removes his hat for the woman he called a "pig," almost made me go outside and find a stone to throw through my television screen.
