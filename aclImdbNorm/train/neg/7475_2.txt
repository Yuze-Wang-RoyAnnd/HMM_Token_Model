to be honest i knew what to expect before i watched this film, and i've got to say it has the worst acting i've ever seen. it does have its moments, and on a comedy level its very entertaining, but i'm afraid its not scary, and stupidity is taken to a new level. there's a lot of unnecessary gore, and the plot is all over the place. i have no idea why the aliens were evil, and why they even came to this remote part of wales, (i mean who'd go there anyway?) but i didn't care at that point, because i was amused by the costumes, and the bad cgi. as far as b-movies go, this deserves the title of 'being so bad, its good', and kudos to the film-makers, because they probably knew what they were doing. long may these films continue.....
