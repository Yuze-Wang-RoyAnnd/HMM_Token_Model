i'm sure to people watching this move outside of britian this film will be an entertaining watch, but for someone from the uk it's painful in it's errors.<br /><br />right at the start of the film elijah wood gets off a tube at bank station, which has been trashed. he says to his sister, who he's meeting, "what happened here" and she replies "oh tottenham were in town yesterday"!!! tottenham are in town already.. they're part of the town, they don't have to go there! and if tottenham fans wanted to fight other fans the last place on earth they'd do it is bank station, where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world.<br /><br />there are several other similar errors but the biggest failing for me is the actor who plays the lead hooligan. he clearly decided it wasn't worth trying to speak with an east end accent and instead opted for a dick van dyke style mock-ney which made my ears bleed. it was accentuated by the fact the rest of his gang all spoke in the way you'd expect west ham fans to speak. this error made him unbelievable in the role and really spoilt the film.
