as you all may know, jigsaw did not make its way to blackbuster because of a member of full moon's own staff, devin hamilton. devin is the one who sells to all of the video chains. he recently released a movie, bleed, which he was selling to blackbuster at the same time as jigsaw. he convinced the blackbuster buyer not to take any jigsaw, and double the number of bleed. the result is that jigsaw looks like a flop, and bleed looks like a hit. the major problem with that is that bleed is one of the worst movies ever, and as we all know, jigsaw is, well, gold. i urge all of you to go on to the bleed page on the internet and vote for the movie that wronged jigsaw, and all of your talents. likewise, you should go to the jigsaw page and cast high votes for it (if you already haven't). we need to get jigsaw up to at least an 8 or 8.5, and bleed down to around a 2 (thus putting it on the internet's 100 worst movie listing). also, try to convince friends and family to do the same.<br /><br />hope you all are doing well, - matt
