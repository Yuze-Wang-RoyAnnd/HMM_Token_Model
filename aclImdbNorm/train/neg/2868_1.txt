this is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the btk killer. the events in this movie are not even close to the truth. why they couldn't make a movie of the real events doesn't make any sense since the real events are more interesting then this made up farce. don't even waste your time watching this for free. low budget and a shameful depiction of the events which should not be made a joke of, which is really what this movie did. if they would allow me to give a -10 to this movie i would. the acting sucked and it looks like it was shot on an old vhs video camera from the 80s. save your time and money by not watching this movie.
