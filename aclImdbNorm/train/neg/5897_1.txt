acclaimed japanese director takashi miike can't seem to get the wheels moving with this torpid thriller, an adaptation of yasushi akimoto's book concerning an evil old woman (and child abuser!) who is part of a new urban legend: if your cell-phone rings with a strange tone--and you see the message 'one missed call'--you will replay the message only to hear your own final words before your death. most successful part of the film is the trenchant satire of reality tv cameras intruding on the future victims, but the not-so-elaborate deaths (which include a hidden piece of red candy!) are disappointing and dispiriting. the frequent shots of ravaged dead bodies are actually displayed rather discreetly, and this overall politeness may be the reason why the film is ultimately so staid. hollywood predictably jumped on the far-fetched plot in 2008, yet the u.s. version fared no better. no stars from ****
