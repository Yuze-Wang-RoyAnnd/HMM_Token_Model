it just seems to run true to form, any movie starring dolph lundgren is bad! i don't know if it is the fact that the storyline in full of holes, or that dolph is such a bad actor. no spoiler here, he seems to overdue the pushing and shoving and grabbing and touching thing in this movie. in my opinion it is a wonder that some of these projects find venture capital to get in the can and to the theatre.
