this movie is possibly the cheapest, cheesiest, and poorest sequel ever made.<br /><br />yet, it is the funniest and most idiotic movie by disney, and will guarantee laughs at the sappy stories and lame plots from start to finish.<br /><br />it's a group of short stories that seem like bad fanfictions.<br /><br />*spoiler alert* the first one's all about beast and belle being petty over a pathetic argument. then, three loser new characters decide to patch things up by forging a letter of forgiveness to give to belle. part way through this little episode, belle has wall eyes, which made my siblings and i laugh so hard. then, she and the beast fight more over the letter... and later learn the meaning of forgiveness. how old are they??? certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness.<br /><br />then, the next one's all about lumiere being the world's biggest dope when it comes to romance. this coming from the man who could woo anything female. and they make fifi a psychotic villainess who tries to kill belle, and winds up getting off scotch-free by the end of it. what a message to send the kids!<br /><br />then, the next one's all about mrs. potts being angsty. and the next one after that's all about beast becoming overly possessive of a bird, to the point where he just seems downright silly.<br /><br />the animation's so ugly, it kills. there are at least 100 mistakes you can plainly see... and the coloring is awful.<br /><br />belle's a simpering sap who blubbers whenever something goes wrong. plus, she's petty and very different from the usual belle.<br /><br />and the side characters are annoying... (i mean, cogsworth and lumiere fight almost all the time. i know they did that in the movie, but it was overdone in this.)<br /><br />but the worst character is mrs. potts. she's ruined in this. i can't even describe it. just buy it and see for yourself.<br /><br />i give it a 1/10 for the sap, but i give it a 10/10 for comedy.
