this is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies. once again it doesn't make since. the killer still kills for fun. but this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie. which means that it is the stupidest movie ever.<br /><br />don't watch this. if you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't watch it. you'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it. because it just doesn't combine the original makes of horror, action, and crime.<br /><br />don't let your children watch this. teenager, young child or young adult, this movie has that sorta impact upon people.
