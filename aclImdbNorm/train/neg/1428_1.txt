although this film was made before dogme emerged as the predominant method of filmmaking, and before digital triumphed over -- strike that. you get the point. this 1991 masterpiece clearly anticipated those developments. corin nemec is just outstanding as the ne'er do well author and narrator. the pace is slow, but elegantly so, because the cinematography is so beautiful. record it the next time its on t.v., because i guarantee you'll never see a better nostalgia rip-off made-for- t.v. movie. direct-to-video never felt so good!
