this movie starts presenting a somehow original idea but became a great frustration later on. what is the deal of having an original start if the rest of the movie did little to avoid a clich'ed plot? the movie itself is very unbelievable. i would like to know how exactly someone enters a clinic, gets a nurse outfit, kills a doctor, takes out a patient in her bed, puts into his chevy pickup and leaves? i guess no one could answer this question, so they just jumped to the other scene hiding these little details. the performances are just plain bad. the villain is just another "annoying crazy antagonist", no deepness, totally linear character. after 20 minutes of film, most scenes are unbelievable, seemed like they were put there just for the sake of the 90 minutes since they were totally unneeded. a doctor see a woman clearly under strong medication, is denied to examine her, gets kicked out of the house and simply leaves quiet? the ending scene made me burst into laugher, only mickey mouse could make it more out of reality. i'm giving it 2 out of 10 for the first lets say 10 minutes of movie.
