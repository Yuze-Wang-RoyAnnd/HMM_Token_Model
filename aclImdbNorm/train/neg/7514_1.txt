a low budget effort from texas that's at least filmed well, but that is little consolation. bad acting, or, should i say, bad over-acting, a pretty limp story line that's nothing new, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. seems like a bunch of young folks are putting together a haunted house for halloween, which is done every year, but this year things are different. has a long extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely fills out the empty spots, of which there are a lot. putrid, puerile, definitely avoidable, at all costs.
