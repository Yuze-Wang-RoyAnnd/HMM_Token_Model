lame, cliched superhero action movie drivel. i had high hopes for this movie, and the genre of hk buddy cop actioneers is one that i don't despise, but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was. this would have been forgivable, as it always is in these kinds of movies, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it did not. the action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of hk action, but it's not very involving, obscenely gory, and in fact often completely incoherent (perhaps this is due to re-editing for american release, it does show signs in many places of patchwork). i was very disappointed.
