a dreary and pointless bit of fluff (bloody fluff, but fluff). badly scripted, with inane and wooden dialogue. you do not care if the characters (indeed, even if the actors themselves) live or die. little grace or charm, little action, little point to the whole thing. perhaps some of the set and setting will interest--those gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived. the framework encounter is unnecessary and distracting, and the hoppalong cassidy character himself is both boring and inept.
