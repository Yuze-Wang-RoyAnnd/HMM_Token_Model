don't even bother with this movie, it's bad when judged on it's own merits, but when compared to the 1972 original (which is a classic) it's down right awful. and btw, somebody commented that the 1972 movie is bad when compared to the book. this is silly, movies should never be judged against the books they are taken from. they are 2 completely different art forms (as if this needed to be pointed out but apparently it does). if you used this criteria for all movies then "2001" would suck and so would "forest gump" and "silence of the lambs".
