as an ordinary movie-watcher i can't say i enjoyed watching this one. it's not too emotional for a drama, not too gripping for a thriller, not too fast for an action. plus, some moments of the movie are hardly credible. ok, i understand, soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there, but it's hard to believe that a person would risk his life, carjack into the middle of a hostile city, and after being shouted at by a professor's wife run away, without having asked a question (in a proper way). it would seem terribly romantic if it were an animation or so, but it's supposed to be a serious film about war.. there are several episodes like this, so the whole picture makes an impression that it's just a raw preview of a movie, and it needs considerable work.<br /><br />it feels like the movie makers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier, but all these 'curves' of his psychology seem simply unnatural.<br /><br />this picture left a question in my head: why? why they gave it an oscar? why six? and imho it's the most thrilling part of the movie :)
