it's hard to criticize this movie, because i dislike the story itself, and no amount of good acting would have saved it. think "raising arizona" with a mean streak. the acting is passable, but jennifer tilly is way over the top (yet not enough to make this a nice camp film) as usual, coming in somewhere between "misery" and a sarcastic dmv employee. the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation, either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise. a real degrading few hours of film. darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood. i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked out, sorry.
