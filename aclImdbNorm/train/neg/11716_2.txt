after watching this i thought to myself, there are either too few good writers & directors or lots of producers.<br /><br />at any rate, this is a terrible movie. terrible in a way that it's not fun, but rather makes you grit your teeth and quiver. makes you shout "this is wrong" at the movie. immersion is zero. by now most of you are probably used to the terrible errors/weirdness-es in movies that has computers hackers etc. in them. this movie is like that in every aspect. <br /><br />the only good thing about the movie is the little girl emily, brilliantly played by eliza bennett. i hope she becomes big, and make this ..thing at least worth something.<br /><br />do yourself a favor. don't watch this. there is not even proper action in it. total waste of time.
