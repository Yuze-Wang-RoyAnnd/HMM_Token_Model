knights was just a beginning of a series, a pilot, one might say. the plot (i really shouldn't call it that, there wasn't any plot) wasn't logical at all and there were many mistakes, like [warning, i'm summarizing the plot]:<br /><br />in the beginning of the movie someone said that there was only a couple of those cyborgs (the bad guys) but after the climax, nea found out that there were many many more left of them. and it was told that cyborgs were hard to kill, but after a month's training, nea could kill them with a single blow.<br /><br />the movie was just pure kicking. i wasn't surprised at all, when i found out that the leading star was a kick boxer.<br /><br />there was one positive thing in the whole movie: it really gave a great deal of laughter when watching it and talking about it with my friends. i recommend watching it, if you are in need of laughter.
