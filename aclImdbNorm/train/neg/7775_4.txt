am not familiar with the trilogy but came upon this film last night on showtime. the film looked very well done with the set design and the cinematography, but the screenplay was stilted and wooden. the acting was fairly bad- thought the two female leads were serviceable. you never really believed anything the supporting actors said though. there were the stereotypes- bible-thumping reverend without a hint of nuance, authoritative captain, hot-headed soldier, etc. i am sorry to say that based on these deficiencies i clocked it straight away as canadian without knowing it to be such-the telefilm canada end credits gave it away. i know i'm a horrible person.<br /><br />maybe i missed something in the beginning but the hostility towards the girls is never explained. here they are besieged in a fort by werewolves and the men are wasting time and energy brutalizing two young women for no reason. focus people. there's a bit more of a pressing situation beyond your walls than whether or not these girls are lesbians-that's just my inference for the hostility directed towards them. if they can aim and fire a gun you might as well make nice with them. the question of their "immortal soul" can be resolved later.<br /><br />also, i guess this relates to the rest of the trilogy, these girls are supposed to be the protagonists? one of them murdered the indian guy at the end that saved one of their lives. i guess one is just a victim of her condition who can't be necessarily blamed for her actions, but the other is just a murderer who doesn't deserve her happy ending.
