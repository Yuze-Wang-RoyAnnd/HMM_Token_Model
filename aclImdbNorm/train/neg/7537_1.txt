and i thought the beach was bad, with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time, nicolas cage. don't blame him for the awful script, if any one can make any sense of what the hell was the point of that movie, give your self a pat on the back. its a cross between the village and a crappier script. its starts off kinda catching your eye, and then as it goes further into the plot, it just makes no sense, and don't get me started about the ending!!!! what was that? the only thing that makes this movie exist is nicolas cage usual great humor, and his ability to be funny in the weirdest situations. if you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch, save yourself five bucks and just go back home and turn put some thing on fire and when some ones asks you why, just say the stupidest thing that comes into your mind, and there you go!
