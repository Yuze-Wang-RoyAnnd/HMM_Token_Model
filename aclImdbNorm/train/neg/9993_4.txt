yeti: curse of the snow demon starts aboard a plane full of american high school teens who are on their way to play a football game in japan, unfortunately during a fierce thunder storm their plane crashes in the himalayas. unlucky really. with some dead & some alive the survivors have to think about themselves & decide to wait it out until help comes. however just when they think their luck couldn't get any worse they soon discover that a huge, hairy yeti type abominable snowman creature wants to kill & eat them all. trapped, cold, starving & fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time?<br /><br />yeah, with a title like yeti: curse of the snow demon it can only mean one thing & that is that someone at the sci-fi channel has made yet another 'creature feature' although to give these things a bit of variety the sci-fi channel here in the uk are now dubbing them as a 'beast feast'! as if that will make any difference. directed by paul ziller one has to say that yeti: curse of the snow deamon is a terrible film but a somewhat entertaining one at the same time, sure it's bad but it's sort of fun at times too. the basic premise is alright actually, it's a sort of cross between alive (1993) with it's plane crash & the survivors having to turn cannibal to survive & the excellent gory killer bigfoot (another legendary hairy monster) exploitation flick night of the demon (1980) which i would defend with my last breath & i have to say it's not exactly a marriage made in heaven but as i said it's fun at times if not exactly gripping or well written. the character's are mostly annoying american teens, there's the expected arguing, there's the macho hero, the strong female & the coward who thinks only of himself so there's no prizes for originality. there are some plot holes too, if a plane load of people crash why only send two rangers on foot to search for them? how are you going to dig a large hole & line it with sharpened sticks in the space of ten minutes? why did the yeti not kill that bird at the end? it had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her? the 'there are actually two yeti's running around' twist isn't used to any effect at all either. at least there's a good pace about the film, it certainly moves along at a fair old pace & i never found myself becoming bored with it. there's some moderately gory action & the film does have some fascination in seeing whether the kids are going to survive or not & if they are going to eat their dead mates or not.<br /><br />the one thing you can always say about these sci-fi channel 'creature features' or 'beast feasts' is that the cgi computer effects will be laugh out loud hilarious & so that proves to be the case yet again. the plane crash at the start looks awful & the yeti when it's cgi looks simply embarrassing jumping all over the place like it's on a pogo stick. there one or two nice gore scenes including a ripped off arm, a squashed head, a ripped out heart, some dead bodies, some blood splatter & the best bit when the yeti rips a guy in half & beats him with his own ripped-off legs before biting a big chunk out of them. according to the imdb the actor playing the yeti took three & a half hours to get into the suit & the make-up which seems like a long time since it's actually a pretty tatty looking creation. apparently the original title was raksha: curse of the snow demon with raksha meaning demon in tibetan sanskrit, so now you know.<br /><br />this has reasonable production values considering the usual sci-fi channel stuff they churn out although the mountain location looks nothing like the harsh, bleak himalayas & was probably situated near some ski resort somewhere & during a lot of the daytime scenes it actually looks pleasantly warm. the acting isn't that good & i didn't think any of the girls looked that good either which didn't help.<br /><br />yeti: curse of the snow demon is another terrible sc-fi channel 'creature feature' if i am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this isn't too bad & there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if it's not very good.
