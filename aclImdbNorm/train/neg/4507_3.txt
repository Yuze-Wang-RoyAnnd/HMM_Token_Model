despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes. where were the japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? not on the payroll apparently. <br /><br />a japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes. in a later conversation she said, "imagine a finnish director making a movie in fnnish about the american civil war using blond swedish actors as union army and frenchmen as the confederates. worse imagine dressing the scarlet o'hara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a 1950's hairdo. maybe some people in finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was "missing the hoop" or recognize the bizarre jane mansfield hair, but in atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears....and be laughing in the aisles...excellent story and photography be damned.<br /><br />so...watching memoirs of a geisha was painful for anyone familiar with japanese cultural nuances, actual geisha or japanese dress, and that was the topic of the movie! hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making. they frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong. i thought "the last samurai" was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on japan could be. memoirs of a geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time.
