tv pilots, don't you love them? quinn martin tried this one out after being successful in a bunch of other tv detective movies, but this one goes nowhere except in the realm of mst where it belongs. roy thinnes is diamond head who takes orders from aunt mary to find super spy lovejoy, i mean tree. zulu and tso-tsing are there for ethnic comic relief and not much else. tree sucks as a bad guy despite all his disguises that makes him look exactly the same as he normally does. there's more unnatural clothing fiber here than you can ever imagine (required in the 1970's)and the show itself is so anti-climatic. why did it not go to series? you figure it out, it's quite blatant. again it's fun for mst, but not a lot else!!
