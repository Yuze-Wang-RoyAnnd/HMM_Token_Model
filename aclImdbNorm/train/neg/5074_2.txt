i saw this movie two weeks ago at the "festival des nouvelles images du japon" in paris. though i wasn't expecting much from it, i have to say i've been disappointed just like many people in the audience... if i wanted to sum up how i felt, i'd say i've been comparing it to princess mononoke and nausicaa from the beginning to the end. of course it's silly. but i couldn't help it. the stories are quite different, but the worlds pictured are very much alike. and from this point of view, "a tree of palme" definitely can't stand the comparison with miyazaki's masterworks. even if it's quite good technically, boredom remains... in the end its complete lack of originality makes me advise you not to care to watch it. i rated it 2 out of 10 (a bit harsh, i guess it deserves 3 or 4)
