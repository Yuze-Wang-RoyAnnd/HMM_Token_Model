this movie is an embarrassment to film-making. i can't believe it was even listed as a comedy - not funny. not only was the script atrocious, but the casting people should be shot. gail o'grady is just a great actress, but beyond that... %99 of the rest of the cast...ouch. pretty much everyone else...wow it is hard to even...wow. here is the number one rule about comedy "don't try to be funny". there are a lot of very talented actors in canada who can do drama and comedy - none of them were used in this film. canadian nepotism and casting directors are helping to perpetuate bad film-making in canada. i realize this is technically a "us" film, but look at the director, actors, location, etc. i just saw this on bravo - they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this film. again, there are a lot of great films out there that can't get airtime and they show this crap.
