did i miss something here? this "adaptation" has everything that brookmyres first novel had. everything apart from the story, the laughs, the black humour, the political intrigue, the characterisations, the plot, and some semblance of sense.<br /><br />spoilers;<br /><br />godamnawful, from beginning to end. they made a mockery of the plot, they had a romance between parablane and a cop, and what was that all about, dr slaughter was portrayed as a bystander, and who the hell was annette crosby supposed to be?<br /><br />it looked like they had made a three hour adaptation, then chopped it down to 90 minutes. (even though the 90 minutes seemed to last forever.) please, please, do not do this to any other of brookmyres books, (especially "country of the blind.)
