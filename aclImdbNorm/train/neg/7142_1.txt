this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. i was going in expecting a cheesy movie but at least with some cool car scenes/races. what i got was nothing. the racing scene are so low budget they sped them up to make it look like the cars are "going fast" in one scene a mercedes slr goes from over 200 to 0 in like 4 seconds by just spinning around in circles. its just ridiculous.<br /><br />if you wanna see a real movie about cars, see the fast and the furious series. they may be a little cheesy, but 100x better than this movie could ever hope to be. better yet just watch mischief 3000, the best car movie ever made i think.
