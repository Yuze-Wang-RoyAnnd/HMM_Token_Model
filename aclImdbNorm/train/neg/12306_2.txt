this film is a pure failure. i am a steve martin fan, but even he can't save the tired idea and swiss cheese script. think "police academy 7" and apply it to a military parody. yuck.<br /><br />i do not feel the other user comments reflected the poor rating this film received (and rightfully deserved!). it is extremely misleading. i have often seen this film marked down to $3.00 in the grocery store and now i certainly know why.<br /><br />if only i could get my 90 minutes back...
