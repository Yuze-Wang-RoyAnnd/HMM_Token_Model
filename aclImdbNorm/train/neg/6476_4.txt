i had such high hopes for this film because i loved the original so much. it seems that disney, however, is trying to perfect the art of crappy straight-to-dvd sequels. they deserve a razzie. several, in fact. i thought the idea had merit, but the music was absolutely awful and the story wasn't much better. what happened to the great music disney used to have in their films. mary poppins, aladdin, beauty and the beast, the lion king...even hercules and the hunchback of notre dame. they've made so many great movies over the years that it's really sad that they've sunk to point of making sequels that aren't even good enough to put in theatres.<br /><br />i hope this movie is not an indication of things to come for the walt disney corporation.
