'sherrybaby' is quite a painful and sordid melodrama set in jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of jail on probe after a drugs-related conviction and fights to stay clean, to find a place for herself in life and especially to win back the love of her kid daughter who is being taken care by her brother's family. the only reason the film is to be watched is maggie gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career, who fits very well in the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders. this is not enough however, as the story line is too simplistic and expected, and the emotional emphasis is put on the wrong place - i kept asking myself all over the picture whether i am supposed to be sorry about the ex and maybe future drug addicted mother as the director and script-writer wanted, or about the innocent kid who is in the middle. even maggie gyllenhaal's acting could not convince me that i should not care more about the kid.
