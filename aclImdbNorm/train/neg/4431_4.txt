this agonizing comedy-drama got surprisingly sterling reviews upon its release in 1979. i remember opening the movie-section of the l.a. times and looking at a 2-page advertisement for "chapter two" filled with glowing captions like: "better than 'the goodbye girl'!" and "neil simon does it again!" what does neil simon do? he takes an autobiographical situation (remarrying too soon after the death of a beloved spouse) and makes it rusty, unpleasant and--worst of all--unfunny. james caan plays neil--er..that is, george--a writer who can't seem to get back into life after losing his wife; enter spirited marsha mason (real-life mrs. simon...soon to be ex-mrs. simon) who attempts to love george despite his moods and general melancholy. mason is very appealing here and might've saved the day were it not for caan's indifference (not to mention a sub-plot concerning painfully-thin, blonde valerie harper which brings the proceedings to a screeching halt). i liked mason's outburst at the end ("i am wonderful! i am nuts about me!"), but i saw no happy ending for these two people...and time proved me right. ** from ****
