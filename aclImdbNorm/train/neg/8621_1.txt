the previous poster obviously worked on the movie. it's a joke how bad it is and no one would review this kind of movie the way he did.mentioning all of the actors' names and what they were in previously is a sure sign that he's involved with it in some way.<br /><br />it's on cinemax right now and i was sure this was some movie where porn stars (the one called ava is gorgeous and well-endowed) were forced to make something else for some crazy tax reason.<br /><br />also, when i first saw it, i was sure it was made in about 1986, and i was born in '73, so i thought i knew what i was talking about...but no...it was made in 1993!! unbelievable!<br /><br />though i would call it one of those so bad it's good movies. like watching a train wreck.
