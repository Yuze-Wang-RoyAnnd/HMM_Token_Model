a film so insecure the creaters perhaps hoped to milk an original film noir classic title, "farewell my lovely", thinking the gullible would assume it a remake. the characters are so foul and unappealing that it deserved its cold reception when first released. time only adds to it its absurdity. having none of the guile, cinematography, desperation or despair of classic noir it relied instead on a convoluted and senseless crime plot that would have easily resulted in several arrests within hours. as if that weren't enough it threw in an utterly sexless attempt at erotica in which at least one of the participants hadn't bothered to bathe in several days. this only made this mess all the more painful to watch. find a good classic forties or fifties film noir instead of wasting two hours on this failure.
