the pakage implies that warren beatty and goldie hawn are pulling off a huge bank robbery, but that's not what i got out of it! i didn't get anything! in the first half there's a new character (without introduction) in every other scene. the first half-hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is just one long, annoying, underlit chase scene. there's always an irritating sound in the background whether it's a loud watch ticking, a blaring siren, a train whistling, or even the horrible score by quincy jones. there are a lot of parts that are laughably bad, too. like, the bad guys chasing beatty on thin ice with a car! or, the police arriving at the scene roughly fifteen times. i really hated this movie!
