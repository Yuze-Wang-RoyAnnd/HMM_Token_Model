a decent sequel, but does not pack the punch of the original. a murderous screenwriter(judd nelson)assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel cabin by the lake. still ruthless killing, but movie seems very tongue-in-cheek. any humor is not of the funny kind. total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times nelson is way over the top. this movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen...this should have happened to this script.
