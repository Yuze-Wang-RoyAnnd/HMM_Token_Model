first of all, i firmly believe that norwegian movies are continually getting better. from the tedious emotional films of the 70's and 80's, movies from this place actually started to contain a bit of humour. imagine.. actual comedies were made! movies were actually starting to get entertaining and funny, as opposed to long, dark, depressing and boring.<br /><br />during the 90's and 00's several really great movies were made by a 'new generation' of filmmakers. movie after movie were praised by critics and played loads of money. it became the norm!<br /><br />then came united...<br /><br />*minor spoilers* it's just simply not funny. not once. not ever. but the thing is... we think its funny. because we're used to norwegian movies to be funny. especially with a cast like this with a few really funny comedians. but.. they neither say nor do anything funny! where's the humor? show me the humor! is it the awkward clerk played by harald eia? is it the overacting totally ridiculously unrealistic football coach? is it the commentaries by arne scheie? the movie is just not funny!<br /><br />but thats not my main rant about united. that namely is the predictability. (and it is here i fear that norwegian comedies have come to a standstill since i have seen this in many other movies as well.) all the time you just know its going to end well. all characters are exactly as they are presented in the start of the movie, and everybody gets exactly what they deserve in the end. there's absolutely no room for surprises at all!<br /><br />all in all i can say that i sat with a bad feeling after seeing this movie. it was the one movie that made me realize that we probably need some new blood in norwegian movie making... again!<br /><br />rating: 1/6
