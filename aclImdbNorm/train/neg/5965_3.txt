in 1454, in france, the sorcerer alaric de marnac (paul naschy) is decapitated and his mistress mabille de lancr'e (helga lin'e) is tortured to death accused of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. before they die, they curse the next generations of their executioners. in the present days (in the 70's), hugo de marnac (paul naschy) and sylvia (betsab'e ruiz) and their friends maurice roland (vic winner) and his beloved paula (cristina suriani) go to a s'eance session, where they evoke the spirit of alaric de marnac. they decide to travel to the villas de sade, a real estate of hugo's family in the countryside, to seek a monastery with a hidden treasure. they find alaric's head and the fiend possesses them, bringing mabille back to life and executing the locals in gore sacrifices. after the death of her father, elvira (emma cohen) recalls that he has the thor's hammer amulet hidden in a well; together with maurice, they try to defeat the demoniac alaric de marnac and mabille.<br /><br />last weekend i bought a box of horror genre with five dvds of paul naschy per us$ 9.98; despite of having no references, i decided to take the chance. the first dvd with the uncut and restored version "horror rises from the tomb" is a trash b (or c) movie that immediately made me recall ed wood. the ridiculous story is disclosed through awful screenplay, direction, performances, cinematography, decoration, special effects and edition and with lots of naked women. the result is simply hilarious and i can guarantee that ed wood's style is back. my vote is three.<br /><br />title (brazil): not available
