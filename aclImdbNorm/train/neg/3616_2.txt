if you merely look at the cover of this movie, it's cool. don't. the movie itself put me to sleep. it was slow paced, had minimal violence and a poor use of suspense. the acting was bottom feeder material and the plot, while it would've been cool for a different movie, was poorly shown here. they even kill the only likeable character in the whole film! i give it a 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was the plot twist at the end. other than that, you might want to save yourself from this movie trash.
