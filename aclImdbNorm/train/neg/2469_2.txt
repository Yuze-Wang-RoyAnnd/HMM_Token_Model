i suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesn't forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show _angel_, you'll enjoy the film. me? all i wanted was a nice, tight little story, and it wasn't there. the pacing was practically backward, plot points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue, and there was absolutely no sense of dread, or tension, or anything.<br /><br />is it the redneck? is it the wendigo? no, it's a cameraman on speed. that's not scary. it doesn't generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you're scared by mtv. like those reviewers before me, i too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the audience.<br /><br />terrible film.
