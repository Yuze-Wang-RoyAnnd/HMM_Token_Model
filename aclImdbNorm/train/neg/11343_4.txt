1st watched 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10(dir-jim kammerud & brian smith): drab and un-spectacular supposed sequel to the original classic animated `101 dalmatians.' yes, the movie continues where it ended in the first one, but the problem is that it plays out much like the original. one of the great things about the original was the pacing of the story, which this one doesn't have. the animation is also very un-spectacular for disney and all we get is the same characters going thru the same kind of story all over again. when is disney going to stop boring us with sequels and re-do's etc.. etc. probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have put out.
