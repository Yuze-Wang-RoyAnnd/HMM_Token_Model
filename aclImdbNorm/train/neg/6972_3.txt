when i first saw the cover of this movie (a giant bug chasing a few nurses) and the name "blue monkey", i knew i wasn't in for any big hollywood movie. i was pleasantly surprised to see steve railsback in this cheese-ball flick, who always does a good job in whatever role he tackles.... the fx are pretty corny, there isn't too much of a plot, and i'm still not sure why this movie is called blue monkey, because there is nothing in this movie to do with monkey. but come on people, what did you expect?? it's not really as bad as it seems.... if you enjoy the old 50's style black and white bug attack movies, this one is basically an updated version, without the updates special fx
