this movie was not made by who fans. most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half-hour tommy medley are simply missed or glossed over: in christmas, they didn't show daltry's screams after the line "tommy doesn't know what day it is...", they showed almost *no* townsend guitar shots in pinball wizard, there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of go to the mirror, and worst of all, in the second half of we're not gonna take it (listening to you), they robbed us of almost every shot of pete's blazing guitar chords. huge chunks of the film are shot from in back of the band. it's a very frustrating film to watch, and doesn't deliver the goods. i don't know if director murry lerner is just not a who fan, or worse, for him at least, if he *is* a who fan and this is all the *eight* cameras could deliver for him. to its credit, there are some rare numbers before tommy, as well as some faves, that are very well shot, and sometimes the editing is brilliant. this might be enough to make some viewers happy, as long as you're not anticipating tommy. the sound overall was mediocre in the transmission i watched from directv; it may be different on video or dvd.
