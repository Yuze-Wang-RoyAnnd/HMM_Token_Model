oh, how we have a misfire here; a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values; character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since d.w. griffith referred to the chinese character in broken blossoms as 'the yellow man'; characters so unimaginative and un-engaging that it's difficult to watch as well as a narrative that plods along at such a slow, stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this film.<br /><br />prizzi's honor is a film that ends up being an absolute post-modern disaster in every which way possible. the film is a messy and senseless disaster that has john huston directing; kathleen turner and jack nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes or supporting characters that weep on a phone now and again or bicker with a main character. prizzi's honor is a film that falls into a genre of neo-noir, comedy, romance, action, gangster and overall crime
