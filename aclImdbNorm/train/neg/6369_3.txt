the only reason i rented this was because of the article in fangoria magazine. the article made this film look interesting. well, it isn't. this was a very boring, amateurishly written and directed movie. all the actors in this movie are awful, except faye dunaway, who is always a joy to watch. but too much time was focused on gina phillips and her ridiculous encounters with ravens and duilio marzio. marzio has such a thick argentinean accent, you can only understand every couple of words he says. also on hand is nicholas pauls, who plays the ultra-bland love interest to gina phillips. the bottom line: this movie is not scary. there is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of the movie. i would have given this one star, but i gave it three just because i like faye dunaway so much. but even she wasn't that great in this.
