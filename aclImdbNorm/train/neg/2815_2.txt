poor robert englund makes another flop and to the expense of tobe hooper who usually makes pretty good horror movies but he failed pretty bad at this one. englund plays the well known marque de sade who in the 17th century was enprisoned for his obsession of pain and the pleasure of bringing pain upon himself as well as watching others also be in pain. the story is so confusing with the flip flop from one century to another and i became confused as to what was going on and what was the purpose of this movie. all i saw was a young lady that became entrapped by a strange lesbian who desides to keep her to herself and the young lady became fascinated by this arabian with alot of money and finds out that he's out to have her killed and then englund steps in from one century to another claiming to be a descendent of the de sade and tries to kill her because she reminded him of the madam momoselle(spelled that wrong) or whoever it was in the picture above de sades wall. the movie was terrible, i am surprised at hooper for hireing englund in this film and the special effects were so fake and laughable, especially the part about the eyes. englund tries to make a comeback from his once hit move "nightmare on elm st." by using these pull in and out needles to put out peoples eyes. terrible, absolutely terrible.
