interesting? hardly. the 'scientific evidence' the movie provides for its point (which is basicly that jews are a cancer) is so stupid and lame, it's almost laughable (if we didn't know what happened in that era).<br /><br />important? nah. i can't imagine germans (even at that horrid time) would like or believe this movie. compare it to riefenstahl's triumf des willens. now that was i movie i was impressed with. this is just silly garbage.<br /><br />'best' part is a scene from m (one of my all-time favorites) where (the jew, as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us) lorre plays a child-molester and murderer. in the eyes of these film-makers, only a depraved mind can do so. uh-huh. didn't know m was hitler's favorite movie, right?<br /><br />no, it's just plain stupid. even for it's nazi-propaganda genre. 2/10.
