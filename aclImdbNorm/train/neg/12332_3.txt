the film looks super on paper. a romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic cross-breeding gold, especially with this excellent romcomic cast.<br /><br />i'm afraid lawrence kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they duly go and hang themselves. adam brooks' script may well be to blame but you'd expect better from the kevin kline of a fish called wanda. instead the two ping-pong off one another and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason either of them are in and dashing around france.<br /><br />jean reno co-stars amiably as the cop-with-a-heart and i guess wishes he was a star-with-a-part. mind you he went on to do those pink panther remake(s!) so perhaps he was ok with this... 3/10
