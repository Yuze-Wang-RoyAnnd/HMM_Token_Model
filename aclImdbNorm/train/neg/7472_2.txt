this show seemed to be kinda good. kyra sedgwick is an ok actress and i like police series, but somewhere in the production this program went awfully wrong. <br /><br />first of all, the writers should have more suspects than one, you know who did it every time!!!!! that makes it boring. the main character is unbelievably annoying and its not believable in any way. i know they wanted her to be tough, but shes mean, stupid and a bad chief. the crimes are uninteresting and bland, and its just lame all the way. as stated above, i hate it.... <br /><br />all in all, this was a big disappointment and very bad indeed...
