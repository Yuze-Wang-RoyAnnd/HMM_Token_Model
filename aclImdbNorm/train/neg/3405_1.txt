i cannot believe how uneducated this movie is. it's like watching police academy, except it's with people that have no clue of what they are talking about, and...wait, there is a stupid robot that is supposed to be a sidekick. i can understand suspension of disbelief, but this is just complete stupidity. not only is there no plot to this movie. it's like watching someone that pretends to be a doctor, throw non-medical words around as if they were chief of staff at a major medical facility. plus the people are wearing clothes that are un-befitting for a space program. i feel like i'm watching a valley-girls "b" movie, in space.
