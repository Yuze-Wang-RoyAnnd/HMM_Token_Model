very dull, obvious, tedious exorcist rip-off featuring a doberman with red eyes - that's the extent of the special effects in this made-for-tv cheapie. richard crenna is about as animate as a chew toy. very 70's dress & music only add to the torture. should put you to sleep almost as fast as "the corpse vanishes", or "the blue hand". practically worthless. moocow says eaghhh what a stinky dog! :=8p
