this could be a strong candidate for "the worst flick ever". perhaps without the presence of john hurt, it could be tolerated as a kid-film. however, the tragedy of this entire endeavor, is that john hurt, one of the screen's greatest actors, diminishes himself in this....i gave it two points just because mr. hurt showed up...i take away 8 points, because he didn't run from it fast enough. as far as the rest of the cast, they are, simply, terrible. janine turner, as pretty as she might be, cannot act to save her soul. and the lead actor is, for all intents and purposes, awful. if you can spare yourself this embarrassment, please do so. it's so bad, it almost hurts.
