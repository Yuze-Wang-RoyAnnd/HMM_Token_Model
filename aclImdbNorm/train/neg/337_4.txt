well, what's to say. the golden child falls in the category "so bad, it's good". eddie murphy is having some funny (and sometimes quite annoying lines), but you are still entertained. chales dance has never been worse than his role as the villain sardo numspa (what a f***ed up name is this??).<br /><br />who should watch the golden child... hm... difficult to say, but my best guess would be people who likes embarrassing movies and can be entertained by bad acting, bad plot and an even more embarrassing dialog.<br /><br />4 out of 10
