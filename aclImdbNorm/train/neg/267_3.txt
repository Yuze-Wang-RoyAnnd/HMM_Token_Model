the episodic version of robert heinlein's starship troopers plays out at a deathly slow pace, following johnny rico leaving his parents, the (not very attractive) girl he lusts for, and joining the mobile infantry. the aliens in the show are nothing like the barbaric bugs from the film, instead being squid-like monsters that shoot lasers out of their mouths.<br /><br />throughout watching this version, i was continually amazed at just how fruity they've managed to make the whole thing. the show is concerned mostly with the relationships between the recruits, and the aching, prolonged gazes they give each other through their battle armour visors, with 80s synth pop sometimes arriving *during* the sparse battle sequences which at last turning up in the final few episodes. in terms of construction, it owes a debt to top gun, sharing much in terms of pacing and content (and all that implies).
