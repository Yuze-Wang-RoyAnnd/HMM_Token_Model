unless you're twelve, this movie really isn't worth it. it's obviously a low-budget film with b actors, and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense cgi work that's not good. i knew it would be bad when i rented it. i enjoy laughing at bad movies. i didn't know how bad though. it's bearable, until after hour 2, then it really starts to burn. fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics, and wire-fighting. there's no real explanation for the transitions. it has a plot, but once again, it's obviously a kid's movie. it seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed, like sesame street or something. it's bearable. but much better if you're, say, nine.
