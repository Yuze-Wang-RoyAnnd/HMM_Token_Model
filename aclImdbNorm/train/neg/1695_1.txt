ok when i saw the previews for this movie i thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group i was with. now living in america especially during this election i see some very deceiving things but i have to say these previews were towards the top of list. i don't see how so many people could be scared by this movie. i only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one. the whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me. as for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of i thought they were comical at best. oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why? the worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird groaning. how does that scare someone? i can make that noise easily. now don't get me wrong i have always loved all those really bad scary movies that your just laughing the whole way through but i didn't even think this one had that going for it it was just plain out bad.
