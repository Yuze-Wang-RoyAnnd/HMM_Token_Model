i was so excited and hyped up about watching this film when the promos first came out in november! it looked awesome and the songs! i was quite disappointed when i went to watch it! this is a film which weaves 6 couples together. it has a multi cast of 12 people! a huge amount of stars have worked on this film. i think the director, nikhil advani, has not managed the situation well and should not have had many people in this movie as this would of made it easier for him. compared to nikhil's directorial debut 'kal ho naa ho' , 'salaam-e-ishq' falls quite behind. i think nikhil should have a smaller star cast. i think the best factors of this film is the songs! the songs are excellent and i think that all of the songs are awesome, shankar-ehsaan-loy done an excellent job and have done an excellent jobs over the years. i think the ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs! one thing i was disappointed with, is that the director should not have included nudity in this film which is done by sohail khan and isha koppikar. i found this extremely rude watching this with family! although, some may find this nude as comedy, it is not something you would want to watch with parents! i think the best acting was performed by salman and priyanka overall, i think its an alright movie!
