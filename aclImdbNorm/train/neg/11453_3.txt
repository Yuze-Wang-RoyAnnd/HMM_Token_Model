this movie is one of the worst comedy movies i have ever seen. i hate these napoleon dynamite rip-offs. just face it people the dumb humor has been mastered already. make something new for once. all these new comedies are just horrible. and coming out of snl andy samberg is not ready for a lead role yet. i hope he can bounce back from this awful movie. and will arnetts character is just plain bad. hey will, did you read the script. the plot is truly the worst ever written. now you tell me if this is weird. (this is the movie) rod kimble's step dad frank is dying and the family needs $50,000 to pay for the heart surgery so rod is planning this huge jump to raise money for frank. only so that rod can beat frank in a fight and prove his manliness. yes thats the movie, you tell me, would u spend $7.00 to see that piece of crap!<br /><br />3/10 just horrible<br /><br />-adam
