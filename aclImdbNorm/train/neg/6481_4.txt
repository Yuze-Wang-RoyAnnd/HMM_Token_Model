since the little mermaid was one of my favorite disney movies when i was little, i was curious about its sequel.<br /><br />the little mermaid(one) is a classic animated feature with top quality everything, a grand music score, and targets a general audience. in contrast, the little mermaid 2 is targeted primarily at young children, because it is spontaneous, reflects a child's self perspective, the music is bouncier and less dramatic, and the ending feels like recess.<br /><br />the little mermaid 2 starts out when baby melody is presented to ariel's side of the family. abruptly without any visual cues to aid the drama, a giant tentacle grabs the baby. i laughed, wait a minute it's not funny, the baby's being attacked! okay, i'll stop laughing. morgana's crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity, takes away potential drama since it happened so quickly.<br /><br />throughout the feature, melody seems superhuman, which i defend is how most children envision themselves. this quality in melody's character is clearly brought out toward the end when she fights morgana without an inch of fear on her face.<br /><br />like the first movie, melody has a lot of ariel's problems, except the reverse. queen ariel turns out to be like her father by restricting her from the ocean, whereas king triton restricted ariel from the surface. ariel and melody both rebel against their parent.<br /><br />the music is more emotionally moving in the first. this sequel has a bunch of songs, but not as much orchestral work went into it. it's great for little ones, because it doesn't take an orchestra to impress them.<br /><br />the ending in the first movie was strong and uplifting. the sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone playing in the water. it's definitely more targeted at kids, because instead of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away, this ending leaves you thinking, "it's time for recess!" ultimately, this movie is fun for kids, so we should let them have fun.
