i have never seen the 1973, older highly rated version. i am a nicholas cage fan (by the way, fine acting as usual). this movie probably took all of five minutes to hammer out the whole plot (i can see it being done on a cocktail napkin at a dinner party), if you can't figure out the ending of this drool in the first thirty minutes you will probably find this movie entertaining. this is, of late, the terrible rut that hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the horror/mystery/thriller genre, unable to give the audience enough credit and write a fresh, smart, and tantalizing screenplay, they dish out some creepy music and throw in a couple of things to make you jump a little and then send the final print off to your local theater. at least, it didn't have the jiggling hand-held camera syndrome.
