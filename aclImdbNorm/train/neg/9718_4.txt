an innocent man (steve guttenberg) has a one-night stand with his boss's wife (isabelle huppert). she spots a woman (elizabeth mcgovern) being attacked outside but she can't call the cops because it would blow her marriage to gutenberg's boss (paul shenar). so guttenberg, honest citizen that he is, when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed nearby only half an hour later, comes forward and claims to have witnessed the first attack, merely intending to pass on the information given to him by huppert. well -- never bear false witness against thy neighbor, as they say.<br /><br />this simple attempt to help the police nab a murderer turns rapidly twisted. when he meets the first near-victim, mcgovern, she immediately twigs to what happened, but agrees to keep quiet for the moment. but then guttenberg finds himself in court, supposed to identify the heavy (greenquist) and we discover through cross-examination that he is near-sighted and can't identify objects at a distance, let alone faces. (not that it matters because, after all, he never saw the creep in the first place.) the plot gets practically labyrinthine. guttenberg winds up the chief suspect when huppert is murdered too.<br /><br />he barely escapes arrest and holes up with the now-sympathetic mcgovern. guttenberg and mcgovern hatch a plan to trap the murderer. she will serve as bait. they'll follow the flagitious creep into one of his seedy haunt and mcgovern will act like the doxy that the murderer is attracted to, just to get him to try to kill her. but everything will be okay, see, because not only will guttenberg keep a close watch on her, and not only will he alert the police a few minutes after she enters this dive, but she will keep a can of mace handy -- just in case.<br /><br />i ask you, the alert viewer, does this scenario unfold as planned? elizabeth mcgovern has a quirkily interesting bone structure. she seems all mandible and tiny mouth at times, but she's vibrant. steve guttenberg has hair on his brawn and that's about it. otherwise he's as helpless as the character he plays. if isabelle huppert can act, it isn't evident in this film. the killer is so formed and so groomed that he looks like he's wearing one of those masks of deformity in that twilight zone episode about greedy heirs.<br /><br />didn't the director, curtis hanson, go on to make "l.a. confidential"? that was a nicely done piece of work. here, everything seems clumsy and contrived, down to the small bit parts. just before the inevitable violent climax, a uniformed police officer is introduced to delay mcgovern's rescue, and the scene is embarrassing to watch. dick olsen has a bit part as a late shopper. he's a neat guy and always reliable. paul shenar as the cuckolded hubby has a striking face that seems made for the stage and he does a fine job too.<br /><br />that louche joint where mcgovern attracts the attention of the murderer, where she plays pool with a couple of hairy apes, was shot at a bar in carolina beach, in north carolina, not far from where i lived. the way the interior is set up, it's clear that this is supposed to be a dangerous and dirty dive. actually it appears rather more elegant on screen than it did in reality.<br /><br />overall, this is hitchcock territory and it brings tears to the eyes to imagine what he would have done with this story.
