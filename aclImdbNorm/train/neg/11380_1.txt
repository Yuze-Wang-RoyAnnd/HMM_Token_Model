when i first watched robotboy, i found it fresh and interesting, but then i noticed, that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself, what is good/bad. episodes became predictable. and main characters are not interesting. again we see a hyper-smart boy, beaten by his older brother, parents who don't understand their kid, and his friends: girl and fat boy. also this show has no logic. a super-modern robot who works on two aa-size batteries, and can use a lot of weapons. but the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super-activated modes. we see two different robots, and it declines main idea of the show: "robot must learn how to behave himself in human society"
