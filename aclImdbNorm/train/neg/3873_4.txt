alicia silverstone (pre-"clueless") plays a modern-day crime-obsessed teenager attempting to solve the brutal slaying of a local girl. pat verducci wrote and directed this b-flick, which isn't especially well-made but is however surprisingly serious-minded in regards to its leading character. silverstone is appealing and successful in carving out an interesting young woman here, despite the picture's kitschy undermining. the supporting cast (including kevin dillon and michael bowen) isn't bad, though the violence in the last act goes overboard. not a cheesy camp-fest, but nothing exceptionally memorable either. *1/2 from ****
