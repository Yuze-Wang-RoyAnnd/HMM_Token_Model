take "rambo," mix in some "miami vice," slice the budget about 80%, and you've got something that a few ten-year-old boys could come up with if they have a big enough backyard & too much access to "penthouse." cop and ex-commando mcbain (busey, and with a name like mcbain, you know he's as gritty as they come) is recruited to retrieve an american supertank that has been stolen & hidden in mexico. captured with the tank were hardbitten sgt. major o'rourke (jones) & mcbain's former love devon (fluegel), the officer in command & now meat for the depraved terrorists/spies/drug peddlers, who have no sense of decency, blah, blah, blah. for an action movie with depraved sex, there's a dearth of action and not much sex. the running joke is that mcbain gets shot all the time & survives, keeping the bullets as souvenirs. apparently the writers didn't see "the magnificent seven" ("the man for us is the one who gave him that face"), nor thought to give mcbain even a pretense of intelligence. even for a budget actioner, the production values are poor, with distant shots during dialog and very little movement. the main prop, the tank, is silly enough for an ed wood production. fluegel, who might have been a blonde julia roberts (she had a far bigger role in "crime story" than julia!) has to go from simpering to frightened to butt-kicking & back again on an instant's notice. jones, who's been in an amazing array of films, pretty much hits bottom right here. both he & busey were probably just out for some easy money & a couple of laughs. look for talented, future character actor danny trejo ("heat," "once upon a time in mexico") in a stereotyped, menacing bit part. much too dull even for a guilty pleasure, "bulletproof" is still noisy enough to play when you leave your house but want people to think there's someone home.
