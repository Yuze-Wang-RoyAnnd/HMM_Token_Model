the complaints are valid, to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women. i am okay with these night time soaps, like grey's anatomy, or ugly betty, or west wing, because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end. however, when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men (taye diggs, tim daly, and chris lowell) into sexual tension and romps, and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital, it seems like general hospital...or a female counterpart to baywatch. that was what men wanted and they had it, so if this is what women want so be it, but the idea that this is a high brow show (or something men will watch) is unrealistic.
