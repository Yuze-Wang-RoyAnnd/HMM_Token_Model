tv does influence society...just look at the surge in popularity of cappucino shops after this shallow little piece of work debuted. besides, real people who look as good as these people do don't have any problems.<br /><br />besides, does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a nice manhattan loft considering what they do for a living? nbc just loves to insult the viewer's intelligence, even if they're just around gump's level. i know a person who makes $100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment in manhattan that costs $2200 a month in rent. <br /><br />i'd like to see a show called phriends, where it's six ugly nobodies in dead-end jobs, living in a crummy neighborhood where sirens constantly wail and someone gets mugged every week...and then the landlord jacks up the rent. now that i would watch.
