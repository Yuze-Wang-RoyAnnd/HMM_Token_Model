i saw this movie a few days ago... what the hell was that?<br /><br />i like movies with brian o'halloran, they are funny and enjoyable. when i saw a name of this title and genre i thought great, this one could be really good... some parody for slashers or another gore movies... but.. then i read a preview and thought right it could be good anyway... but it wasn't...<br /><br />my opinion: if like movies they look little bit like documentary, with little bit of comedy try some moore's movies or alien autopsy, they are really about something. this one was empty. <br /><br />and put a comedy to title... no comment... really bad joke
