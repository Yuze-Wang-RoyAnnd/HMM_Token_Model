this film is to the f.b.i.'s history as knott's berry farm is to the old west. shamelessly sanitized version of the federal bureau of investigation fight against crime. hoover's heavy hand (did he have any other kind?) shows throughout with teevee quality script-reading actors, cheesy sets, cheap sound effects and lighting 101. with jimmy stewart at 20% of dramatic capacity, vera miles chewing the scenery, the film features every c-lister known in the mid-fifties with nary a hint of irony or humor, from the 'amazon jungle' to the 'back yard barbecue', everything reeks of sound stages and back lots. even the gunshots are canned and familiar. i imagine mervyn leroy got drunk every night. except for a few (very few) interesting exterior establishing shots, nothing here of note beyond a curio.
