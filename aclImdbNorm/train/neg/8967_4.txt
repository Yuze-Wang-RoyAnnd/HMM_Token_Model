follows the same path as most sequels. first one was great. second was average and this one, full of bad acting and some stupid dialog and well as a lot of suspension of disbelief, this movie was weak.<br /><br />too predictable and i just couldn't stand that henry wrinkler-like boss with that stupid eye, there was so much more they could have done with this. i liked the first one a lot. i wish they would have went more down those lines, rather than what they did here.<br /><br />there was too much unexplained that needed to be explained, what time period this was in and why why why is there an old fashioned phone in that room?<br /><br />i understand there is another one in the works. <br /><br />blah!
