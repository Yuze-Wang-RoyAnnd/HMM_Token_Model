this movie was like "the disney channel after dark." take out the "aren't we naughty" language and themes and you are left with dialogue and plot devices that insult the intelligence of anyone who doesn't describe "saved by the bell" as quality television. the dialogue so laughably cliched and knowingly dirty, one might think the screenplay was the product of locking aaron spelling and joe eszterhas in a room with orders to produce an amalgam of every bad script each had ever had a hand in creating. if that was roger kumble's intention, mission accomplished.
