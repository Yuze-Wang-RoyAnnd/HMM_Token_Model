"loonatics unleashed " is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters created by chuck jones . the "loony tunes" have many spin -offs and different versions , some were good ,others not very much .but "loonatics " it's the worst .the concept is stupid and derivative of shows as "the power rangers " and "teen titans " . there wasn't any similarity with the original characters and the stories are boring and poorly made . the new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic . this show just doesn't work .this horrible waste of animation is a complete failure and this shouldn't have be nothing more than a bad joke . lame ! zero stars
