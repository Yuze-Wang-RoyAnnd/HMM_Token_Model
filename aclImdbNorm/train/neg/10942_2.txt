lorenzo lamas stars as jack `solider` kelly an ex-vietnam vet and a renegade cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from backwoods rednecks. atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that ron palillo is third billed, and yet has 3 minutes of screen time, and even those aren't any good. overall a terrible movie, but the scenes with lorenzo lamas and josie bell hanging from a tree bagged and gagged are worth a few (unintentional) laughs. followed by an improved sequel.
