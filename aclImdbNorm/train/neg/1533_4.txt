i won't spend a lot of time nor energy on this comment. i just want to add it because all the comments were so positive i felt like i just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled, let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt at creating a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma. some scenes seemed promising, playing with visual dimensions, but couldn't hold up the rest. i felt like i was stoned for the first time again, having semi-philosophical conversations with fellow adolescents.<br /><br />what a futile attempt to raise dutch cinema to new heights. i'd rather watch jesus is een palestijn, without all the pretentions and with straight forward humor, also raising questions about life and the realities we create for ourselves.<br /><br />gert de graff is not jean-luc godard or tarkovsky and appearantly never will be.
