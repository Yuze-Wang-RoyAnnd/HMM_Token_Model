well i'll start with the good points. the movie was only 86 minutes long, and some of it was so bad it was funny. now for the low points. my first warning sign came with an actual "warning" on the film. when it started the following "warning" was displayed: "the film you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images. because contrary to popular belief being killed is neither fun, pretty or romantic." i should have saved myself the 86 minutes and turned it off then. the first words of the film were: "i'm at the glue factory." it was some guy talking on his phone, and he was referring to a nursing home as a glue factory. i don't know why. so the basis of the movie is some kid is obsessed with the zodiac killer and starts imitating him. the budget for this film was at least 50 bucks and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find. the acting was worse than me reading straight from a script. that's what is looked like they were doing. the script was horrible, and the big "twist" was that this guy who wrote a biography on the zodiac killer was actually the zodiac killer. of course they tried to show this subtly but made it totally obvious within the first 10 minutes. without any more painful details of the plot, here were some horrible highlights of the movie. they try to make the zodiac killer compare himself to an "army of one" because soldiers are really just murderers. then they tried to make an attempt at "satanic worship" by showing some guys in black hoods in a meeting. the great "computer hacker" was able to get this kid's address when someone gave him the kid's name and phone number. for some reason he had to hack into the fbi to get someone address. i'm not sure why he didn't just look it up in the phone book or use whitepages.com. there was also a random allusion to 9/11 for no reason. i also learned that no matter where you get shot, blood will come out of your mouth within seconds.<br /><br />so if you like really bad acting, sub-par scripts, bad camera work and an obvious plot, you'll love zodiac killer!
