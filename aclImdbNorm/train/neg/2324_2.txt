i agree with other users comments in that the two main roles were well acted, that being the guy that played gary gillmore and giovanni's role. too bad the story was so boring. not hearing about the story i knew nothing of gary gillmore before the movie so i didn't know what to expect. i thought it would be something like dead man walking or the chamber but how wrong i was. the whole movie was just talking, talking and talking about their mom and dad. the only cool scenes were the flashbacks where the dad would lose his temper. that was the only interest i got from this borefest.
