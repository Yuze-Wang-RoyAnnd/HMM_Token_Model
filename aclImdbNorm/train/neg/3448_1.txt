i checked this movie out when it still had 6 votes and it said like 7.2 or something, but seriously this is a horrible movie. lets break it down. the first thing you notice about this movie is that it was filmed on a hand-held digital camera owned by a freshman at a community college. the next thing you'll notice is that the actors, are all friends of said freshman (he probably met them at the pub the night before. third on the list you will notice that the musical editing is horrible, and they try to cram many songs into this movie, at 30 second intervals... also all digital editing is done on said freshman's home pc... probably using windows movie maker. this movie was horrible... pretentious, had an undeniably bad script, and acting that followed suit. i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone i know, but i do sentence the writer and director to watch this movie in hell for an eternity.
