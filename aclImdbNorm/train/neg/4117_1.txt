two days after seeing this thing, i'm still in agony over having seen it. it's so bad, you have to wonder how anyone could write this tripe, much less allow it to be loose on the general public. stilted acting, a leading man who looks like he's sleepwalking, and alison eastwood embarrassing herself. the action is indicative of low budget movie making, which means it is painfully bad. the plot? well, if you were 6 years old, then you could have written this movie. simplistic, idealistic, and just plain lame.
