a cast of 1980's tv movie and tv series guest stars (misty rowe, pamela hemsley,clevon little, seymour cassel among several others)in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models. of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of complications.<br /><br />over done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an r rating but not enough good material to engender any real interest. this is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel cinemax the alternate name of skinamax. i really can't see the point of watching this unless you need to see every sleazy thriller out there. (i also have to comment that this film is filled with smoking, to the point that it becomes laughable when anyone lights up)
