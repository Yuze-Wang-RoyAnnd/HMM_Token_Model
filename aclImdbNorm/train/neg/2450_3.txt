i watched peter jackson version of lord of the rings when i was half way through reading the two towers and i thought it was absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />at this time the animated version of the lord of the rings was released on dvd but i told myself that i will finish reading the two towers and return of kings before watching it (as i thought it showed the whole of the trilogy).<br /><br />so when i did finish the trilogy i went and brought the dvd, which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely rubbish.<br /><br />i was acturly bored 20 minutes in to it which was really strange because i love the book and i am shooked that the maker of this film could of even thought of fitting at least 1 and a half of the books in to a 2 hour 8 minute film.<br /><br />none of the characters had any emotions when they were talking and they seemed to be reading it of a page, even my favourite character who is gandalf did not seem interesting at all. <br /><br />the animation was the only okay in parts of the film except for the orks (they looked awful) and aragorn and sam face.<br /><br />i don't know way this film was released because there was not even a proper ending, but maybe it was good that the maker ran out of money because the film couldn't of got any better. <br /><br />i just hope that nobody judges the books by this film.<br /><br />3/10
