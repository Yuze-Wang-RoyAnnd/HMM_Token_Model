man, what the hell were the people who made this film on? and more importantly where can i get some? the opening scene sets the tone for the film: a woman writhing naked in a circle of fire, transforming into a werewolf. and this is no rick baker 'american werewolf' transformation, folks. we're talking some of the worst makeup ever captured on film here. i can just imagine some stoned italian spreading glue on naked annik borel (who plays daniela, the film's protagoness (is that a word?)), and asking her to roll in fur. that's how bad it is.<br /><br />from here on in it doesn't get much better. minutes are wasted as the scenery chewing male actors waffle on about daniela and her condition or something (i can't remember, but the dialogue is so bad if you don't laugh at it you'll cry).<br /><br />the funny thing is daniela isn't even a werewolf, she's a psycho who goes mental whenever there is a man around (understandable, as she was raped as a child) so she thinks she becomes a werewolf like her ancestor (the opening scene). she can't help but tear out the throat of every man she meets, and she only wants to be loved! things start looking up for daniela as she meets and falls in love with a buff stuntman who doesn't trigger her 'episodes'. check out the montage here, one of the cheesiest you'll ever see (laughing and hugging after diving headfirst through a window).<br /><br />daniela's luck doesn't hold out as the film takes a brutal turn, she is suddenly viciously beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the stuntman. reminiscent of "i spit on your grave", daniela extracts bloody vengeance on her rapists.<br /><br />this is 100 minutes of my life i will never get back. but hey, that's the game you play when you're a film geek.
