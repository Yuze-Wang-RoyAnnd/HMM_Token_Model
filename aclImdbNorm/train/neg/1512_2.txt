a bad rip-off attempt on "seven", complete with sub-second-grade acting, awful camera work, half-baked story and strong aftertaste of lame propaganda. yeah, them "sex offenders", they live next door and you're gonna get raped, really.<br /><br />no surprises from the vice-terminatrix woman, she acts as always -- as convincingly as a piece of wood. richard gere keeps on sliding lower and lower -- and is about as low here as a late steven seagal.<br /><br />the singer woman with the crazy eyes is best when she's dead in bed; and even the wolf was sub-par (although she was the best performer in the movie) -- maybe they fed her before the shots, or something.<br /><br />unlike "seven", which had a (made up, but interesting) story, to which one could relate more or less regardless of the country, this movie seems to focus on a us-only obsession. if one doesn't care much about "sex offenders" -- and the statistics are that lack of exercise and bad diet cause more pain, suffering and death -- there is little reason to see it, or to be afraid.<br /><br />there are some body part fetishes and some snuff, but the gore is less then mediocre, and fails both as artistic device (because it is pointless) and as gore, because it is not gory enough.<br /><br />don't waste time on this one.
