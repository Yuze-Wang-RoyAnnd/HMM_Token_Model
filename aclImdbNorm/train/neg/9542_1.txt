i don't know what else to say about this horrible movie that hasn't already been said. honestly i have only myself to be angry with. i should have know better when i saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap, but i loved war games so i indulged my whim. i will live to regret that decision the rest of my life. from the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game i knew i was in for a ride though the land-that-good-writing-forgot. the list of very, very, very bad plot lines, dialog, and acting is so long i would crash imdb if i tried to post it. to those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me. i am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung.
