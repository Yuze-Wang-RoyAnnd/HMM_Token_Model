if i only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor, enough film for only one take of each shot, and then lost all that film and had to scrounge up some bucks to buy a few digital video tapes, and was forced to make an over-2-hour movie about the french revolution, and also didn't have any sets and had to have my 4-year-old autistic son paint the backgrounds, and also the only actors i could find were the people who didn't make the auditions of that year's soap opera, and i was also forced to not use any music in the entire film, and also the zoom function on the camera didn't work except for one time when it accidentally started zooming in and couldn't stop, oh and if i hated my audience, then i might make something kind of like this awful, yet mistakenly hilarious, hell-worthy waste of time. the almost grand looking but completely fake looking backdrops reminded me of some of george lucas' latest creations, which made it so much more disappointing because through the whole movie, there was that little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the film would climax in a lightsaber duel/space laser battle. i don't mean to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, but that's not how it ends. the only thing i can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review. peace.
