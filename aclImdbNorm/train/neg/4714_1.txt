i want so badly to give this piece of garbage a zero, unfortunately, there isn't, so, i had to give it a 1 just to warn you about how stupidly terrible this imposter of a familiar cartoon really is! the characters look like they were drawn by pre-schoolers, no, wait, i've seen pre-schoolers do better! i prefer "misadventures of flapjack" to this terrible excuse for a cartoon! i'm probably saying what others have said, two words: rip off!! remember that episode of dexter's lab when they raced go-karts down that volcano? yeah, mister fellows even cashed in on that idea and failed! they even ripped off shadow lugia in that one episode that parodied pokemon!(he even cashed in on that franchise!) that one character is a cheap rip off of mandark from dexter's lab! mister fellows needs to be sued for statutory infringement for this piece of crap!! everyone has their own opinion, but those of you who like johnny (rip-off) test, your'e just lying to yourselves. do yourself a favor, change the channel when this rip off tries to disgrace your screen!
