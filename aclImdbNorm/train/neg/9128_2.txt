even if one didn't realize that sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and passed away before the film's release, the fiendish plot of dr. fu manchu would be painful viewing. it is supposedly a lampoon of sax rohmer's famous oriental villain but it lacks any focus. the potential for satirical commentary on the anti-oriental overtones of rohmer's concept are ignored. indeed, the movie employs racist insults. there are hardly any actual jokes or gags, just mostly actors behaving idiotically and spouting dreary lines. it is especially distressing to see sid caesar forced to spout curses and racial slurs for attempted laughs. most of the other actors embarrass themselves as well.<br /><br />and then there's peter sellers. he plays the dual roles of the sinister fu manchu, who is trying to concoct a formula to regain his youth and his stalwart british foe nayland smith. sellers isn't one hundred per cent bad; he conveys a quirky warmth as smith when he discusses his fetishistic attachment to his lawn mower and he's oddly moving as manchu when he expresses his love for english music hall entertainment. but most of the time, he plays both roles with a weary grimness, thus further sabotaging any comical possibilities. sellers' routines where he revitalizes his fading strength with electric shocks are particularly excruciating; he seems too convincingly agonized to be funny. <br /><br />a few genuinely witty lines, an apt slapstick bit by burt kwouk (cato in the pink panther films) as one of manchu's minions, and helen mirren's amusing musical numbers cannot salvage this mess. if anyone wants to understand why peter sellers is considered a comedic genius, they won't learn anything from the fiendish plot of dr. fu manchu.
