i jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted, remembering rahs and raves for it. but wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary, it backed off and went somewhere else. the dripping water throughout the house, the black rain, the prophetic dreams, taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream.<br /><br />what a disappointment. chamberlain's nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief, something i found myself mirroring as the film wore on. what could have been eerie aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one's head. the ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods, that the aboriginal peoples believe red-haired white men were the first priests, and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension (the dream time).<br /><br />[spoiler] in the final scene, it wasn't clear to me what the director was trying to tell. is there a big wave? so what? how big? a tsunami? yeah, okay. that's devastating but not apocalyptic. is it the end of the world? from a wave? the last wave? that'd have to be a pretty darn big wave. why? was the world that bad a place? it didn't seem so awful in this movie. actually i didn't think the wave came off, since the shadow left burton's face that had been cast by the wave. was it only burton's apocalypse? heck, that happens every day to people who lose it. it wasn't of any interest if it was only him.<br /><br />the most frightening scene, and the one that gives the best indication of weir's potential, was in charlie's apartment where burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring burton's wife. charlie keeps asking him "who are you?" and it becomes truly disturbing after a while. unfortunately, the movie never followed suit.
