ostensibly a film that predicts the coming trends in british popular music, it's wrong on so many fronts that it's laughable. tommy quickly? the honeycombs? the movie does include a song by the spencer davis group, two by the animals, and one tacked on live film of the beatles doing their live version of twist and shout (all 1:20). but all in all, an awkward display of british music circa 1964. oh, and herman's hermits.
