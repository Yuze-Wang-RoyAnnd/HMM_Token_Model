i love alec guinness. and that's saying a lot after this film. actually, he is not bad in it. he just seems to stand aside, be urbane and his usual delightful self, but invest nada. it is obvious the girl he is matched with is a featherweight, even as an inexperienced young french girl. sir alec wouldn't have chosen her when he was young and very obviously isn't too happy about it now.<br /><br />the interesting character is the brooding brother of the odd "suzanne", another twit. "donald" aspires to be a french heathcliffe and i waited in vain for the source of his mystery. what deep dark secret was he hiding behind that forehead? was he in love with the father's mistress? why did he jerk suzanne's hair when she plotted to bring the disparate parts of this turkey together on the country estate? or perhaps he had simply had enough of her obnoxious acting.<br /><br />the film would have been charming with guiness and the "older woman" reminiscing and seeing paris together. that would have been a great story! two lovely experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of world war ii. why didn't somebody come up with that? i suggest watching alec guiness in "the card", a little known but worthwhile film.
