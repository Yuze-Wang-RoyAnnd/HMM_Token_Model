a young basketball-playing professor of genetics is doing research on the genetic sequence, using human fetuses. he hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging. he's pressured into concluding his research because he hasn't published, so the university is having trouble justifying funding him (i think).<br /><br />he does a trial injection on a monkey, which quickly dies. he then tries it on himself. he starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy; she's the one who had been demanding results from the research.<br /><br />initially, he seems to have no effects from the injection, except some new strength. he then realizes that he had some memory loss, and starts recalling what happened. additionally, he starts to appear very unhealthy.<br /><br />since the movie is named metamorphosis, he does eventually change into something else. you won't believe your eyes - either what he turned into, or the absolutely crappy costume the actor is wearing to depict what he's turned into. incredibly, there's a further change in store - the end of the movie is really, really absurd.<br /><br />about the only thing this movie has going for it is that laura gemser is in it, but she has a very small part.<br /><br />i'd once seen a the video box for this with a sculpted plastic form glued to the boxcover. possibly it might even have had some electronics in it at one time, perhaps eyes that light up (the main character's eyes occasionally turn green in the movie). the copy i watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had held on the plastic, which had been removed. the novelty boxcover, if it still had it, would have been the only reason i would have held onto this movie; i'm definitely getting rid of it.
