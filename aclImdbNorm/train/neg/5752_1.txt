i don't usually comment, but there are things that need to be said. where to start...<br /><br />the acting, on jeremy london's part was horrible! i didn't think he could be so bad. the plot could have been good, had it been well directed, along with a good solid performance from the lead actor. unfortunately, this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be entertaining, but get disappointed from the start. <br /><br />well, at least i got good laughs. i wouldn't waste my time if i were you.
