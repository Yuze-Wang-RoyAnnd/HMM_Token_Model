typically terrible trash from director fred olen ray about a female cyborg hunter(teagan)commissioned by warden jan-michael vincent to find and execute escaped alien convict ross hagen who has charted course for earth. soon forest ranger john phillip law will have to protect a group of obnoxiously hammy college kids headed by the grating richard wiley who ran over hagen with his rv on a camping trip gone awry. soon the cyborg will be blasting away with her arm laser burning one innocent alcoholic doctor(robert quarry of count yorga-vampire fame)proving that no one will stand in it's way of retrieving the hide of the convict, whose collar is a tracking device that weakens his body. law finds an ally in leo gordon, an old vietnam war vet with way too weapons stashed in his cabin.<br /><br />perhaps intentionally made awful, this features what fans of "rancid cinema" yearn for..dreadful special effects, acting, and premise. at least, the film has pj soles for some eye candy..even in '89, she was quite smokin'. that laser gun sure is funny..it can incinerate some houses yet when the cyborg shoots at law it barely leaves a mark on the location fired.
