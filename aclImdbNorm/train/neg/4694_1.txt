i was interested in the title and description of big rig while attending the sxsw film festival in austin, tx. however, i was eager to get the heck out of the seats as soon as big rig ended. big rig is comprised of several "big rig" drivers who set out to deliver goods driven across the united states. the characters are all wonderful people, however the filmmakers never dug deep into the complexity of them as people. instead, the story meanders as much as the maps in the film are meant to guide, but never do. at most, we get lost. we - the audience - end up going nowhere and, like the direction of the storytelling, end up somewhere but without direction, location, or plot. why are we here? where are we? how did we get here? the storytelling is sloppy and the directors' intent on "humanizing" a group of people who they regard as "overlooked" and "invisible" comes across as unconsciously and irritatingly condescending. the problem here here lies in the perspective of the directors instead of the truck drivers. the directors bring their own naive assumptions about truckers forward and then simply edit the film to confirm those assumptions. overall, the story lacks any tension, the film is entirely too long (should have been a 15 min sketch), the big question of "so what" is never answered, and the entire film is one piece of see-through propaganda that does nothing to further "enlighten" (as the directors claim) the outside world about big riggers.
