marvin(rob schneider)does not have the ingredients to be a cop which is his lifelong dream. but his luck changes when he has a car crush(a very bad one)and is found by a doctor. the doctor has to use animal organs to rebuild him. after this moment, he starts to have wild behaviours unconsciously and becomes a best cop one could ever be. by the time, he realises the changes and his animal instincts starts to take over his human side. in the mean time, he finds a lovely girl and try to be a perfect gentleman that means he has to control himself and behave civilised. i am not a big fun of rob schneider. in fact, this is the his first film i have seen. however, i can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser.(see his part in ally mcbeal, quite funny actually).there are some good parts in the movie such as his flirting with the goat. in such movies, the biggest problem is that the script is seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent. i am sure this movie is okay to watch as long as it is not taken too seriously. but very sad to see such films doing very good in the box office. the animal is not the worst film i have seen to date but fails to get more than *.
