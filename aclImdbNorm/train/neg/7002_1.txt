i have seen this movie and the other one. trinity is my name and i find that this one is worse then the first one. i have no idea why they even made another movie it was stupid and pointless sorry to say that i have all of them. i have sat through them number of times and it still drives me to turn it off 5 minutes into the movie. i like terence hill movies and i like bud spencer but this movie just drove me up the wall. if it had a different story line or at least more of a plot and more comedy it might have been funner and worth the 5 dollars i spent buying all the movies. but you make mistakes so i would say save your money and don't bye this movie or any of the ones that go with it trust me on this one.
