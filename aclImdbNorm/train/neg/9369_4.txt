although i had heard this film was a little dry, i watch whatever scott bakula is in. at the start of this film i had high hopes for the classic cheesy but enjoyable scott-gets-girl ending and until 20 minutes before the end it was going great. the plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very clever. i kept my fingers crossed that it would work out and it would all be some horrible misunderstanding, right up until when the credits rolled and i realised that there was not going to be a happy and contented ending. unfortunately i was left regretting that i'd watched it and hurriedly putting on some quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the great scott!
