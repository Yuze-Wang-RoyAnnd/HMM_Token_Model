okay. so i just got back. before i start my review, let me tell you one thing: i wanted to like this movie. i know i've been negative in the past, but i was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film. i didn't.<br /><br />it's not just the fact that every horror clich'e imaginable is in this. and it's not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare (walking into a baseball bat left on the floor? are you kidding me?). it just wasn't scary. one thing i was surprised about: there was more blood than i thought there was going to be.. which isn't saying much.<br /><br />the film starts off with donna being dropped off by lisa's mom at her house. she comes in.. goes upstairs. camera pans to her father dead on the couch. spooky. she goes upstairs, where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens. finds her brother on his bed, apparently dead (how could she tell? he didn't have a spot of blood on him). killer comes in, donna hides under bed, mom dies. she runs outside screaming for help. killer behind her: "i did it for us." cut to therapy session. this confused a lot of people- everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it- and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back. filler dialogue ensues.<br /><br />they cut to the chase pretty quick. few scenes at the salon, they go to the hotel. of course the killer is already there (for some reason, he escaped 3 days ago but the police/family weren't informed until he's already there). more filler ensues.<br /><br />i'm not going to go on about what happens in the film, because i don't want to spoil it too much. if you want to know who dies, horror_fan made a post about it already. but on the subjects of deaths: they weren't that exciting. people in the theatre actually laughed out loud (an experience i've never had before in a horror movie, not even in when a stranger calls) during several of them. one in particular: the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious 'scared' face i've ever seen. the only death involving any blood was lisa's, and that was pretty scarce. her throat is slashed, blood (if you can even call it that- it was practically black) splatters on the curtain-thing. the only other blood was on claire when we see her body. apparently, fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death. um, okay? the movie was one of the most clich'ed i've ever seen. let's see here.. obligatory close-mirror-curtain-boom! scene. check. twice, actually (you could tell they were struggling). mandatory backing-up-into-killer. check. there's also the backing-up-into-lamp scene, but you've all seen that. oh, you say you want a birds-flying-away scare? well, you got it! (yes, they managed to incorporate one of those in here). and, of course, the we-have-security-on-all-exits-but-he-still-escaped scene. shall i go on? i could.<br /><br />for anyone saying the characters weren't stupid, are you kidding me? "oh, even though the massive alarm is ringing, literally saying please vacate the building, and 3 of my friends are missing, i'm going to go upstairs to get my wrap." these characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever. the only likable character - lisa - made one of the most stupid moves in the movie. "oh, i just realized the psycho-teacher is here! i must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her! oh, shoot, the elevator is being to slow? guess i'll take the stairs and run off into the construction site!" ugh. by the end of the film, they all deserved to die. the only death anyone felt any remorse for was donna's boyfriend (i can't even remember his name- is that bad?), and by that time, the audience was completely drained out of this scareless, clich'ed film.<br /><br />there were some positives- the acting was decent for the most part, and it was well-shot. but that's about it.<br /><br />i'd give it a 1/5, and that's being generous. just for the laughs (and believe me, the audience had a few), and brittany snow.<br /><br />oh, and the reaction was bad. very bad. people were boo-ing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative. expect bad legs for this one.
