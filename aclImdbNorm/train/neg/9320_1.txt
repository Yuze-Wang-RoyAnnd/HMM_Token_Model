if this film was a comedy, i would have given it a 10. oh my, where do i begin? put it this way -- i've seen lots of terrible horror films, but this one makes troll 2 look like freakin' saving private ryan. it's as if a group of porn filmmakers decided to make a horror film, changed their mind in midproduction and decided to do a comedy, then went back to horror, and then decided that they should have just stuck with porno (softcore at that). everything about this film is simply terrible: the musical score (someone shoot the guy who invented the yamaha keyboard), the script, the directing, the cinematography, the acting. there simply are no words to describe this. oh wait, yes there are: holy $*%!.
