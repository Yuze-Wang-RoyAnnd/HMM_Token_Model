sixth escapade for freddy krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in springwood; now he wants to broaden his horizons and (**spoiler**) needs a family member in order to do it.<br /><br />a failure as a horror movie because it simply ain't scary at all. works better as a dark, macabre black comedy, to tell you the truth. freddy krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer. (too many wisecracks, that's for sure.) the actors aren't interesting (save robert englund, as always, and an obviously slumming yaphet kotto) and there are simply far too many visual effects. the finale is ok but doesn't provide as many sparks as i think one might hope.<br /><br />in adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer's story, it provides englund the opportunity to do more non-makeup scenes than ever before.<br /><br />there are cameos worth noting: a joint cameo by then-couple roseanne and tom arnold that is devoid of entertainment value, an appropriate appearance by veteran shock-rocker alice cooper, and a funny cameo by johnny depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had become.<br /><br />film debut of breckin meyer, who plays spencer.<br /><br />one of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing credits.<br /><br />4/10
