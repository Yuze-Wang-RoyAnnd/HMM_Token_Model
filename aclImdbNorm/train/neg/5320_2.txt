this is a dry and sterile feature filming on one of most interesting events in wwii and in history of warfare behind the front line. bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event. there is no character development at all and idea that tom cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and treason is completely insane. i believe that mister bin would play it better. generally speaking, film pretty much looks as a cheep copy of good german tv movie "stauffenberg" from 2004, but can't get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever. however, movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop-corn audience that cherishes hollywood fast-mood blood and shallow art values.
