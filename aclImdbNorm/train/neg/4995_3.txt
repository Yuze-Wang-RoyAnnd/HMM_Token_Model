i found it a real task to sit through this film. the sound track was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said. there was little to move the plot along and often the action simply stopped and there was a prolonged period of conversations which seemed extraneous to the movie. these conversations switched between family groups and the observer was left to try and piece together what the common thread was that tied them together. it is rare that i rate a film this low and do so in this case as the entire viewing experience left me thinking "so what" and "why did i waste my time watching this."
