this is going to be the most useless comment i have ever put down, but yet i must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that "freddy's dead" is. it is not only the very worst chapter of the nightmare series, but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time! it was boring, pointless, and nearly death free. the horrible 3-d ending and over-the-top corny kills are enough to drive this "film" into the ground. however, it doesn't stop there, just add bad acting, a terrible script, and a number of cheesy cameos and you've got yourself this heaping pile of guano! it's no wonder why freddy, as always played by robert englund, has made two postmortem appearances. i would too if i went out like that. this is a strictly fans only movie, don't stare at our shame.
