oh, brother. the only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total "bomb" from me is because it's at least historically noteworthy as the first three stooges film (when they weren't yet on their own and were still saddled with that painfully unfunny ted healy). but even as a longtime stooges fan i'd have to say that young moe, larry and curly are badly used here as three zany assistant janitors to mr. healy's taller boss janitor. they're not featured steadily through the movie and their silly on-and-off-again stints paint them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusing.<br /><br />most of this toothache deals with jack pearl seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man who impersonates baron munchausen (here's a good example of the level of humor: "i object!" "on what grounds?" "coffee grounds!"). his sidekick is none other than a young jimmy durante, but even the schnoz himself is a bore.
