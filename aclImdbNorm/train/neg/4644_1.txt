this film is terrible. the story concerns a woman trying to find out what has happened to her sister. the film struggles with its identity, lurching from noir/thriller to erotic, with elements of horror thrown in for good measure. the film has a very confused structure, for example with frequent use of flashbacks without tying these into the story. the plot is poorly developed, and the characterisation made it difficult to distinguish between who was who and the part they were playing. some implausibilities exist in many films, but the scene where the main protagonist willingly accompanies a virtual stranger to his home, then agrees to go upstairs alone (to where he says she will find a phone), minus the gun she had brought with her, to call the police, was too hard to believe. some of the cinematography is very poor: we were watching on a 42" tv so how anyone with a smaller set could work out what was happening in the scenes taken in almost complete darkness is beyond me. overall, a chaotic mess.
