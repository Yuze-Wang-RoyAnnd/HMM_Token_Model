i was surprised when i saw this film. i'd heard it was the best ever filmed of the novel. how disappointed i was.<br /><br />how any true jane austen fan can rate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes. the scriptwriters have decided to stick in bits of ridiculous humour which are embarrassing at the best of times, but also ruin the feel of the period. as for the cast: gwyneth paltrow makes a rather shallow heroine (but then any 'hot' american star would be questionable in the role), toni collette is miscast, and poor ewan mcgregor is made to look laughable!<br /><br />i really could not say a good thing about this film. i seem to be among the very few who don't rate it, but if you want my advice, see instead the tv production starring kate beckinsale - believe me, that is far preferable to this superficial trash.
