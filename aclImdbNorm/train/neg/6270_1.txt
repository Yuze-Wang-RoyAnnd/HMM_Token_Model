somehow a woman working with a scientist puts round metal balls into people's mouths that supposedly changes their personality but in reality turns them into crazed, zombie-like killers. the "guinea pigs" for the experiment are scantily-clad, nubile young women in desperate need of acting lessons. this movie is awful, atrocious, and amazingly bad. it has little to no logic in the script. you really will have trouble following what is going on. it has no special effects. the computer screen that is supposedly representing a huge scientific advancement looks nothing more than an old atari screen. and what is even worse is that there is also a puppet with strands of felt hair(looks like a lonely kid at summer camp made it) named george that is like a personal servant/confidant to jessica(the leading "actress"). throughout the movie you will be subjected to the idiotic, sophmoric utterings of this puppet. but wait...you also get loads of softcore, unerotic, barely nude scenes with the girls with some bar guys. all the while a most annoying soundtrack plays in the background like some kind of spiritual discovery has taken place. none of the actors are good. there are just varying degrees of bad. the gore and "horror" aspects are especially ineptly filmed. the film really looks like an adolescent put it together. no coincidence henry sala, the director by name but not by trade, has not made another film. i was bored almost into a coma watching this stupid, silly, dreck! and how bout the ending? what happened? if you know let me in on the secret because for the life of me i cannot figure it out. all i know is that i lost the time spent watching this garbage that made the beginning of my weekend a real nightmare of a bore!
