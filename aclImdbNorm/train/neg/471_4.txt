a stale "misfits-in-the-army" saga, which half-heartedly attempts to be both surreal (the foreign subtitles) and vulgar (the flatulence gags), but just ends up being a mix of many different kinds of humor, none of them followed very successfully. barbara bach, the bond girl from "the spy who loved me", has only two or three brief scenes. what a waste!
