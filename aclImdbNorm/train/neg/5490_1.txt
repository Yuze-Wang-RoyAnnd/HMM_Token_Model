when i was a kid we always used to be babysat, and we always used to rent a film or see a film at the cinema. this is one of the films we watched. this is one of the stupidest films i've ever seen, i think it might even be a walt disney pictures film! a martian is dropped on earth, turns into a human, befriends a human, and is trying everything he can to get back home. but he is distracted by the wonders of the earth. the only good comment i can give is the choice of actors, back to the future's christopher lloyd as the martian, uncle martin, dumb and dumber's jeff daniels as tim o'hara, elizabeth hurley as brace channing and daryl hannah as lizzie. but apart from that it's complete crap. poor!
