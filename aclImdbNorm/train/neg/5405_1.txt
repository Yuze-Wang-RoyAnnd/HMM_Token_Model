i got this as a turkey movie and was i not disappointed.<br /><br />acting - overall even though many have been in other movies it is clear that they had to work hard to act this bad so constantly over this entire movie with out accidentally letting slip some degree of acting.<br /><br />plot - being generous i could say that the scriptwriter did originally start with a plot but but did his best to ignore it. the plot broke down faster then a chinese knock off computer <br /><br />scrip - now that was an abomination of nature. it failed to flow with any rhyme or reason. the majority of the lines by the characters were at best pathetic to imbecilic. the script worked hard to make sure that no character managed to get to be considered memorable. i have watched other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable.<br /><br />special effects - rotflmao!!!!! they were short bus special <br /><br />directing - until you can come up with your own directing ability copy the style of your favorite directer otherwise you will only make failures like this.<br /><br />it is good to know that your friends/family have been giving you 10 stars for this movie
