yes, about the only thing this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish tom hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in hollywood. here though is not a movie that is going to showcase his talents much at all and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat entertaining about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees a monsters and runs a guy through. yes, this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios. basically, an after school type special about the evils of the game dungeons and dragons cleverly retitled here as mazes and monsters. apparently, the makers of this film thought that nerds should not have fun of any sort unless they were going to go out and do underage drinking, drugs, having lots of unprotected sex and harass other weaker children like all the popular kids were doing. no, these bad people were playing a game that actually required one to use there brain, heaven's no! not that, if they have a brain they actually may be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups out there. yes, i think this movie is utterly stupid and a waste of time. granted, it could be a movie against addiction, but there are a lot fewer people who died taking dungeons and dragons to far in its entire existence than than say what drunk driving claims in like a month.
