i am not saying that night of the twisters was horrible, but it was far from great. mediocre at absolute best. i seems though that every time one type of movie is released, a second must be around the same time. (think about armageddon and deep impact, volcano and dante's peak) night of the twisters is really just twister except worse and with mundane special effects.<br /><br />i have nothing against the actors who starred in it, even if they weren't great, it was the movie itself, the directing, the special effects, the whole storyline was just too strange to interpret. a series of tornadoes strike a town and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage.<br /><br />i really don't know why it seems as though duplicates of disaster movies are released almost in sync with each other, but this one would have been better with bill paxton and helen hunt.
