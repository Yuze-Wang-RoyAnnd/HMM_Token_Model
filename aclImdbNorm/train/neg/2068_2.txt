the gospel of lou was a major disappointment for me. i had received an e-mail from the theater showing it that it was a great and inspirational movie. it was neither great nor inspirational. the cinematography was pretty iffy with the whole movie. a lot the scenes were flash backs that were done in a way that couldn't tell at times what they were about. the voices were often distorted for no reason. also many of the people in the movie were far fetched. the relationship he has with his ex & son is never made clear. also the whole movie has most him one way, and then all of a sudden bam, he is cured and inspiring people. the whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life, making him live his life the way that he is living it, but when he changes, he doesn't leave boxing, he teaches others how to box. thumbs down.
