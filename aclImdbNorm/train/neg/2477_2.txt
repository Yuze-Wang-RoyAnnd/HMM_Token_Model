if you want to know the real story of the wendigo, i suggest you pick up a copy of algernon blackwell's original story. this movie was not only bad but had nothing to do with the book.<br /><br />i loved the book when i read it as a kid (in "campfire chillers" by e.m. freeman)and was so excited to see a movie based on it come out. i was so disappointed when i finally saw it. another thing is that there were too many pc (politically correct) undertones throughout the movie that had no place in the film. when the book was written pc didn't even exist.<br /><br />my suggestion is don't waste your time or money!! if you see it on the video store shelf leave it there.
