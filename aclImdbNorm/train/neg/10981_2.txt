or listening to, for that matter. even the soundtrack is a bore. <br /><br />honestly, this isn't the worst gay movie i've seen (that would be regarding billy), but it's down there very close to the bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />this thing drags and drags and drags. it's not that the plot is inane--in the hands of a good writer it might have worked . . . it certainly could have been much more entertaining. there's not one plot point you can't see coming for ten miles down the road. the dialog is flat. the jokes are old. to add insult to injury, it's full of one-dimensional, stereotypical gays. <br /><br />nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible, much less real. there was no chemistry, no dynamic, in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other . . . we're just told they're in love. hard to figure when they have nothing in common and aren't compatible sexually. they like the same book? huh?<br /><br />the acting is not totally bad, but the pacing is excruciatingly slow. i mean, almost jarmusch- slow, but without jarmusch quality. in fact, that would be a good barometer for you. if you like jarmusch films, avoid this one.
