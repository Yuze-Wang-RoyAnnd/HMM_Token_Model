alright, so i've been dying to see this movie. stoked about the, "who's who" in horror land that are in the film....well, my friend rented this, brought it over, and we started watching it. it's supposed to be a comedy....i did not smirk even once, until the 40min mark.<br /><br />does it have to do with the budget? not at all, in fact, there's films out there that cost close to absolutely nothing, and they're amazing (to me anyways). also, while watching this film, i couldn't help but realize the similarities (i.e., stealing) to a low budget indie film titled, "actress apocalypse", read my review about it (it destroys this film btw).<br /><br />this film...it had potential it really did. it had the "star power", stolen plot (lets film the behind the scenes of the making of a movie...ie..."actress apocalypse"....seriously, this angers me the more and more i think about),...it really could've been funny. a lot, a lot of the jokes fall flat. the acting is alright for what it is. but it dragged on, wasn't funny, and the plot was totally stolen.<br /><br />i give this a two, because it wasn't sooo awful, but that's the only reason.
