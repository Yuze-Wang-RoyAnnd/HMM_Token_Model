i watched this film a long time ago (aprox 10 years or so) and liked it then. i remembered it the other day and decided to watch it again. the second time around was not pleasant. the acting is 'so,so', the plot is illogical, unreasonable and predictable.<br /><br />the acting...i'm sure it wasn't a stretch for those actresses to play those characters. the plot...there's no way in hell those women would have gotten away with the first robbery much less the 2nd. (side note: why did tt not realise that even if she came up with a load of money for her court date they would ask where she got it and she would have no logical answer! ding, ding...we have a crook!). it horribly stereotyped black women in saying basically that the only way black women can 'beat the system' or obtain a large amount of money was to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources. it plays too much on sympathy b/c all of them die in the end (bar jada) but it's not sad (you're thinking 'they were so stupid; they deserve to die). you just don't really care about the characters unless you're a shallow person.<br /><br />i can't believe this film rates over a 5.
