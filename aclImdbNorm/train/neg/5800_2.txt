as a horror-movie fan i try to watch all significant novelties of this genre, especially those which are the products of my native cinema. and i can say that that the "power of fear" (or "vedma" as the russian title of it) is one of the weakest film among them. firstly, it can't scary even a little kid, it paces so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror. frankly speaking, it's bad in all points: from the goofy plot (i don't know why the russian producers/director decided to transform the classic story about ukrainian witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous modern-day-america thriller. i absolutely agree with the previous reviewer
