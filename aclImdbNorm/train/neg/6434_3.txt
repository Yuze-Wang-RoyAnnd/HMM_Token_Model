i'm always suprised on how different all people are and how for almost every movie you get both extremes. people who think it's the best movie and people who think it's the worst.<br /><br />stigmata wouldn't be the worst movie i've ever seen, but it's up there. first of all the sound. the producers spent more time on the soundtrack than the editing. it was so loud when the soundtrack was playing and no one was talking and then when patrica was talking in her monotone voice, she could hardly be heard.<br /><br />i usually like patrica and gaberial, but they were both flat in this movie. patrica had basically 3 emotions. quiet, in great pain, or really angry she has stigmata. the first was the predominate one, the second involved screaming pain, the third involving raising her voice. it was loudness that distiguished the three and not emotion.<br /><br />maybe i missed a lot of the deep meaning and subplots everyone was talking about, or maybe i was distracted by the terrible filming and mtv like style. when you watch a 3 minute video you need fast cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story, in a 2 hour feature film, it's nauseating. i fail to see the meaning of her seeing that women across the steet and dropping a child. and no pittsburg does not rain that often!!<br /><br />i think maybe a real story, with something to say could have been intended, but all the budget was spent on buying music and the equipment to do slow rain drop shots and renting that gorgous apartment that ms. arquett lived in that they ended up firing the guy with the story.
