i really hate this show! i had watched one episode, and i knew this show is really terrible. the story lines are both poorly written and executed and the jokes are really bad...i mean it is just a sh++ty rip-off of dexter's laboratory and johnny quest, 'bout an obnoxious boy with flamed blond hair with his twin genius sisters and talking dog; a stay-at-home dad and a smart, super-busy mom...like oh-my-flippin'-god! their dad is a mother-f**kin' crazy home-maker, isn't that so gay! if my dad is a home-maker, i would personally die! of shame that is...really i would.<br /><br />i have nothing else to about this...this travesty but only 3 word; count them 3 words to describe it:<br /><br />. lame, . stupid, and above all... . f**k up! that's all i could say folks, it is definitely making my list of worst animated series ev-er! if i had one that is.
