i don't know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it. perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not compelling enough to care about. perhaps it was the disorganized storyline. perhaps it was the fact that rob lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner. perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song. perhaps it was because the 1980s were never that 80s. perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole. perhaps it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out. i don't know what it was that made me hate it so, but if it means trying to watch it again i'm not willing to find out.
