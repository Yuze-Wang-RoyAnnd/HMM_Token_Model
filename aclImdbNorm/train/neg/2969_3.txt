the story is very trustworthy and powerful. the technical side of the movie is quite fine.. even the directing of it. the main problem is with the castings, that turned that movie into almost another local and regular clich'e with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression. beside the small role of the father, rafael (played impressively by asi dayan), all other actors were unfortunately not in their best. the role of the elder blind girl, played by taly sharon, was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role. therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile. there were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie. but after all it's a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future.
