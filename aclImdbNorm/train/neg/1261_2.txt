i'm a jean harlow fan, because she had star quality. i don't think her movies are good and i don't even think that she was a good actress, but she certainly was great in comedies. every bit of comedy in the girl from missouri is very good. but this movie is perhaps more like a love story. jean harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast - their performances bring nothing new. it always impresses me much to think that harlow's beautiful body was that of an ill woman. well, in this movie she does look beautiful.
