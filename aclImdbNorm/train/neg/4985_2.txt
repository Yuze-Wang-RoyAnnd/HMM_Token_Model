in 1993, "the visitors" was an enormous hit in france. so, the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately, this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made. <br /><br />this is a movie that doesn't keep its promises. indeed, it's supposed to tell a sole story. jean reno must go in the twentieth century and take christian clavier back in the middle ages so that time can normally follow its course. the problem is that clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century, and so make him get back in the middles ages is rather hard... instead of this, the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot. as a consequence, the movie becomes sometimes muddle-headed, sometimes a bit of a mess.<br /><br />but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors. reno and clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie: they're going over the top and become annoying. then, why did jean-marie poir'e the film-maker engage muriel robin in the female main role? he made a mistake because she seems ill-at-ease and is absolutely pitiful. the other actors aren't better: marie-anne chazel is nonexistent and christian bujeau, unbearable.<br /><br /> of course, the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness. certain sequences and dialogs are affected. it also appears hollow because poir'e takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie. thus, a young girl takes reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding.<br /><br />a labored and disappointing follow-up. anyway, what's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial?<br /><br />
