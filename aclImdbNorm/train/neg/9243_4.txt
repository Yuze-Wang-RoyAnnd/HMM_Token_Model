to put it simply, i am not fond of westerns. and having never sat through one from beginning to end, i decided to watch "my darling clementine" and see it all the way through, no matter how painful it was for me. at first it was excruciating as expected. i found the acting to be laughable, the scenery (your standard dessert, horses and cowboys) boring and the music and its timing teetering on the edge of painful. however, after mentally pep talking myself to struggle on, after the first 20 minutes it began to be quite a bit easier for me to endure. focusing in on the cinematography, and how john ford managed to make even the dullest situations (dull according to me that is) look quite stunning at times, made it a lot more interesting. <br /><br />in conclusion, i can't go so far as to say that i enjoyed the movie by the end of it. however it was made well enough for me to sit all the way through to the very end, and that in itself impresses me.
