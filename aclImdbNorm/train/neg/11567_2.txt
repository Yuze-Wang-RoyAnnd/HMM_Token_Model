i decided to watch this serial after seeing the endless adverts for it on the bbc in the weeks prior to it starting. i watched it despite the fact that i don't like the pretentious kind of stuff that alan hollinghurst writes (sorry to his fans but i think we have a case of the emperor's new clothes with this author's work). i admit that the acting is excellent, it is beautifully shot and i was reasonably entertained by it - however- i found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very unsatisfied with this rather empty production. the 'explicit' gay sex that the media droned on about has all been done before on tv - several times - so it was nothing very shocking i'm afraid. full marks for production values but low ones for storyline/content i'm afraid.
