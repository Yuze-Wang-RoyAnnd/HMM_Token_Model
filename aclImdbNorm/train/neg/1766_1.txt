baldwin has really stooped low to make such movies. the script, the music, just about everything in this movie is a waste of time.<br /><br />the sound fx do not sound real, they stick out way too much (technical gadgets etc.) if they are trying to make a movie about things like this, at least try to get real with it and drop those extra bleeps and beeps, because those gadgets don't really make loud sounds like that. natural sounds like footsteps and such are non-existent, which gives it a void-like atmosphere.<br /><br />directing seems to be ok for such a low budget film (i sure hope it was a low budget production), although it does seem fairly amateurish at times.<br /><br />most characters seem empty and false, they simply haven't casted this movie very well. i'd imagine it would've been a better idea to make baldwin speak some spanish than to make spanish actors speak english, when we all know that theirs is the language which is more vibrant and alive, that is why the actors performance can suffer greatly if an odd language is used. i mean, could finally someone realise how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak english with a bad accent? it's should've a long ago buried corpse in movie production. the production team ever heard of subtitles? this movie again manages to depict european police as lazy and corrupt, the societies as vulnerable and helpless. i mean if the plot again goes like "the interpol can't do jack, so let's call one american to bring down this international syndicate" or whatever.<br /><br />sony pictures treads on the same path as columbia before it, just producing movies for the hell of it. i'd imagine them to have some self respect also. are buyers supposed to buy every dirty title just because sony puts out something good a few times a year?! maybe they should've used the same team as who were making di que si - say i do. it's spoken in spanish and paz vega and santi millan do a decent job keeping the movie afloat. looks and sounds much better! come on sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
