the original boogeyman was a silly but entertaining supernatural slasher flick. it was by no means a great film but fun in the right frame of mind. the third instalment in this series, return of the boogeyman, on the other hand, is simply atrocious. it consists of two things. firstly, cheap and lifeless new footage. secondly, loads of recycled bits from the first movie. the new material is unbelievably amateurish but not in an amusingly inept way, simply incredibly tedious. this footage has clearly been knocked together quickly and without any effort. it serves as a framing device for the endless clips from the first (and possibly second) movies. and boy, do they milk those clips from the earlier films; sometimes reusing sequences over and over again. the only new addition to these parts is a voice over that pointlessly describes exactly what we can see with our own eyes. the whole experience of watching this is truly mind-numbing.<br /><br />return of the boogeyman is an example of the very worst kind of exploitation flick; the kind that exploits the audience in a highly cynical way. i want to keep this review brief and to the point because this film deserves no more. there is nothing here of value at all. this is worthless.
