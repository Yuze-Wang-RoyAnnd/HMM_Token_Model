i joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a film. i wasn't drawn in for even a second. the characters were all one-dimensional. they threw every topic they could think of hoping something would stick. i would bet (and hope) that everyone involved in teachers looks back with embarrassment. there are some great actors here but you would never know it. thank god it didn't destroy morgan freeman's or judd hirsh's or nick nolte's or laura dern's careers. there was no vision, no labor of love here, only a horrible effort gone wrong. btw i don't think the writer ever set foot in a real school.
