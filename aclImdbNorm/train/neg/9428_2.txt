i normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read, about movies few will see. however, in this case, i feel i must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it. i just finished watching it only five minutes ago. this is, quite simply, one of the worst movies that i have ever seen in my life. the acting is horrible, a plot is nonexistent, and production values are poverty level at best. i know that even a low budget movie can be great, but not this one. there is only thing that could have saved this movie for any horror fan's purposes--more on-screen gore and slashing! the grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen. while it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--there is simply not enough of it. the movie is just too long for it's minimal content, too dialogue heavy, and consequently almost impossible to watch. what happens? to put it all in a nutshell with room to spare, three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people--one of whom is the psychotic killer. all three are eventually murdered, one by one, off-screen, after what seems like an eternity of boring, slow-paced nonsense. as i said, the only things worth watching even once are the murders. please don't buy it or rent it just for that, and don't be fooled like i was by the misleading box art and movie description. save your money and your time.
