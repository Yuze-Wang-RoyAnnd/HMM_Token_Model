i cannot believe the same guy directed this crap and dracula 2000. dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh, and well written, if poorly acted.<br /><br />this pile can't even claim that. it starts with the defeat of dracula at the end of dracula 2000. then ignores the narrative afterwards describing what happened after that. following the narrative properly could have made this a good sequel somehow, but craven chose to go in the style of his older films, having no good tie but the main villain's name.<br /><br />even the actor playing dracula was different (going from dark hair in dracula 2000 to a blonde here).<br /><br />avoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies.
