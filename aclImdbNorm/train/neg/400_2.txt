i rarely make these comments but i felt compelled to spare others the pain i endured in watching this movie. it's so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply can't suspend disbelief. the problem starts early, when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle, overlooking the capitol building in washington, d.c. that kind of life on a government salary? hah! it only gets worse. toward the end, when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys, the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die, in order to cleanse the gene pool. the special effects are pretty good - any producer's money can buy that - and the lead actors have been great in other films, but the screenplay and direction here are moronic. many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind paul verhoeven's previous, facially stupid movies (showgirls, starship troopers), but this movie should stop the wondering. he's just plain bad.
