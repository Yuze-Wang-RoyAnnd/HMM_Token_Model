immediately after renting and watching this movie several years ago, a friend and i decided that it defined the absolute zero on the movie scale. there was nothing about the movie that could have been done worse than it was. to this day we still rate movies, even very bad ones, by how much better than "the lonely lady" they are.<br /><br />a long time ago i saw an interview with eleanor perry, who wrote the screenplays for, among other things, "last summer" and "diary of a mad housewife," and she related that she had been asked to write a screenplay for the harold robbins' book "the lonely lady." she said that she sent in a treatment and it was rejected because they didn't think she understood the difficulties of a female screenwriter in hollywood. she then said "i think they got someone else to write it." the interview was filmed before the movie was released. she died in 1981, and i bet the first thing she did on arrival in heaven was personally thank god for saving her from involvement in the result.
