i can't say this is the worst movie ever made, but personally i think of it that way because when it was originally released in theaters, (1) the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted we go see it, and we actually stood in line to get tickets, and (2) it's still the only "serious" film i recall where the audience started snickering at a certain point and basically laughed at the movie the rest of the way through. once we reached the infamous (and interminable) snake fight scene, i think everyone gave up.<br /><br />the only positive i can concede is the lush location shooting. oh, and there's also bo's breasts, although her acting is so wooden that the nudity is unerotic and doesn't rate much more than a playboy pictorial.<br /><br />the "dramatic tension" in this film is between bo's terrible acting and her husband's horrible direction. the snake fight has to be one of the most incompetent "action" sequences ever filmed. however, this is one of those films that's bad enough, it may be worth watching on the level of unintentional humor. definitely the worst film i ever paid to see.
