that's incredible! fidani (who he was also a spiritist) was one of the cheapest director of all the world. this movie stole the original title of leone's "duck you sucker!" but tell the boring story of a pinkerton agent against the killer "testa di ferro" (the improbable gordon mitchell, a stuntman). all is poor and crazy in this pelicula filmed into the dear landscapes of lazio. the story is bad and crazy at the same time. fidani was not able and ingenuos at the same time. into the story happened some kind of crazy illogical things (like the discussion into the sheriff's house and the demential appearance of butch cassidy !?!?!?!?!? yes, really butch cassidy,who is portrayed like an idiot). terribles nuit americaine, absurd comportaments, illogic plot, bad acting and a fugace appearance by one of the most rewarded anchorman in the story of italian television, renzo arbore. ah, of course: klaus kinski. yes is great and terrible, but i'm sure he was in it only for money an for playing with iron horses) 2 of 10 but...don't miss it!!!!!
