if ashanti had been a serious attempt at a film about the institution of slavery, still prevalent in third world countries the film might have been better received. instead it turns into a star studded disaster of a movie where the stars came in, said their lines, and picked up their paychecks without much conviction.<br /><br />michael caine and his wife beverly johnson work for the united nations world health organization and are busy doing their humanitarian thing in east africa. along comes peter ustinov who can barely summon enough ham in him to make a go of the part as a moslem slave dealer. as johnson is black he grabs her anyway along with a lot of children and a few adults as well.<br /><br />of course caine doesn't take kindly to the kidnapping and the rest of the film is spent in a rescue attempt. the rest of the cast has such folks as william holden, rex harrison, omar sharif and indian film star kebir bedi in parts and looking so incredibly bored with the whole thing.<br /><br />usually in something like this talented people like those mentioned above will just overact outrageously and feast on a diet of scenery. but ashanti doesn't even have that going for it.<br /><br />what an incredible waste of time. the aroma of tax write off is permeating the air.
