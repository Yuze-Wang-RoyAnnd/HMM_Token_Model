i am a christian and i say this movie had terrible acting, unreal situations and a completely facade front for christianity. you might as well watch "remember the titans" and at least not mix christ in a football film like a formulaic steroid for losers. let me make some really pressing comments of what bothered me in this film.<br /><br />1. the school was in georgia and was a white academy school. i did not notice a single black student or player in the school. i deal with the white "christian" academies in the south and they were built for no other reason than to reestablish segregation. this is troubling when the movie is about christianity and christ changing lives...how about changing the hearts of segregation? (note: i loved the token black coach; like it made up for the entirely white team and all the black 'giants' players.) <br /><br />2. the uncritical acclaim by everyone christian about this movie. can i get a couple people to say that it was bad acting, bad filming, bad writing and in short poor compared to other movies. if we were to compare this to another football movie, would it have the same charisma and energy? <br /><br />3. the half-baked christianity which was shown made even less sense to me than the unrealistic ending. if christianity is about simply reading a little scripture and praying to begin a complete life change, then don't wonder when no one will listen to what christians have to say. we want to sell christ as a cure-all. he doesn't need sold and he doesn't need to be attached to such whimsical lifestyles. no wonder everyone considers christianity to be anti-intellectual with this unreal presentation.<br /><br />i recognize this film may be inspirational to a few people. to most, it will not be. it will not give a real picture of struggle and heartfelt tension. most importantly to me, it is not christian by any means or stretch. it has values but it falls short as a 'pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps' message as shallow as positive thinking. if you live alongside people who struggle and/or those in third world living conditions, this movie will be hollow as most churches are today in their religion.
