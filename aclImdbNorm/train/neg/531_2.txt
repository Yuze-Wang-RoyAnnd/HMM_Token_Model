with a cast list like this one, i expected far better. venessa redgrave spent the majority of the movie lying in bed. the best actresses in the world cannot make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the entire movie. the plot summary says that a secret is revealed to the daughters as their mother comes closer to death. the thing is, she never tells her daughters anything except cryptic advice to be happy. all the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped. i also felt that the back and forth between the past and present was unnecessary. it seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the book the da vinci code in which the device was used to increase suspense, or from the notebook in which they used the device to create the never ending romance of the story's main characters. either way it was a cheap device in this movie because it didn't work to create anything. it was a way to attempt suspense in a movie that has none. i left wondering why good movies can't be written for women. it really was a disappointment.
