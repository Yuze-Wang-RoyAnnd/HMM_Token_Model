generally i like horror movies, but unfortunately this fell out of the one pound bargain bin into my friends hand. we sat down to watch it, ready to be scared and ended up spraying food everywhere we were laughing so much. the concept isn't that bad, but why they decided number ten in the series would be lucky i don't know. the worst thing about the movie is the actors. the camera work was poor, the special effects are actually not bad if i am being generous, but overall the story failed to connect on any levels because the actors were as effective as a small lump of badly charred elm. they were wooden beyond measure, especially a foppish young actor who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent. he looked more like a public school boy in fact. there was a really amusing sex scene where he looked like he was bobbing for apples as a busty lady rode on top of him and later his nappy sized underpants were hysterical, but then i remembered it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. i'm desperately wracking my brain to find something positive to say about this movie apart from the occasional flash of breasts, but there simply isn't. let's hope ten was the lucky number and they don't do another one, i'm not sure my ribs could take it.
