a group of human looking aliens going to earth to eat crash land on a planet of prehistoric beasts instead where they all eat physcedelic mushrooms and act retarded. padded with footage from "planet of the dinosuars" and horrible jokes this is definitely one to miss. the acting is atrocious as well, and while this isn't as bad as "chickboxer" (what movie can be?) this is still pretty awful repugnant stuff. it's 90 minute running time feels like an eternity and you will likely be cursing life so do yourself a huge favor and just move on, skip this crappy film, there's nothing to see here.<br /><br />the film-makers try to resell this turd as a mst3k style making fun of the movie they made a decade before, and it works to an extent it's still nothing that watchable though, ariauna albright is hot, but lilith stabs has a pretty unattractive speaking voice.<br /><br />my grade: d- <br /><br />dvd extras: joke commentary, 17 behind the scenes featurette; 7 minute into the black featurette; jessica mills reporting; stills gallery; and original trailer
