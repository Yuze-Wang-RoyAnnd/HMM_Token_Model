manmohan desai made some entertaining though illogical films like aaa, parvarish and naseeb but he made some craps like coolie and mard and then gjs<br /><br />this movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him the dial became famous mard ko dard nahin hota but the film is so bad you cringe<br /><br />the british are made carricatures and the film looks so weird the scene in the british hotel is damn stupid <br /><br />the film has many stupidities like amrita assaulting amitabh and then the entire scene plus towards the climax the film becomes even worse there are more gems like the horse statue getting life, the masks of amitabh haha and more<br /><br />direction by manmohan desai is bad music is okay<br /><br />amitabh does his part with style, nothing different from coolie, laawaris type roles amrita singh is okay satyen kapuu is okay prem chopra is as usual, nirupa roy is again her usual self dara singh is also as usual
