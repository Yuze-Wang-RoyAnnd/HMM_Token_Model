this movie was extremely depressing. <br /><br />the characters were so cold. the mother, who is he main character, is everything but "motherly". ok, she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and children first. her husband dies. she then goes to visit her son and meets this hunk who is sleeping with her daughter and ends up sleeping with him. until this part, the movie is all right. not excellent, but it can be watched. the guy is charming and who can blame her? ok it's not very motherly to sleep with your daughter's lover but let's blame that on the shock of losing her husband. <br /><br />she becomes totally obsessed with the guy. i think this is the part where i started to dislike the movie. she's always there wanting to please him in an "old fashioned way" with snacks while he is working on her son's house (i guess this is the only thing she ever learned to do), as if it was the only way she could get his attention. the guy obviously is not very interested (actually, it seems more like he considered sleeping with her a charitable activity) and instead of being insulted by that, she continues to beg him to go to go to bed with her and to be nice to her when he becomes very abusive. "i want to please you", she tells him in a desperate way while he is insulting her very badly. <br /><br />what outraged me in this movie, is the utter lack of self-respect the mother has for herself. she tells craig something like "i am just a shapeless lump" the first time they sleep together. <br /><br />this movie is an insult to women kind. if it had been me, i would have bought myself a little object that would have brought me the same satisfaction and a lot less emotional pain... :)
