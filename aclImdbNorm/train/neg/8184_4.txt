this is almost like two films--one literate and engaging, the other stupid and clich'ed. it's really a shame all the problems weren't worked out with the writing, but considering how quickly most b-movies were written and produced, this isn't too unusual. it's a real shame, though, as this could have been a very good film.<br /><br />first the good. the movie is original and involves wwii code-breakers. this is pretty fascinating and i liked watching the leading man (lee bowman) go through his paces as a master code-breaker. in fact, the first two-thirds of the film was very good. but now for the bad, the film just went on way too long and lost steam at about 50 minutes. additionally, jean rogers' role as the "kooky girlfriend" must rank as one of the worst-written and distracting roles in film history!! for every smart move made by bowman, the idiot rogers then stepped in to screw things up as some sort of misguided "comedy relief". if her role had been intelligently written, the overall film would have improved immensely! instead, watching her, it's hard to understand how we actually won wwii!!
