the plot, character development, and gags in this movie are all extremely weak. quite a waste of time. the conclusion of saving grace is supposed to make one feel warm and fuzzy as though the characters have grown through their struggles. there was no such development to make such warm fuzzy feelings possible. the drug gags are cliched and much of the movie doesn't ring true to life. the plot builds what is supposed to be tension but the characters aren't developed enough to care. then it rushes through a resolution of all the outstanding problems in about a minute of screen time leaving the viewer feeling like they have just wasted their time.
