as a long-time fan of superman from the comics, through the 1950s series, the first two of the chris reeves films and lois & clark, and finally smallville, i was *really* hoping for something clever with "superman returns".<br /><br />instead we got lex luthor making *another* attempt at real-estate conversion, another superman-beaten-up-while-wearing-kryptonite sequence, and internal inconsistencies: he couldn't stop himself falling into the ocean when stuck with 6" of kryptonite, but when lois breaks off 3" of it, *leaving the rest embedded in him*, he can lift *a continent* into space?? really, the only hero in the story was lois' partner - i can't remember his name off-hand. he did all kinds of life-saving, heroic things with nothing but guts and skill - no superpowers, no invulnerability...just a normal human.<br /><br />they keep making superman so small. why can't we have superman battling brainiac or fighting to save the universe from general zod instead of lex's petty schemes. oh, i forgot...they're doing that in smallville.<br /><br />yeah...i think i'll stick to smallville...<br /><br />you probably should, too...
