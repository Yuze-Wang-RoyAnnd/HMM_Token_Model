i picked this movie up to replace the dismal choice of daytime television and to go with my thirst for femme fatales. well, for the previous, it is better than daytime television....though i'm not sure how much.<br /><br />it does have its points but after about the first 20-30 minutes, the good points pan out and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a made for tv movie that was put together with not much time to make something that will hold together. in short, a terrible sci fi channel type movie.<br /><br />it has its points such as the future is dirty, like "blade runner" showed ..... of course, this is no "blade runner". the captain looks, sort of feels like actor robert forster, the kind of person one might want to be around.<br /><br />but unfortunately, it rather ends up feeling like a bad "andromeda" rehash where the muscle of the crew consists of poor copies of the smart gunners of "aliens", the mystic is vampire willow sexually intensified, and the new captain might as well be like jan-michael vincent running around on "danger island" in the "banana splits"; he only put on the uniform with the epaulets; he's got very little right to it. all of them running around with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks very much like the 'eureka maru' as they are fighting a class of 'people' who occupy the universe and are broken up into several different tribes or sects of different evolutionary qualities.......just like the nietzcheans in "andromeda".<br /><br />it might have a redeeming feature with michael ironside, but after a while, one gets the feeling that he took the part as a hoot! he probably had fun doing it, but it doesn't help the movie much.<br /><br />it's ..... "okay". okay in the way that one might watch the dvd once without turning it off; if they watch it with commercials, they will probably change the channel. one might watch it once .......... but a few hours later, be wondering what it was that made them watch it all.<br /><br />for me, that was the femme fatale ............. when she was fighting.
