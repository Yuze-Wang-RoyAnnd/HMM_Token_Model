from the nepotism capitol of the world comes another junk flick in a fancy wrapper. "cq" tells a lame, disjointed mess of a story which is little more than a bunch of silly caricatures, a babe, and straight man davies running around trying to make a stupid sci-fi flick. i can't think of any reason anyone would want to spend time with this ridiculous attempt at film making.
