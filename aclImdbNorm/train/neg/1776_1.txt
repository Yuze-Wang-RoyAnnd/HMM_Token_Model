this film has its share of negative comments and i have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made. true, most of the films based on the works of king are pretty bad, but this one goes beyond bad into the realm of horrible. there is not one scary moment in it unless you consider stupidity scary. it is typical king garbage -- myths twisted around that made no sense in the first place, mixed with obvious and belabored so-called "scares" that are about as shocking as peewee's playhouse (which, at least, is entertaining). it is full of ridiculous moments, not the least of which is alice krige's character. when she goes on a rampage and starts quipping like the villain in an old batman tv show, it is so absurd as to be sickening. all the people who had cameos in this (including john landis)are lucky they still have careers. but the most absurd part has to be the cat costumes towards the end, which look like cheap rubber outfits someone bought at k-mart. the best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats who actually out-act the people in the movie.
