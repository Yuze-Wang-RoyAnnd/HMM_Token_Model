i wanted to like this film, i really did. it's got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat. it tries too hard to be funny in some places (the daughters over zealous cooking attempts), over reaches in others (the scene where they clean up someone's yard, so he agrees to join the team) and has some scenes that, while mildly interesting, are really just filler (all the work scene's). and i didn't find the "villians" intimidating, or worth hating, so much as i found them to be childishly annoying. <br /><br />i've met people like those in the film while playing church ball. and i will say the referee's are spot on, still, in the end, i really didn't care all that much about the characters, or their quest for church ball glory. maybe because they were all so one dimensional, which i might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall. <br /><br />kurt hale, and halestorm entertainment, has made some good films, but this is not one of them.
