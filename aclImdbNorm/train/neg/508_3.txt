early film directed by d.w. griffith; it features a gloriously happy king (arthur v. johnson) and his queen (marion leonard) - but, wait! when the king leaves the scene, his queen makes music with the palace's minstrel (henry b. walthall). when the king discovers the lovers, he decides to enact a horrific edgar allen poe-type revenge. it's difficult to believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them; although the actors are trying to look alternately noisy (the lovers) and quiet (the cement mixers). the sets make "the sealed room" look very staged. the performances are okay, and the story is easy to follow. <br /><br />*** the sealed room (9/2/09) d.w. griffith ~ arthur v. johnson, henry b. walthall, marion leonard
