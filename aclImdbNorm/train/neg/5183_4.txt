this is the first of these "8 films to die for" collection that i've seen and it's certainly not made me want to see any of the rest...although i've heard at least a couple of them are decent. i don't know, this wasn't terrible but it didn't really do much for me. your basic dysfunctional cannibal family in suburbia kind of thing, mom & dad died, the family sold the farm & moved to san francisco (?) where they continued to bring home stray food sources whenever possible. the best part of this was the creepy goth sister, who of course invites a friend over from school that never leaves. anyway, of course we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on and so on. this family is sort of like the white-bread version of the sawyer clan, they're nasty & they do bad things but they ain't go no soul. i see a lot of reviews from people that liked this, and i guess i don't know what i missed, but i found it to be very mediocre & i wouldn't recommend it to anyone, really. 4 out of 10.
