the closing song by johnny rivers was the only great thing about this movie. unfortunately that is all the positive i can say about this western movie. i have to write 8 more lines for my comments to be posted, but there is more than 8 lines of awful in this western. i am not sure if the movie was a tribute to hopa along, or just a spoof. the hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic. not realistic at all. a lot of the supporting actors in this movie looked authentic, but the shooting scenes were a joke. a previous commentator thought this movie was great, and in the comments took a cheap shot at president bush. this was not a democratic or republican western. it was just a bad western movie to be sold commercially. i wonder if it made any money. at times i thought i was watching a movie made by college movie students. if that was the case, then it was a great movie.
