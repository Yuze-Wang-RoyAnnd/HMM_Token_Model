this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life. the plot and message are horrible. there are too many mistakes in this movie that it's impossible to keep up. i don't even understand how this movie can get any nomination, let alone 2. here's why: 1) sam lee portrays a angry/irrational detective which was caused by the disappointment from his dad. pros: he's angry alright. cons: when it comes to the explanation scene, he cannot convey the sadness/disappointment he has in his father. the crying scene was too fake and it seems like he is literally squeezing out tears from the corner of his eyes.<br /><br />2) to connect the movie to the title, there were barking or dog wimping sounds during the fight scenes and rape scene, which is totally irrelevant and confusing to the viewer. i understand that it's supposed to be a metaphor or what not... but it's just sooo dumb! 3) why the heck did the cops not shoot the killer? what the heck is wrong with this movie. when the killer started stabbing an officer, shoot him. he's already dead! what the heck? there were lots of opportunity that the killer could be killed, but i do not know why he wasn't! 4) during the scene where the girl had her foot hurt. in the scene, it was very clear that the left foot of the girls was hurt, so how the heck in the next scene that she's lending all her weight on her left foot? and this is the actress nominated as the best new performer? wtf? 5) the sounds in the movie are off sync.<br /><br />6) i am guessing that this movie is trying to bring awareness of the brutality and violence among children in south east asia, so why does the bad guy wins and then the cop was joining the fight? 7) this movie is just too violent without a purpose. cops are beating ci to a pulp and then if they cooperate, they give them marijuana and coke? this is overall the worst movie. i truly feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sadist and sick person. i have never seen a more disgusting movie in my whole entire life. worst movie ever!
