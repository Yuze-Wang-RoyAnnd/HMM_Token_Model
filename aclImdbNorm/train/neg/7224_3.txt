the movie remains in the gray for far too long. very little gets explained as the movie progresses, with as a result lots of weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning but because of the way of storytelling they become only just weird and not understandable to watch. it sort of forces you to watch the movie again but no way i'm going to do that. it is that i watched this movie in the morning, i'm sure of it that if i watched this movie in the evening i would had fallen asleep. to me the movie was like a poor man's "blade runner".<br /><br />the movie leaves far too many questions and improbabilities. it makes the movie leave a pointless and non-lasting impression.<br /><br />also the weird look of the movie doesn't help much. the movie is halve cgi/halve real life but it's not done halve as good, impressive, spectacular and imaginative as for instance would be the case in later movies such as "sin city" and "300". they even created halve of the characters of the movie by computer, which seemed like a very pointless- and odd choice, also considering that the character animation isn't too impressive looking. sure the futuristic environment is still good looking and the movie obviously wasn't cheap to make but its style over substance and in this case that really isn't a positive thing to say.<br /><br />some of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting. the main god of the movie constantly says lines such as; 'i'm going to do this but it's none of your concern why i want to do it'. than just don't say anything at all mr. horus! it's irritating and a really easy thing to put in movie, if you don't care to explain anything about the plot. also the deeper questions and meanings of the movie gets muddled in the drivel of the movie and its script.<br /><br />the actors still did their very best. they seemed like they believed in the project and were sure of it that what they were making would be something special. so i can't say anything negative about them.<br /><br />the story and movie is far from original. it rip-offs from a lot of classic and semi-classic, mostly modern, science-fiction movies. it perhaps is also the reason why the movie made a very redundant impression on me.<br /><br />a failed and uninteresting movie experiment.<br /><br />3/10
