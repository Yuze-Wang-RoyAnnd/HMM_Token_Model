why oh why can't anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale? this is the second adaptation of "beowulf" i've been disappointed with in a year. but i have to say, the previous version ("beowulf & grendel", starring gerald butler) was far superior to this. that one was only a little disappointing. this one is a mess!!! <br /><br />what bugged me most? was it the useless plot elements they added in for no particular reason (human sacrifices? pointless love interest?), or the bad cgi, or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired acting? even worse was the way they made beautiful marina sirtis look so horrible!!! and lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow? <br /><br />and why did they continually remind us that beowulf had the strength of 30 men, and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the entire film. he was tossed around by both monsters he fought, relying on his sidekicks to save his bacon. even when he slugged the arrogant prince, he didn't knock him out. he was much too reliant on weapons. beo-wimp is more like it. this was certainly not the powerful beowulf of the epic poem! <br /><br />i'd like to end this on a positive note but i can't really think of one offhand. all i can say is, if you've ever read "beowulf", you'll be infinitely disappointed by this dismal, inaccurate excuse for an adaptation!
