i came at this film with high expectations. i was aware of greenaway's work and 'the tempest' and was interested in an adaptation. i first wanted to switch off after ten minutes, but felt that it would be unfair. there was a representation of a storm, but where in your mind do you conceive a small boy peeing over a toy boat? it is symbolic of what? i continued another ten minutes my finger twitching over the 'off' button, somewhere something would capture my interest. this is not shakespeare, it is not cinema. there is a time and place for it, but i will not waste my time and there is no place for it in my studies of shakespeare. after twenty five minutes i gave up and that was the end. i then read all the comments on this website and the pretentiousness of the film is only matched by its defendants. 'its a painting.....then put it in a gallery', 'it's a ballet.....keep it on the stage then'. shakespeare can be done intelligently, and the plays were performed to mass audiences, they were accessible, and this version helps put a wedge between shakespeare and the general population at large - and i do not think that the bard would be happy with that.
