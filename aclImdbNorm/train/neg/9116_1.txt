there isn't one decent scene.<br /><br />amy adams gives one of the worst performances of all time. proof that you a can start anywhere. the guy playing sebastian sucks, too. he doesn't even look much like ryan phillipe. more like joshua jackson. the two other girls are terrible, as well. <br /><br />then the dialogue is also crap.<br /><br />sebastian (about to have threesome): if you cant beat them... <br /><br />virgin girl: who says you can't beat 'em?<br /><br />lame.<br /><br />the ending contradicts the entire plot of the original. in the first film, it is clearly stated that kathryn and sebastian never had sex. one of the reasons sebastian wanted kathryn so bad, aside from the fact that she's played by sarah michelle gellar, was that she was "the only girl he couldn't have and it killed him". she was a tease who liked playing with him. the fact that she never gave it to him increased his wanting. then in this p.o.s., it implies that he can have her, along with a girl on the side. what? and we don't even see the sex, either. it's implied, making it not only stupid, pointless, and contradictory, but worthless too.<br /><br />and in the first one, kathryn rejects sebastian because he fell in love, making him a loser. even though he won the bet, that crumbled his chances. then in this excrement, he looses and falls in love. so she doesn't screw "losers", only complete losers? another thing: it's stated that sebastian has never been in love, so what do you call the thing with virgin girl?<br /><br />then at the end, virgin girl is all of sudden revealed to be kathryn's evil lesbian lover (dun dun dun) and, like i said, they go into a lame offscreen threesome. stupid. <br /><br />there's several other plot contradictions. did the writer even see the first film? a 5 year old can point his stuff out.<br /><br />after the threesome, sebastian has sex with the blonde virgin, corrupting her innocent mind in the back of a limo while kathryn and virgin girl turned evil lesbian in lame sudden plot twist sit in the front, listen, and smile evilly into the camera. <br /><br />the end... <br /><br />seeing sebastian become the ass hole he was in the first one could have made an interesting film. i guess all it took to make little sebastian bad was a threesome with two hot girls. interesting.
