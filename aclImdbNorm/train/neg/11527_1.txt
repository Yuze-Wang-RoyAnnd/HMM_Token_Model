<br /><br />the movie starts out as an ordinary comic-hero-movie. it's about the boy who is picked on, has no parents and is madly in love with the schools #1 girl. nothing surprises in the movie, there is nothing that you can't guess coming in the movie. toby mcguire shows us that either he is no good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this one. maybe kids around the age of ten can enjoy the film but it is a bit violent for the youngest. you can't get away from thinking of movies like x-men, batman and spawn. all of those titles are better. i almost walked out the last 20 minutes! one thing that could have been good though was the computeranimation, but not even that is anything to put in the christmas-tree! so my recomendation: don't see this film even if you get paid for it!
