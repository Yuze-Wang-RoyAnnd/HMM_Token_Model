i watched the malayalam movie "boeing boeing" made in 1985 (which in turn is probably inspired by an english movie of same name) long back. the basic story of garam masala is the same - but it is told in a pathetic way, the classy jokes replaced by routine ones which are found in normal hindi movies (probably the director did this to suit the taste of hindi audience)... <br /><br />i haven't seen the english original. but had really enjoyed the malayalam film (made by priyadarshan himself)which was a side splitting comedy, back then. of course the acting by mohanlal,mukesh and sukumari (who did the cook's role) was so natural and spontaneous.<br /><br />probably, i am too smitten by the malayalam film that i cannot tolerate even the smaller flaws in its hindi remake. but i still feel that akshay kumar and john abraham have overacted. paresh rawal has done a decent job - but doesn't reach anywhere near sukumari.<br /><br />but all in all its ok, if one compares it to other recent hindi comedy movies.
