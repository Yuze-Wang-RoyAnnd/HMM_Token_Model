as others have said, "no, luciano" is a more apt title or response to this movie title. for entertainment, the great opera singer should stick to singing.....not that he's a terrible actor. it's just that this movie stinks.<br /><br />the first 25 minutes were fine - a nice family movie, as it were - but after that it's nothing but a boring soap opera.<br /><br />appropriately playing a singer, pavarotti, as "giorgio fini," loses his voice a few times and the doctor, "pamela taylor" (kathryn harrold) comes to the rescue. the singer then falls for the doctor, the doctor slowly falls for the singer, the two argue all the time and on and on and on it goes.<br /><br />pavarotti has a winning smile and is a likable guy. it's harrold that spoils things and after watching her here i am not surprised she didn't become a star. <br /><br />there is nice scenery in the movie to enjoy, good shots of san francisco and italy, at least in the first half of the film. i got bored and don't remember much about the second half of it.
