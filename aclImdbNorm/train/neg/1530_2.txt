i wished i'd taped men in white so i could watch it again<br /><br />" what ? you mean you really enjoyed it theo ? " <br /><br />no i mean i could watch it again to see if it was as retarded , stupid and as embarrassingly unfunny as i can remember it <br /><br />a lot of people have claimed it was made for children . may i suggest it was also made by children ? because the whole structure of the script lacks any type of discipline on the part of the producers and writers and much of set pieces seem to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time <br /><br />the cast don't help but i genuinely started to feel sorry for them . honestly you can believe that during filming the cast had to lie to their families that they were filming a hard core porn film such was their embarrassment at having to appear in something as dismal as this . to give you an idea of how bad the acting is every time baywatch babe donna d'ericco disappeared from the narrative i waited patiently for her to reappear then seconds later i forgot she was in the movie . got that ? a star from baywatch appears and seconds later you forget they're in the movie . this tells you all you need to know about the standard of men in white <br /><br />fair enough it's trying to be a live action cartoon similar to the goodies ( although the dismals would be a better adjective for this movie ) , though perhaps the movie deserves some credit for never descending to toilet humour , but considering this is a kids movie ( this didn't stop itv broadcasting it at 11 pm ) then there should be no near the knuckle humour in it anyway
