city girl meg tilly receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and, understandably shaken, returns home to her family's rural digs, only to be faced with a mystery: why are all the homespun residents acting out in bizarre and unsettling ways? radiation thriller, with barely a nod to ecology, has small town residents going berserk, which (laughably) includes two women gazing at each other with desire in a public place and tim matheson receiving oral attention from a girl on an office bench. the picture is too silly for words, wasting tilly's wistfulness and quiet intensity on trash while forcing itself into a corner it can't possibly hope to get out of. some of the cinematography by thomas del ruth is good (particularly a fire sequence set inside a garage), though he is let down by the scrappy editing--and a fairly bathetic finale. simplistic screenplay has nary a surprise nor a shred of originality up its sleeve. *1/2 from ****
