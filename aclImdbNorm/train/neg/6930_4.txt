dr tarr's torture dungeon is about a journalist who travels to an insane asylum to write about a new technique they use with their patients. however, the journalist soon finds out that things are not what they seem to be, and the asylum is being run by the patients, and the doctors are in cages. first of all, some parts of the film are just plain boring and just makes you want to fall asleep, and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons(a guy who thinks he's a chicken, for instance). i have to admit that the story is actually pretty good, but the film itself bombs. the music of the film is really odd and like something you would hear in some insane comedy, and yes, there is a scene involving dancing chicken men, which pretty much made me want to shut off the screen. watch this film at your own risk! <br /><br />rated: r for violence and nudity.
