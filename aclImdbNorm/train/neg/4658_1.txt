brief encounter is a ghastly and pointless remake of the 1945 david lean classic, which was based on noel coward's play "still life". a doctor removes a particle of grit from a woman's eye at a railway station, he is in a miserable relationship, she is happily married social worker of italian ancestry. they meet by accident on another occasion, form an instant attraction and arrange to meet each other every wednesday. the pair fall in love, but after spending a few afternoons together they realise that they have no realistic chance of happiness and agree to part. coward's original one-act play concerned two ordinary people who fall in love. sophia loren and richard burton, two super stars and veterans of hollywood epics, are nobody's idea of 'ordinary people'. loren in particular is miscast - sophia loren in full make-up, looking like a million dollars, working as a part-time voluntary social worker at a citizen advice bureau just doesn't ring true. burton, looking haggard, with dyed hair, too much make-up and wearing platform shoes, doesn't come across as your average general practitioner. that said, you can't really blame them for having an affair after seeing their spouses. burton is married to a literary critic who spends her evenings penning poisonous reviews and who treats her husband with total contempt. loren's husband, jack hedley, potters around the house all day and is terminally boring: the most exciting thing he has ever done is nearly have an affair six years previous. their final scene together will induce nausea, ("you've been a long, long way away", etc.). that great british jobbing actor, john lemesurier, has a three minute cameo as burton's friend, and appears to be slightly inebriated, speaking his lines in a barely audible voice. it's a sad and forgettable performance in a dismal, awful rehash of a cinema classic. avoid at all costs.
