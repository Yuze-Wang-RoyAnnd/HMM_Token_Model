wanda nevada is a pubescent fantasy movie using circa 1979 ideas of what constitutes illicit romance for 13 year old girls. script, pacing, and direction are uniformly awful. action sequences defy belief. characters speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in films aimed at the under 10 set, but also includes multiple sexual references involving shields' character as well as graphic deaths. <br /><br />the movie wants to be a comedy on some level but is never funny, an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid, and a children's movie but introduces pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities. it also wants to be a buddy picture, a coming of age picture, a ghost movie, an indian spiritual movie, a travelogue, and a western. the overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist. wanda nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see a good many terrific shots of the grand canyon. that it manages to do just fine.
