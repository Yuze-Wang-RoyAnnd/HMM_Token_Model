this sword-&-sorcery story of an appallingly brutal and callous "hero" vanquishing an evil king is worthless in almost every detail. the acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles. the leering, gloating glee with which the director shows the hero smearing blood around is absolutely disgusting; nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause, since he is as bad as the people he's fighting. z-movie editing is abundant, including a scene where a character "dies" from a sword thrust that very obviously missed completely!<br /><br />the movie is clearly banking on the charms of the female leads, barbi benton and lana clarkson, who are paraded around mostly naked throughout the movie. as a 20-something male, i will not pretend that female flesh on the screen doesn't attract me. but the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and joyless, that i couldn't enjoy even this aspect of the movie.<br /><br />most cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek feel (the sequel is better in this regard), but deathstalker seems to take itself completely seriously as heroic fantasy. no way! avoid at all costs!<br /><br />rating: 1/2 out of ****.
