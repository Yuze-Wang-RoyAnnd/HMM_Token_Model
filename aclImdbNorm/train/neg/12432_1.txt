this is the worst ripoff of home alone movies that i have ever seen! watch part 1 and two, but don't let anyone say that this is better than the first two! i mean, really, you don't make a movie, then make a sequel with the same characters and actors, and then make another sequel with different characters and actors! i mean, it would have been ok if this wan't a "home alone" movie, but they did make it a home alone movie. culkin is too old now, so you're suppose to stop making sequels! goodness, this movie makes me sick! buy part 1 and 2.
