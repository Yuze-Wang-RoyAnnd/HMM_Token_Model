i believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war, avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles. zvezda barely does the first. zvezda being a russian war film, i was expecting patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful poetic pictures, a lush score, slavic cheekbones and cruel germans. what i didn't need was the naive love non-affair, the unrealistically silly war scenes and the abuse of the syrupy soundtrack in a film which avoided carefully all historical or political references (stalinism, nazism, holocaust) only to end on a passing but nonetheless insulting to our sense of history endnote about "liberating poland". a missed opportunity as a film but not as propaganda apparently.
