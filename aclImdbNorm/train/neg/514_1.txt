this is one of the most insipid, lackluster, unoriginal, and pointless movies ever made! it almost feels like everyone involved in this project didn't even try to make an appealing movie. this is nothing more than a continuation of a tiresome series of films that attempt to cash in on the success of smokey and the bandit, which i think is the best film of them all. as for this waste of film stock, burt reynolds sleepwalks his way through the entire movie, jim nabors is wasted, the other actors aren't given very much to do, the car races are obviously stock footage, the humor is uninspired, and many of the scenes are more dull and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours. "stroker ace" is simply a superfluous film with nothing unique or distinctive about it.
