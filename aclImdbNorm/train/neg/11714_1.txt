the us appear to run the uk police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that cid officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub! this has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of "real" uk police that has ever been foisted on the unsuspecting public. i can see that mr snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like charles dance was doing in it is a mystery.<br /><br />worse than the worse low budget "b" film of the 50's. an hour and a half of suicide and time i will never get back.<br /><br />avoid it like the veritable plague.
