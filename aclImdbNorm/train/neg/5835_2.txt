ah winter kills , based on the novel by richard condon which deals with a conspiracy that killed the president of the united states 20 years ago . i knew condon also wrote the manchurian candidate which dealt with a similar theme and was looking forward to seeing an intelligent thriller<br /><br />winter kills left me cold . it's not a thriller - it's a piece of worthless crap , possibly the worst movie i've seen this month and boy have i seen a lot of bad movies in june . the problem lies in both the direction and the script and seeing as william richert was responsible for both then he should be blamed entirely for this unfunny farce <br /><br />there's two things wrong with this movie . first off is the way everything is presented in a totally over the top manner . it's not as ott as say something like that james bond movie with david niven and peter sellers but everything has a farcial edge to it with actors completely mugging their performances . this might have been justified if there was entertainment value to the movie but there's none . as a satire it's very silly , so silly that it becomes almost unwatchable . secondly the scenes seem to have been cut so much that they're rendered senseless . take for example a scene where the hero is confronting a loopy militia leader called dawson . dawson tells the hero he has 30 seconds start then it cuts to the hero being on board a plane . the scenes begin and end with no rhyme nor reason<br /><br />a dire movie that's an ordeal to sit through
