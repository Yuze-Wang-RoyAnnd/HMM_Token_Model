left behind is the kind of "we know what we know cause we know it" movie that christians (and most any other naive person) needs to help them feel like what they "think" and "believe" (not "know") is right. but, at the same time i feel bad for the little guys, because this is not a well made film. it does not help any message. i work at a video store, and i know the only reason people went to see this movie was because they were religious and they thought it was. anybody on this earth who thinks they know what will happen in the future is wrong, unless they think they know that they don't know. i've had about enough (but only after i've had too much) of these people walking around with their noses in the air thinking that a movies starring a semi-talented tv actor means something above me.<br /><br />please, if you love yourself you'll stay away. i refuse to go into any detail about this movie (not because a-i didn't see it (because i did), b-it was too shocking for my atheist-self to handle (because it wasn't), or c-i really don't have anything to say bad about it (because i do). the reason, (which is a word nobody who helped make this movie understands) is that i want this movie out of my head, i want that it was made out of my head, i want that i watched all of it with an open mind out of my head, i want the message that kirk so proudly and coachly gives at the end of the movie out of my head. i only want all the things that were in my head before viewing this movies there, anything directly connected with this movie that's floating in my head get out! my peaceful rage is ending. i'm sorry that somebody in this world went to the theater to see this movie about what could happen in the future (but won't) when they could have given that seven dollars plus to any number of human, animal, or rain forest charity. but if they did that then they wouldn't be able to "believe" in the fact that it's real, they might have to fact what is. left behind zero (out of ****)
