i recently saw this at the 2009 palm springs international film. this is the feature length directorial debut of veteran dutch actress monique van de ven and based on my observation it should be her last. i hate movies that are so implausible that you are picking apart practically every scene. this film immediately leaves you scratching your head. as it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization are having a leisurely drive through the taliban-controlled mountains afghanistan having a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them. they get out of their vehicle to watch as talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, handguns and grenades execute all five people in the truck. bob (waldemar torenstra) starts taking pictures of all this when he is spotted by one of the insurgents who lobs a hand grenade at them that kills his girlfriend. since they are with hand throwing distance they can't be more than 50 yards away yet he somehow gets away. his girlfriend is blown up and he takes a picture of the moment of the grenade impact that kills her and wins a prize as photographer of the year for the photo. every scene and situation in this film as as ridiculous as it's opening. the following year bob finds himself on assignment for national geographic on a dutch resort island where he meets kathleen (sophie hilbrand) and inserts himself into her seedy underworld of international drug smugglers. avoid this film. i would give it a 4.0 out of 10.
