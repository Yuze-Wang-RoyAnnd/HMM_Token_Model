the only words you need fear more than joe don baker if your thinking of watching a film are greydon clark , and if they are both there , run for your life . however this is a very funny film because they actually take themselves seriously ! it starts out bad and goes downhill from there , repeated scenes , the good the bad and the ugly like shootout will have you rolling on the floor with laughter .yes , he's the best deputy sheriff in texas , tracking a mafia hit-man to malta as only he can . he makes his own rules , does things his own way , all the while wearing cowboy boots and sidearms cowboy style . you want to see a bad but funny film ? go ahead on , its your move !
