this movie is a perfect adaptation of the english flick unfaithful. ashmit plays the role of richard gere, emran that of olivier and malikka the perfect cheating wife role of lane.they have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the indian masses. <br /><br />even then the movie has got the full traces of unfaithful, though it couldn't catch up with the original. it was a cheap soft porn of the bollywood lovers, where mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show. emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer. in the future if the indian directors plan to remake a english movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the indian censors. though the film bombed at the box office, the actors got the undue recognition. in future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a oscar nominated film. <br /><br />all said, this is not a family film, so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family.
