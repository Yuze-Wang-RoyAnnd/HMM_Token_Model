oh my god, what a horrible film. the film has all the right people involved, unfortunately it is not worth watching. i saw it for free at my local library. if i had paid to watch this i would be even more upset. this film is unwatchable. how could tarintino be involved with such a slow paced, unexciting film. no wonder it didn't get much distribution, every one involved must have been ashamed. i can make a better film with a dated camcorder and my big toe. its beyond boring, i really hated it. tarintino just lost some standing in my eyes. this must be some kind of sick joke. don't bother with this film. if some one even hints you should watch it, kill them.
