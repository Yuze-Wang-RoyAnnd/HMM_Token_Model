as far as films go, this is likable enough. entertaining characters, good dialogue, interesting enough story. i would have really quite liked it had i not been irritated immensely whilst watching at the utter disrespect it shows the city it is set in.<br /><br />glasgow. in scotland. yet every character is english (save for sean's girlfriend, who is dutch). scottish accents are heard only fleetingly in menial jobs & roles. as a scottish woman (& as a viewer who likes her "real life" films to be a bit more like real life) i really don't think it would have hurt to use any one of the countless talented scottish actors...or at least got english ones who could toss together a decent accent! the futile attempt at using the word "wee" a few times did nothing but to further the insult.
