one of the previous reviewers wrote that there appeared to be no middle ground for opinions of love story; one loved it or hated it. but there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions throughout the scale of 1 to 10. for me, this movie rated a 4. there are some beautiful scenes and locations, and ray milland turns in a fabulous job as oliver's father. but the movie did not do a particularly compelling job of telling its story, and the story was not so unique as to warrant multiple viewings, at least, not for me. i may be a bit of a snob, but i tend to avoid movies with ryan o'neal -- i still haven't seen barry lyndon -- because most of them, but not all, are ruined for me by his presence. the lone exception is what's up, doc?, in which his straight performance is the perfect underlining for barbra streisand's goofball protagonist -- and, not coincidentally, he takes a shot at love story for good measure! mcgraw and o'neal tend to mug their lines, rather than act them.<br /><br />this movie is notable for the beginning of one fine career: it was tommy lee jones's first movie.
