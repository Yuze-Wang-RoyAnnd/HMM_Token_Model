i could barely keep myself from either nodding off or just turning off this turd, but i decided to stick it out if only for the reasoning that maybe *something* would happen. this is the work of a writer/producer/director/special fx, kenneth herts, who wants to make a statement on ecological damage while making a monster movie. that's what he wanted, anyway. what it turns out to be is a lot of acting, either slightly hammy or just mundane and without much merit, and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as the monster attacks in the river waters (oh, and what luck, a woman just happens to be naked in it... even though there have already been disappearances!) <br /><br />this is just nonsensical stuff, but i suppose it's not too harmful; it's not very obnoxious at the least and once or twice we get a semi-interesting peek at brazilian "culture" (which is the father walking through town with his flock or other pieces of a semblance of 'hey, this is not america!'). but whatever hope the director had in casting mitchum or carradine is squandered on at best pedestrian and at worst excruciatingly banal and dumb dialog. it doesn't help that when we finally get something of a good look at the monster and the "action" happens, it too is stupidly staged and with only sleazy appeal. usually i would feel sorry for a filmmaker who had a lot of problems getting a particular picture finished- in this case it took the better part of the mid 70s- but with monstroid or monster or whatever it's called... nah.<br /><br />if you happen to get the elvira dvd double-feature of this (bad print with bad transfer quality) with blue sunshine, make sure to skip this one. unless, of course, you're an elvira die-hard and can't help yourself to hear her luscious commentary; personally, i'd rather get joel or mike nelson with the robots from mystery science theater on this roast turkey.
