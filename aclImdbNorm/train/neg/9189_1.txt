this movie has received a lot of bad press from people who don't understand what it was meant to be. one must understand that this movie was never meant to be taken seriously. it's camp, along the same lines as "army of darkness." aod was silly, but funny and bad in a good way. "house of the dead" fails to be "good bad.".<br /><br />there are qualities inherent in good campy movies, most important of those being believable fantasy. one needs to believe what's happening in a movie to see the humor when a situation goes incredibly wrong. without boundaries, the movie becomes absurd. hotd lacks any believability.<br /><br />worse still, hotd brings nothing new to the genre, and repeats the same plot twists and character reactions that many horror movies inevitably start to exhibit. for example, all too often, horror movies fall into the trap where the main characters find love amongst the gore and destruction. i don't know about you, but when i'm being chased by zombies, i wanna make out with a hot chick. believe it? no? then, you probably won't believe it when the characters start sucking each other's faces in this movie.<br /><br />beyond the obvious issues that plague this movie like so many other horror movies, uwe boll elected to add scenes from the video game of zombies being shot, randomly whenever a character shoots a zombie in the movie. not only is there no clear rationale for this artistic choice, but it distracts one from an already unbelievable plot. further, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting, and seemingly no attempts by the director to guide the actors' reactions to events... leaving the movie with no redeeming qualities. avoid...
