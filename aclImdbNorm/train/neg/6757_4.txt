odd slasher movie from producer charles band. in the days of full moon's greatest success band said that he would never make "real killer films" because he felt that little puppets and big monsters added a fantasy element that made the films better - people killing each other is thus real and less fun. a nice philosophy and a true shame that band, having destroyed the full moon studio through possible shoddy business dealings became so desperate for home cinema profits that he started making exactly what the likes of blockbuster wanted and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality. the team behind this one also worked on 'delta delta die!' and 'birth rite' - both equally bland by full moon standards. debbie rochon is on usual top form here as a newbie to a gang of dudes and dudettes who decide to make up a story about a 'murder club'. she - as one would obviously - does all she can to join and then panic sets in because it was not a true story and silly ms rochon believed it and now everybody will have to run around getting covered in blood and maybe killing each other or maybe not. the choice is there's and with regard to this movie its yours...not recommended but not entirely bad either.
