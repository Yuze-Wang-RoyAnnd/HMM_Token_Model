jimmy dean could not have been more hammy or absurdly loutish. hysterical if viewed through the eyes of mystery science theatre 3000, which i rate as a 10. i mean, the sight of this obese, corn-fed hog trouncing around malta should be enough to send you to the vomitory, if you make it that far into the film. this ugly, hysterical farce should be placed with the likes of "booty call", "pumpkinhead", "swarm", and "the smurfs go to bangladesh". a -gulp- film like this proves that sometimes actors, writers, producers, etc. get behind on their mortgage, or get stoned to the point of insanity. it begs the question "who was so stupid to finance such a whale?" but then, had good judgment prevailed and "final justice" never was, then we wouldn't have the delightful spoof voice-over in "mystery science theatre 3000"!
