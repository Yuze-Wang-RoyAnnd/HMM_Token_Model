not even timothy hutton or david duchovny could save this dead fish of a film. for starters, the script was definitely written to be made into a b-film, but somehow duchovny (looking for a star vehicle to elevate himself out of television) and hutton (looking for the "two" of a "one-two punch" he had hoped would define his career after "ordinary people") became attached to the picture. cheesy lines, big bad wipes from scene to scene (come on--who uses wipes after 12th grade telecommunications class?), and plain old bad acting sink this film. even duchovny is not immune to the bad acting plague that is this film. only timothy hutton rises above the material at all. i must admit feeling duchovny's pain as he read the lines that are the voice-over. while i found myself laughing when i'm sure the director wanted me to feel terrified, nothing prepared me for the closing line of duchonvey's voice-over: "if you ever need a doctor, be sure to call 911." if only the studio had called 911, this dog of a motion picture would never have been made. avoid at all costs. <br /><br />
