this might be the worst film ever made, and is possibly worth seeing for that reason alone. streisand is laughably unbelievable as a young woman posing as a man in order to study judaism. the soundtrack is torturous, featuring barbara belting out some of the weakest blather ever put to film. and don't even get me started on the plot. you will actually get more chuckles out of this film than many comedies because it is soooooooo terrible. the rampant ego of streisand, thinking she could somehow raise this stinker to oscar heights, led to this disaster. i'm pretty sure the novelist, isaac bashevis singer, hated this film and never forgave streisand. i can't blame him. this movie is like watching a car wreck in slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack of 'the sound of music' being played backwards on an old turntable. it's truly that bad. i'm amazed that anyone from streisand enjoyed this movie on the level that it was intended.
