this movie causes more unintentional laughter than anything else i've ever seen. really, if you are a tolkien fan, rent it just to laugh at it with your friends. i won't be the millionth person to rip apart its flaws... all i will say is that the movie (for me, anyway) lost major points for turning my favorite character, sam, into a bumbling idiot. shame, shame... 3/10
