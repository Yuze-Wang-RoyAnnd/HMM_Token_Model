woody allen has made some of the greatest comedies ever and i would seriously consider saying that annie hall is the greatest movie ever but if i really think about it i will probably think of one or two that are better, but it would be hard. he has had of course some films that aren't quite good but not that bad either like manhattan murder mystery and sweet and lowdown but he has never before had a film quite as bad as melinda and melinda. not quite so tired and so unfunny, his films are usually witty and hilarious but how did this happen, is it still our good old woody? the plot runs around four friends who are having dinner together. two are play writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of hers. it is about a young woman who bursts in on a dinner party unexpected. we never hear the rest because the two play writes start to debate whether it would make a better comedy or tragedy. than we begin to see the two points of view. both center on this woman named melinda who is having trouble both with drugs and with her ex-husband. in the tragedy she is an old family friend who after attempting suicide decided to show up at her old best friends front door for no apparent reason. the comedy is about melida who stumbles in on the dinner party after popping 28 sleeping pills. both go on a wild whirl wind of events that never really make sense or fit together, or make you laugh more than once or twice. there are some nice performances by radha mitchell and will ferrell but they can't fit it together on there own. they cam't stop it from sinking farther down than most of the other films this year.
