i only saw this movie once, and that was enough for me. the movie has very little if any plot and seems to be nothing but continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little of anything else. i wanted to see this movie because it starred zoe trilling of the second "night of the demons;" and i wanted to see her playing someone normal. unfortunately, the tobe hooper script barely begins and goes nowhere as robert englund dominates the film and chews up the scenery and plot. zoe, i know where you are now; hiding from this film !
