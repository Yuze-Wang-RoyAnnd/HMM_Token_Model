daniella has some issues brewing under her attractive exterior. she starts to lose her mind when she finds out about a distant relative (who she resembles) that was burned for being a werewolf. she goes a bit feral when she beads horny men and slashes out their throats. she does eventually find a man that helps contain her inner beast but when others ruin their bliss she extracts her violent and furry revenge.<br /><br />'werewolf woman' isn't a very goof film but it does pose as a good crowd film. a fun time could be had by harping the bad acting / dubbing / translation and the just plain cheesiness of the production. but on it's own it moves slowly but does have ample nudity to keep you awake
