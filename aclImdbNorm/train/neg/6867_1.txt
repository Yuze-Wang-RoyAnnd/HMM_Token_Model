we can start with the wooden acting but this film is a disaster. having grown up in ny i can tell you that this film is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or the people. i'm not even a defender of the culture in any way and found this to be a hollywoodized piece of trash to fit its own fictional, ridiculous culture presentation and language that anyone who watches seinfeld knows is inaccurate. this is a colossal waste of time and, even worse, is not exactly interesting since the outcome is obvious and the scenes of confrontation are laughably bad. who acts this way? nobody.<br /><br />the writer's name sounds israeli or something of that nature but it is clear he doesn't have a clue about the subject he is writing about. looking at his bio, it is shocking he lived in new york and wonder how much real connection he had with the community. even mediocre films like "a stranger among us" are better and more closer to the truth than this dreck. reading this guy's credits it's no wonder he has written scripts on all c grade films that somehow feature stars. shocking. perhaps he knows someone because this script is even below par for a bad dolph lundgren film.
