despite the mysteriously positive reviews and high rating, this is an awful movie. awful enough, that l feel obligated to warn you how bad it is. <br /><br />the movie is set in the final period of the raj, during the time of india's fight for independence. what follows in the ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief. what the characters do and how they behave just does not persuade me that the characters exist in that era. <br /><br />for instance, would the young married hindu housemaid from the local village have an affair with her married englishman master, knowing full well that discovery of the affair would likely mean utter social ostracization and shame if not mortal punishment? unlikely, but still maybe. however, would the same young hindu housemaid, in the conservative society of india of that era carry on like a half naked britney spears in heat, partake in hot outdoor sex during daylight in open view where they might be discovered at any moment? that is not only bloody unlikely, that is a retarded plot line.<br /><br />such idiocies combined with the poor acting, drove me to leave the cinema an hour into the movie, so i did not watch the second half of the movie. one could only hope the ending is of more intelligence than what i saw in the first half.
