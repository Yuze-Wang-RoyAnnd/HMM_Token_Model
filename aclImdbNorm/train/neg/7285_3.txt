the sun should set on this movie, forever.<br /><br />it goes on forever (which isn't usually a bad thing - the english patient, schindler's list) but is so tedious. the aging of the actors is unbelievable and so is the drawn-out never-ending story line which really seems to go nowhere.<br /><br />in short, a waste of talent and film.
