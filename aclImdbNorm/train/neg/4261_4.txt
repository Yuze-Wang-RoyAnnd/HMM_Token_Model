pathetic. this is what happens when director comes to work just because someone is paying him to. <br /><br />the intentions were good, great locations and settings for a film of epic proportions. but the performance, damn! i swear, in some shots you can see extras on the background staring in the camera, or looking at the actors because no one told them what they should do when they hear "action!". the battle scenes are so bad you wonder - are these people for real? they could've done more damage just by hugging each other. in the slow-mo scenes you can see people on battle field walking around or just standing, waving their hands. <br /><br />only action in the foreground is somehow emphasized. but for what? the story is so illogical and discontinuous, it seems like random situations in chronological order, sometimes not even that. the dialogs are dumb, the love plot is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in hong kong action movies. <br /><br />with a budget of 40 million, and you can see every dollar invested on the screen, in best case scenario, the final result of all this enormous effort is a shiny round laser disk in the thin cover placed on the shelf in video store.
