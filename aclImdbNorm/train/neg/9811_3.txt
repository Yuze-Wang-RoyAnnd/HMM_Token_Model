what can i say??? this movie was so dumb & stupid i thought it was a psychotic drag comedy - they should rename it "bitching pregnant cat fight!" what a stupid waste of time , if you want to see(die die!!! "i want your baby drag queen) jennifer tilly being her freaky self then just rent out one of the "chucky" movie, oh ya , "the bride of chucky." it's more fun watching the two ugly plastic dolls (one of them jennifer tilly turned into the ugly female version of chucky) having squeaky plastic rubber sex then watching daryl hannah being pregnant , dumb & stupid; & jennifer tilly grinding up her husbang in a food processor reminded me of my mother trying to do house work! ok it's just bad!!!
