i read in the papers that w.snipes was broke so no wonder he would take parts in low budget projects like the contractor.he is just the next action star to join a growing club:the penniless action stars of the 90s (van damme,segal,lundgren,snipes). here he stars the lead in a cheap action flick which was shot in bulgaria( we are supposed to believe that the location is london, like only a complete moron would buy that)the story is the one of 1000 other movies: retired special forces good guy gets hired by the government again to do a wet job- after that government wants to get rid of him- good guy gets away after killing bad guys (was that a spoiler? guess not!) the star of the movie: the little girl (eliza bennett) outperforms everybody else of the cast!!!one star is for her plus one star for eye candy lena headey, makes 2 stars. only for die hard snipes fans!everybody else:avoid!
