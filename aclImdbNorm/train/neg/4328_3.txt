any movie with "national lampoon" in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die a death in london,england,paris,france,rome,italy,and anywhere in germany.it may be an institution in the u.s. but it is practically unknown in europe to the larger audience."national lampoon's european vacation" is unlikely to rectify that situation. the appalling griswalds are just that - appalling.they are not funny. clearly mr chevy chase thinks he's funny, after all miss b.di angelo laughs a lot at his jokes,but she's getting paid for it and didn't have to fork out lb2.50 for the privilege. the section set in england is typical.the same old same old tv performers, messrs idle,smith,coltrane,miss m.lippman trot out the same old same old tired clich'es,mr chase gets lost in the hotel corridor....yawn,yawn,yawn.. bucking - ham palace,big ben......i feel cheated that we never saw bobbies on bicycles two-by-two.........rosie red cheeks on the little chil - dren,need i go on? the english are buffoons,the french vicious - tongued yank-haters.the germans pompous and puffed up,(don't mention the war,clark),and the italians lecherous bottom-pinchers.have i forgotten anything? every possible "comic" situation is worked to death,mr chase gurns desperately,miss di angelo dimples sweetly,the children are embarrassingly bad. the fact that this franchise ran as long as it did must bring comfort to those who propound that you never lose money by underestimating public taste.
