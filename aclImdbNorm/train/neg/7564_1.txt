the wicker man. i am so angry that i cannot write a proper comment about this movie.<br /><br />the plot was ridiculous, thinly tied together, and altogether-just lame. nicolas cage...shame on you! i assumed that since you were in it, that it would be at least decent. it was not.<br /><br />i felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor, and even if it's complete-the movie was just outlandish and silly.<br /><br />at the end you're left mouth agape, mind befuddled and good taste offended. i have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred. people were complaining about it in small groups in the mall, four floors down from the theater near the entrance. it's that bad.<br /><br />i heard it compared to : glitter, american werewolf in paris and gigli. my boyfriend was so mad he wouldn't even talk about it.<br /><br />grrrr!
