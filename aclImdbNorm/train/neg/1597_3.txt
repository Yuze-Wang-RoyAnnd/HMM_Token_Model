this movie is rated a classic on sentiment not on any quality of movie-making. it moves from the unlikely to the unbelievable, from the unrealistic to the ludicrous.<br /><br />the unbelievable plot revolves around an attempt by two british soldiers and a hindu gofer to rescue a third soldier who has been captured by insurgent indians. in the later scene we see a full regiment with drum and bagpipes marching into an ambush. in the british army, a sergeant does not order up a rescue attempt, and if you get past that, he does not attempt it with only one other soldier and an indian servant when there is a full regiment on hand. the indian insurgents are so incredibly inept it is laughable...there are hundreds of them but they can't hold their prisoner or kill the two rescuers, of course not. at one point we see the british soldiers throwing blocks of stone down from the battlements at the insurgents, who are scattered around the mountainside in ambush...one would have to have an eggplant for a brain to think this would do any damage. after cary grant as the rescued prisoner is shot, he lies on the floor looking around at the water boy...hardly the actions of someone who has been shot in the back. the water boy bravely blows a bugle (which comes from nowhere) to sound the alarm...this he does by standing up high on a wall so he can be seen and shot by the bad guys, and we shed a tear as he keeps trying to sound more notes as he is repeatedly shot and the bugle call breaks up into feeble squawks...instead of blowing the bugle while hiding behind cover as anybody with half a brain would do. this scene has deservedly been parodied in comedy sketches. if they wanted to make a buster keaton comedy, they should have hired keaton and done it better.
