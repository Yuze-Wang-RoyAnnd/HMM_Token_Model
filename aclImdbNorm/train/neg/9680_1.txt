greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers. this film opens with incest--and purposeless, meaningless, casual incest at that. that's greenaway's big problem. he prefers parlor tricks to shock over actually doing anything meaningful. technical skill isn't enough. he's just a bit perverse for the sake of perversity.
