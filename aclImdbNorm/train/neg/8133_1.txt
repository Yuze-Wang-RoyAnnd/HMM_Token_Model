the movie is just as fun as staring at the sun.sheriff pataki is a total retard that loves nothing better to do than sit on his fat rear making a smoke ring from his puffy cigars and drinking booze while the doctor acts like a zombie version of nicholas cage sucking up all that so called "blood" which in reality seemed like fruit punch.<br /><br />most of all the plotting seemed very horrid to even call this piece of crap a movie.the rest of the characters in this movie are total wastes of time, the ending was awful, the outlines were cheesy, and the scenes were terrible. what else more should i say to you viewers out there? my advice would be to get your rabies shot if you've already watched the movie. this movie may give you the foam in the mouth if you didn't get your up-to-date shots.
