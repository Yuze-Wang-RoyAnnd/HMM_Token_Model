a film as bad as this should be withdrawn from all stores world wide. so full of boring, dull, unimaginative characters, and with a lead character with such an annoying attitude and dry voice constantly giving a thoughtless voice over for every action and feeling, this film holds the record for the most challenging film i have ever watched. as i had payed money to own it, i felt a duty to see it through, and how i regret it. my head hurt throughout because of the terribly dull characters and their pointless, plot less lives. a bunch of kids who have zero knowledge about anything, are all frigid and worst of all, have terrible dialogue throughout, just mulling around as the main character tries to get a date with the girl. boring, so much so my friend was shaking with hatred and i was red with embarrassment that i'd thrown away lb6. the dvd was on ebay the following day, and i didn't make much of my money back. avoid like the plague.
