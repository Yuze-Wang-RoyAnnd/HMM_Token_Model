this movie is a pathetic attempt, apparently, to justify the actions of mary ann letourneau. in order to do this, they cast a 19-year-old -well, probably not "in order to do this." there was no way they could have cast a 12 or 13 year old as the boy because the love scenes would have grossed everyone out (if they had even been allowed to do them) - as they should. mary ann's boyfriend was my nephew's age, making her a pedophile. sixth grade, people. the definition of pedophile doesn't have to include many children - all you need is one.<br /><br />i really don't care about her upbringing or her unhappy marriage. she had a responsibility to her students that she did not live up to. the reason given is that she is bipolar, rejected the diagnosis, and refused to take her medication. it's understandable, then, that she was not thinking rationally. one hopes that she now understands her actions.<br /><br />now that she and vili are married and have two children together, i pray that she is on her medication and thinking clearly.<br /><br />all that aside, penelope ann miller was totally convincing and perfect casting for the role.
