"nat" (voiced by trevor gagnon), along with his brainiac friend "iq" (voiced by philip bolden) and the always hungry "scooter" (david gore) are kids with big dreams. they want to be the first flies in space. and what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon, the apollo 11, is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out.<br /><br />the first thing you notice is the animation of the film. i found it done very well done. the scenery had depth to it, as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes. i didn't see the movie in 3-d, as it was broadcast on hbo. however, i could see that there really wasn't any scenes which took advantage of the 3-d effects except a fight between characters near the end. i also wasn't really impressed with the design of the characters. to me, they didn't look like anything resembling a fly, especially in the coloring. the flies were an unusual blue-gray that was kind of distracting to me.<br /><br />the performances from the cast was not bad, but it wasn't good either. there were many times i focused more on my computer than the story. the writing was certainly written for a younger audience, with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh. i saw nothing for adults, like jokes that they'll get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning.<br /><br />history was not followed in this film. in fact, i think it was completely ignored, as the main focus was the flies. i also hated when a well known astronaut popped up on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film was a work of fiction, and no flies were on apollo 11. i did like how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though.<br /><br />if you are an adult, this is not for you. it was not made for the entire family. this is certainly just for kids. but, save this one for a rainy day.
