i'm not to keen on the pallbearer, it's not too bad, but just very slow at the times. as the movie goes on, it gets a little more interesting, but nothing brilliant. i really like david schwimmer and i think he's good here. i'm not a massive gwyneth paltrow fan, but i don't mind her sometimes and she's okay here. the pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like the leads then you might enjoy it.
