i am so appalled by this documentary. i am deeply embarrassed and ashamed by the way puertoricans were portrayed. this documentary was not about the culture of puertoricans. it was about the culture of nuyoricans. puertoricans and nuyoricans are two different cultures. very different cultures and should not be generalized to the puerto rican population. rosie, before you make a documentary, you need to do the research. you also need to check and make sure your sources are credible. puerto ricans are not all loud and they do have class, which is one thing the documentary lacked to show. when i saw rosie and jimmie on the view and rosie on martha stewart i was very excited about watching. i even made sure to let my parents know since they love puerto rico so much. after the first five minutes i could not believe how the documentary bashed the us and made puerto ricans look like a bunch of guinea pigs. you need to go and visit puerto rico and you will see that puerto rico is not a 3rd world country where more than 50% of the population is in poverty. puerto rico has colleges and well known universities, roads, cars, shopping centers, malls (the largest kmart and jcpenney's i've ever seen), restaurants, theaters, beaches, hotels(ritz, hilton,etc.), casinos, churches, agriculture, auto expresso, and restaurants just to name a few. poverty? not 50% of the population is. puerto rican culture is about family, music, food, celebrating, and trying to move forward not backward. oh, and new cousins don't just pop up out of no where. no that is not a puerto rican thing, that is a ghetto thing. we are not bastards. parents of puertorican descent who would like to teach their children about puerto rico should invest in a trip with the family so they can see first hand what puerto rico is all about. they will see its beauty, people and culture. please don't show them this documentary because it will only cloud their minds with negativity. oh, and please don't tell your american friends to watch this documentary because it will only make the puertorican people look ignorant.<br /><br />yes, i am born and raised puerto rican from the island. just so you know!
