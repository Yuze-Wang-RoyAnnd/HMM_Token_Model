i live in salt lake city and i'm not a mormon, so why did i rent this movie? well because i live in utah and thought it'd be nice to see locations i know in a film. i really knew going into it that i wasn't going to get the inside jokes so i wasn't surprised when i sat with the deer in the headlights stare. what i was surprised at was the ant-non mormon actions that were placed in this film.<br /><br />i know it's a mormon film, catered to the members of the lds church, but i found it offensive because of the typical stereotype of people that isn't of their faith. every non mormon, which wasn't many, drank, smoked and had an amazing selfishness attitude, why?<br /><br />that really ticked me off about this film, they made the mormons so pure, yet the rest of the state of utah i guess is filled with punk psychos just because they don't follow the scriptures of the lds church.<br /><br />i can understand having the plots revolve around all lds members, but you'd think salt lake city was 100% mormon, which isn't even close to being the truth. and as i said, the non mormons in the movie were portrayed as drunken jerks, please!<br /><br />i guess i just don't get it because i don't belong to their faith and i guess i never will.
