think "stage play". this is worth seeing once for the performances of lionel atwill and dwight frye. compare the melvyn douglas in "ghost story" with the melvyn douglas of this film. are there vampires at loose in this 'bavarian' village, or is there a more natural, albeit equally sinister, explanation? dwight frye is herman, a red herring, who is cast as an especially moronic character. it's fun to look at his different facial expressions in what is really a stock character. not much happens for a long time, but then we discover that atwill's pipe smoking doctor is the real murderer. there is too much 'comic relief' but that is par for the course for this era. fay wray looks really good.
