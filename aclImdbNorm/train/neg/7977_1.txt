well, jesus of montreal is basically an intelligent movie. the actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay. but, although i was very interested in the topic and like to think and discuss about religion (i am an atheist), it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end. why is this movie so incredibly boring? i don't know. it just is and so it is not recommendable.
