good deaths. good mask. cool axe. good looking girls....but watch out!!! no plot and little scares completely lower it's standards. they tried to make an "i know what you did last summer", but ended up making a "scream". but hey, what do people expect from a horror movie? answers totally vary. rent it if you want, but i regret ever seeing it.
