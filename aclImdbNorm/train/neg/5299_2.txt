i really like slasher movies,but this one is truly awful.the acting is lame,the script is bad,and the atmosphere is non-existent.the plot is as follows:a deformed gardener charlie puckett slaughters people in a small american town.that's right-this is the plot.very original,eh!"the night brings charlie" isn't even gory enough-if the film ain't gonna be scary,at least they should make it bloody.avoid this cheap piece of trash at all costs.if you want to see some good slasher flicks check out "madman","the burning","the prowler","just before dawn" or "humongous"- just don't waste your precious time with this worthless piece of garbage.
