i caught this movie on sci-fi before heading into work. if you've any interest in seeing dean cain dive and avoid being enveloped in flames at least a dozen times, this movie is for you. if that doesn't peak your interest, well, i'm afraid you'll wish that you were the one about to be enveloped in flames, because this movie is pretty bad. the acting, to begin with, is awful, awful, awful. the characters are all completely obnoxious, and the dialogue is worse than your typical z-grade, sci-fi movie. towards the end, the movie began to remind me of 'hollow man' (complete with escape via elevator shaft), except with a dragon, not a naked, invisible man. unlike other similar flicks, however, this one wasn't even awesomely bad...it was just plain bad.
