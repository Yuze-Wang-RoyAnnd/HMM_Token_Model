i realize it's not supposed to be bsg and i can handle slow-paced shows if they're interesting but i find myself completely uninterested and bored with this series.<br /><br />the formula for bsg seemed to be: action + adventure + scifi + suspense + mystery + drama<br /><br />the formula for caprica seems to be: bland drama + moderate scifi<br /><br />maybe it will get more interesting but as of episode 3 i can barely watch it. in fact, it's at the bottom of my to-watch list for the week. this is a sad state of affairs. the syfi channel really destroyed their friday night lineup. whatever happened to the glory days of sg1, stargate atlantis, and bsg on friday nights? they had a good thing there.
