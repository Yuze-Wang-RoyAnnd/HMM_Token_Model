i knew this movie wasn't going to be amazing, but i thought i would give it a chance. i am a fan of luke wilson so i thought it had potential. unfortunately, a lot of the movie's dialog was very fake sounding and cheesy. i think that aquafresh gave some money towards the production of the film because they were seriously dropping some hints throughout. there is a shot where the aquafresh sign sticks out at you that you can't help but notice it. maybe they should have focused on writing and acting more than how many times can we drop aquafresh products in the movie without people getting annoyed. the movie had its moments, but i'm glad i didn't spend $9.50 to see it in the theater.
