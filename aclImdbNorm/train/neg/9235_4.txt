this woman never stops talking throughout the movie. she memorized every line, and delivered all without a bit of natural emotion. she also has a most uncharming lisp, and the pitch of her voice sounds like nails on a blackboard. this film has way too much betsy drake, and not enough cary grant, who carried what little was left of the film entirely on his own.
