not very impressed. its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film, because there is almost no development in the plot. everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry. the acting seems very poor as well, and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television. although this is difficult to tell with the female role, yuwen, as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin. it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time. <br /><br />tian zhuangzhuang's film the 'blue kite' was a far better film. but don't be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late '40s. unlike the blue kite, the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself, the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop.<br /><br />i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can't tell the difference between a film that is 'beautiful' 'profound' or 'hypnotic' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial.<br /><br />if any film fits the description of 'overrated,' this is it. i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry.
