do you know when you look at your collection of old, videotaped movies, and realize that there are some that you've only seen once or twice, and you can't remember if they're worth the time it takes to see them? the alibi is/was one of those films; i found it, not long ago, and decided i might as well give it a chance. i'm not entirely sure if i'm happy with my decision... on one hand, the film is really, really bad, on the other, now i have another free tape... yeah, you get it. the plot is predictable and not in any way original. the pacing is bad. the acting is bad, but that's not really surprising, seeing as the two leads are former soap-opera stars... they're used to overact. the characters are poorly written clich'es. the film even manages to screw up the easiest damn way to impress me(through film): court scenes. even those don't elicit one single emotion for or against any of the cardboard-thin characters. the film just has no real redeeming qualities whatsoever... even the dialog is bad. the thing is, it's so full of clich'es that it's laughable. and that's the one thing that lifts this above a rating of 1/10: the(albeit unintentionally so) comic relief of the many clich'es and stereotypes. i didn't pay very much attention to the film, but just about every time i looked at the screen, there was something to laugh at. one final note: i considered using the line "tori spelling can't act" as a one line summary, but i guess everyone knows that, so i opted for the current one, seeing as it's more informative. all in all, a thoroughly bad film, but not the worst if you've got nothing else to do and if it's on tv. good for a few laughs, if you can sit through it. 3/10
