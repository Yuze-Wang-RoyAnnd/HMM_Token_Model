please do not waste +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just don't. especially if someone is fortunate to be snoozing at the side of you. damn cheek if you ask me. i waited for something to happen - it never did. i am not one of those people to stop watching a movie part way through. i always have to see it through to the end. what a huge mistake. do yourself a favour and go and paint a wall and watch it dry - far more entertaining. please do not waste +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just don't. especially if someone is fortunate to be snoozing at the side of you. damn cheek if you ask me. i waited for something to happen - it never did. i am not one of those people to stop watching a movie part way through. i always have to see it through to the end. what a huge mistake. do yourself a favour and go and paint a wall and watch it dry - far more entertaining.
