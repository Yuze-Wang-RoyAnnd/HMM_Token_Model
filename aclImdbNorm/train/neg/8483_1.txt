i normally only write reviews for movies i really hated or really liked. and, as you can probably tell from the number of stars up there, i didn't like it. by now, i assume you have read about the plot or maybe even seen the movie, so i'll skip the summary. let's break this down, pros and cons:<br /><br />cons: the concept: the premise was set up to be interesting. using chaos theory as a theme was interesting. however, it wasn't carried out so well. correct me if i'm wrong, but it seems to me that chaos theory was kind of misrepresented. the event that occurred in the movie seemed more like contrived coincidence than anything. i guess the butterfly effect was represented by the whole "god(s) causes tsunami to bring back statue." the presentation comes off as really sloppy though. some people call this intelligent, but it just seems to be another souped up action film.<br /><br />storyline: is it just me, or does it seem that kamal just threw this together to give him an excuse to play ten roles? the plot is extremely contrived; govind kept losing the vial so many times in obscure accidents (his friend just happens to mix up the vial with a package he was sending to india, a crazy old lady just happens to throw the vial into an idol, half the cast just happens to unexpectedly meet up in the same hospital, and the case with the idol just happened to get mixed up with one that belonged to a famous singer.)<br /><br />cgi: oh god, the cgi. it was even worse than the special effects in jaws 3, and those sucked. right away, i could tell which parts were animated. even my ten-year-old cousin knows that underwater cars don't look like that. <br /><br />stunts: yes, i now that action scenes in tamil movies aren't realistic, but the stunts in this one were horrid and actually distracted me from the story.<br /><br />make up: i have to admit, they did a better job than expected. i thought kamal would be playing people with similar skin tones, so the two fake white guys and the fake japanese aikido guy caught me off guard. however, it was still pretty bad, i could easily tell which ones were wearing masks.<br /><br />the songs: the music was distracting and out-of-place in many instances.<br /><br />asin: her character was possibly the most annoying one in the movie. she was loud, ditsy, and obsessed irrationally about that idol. i actually found myself wishing she would die.<br /><br />plot holes and fridge logic: let me get this straight: a lab monkey was smart enough to get past a password-locked door, but not intelligent enough to tell the difference between a bar of chocolate and a vial with a deadly virus in it. and then, an ex-cia agent who's after the vial figures out it's headed for india. instead of immediately following it, he marries a pole dancer first. a famous punjabi singer with cancer checks into a small town hospital in the third world when he could easily afford the best medical treatment available. furthermore, he gets shot in the throat with a bullet. you'd think he would be killed, but instead, the magic bullet has cleared his tumor. you read that right, a bullet knocked out the tumor. <br /><br />pros... the naidu character: possibly the only likable part of the movie was his comedy.
