for months preceding the release of this movie you saw it advertised in all sorts of print media, so i patiently waited for its video release to see what all the hype was about. after it was over i had to apologize to my roommate for occupying the vcr for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie. it essentially fails because it is a character based movie about unredeemable characters. with the possible exception of amanda peet (whose only redeemable quality is that she is amanda peet) you cannot stand any of them. the film relies on its dialogue which is sophomoric, moronic, and crude. the only slightly amusing character is eric, whose portrayal of the sole married member of a group of friends is dead on. the final twist, designed to make you laugh at the three main characters, only instead inspires the same kind of resentment towards peet. all in all, only rent if you are desperate or possess a dark sense of humor.
