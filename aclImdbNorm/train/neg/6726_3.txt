anyone who has seen 'shine',scott hicks film of the heartbreaking yet ultimately joyful life of the pianist david helfgotts; will i am sure realise that 'the soloist' is very poor in comparison.it is as slow as a lullaby( i took five breaks answering emails just to wake up). the depiction of the homeless area way over the top and extremely self indulgent, on a par i fear with the awful beach battle depiction in joe wrights other disaster attonment. .j fox performance was an extremely poor example of acting and lacked credibility from the offset.downey on the other hand; although struggling with a badly paced film, still manages to charm,9is it me or is he turning into george clooney in more ways than one?). comparing both these well known so called 'star'actors though is unnecessary as the light that shines brightest as far as acting is concerned must be that of 'shine's' geoeffry rush who's brilliant performance definitely shone far brighter in my sky. with both 'attonment' and 'the soloist' the written word wins far more prizes for empathy of subject. read the book and articles or wait for the dvd its bound to be in the bargain basement soon.
