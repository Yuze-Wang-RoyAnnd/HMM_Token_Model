perhaps not my genre but plot was horrible as was acting by nancy allen and linda farentino. c. thomas also seemed uncomfortable in role of being seduced here (while on marijuana? why did this need to be included? this weakened plot considerably). also farentino's charac. would have been better had she had more respect for a relationship. would does movie try to say? not much.
