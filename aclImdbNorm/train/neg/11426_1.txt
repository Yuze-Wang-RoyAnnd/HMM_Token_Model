heather graham couldn't play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it. who do the producers of the movie think they are? the absolute worst, most unrealistic movie i've seen in as long as i can remember. this movie is so bad that i felt compelled to sign-up on imdb and make sure the rating of this "film" drops.<br /><br />omg i'm heather graham, i just kissed a drunk chick, so while she's passed out i'm really going to pace around my room for hours asking myself frantically "what have i done?!".. jesus heather, get over it and grow up... and i'd like to forward that same sentiment to the idiot producers... and while i'm at it, instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story, perhaps it would have been more suitable to focus the plot onto a character who's mentally unstable... like your so-called "lesbian" character... after all, i know the first time i had gay sex, when i left the next morning i jumped to the sky in excitement in the middle of the street... honestly b*tch, get a grip... <br /><br />what a joke! and please note there are many many many more flaws and appallingly stupid aspects to this lame flick, but i'm so sick of even thinking about it anymore. bottom line, if you're a smart person you'll hate this movie, and if you're not a smart person, then you'll love it... it's as simple as that.
