i honestly had somewhat high expectations when i first began to watch this movie, but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring films i have ever seen!<br /><br />first of all, the pace is incredibly slow, so it seems much longer than it is (and it's not short).i'm sure when jane austen wrote the book, she made it several pages long, filled it with description, and didn't intend for people to read in in one day, or it might drag and lose it's appeal, which "emma" most certainly did. now "sense and sensibility" had this flaw of a slow pace, but at least it had lively lines to make up for it, as well as some good performances!<br /><br />that brings me to flaw #2, which is of course, the acting. while i don't happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film, i am sure they are capable of good work, but i didn't see much of it in this movie. it was like people were trying too hard to be witty, too hard to be "upper-class", too hard to be british (well, some of them), so they all just came off as a bunch of actors and not as people.<br /><br />#3. the cast, as i said, seemed only like actors, and not actually like the people they were playing. maybe that's a good thing, because the people they played really weren't all that nice. why did everybody like emma, for example? sure, she was nice to the rich, handsome people in front of them, but she was an awful gossip behind their backs. if her friends were "ugly", then she didn't even bother to go behind their backs. so, why is this girl so great? why do people have to tell stories, "just to make her laugh?" of course the snob couldn't even do that right. i have enough problems with gwyneth paltrow as gwyneth paltrow, and her "emma" did not exactly change my opinion.<br /><br />well, it's easy to see that i did not care for this one. i'm sure it's a lovely book and all, but some books are really not meant to be made for the big screen, and "emma" is one of them.
