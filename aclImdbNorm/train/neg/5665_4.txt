this wilfully bizarre adaptation of borges short story is typical cox. his strong visual sense is, as usual, undone by the appalling half baked acting of most of the cast. the film is definitely in the surreal tradition of bunuel's mexican period, and looks at times like a poor man's take on lars von trier's elements of crime. cox's apparent preference for single takes, jump cuts, and ambient sound recording all work against the film's effectiveness. worth a look but ultimately disappointing.
