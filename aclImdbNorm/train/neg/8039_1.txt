this mindless movie is a piece of crap and boring like the full house repetitions. for all the people who want to see a great, exciting and cool horror movie shouldn't even think about watching this bunch of mindless work. a f- in my opinion. i have one question, what were they thinking? let's make a list: 1) bad script 2) bad script 3) bad script 4) bad acting 5) bad directing and last but not least a bad script. i mean i am not like grumping about every movie, but i was disappointed when i watched it. this movie should be banned into a box, locked and sunk down into the sea. so please don't do something like this again, please, please, please!!!!
