i don't know who wrote the script for this movie, but from the first moment on, i was irritated. of all possible decisions they could make up in the mountains, why do they make the decision, which is the most dangerous of all? why do the criminals act dumb, although they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it? why doesn't the main criminal land the helicopter, shoot stallone, grab the money and fly away with the chick as a hostage? and there are more cases of illogical behavior. i'd give this movie 5 points for nice action and great landscape scenery, but due to the illogical behavior of the characters, i just can give this movie 1 point...
