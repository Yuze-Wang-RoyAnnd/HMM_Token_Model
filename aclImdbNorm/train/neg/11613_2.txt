terrible film with frank sinatra as tony rome. here, he gets involved with a dead woman below the sea.<br /><br />rome is soon hired to find out what happened to a woman. naturally, it's the woman below the sea. her room mate, lainie kazan, soon winds up dead on the floor.<br /><br />an aging richard conte plays a police officer and friend of rome. when a local club owner gets killed, the blame falls on rome and there becomes an interesting chase scene. that's how bad this picture is if you have to depend on a chase scene to supply the action.<br /><br />raquel welch plays the beauty up to her neck in intrigue. her acting leads a lot to be desired. <br /><br />martin gabel is a retired hoodlum whose son is trying to outdo him.<br /><br />by the film's end, you don't know why the girl was murdered. don't even bother to ask.
