where to begin? how best to describe just how awful this movie is???<br /><br />let's start with the campy hick humor. it isn't very funny. add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors - meat loaf is horrible and deborah harry is even worse. pity poor art carney, who should have known better than to do this movie.<br /><br />and then there is the plot. a roadie whose life goal is to work an alice cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for alice cooper. at least they get what they want...<br /><br />and then, just when the movie should end, they can't come up with a more plausible last scene than a - well, i won't ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie.<br /><br />there are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a "b" movie or perhaps worse. gailard sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role. that's a sure sign that the movie probably won't be very good. if nothing else, the movie lives up to the low expectations - even exceeds them by being worse than poor.<br /><br />let's just say this. this is the movie against which all bad movies are compared. and none are worse than roadie.
