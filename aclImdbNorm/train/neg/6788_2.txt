the idea of in the name of the people is good, a murderer doesn't want his only daughter to end up in an institution and asks the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter. and you could expect of the actors, especially scott bakula to do some good acting, unfortunately they don't! in the name of the people turns out to be the regular friday night tearjerker. the flashbacks with the girl that was killed are pretty pathetic and at a certain stage you can just predict what the actors will say... if you want to watch a good film about this subject then watch dean man walking!
