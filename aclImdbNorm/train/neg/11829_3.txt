i wandered into this movie after watching the 82-minute "borat" tonight, and left quite disappointed. i was a huge fan of wallace and gromit, and routinely go to see animated films. that being said, i found myself nodding off and at one point nearly walked out, but stayed waiting for this film to get better. never happened.<br /><br />the visuals are stunning and the voice work is top notch, especially in my opinion, that of kate winslet and ian mckellen (i had to remind myself a few times the bulbous headed lizard villain was gandalf and magneto). the problem with this movie for me is it's one of those animated features for the add-set. it registers after the fact as one zany slapstick routine after another, weighed down by a treacle filled plot that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an "important message." it looks a lot like busted oscar bait for the animated category, and considering the way it's scoring with critics, i wouldn't be surprised if the academy gets it wrong and offers up its hardware. but if you're looking for an enjoyable animated feature about rats, take my advice and wait for ratatouille.
