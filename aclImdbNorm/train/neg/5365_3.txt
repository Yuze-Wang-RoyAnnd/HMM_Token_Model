"private practice" is being spun off the fairly successful and well written "grey's anatomy". the cast is fabulous. the premise might even work. but the writing is just terrible.<br /><br />the pre-pilot disguised as a grey's anatomy episode should have been my first warning. the plot was just blah. i thought maybe it was a fluke. so i set the dvr to tape the pilot and all other episodes.<br /><br />as i was watching the pilot, i just kept wondering how a show with such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot. the pilot is supposed to suck people in and keep them coming back for more. there's supposed to be excitement, flash, great writing, intriguing storyline with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season. amazingly, this show had none of that.<br /><br />thinking it was a fluke, i just watched the second episode hoping for the best. and although marginally better, it doesn't come close to what it needs to be interesting can't miss tv.<br /><br />i just scrubbed this show from my list of shows to watch. not worth the effort imo, and i would be very surprised if this show even makes it through mid season. pass this one up folks.
