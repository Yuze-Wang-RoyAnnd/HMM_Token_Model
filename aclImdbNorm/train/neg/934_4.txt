macy, ullman and sutherland were as great as usual. ritter wasn't bad either. what's her name was as pretty as usual. it could have been a good movie. to bad the plot was atrocious. it was completely predictable, trite and boring.<br /><br />from the first 15 minutes, the rest of the movie was laid out like a child's paint by numbers routine. the characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard. there was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the acting, which was a pity.<br /><br />finally, too bad the script writer wasn't the victim. especially with the "precocious" lines from the child, which were completely unbelievable.<br /><br />again, it's only the acting that prevented a much lower score.
