it was a decent movie, i actually kind of enjoyed it. but the ending is so abrupt!! there is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends. what happens after the concert? what happens with her boyfriend? does she hook up with grant? does she come beck in the next semester? and what about angela? obviously holly's performance would knock angela down a few pegs, but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts. there is so much left up in the air and it's very unsatisfying. i don't know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something, but it is a terrible ending and i think that it really makes the movie a joke. i was very disappointed.
