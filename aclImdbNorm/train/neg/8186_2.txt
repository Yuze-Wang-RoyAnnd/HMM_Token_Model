did anyone read the script. this has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year. three great actors, paul giamatti, rachel weisz and miranda richardson couldn't pull this one out. about two-thirds it looked like giamatti eyes were saying, i can't believe i signed the contract. it's not the worst movie i ever saw, but it's on the really really bad christmas movie list. not enough lines, but what else can be said? okay, the movie just doesn't move with vaughn's con-man dialogue, his character is just a creepy guy that you just can't get past. it was just a lackluster walk through, that no one seemed to be able to get into.
