the only good thing about "people i know" is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that al pacino should avoid performing in. the first big turn-off i had was the way in which pacino tried to portray a georgia accent; at times it was weak and unattractive while in other segments it seemed too overdone. dialogue and character interaction was terrible along with a weak plot. the supporting cast did an extremely perfunctory job in keeping the movie interesting, and within an hour i still saw no signs of a sturdy plot. the story overall is a real bore, and i had to slap myself in the face a few times to keep myself awake.<br /><br />this movie will surely bore you as well...avoid at all costs.
