december holiday specials, like the original frosty, ought to be richly-produced with quality music and a wholesome, yet lighthearted storyline. they should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays. basically, they should look, sound, and feel...well, "special" and they should have a decent and appropriate december holiday subtext.<br /><br />so when i saw legend of frosty the snowman in the tv listings, i got my kids (6 and 8) pumped up for it by telling them the story of the original frosty and passionately relating how much i enjoyed it as a kid. as my wife and kids cozied up on the couch to watch the movie the expectations were high, but 10 minutes into it my kids were yawning and my wife and i were giving each other "the look" and rolling our eyes. after 35 minutes my kids were actually asking to go to bed -- i guess they were fed up with the insensitive language and pointless, disconnected segments. i was actually embarrassed about their (and my) disappointment with this movie.<br /><br />unfortunately, legend of frosty the snowman is more like a bad episode of fairly odd parents crossed with a worse-than-normal episode of sponge bob than a classic holiday movie. don't get me wrong...those shows are fine and i like them as much as the next guy, but when i watch fairly odd parents or sponge bob, my low expectations (for mediocre, off-color, zero subtext, mind numbing episodes) are always satisfied.<br /><br />we picked out some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together. a much better choice than the embarrassingly bad legend of frosty the snowman.
