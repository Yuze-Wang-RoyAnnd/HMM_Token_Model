i saw the mst3k version of "deathstalker iii" and loved the movie so much -- even "unmystied" -- that i decided to watch the entire series of "deathstalker" films. i bought i and ii and settled down for a laugh.<br /><br />nothing about "deathstalker i" was funny on any level and when the credits rolled i was embarrassed and regretful that i had bought it! too much ugliness and nudity. i guess either "ds 3" was a much cleaner production or mst3k really edited a lot because i expected something similar, i.e. stupid and carefree and simple. i was wrong. even at $6.99 it seemed a waste of money. i didn't even open "ds 2" as i will return it tomorrow. now i'll probably just throw away this dvd as i can't return it and no one wants it -- including myself! so really, don't bother with this one. even the nudity (lots of it, btw) is uninspiring and icky.
