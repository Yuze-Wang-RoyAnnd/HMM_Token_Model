i am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself, but i just got back from this movie, and felt i had to express my opinions. let me start by saying that i am a huge horror fan. but what makes a horror movie? i sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development. i know they often lack in horror movies, but prom night looked like it didn't even put forth any effort in that department. next, we all love suspense. that on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. yeah, prom night had none of that! of course, we like a terrifying killer. prom night have that? nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife. and when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene! yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated pg-13 like prom night, they leave that stuff out too. so with all of these elements missing, i ask....does this still count as a horror movie? nope. i'd call it more of a comedy. people in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when i saw "semi-pro" that was supposed to actually be a comedy (which also sucked, but thats another story!). i think i am just going to have to give up on new horror. all the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money. the people i went to see it with didn't even know this was a remake! which made me mad! i wonder what will happen when there's no more movies to remake??? where will horror go next???
