this is one of those awful, sex-driven b-movies that couldn't have played anywhere near a theater. women run around dressed in scantily clad "bunny" outfits, an extremely fat woman is the brunt of many tasteless jokes, and they all work at the restaurant of a dirty old man, who has an oddball son (jim hanks, who is of course tom's brother), whom the man wants to get "laid." hanks is actually sort of good, but this movie goes nowhere and has no point. one must wonder why it was even made? nevertheless, because of hank's performance and a few entertaining moments(but no more than a few), it received a stellar "2" out of 10. i think i was being nice, though.
