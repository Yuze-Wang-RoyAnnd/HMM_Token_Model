there is no way on earth you are going to care about any of these characters. a bunch of spoilt middle class overgrown kids take some drugs at a party and get off with each other and argue. i've just seen this on tv and i didn't think it was a 'film' as such, more a post-'this life' indulgence that really has no resonance or proper drama to it. stuff like this will get commissioned for time immemorial unfortunately, irrelevant middle class "lifestyle" crap that takes itself far too seriously. it's got david baddiel in it and that bird out of "cold feet", you know what to expect. there was a lot of this stuff about in 2000, it was a particularly british malaise..."they're educated and doing drugs? friends, but kinda dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships? sounds great!". this kind of nonsense, and post-guy ritchie comedy- gangster stuff...dark days. if you have taste, this will annoy you to the point of violence.
