creature unknown is the right word for this movie. or maybe it should be called unknown movie. this movie is a piece of crap right from the beginning. it has a really stupid "plot," really pathetic "acting," and so-so "special effects." <br /><br />some thirty-something year old "post-teens" are trapped in the woods with a mad, reptilian, rubber-suit creature lurking around endlessly. what you get with this movie is a bunch of talk and precious little action. you have girls walking through the woods talking, and then you have guys (with heavy mascara on) walking through the woods talking. the whole thing is so boring!<br /><br />the creature itself is rarely seen throughout most of the movie. when it is shown the picture is distorted to mask the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit, and the movement shows that it is a suit, hence the reason for the blurring and distortion of the image. <br /><br />this is not a good movie in any since of the word and the ones here who have praised it are most likely the people that were picked up off the street to "act" in this truly stupefying movie! skip this one for certain!
