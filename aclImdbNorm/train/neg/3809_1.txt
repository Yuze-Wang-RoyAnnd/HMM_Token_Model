this show is just annoying!!! i feel sorry for the actors for having to attempt to be funny (especially bob saget), the laugh track tries to cover up the sad jokes and the "awwww" track comes up at the most unnecessary times. the over-dramatic kids are no exception, especially the olsen twins. also, this show is clich'e city. if you were to look up the word clich'e, it would read "full house" every story line has a "life lesson" to be learned at the end. a sappy speech makes everything better and even has the ability to make the most bratty child have a sudden realization of goodness gasp too bad this couldn't be possible in real life. i don't know how someone could watch this show without bad mouthing the behavior of the characters or the laugh track. i find myself yelling at the tv saying, "that isn't funny/sad/cute" if life were really like this, the world would fall apart.
