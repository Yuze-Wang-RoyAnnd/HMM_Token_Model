this movie makes a promising start and then gets very confused and muddled. kamal hasan has made a lot of effort in getting the period look right, pity he did not spend more time on the plot. most of the small characters in the movie show up for no particular reason.<br /><br />overall very disappointing, i would recommend avoiding this movie.
