i had heard some bad things about cabin fever almost as much as i heard the cultish hype. as it turns out, the first film from the new impresario eli roth, it's just a so-so effort with the iq points dropping as the film progresses. there are worse movies out there, and surely more gory ones (while i'm not sure how the hype-meter got so high on the blood-count for hostel, there is a good amount for genre fans here). the premise isn't necessarily bad either though: kids go to a cabin for a week of partying, only to come across a very sick man, covered in blood, whom in a panic they set on fire. he winds up dead in the water that feeds the reservoir, and soon the characters all succumb to the flesh-eating virus one way or another. the characters, either the lead college kids (including rider strong as the hero and james dibello as the goofy side-bar) or the supporting 'village' folks are archetypal to the point of inertia, if not painfully so. <br /><br />as they meet their fates, the townspeople get pretty weird, and it just seems to be non-sensibly thrown together without the many laughs; 'pancakes kid' comes out of nowhere, and maybe might have been funnier in another movie or by itself, but in the context of the rest of the movie, it just doesn't work. there's also a young police character who is even dumber and less convincing than the others. and the family that goes after dibello following an incident has some possibilities that aren't realized. but all the while, roth pumps up his script with common sense out the window and sudden scares and frights with people hacking up blood on one another and a killer dog rambling around. which isn't all for not either. now, unlike lesser troma horror movies or even lesser ones of the 70s or 80s- to which i'm sure roth is a die-hard fan- he doesn't make it unwatchable. it's also smart to not have any explanation for where the virus comes from. <br /><br />but unlike those films too, he also doesn't really have a fine idea of what makes for great campy-horror times. his film tries for that, of course, and only once or twice does he make it a goofy, bloody time (i did like the random bunny strong sees while on the gurney). it's not even very poorly shot a lot of the time (albeit with its own contrived style-choices ala red tint on the lens or that story with the bowling-alley worker). it simply contains a lot of illogical scenarios and choices made (shave your legs with a deadly virus, uh-huh), and it aims for fairly typical ground. if that's your cup of tea, more power to you. but at the end i found it to be actually un-exceptional genre territory that doesn't offend audience sensibilities ala saw, but doesn't swing for the fence either as a clever b-movie. roth also has the temerity to end the movie on a true note of 'what-the-hell' as the santa claus bearded convenience store clerk from earlier in the film serves a bunch of black people. it could work if he followed up on it with something better, or if he dropped it altogether. same could be said for a lot of the movie. c-
