this film is described as a action/comedy. the first 15 minutes and james belushi's presence point to it being a humorous gangster film.<br /><br />however, the introduction of the ridiculous female lead begins a number of ludicrous plot twists which do little to conceal the contrived ending. the film moves between comedy(description used loosely) and surreal drama with some out of context adult scenes thrown in. the lead female (the angel of the title) is poorly acted and the actress is not helped by the script which requires some unbelievable, extremes of character to be portrayed. james belushi is the only one who handles his part well but is also let down by the poor script. one to avoid.
