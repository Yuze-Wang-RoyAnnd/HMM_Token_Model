st. elmo's fire has no bearing on life after university at all (for the majority of us common folk anyway). why was this garbage even made? who can really relate to this? who lives like these characters? i truly feel sorry for the actors having to deal with such a terrible script. there are some talented young actors in this "film" that have done a good job elsewhere. it must have just been one whole joke to them on set.<br /><br />i actually found this "film" insulting to my intelligence. the only joy i got from this is hoping that sir john hughes had a good ol' laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of the breakfast club was released.<br /><br />don't make the same mistake i did of watching this because you enjoy 80's films. it really is that offensive to the genre.
