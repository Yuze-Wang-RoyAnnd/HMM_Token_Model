dark rising is your typical bad, obviously quickly produced horror/sci-fi/fantasy movie. it has a strange, unexplained plot with holes so big you could fit an elephant through them. most of the time i didn't know what the hell was going on but it didn't really matter, it was a simple demon hunter returns from hell dimension to save campers story with confusing stuff added on about witches and a book of evil with plot elements and characters who make no sense or disappear totally for no reason. the acting is bad but there honestly is not much they can do with this script i am guessing. there is a couple topless scenes which is probably the only reason this bad movie got made (like so many other bad movies). give this one a pass unless there is nothing else on t.v.
