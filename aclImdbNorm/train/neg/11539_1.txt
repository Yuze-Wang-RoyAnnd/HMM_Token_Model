this is the biggest load of crap that i have seen in a long time. the last time i hated a movie so much was whilst watching "28 days later" and "magnolia". there is absolutely no point to this movie, except to see some really sick and twisted sex/rape scenes, gillian anderson relieving herself on the side of the road, and every single sentence of dialog having to use the "f" word at least a couple of times in it. it has extremely cheap acting and is very low budget. my friend and i eventually turned off the movie after about half an hour. we had tried to give it a chance, but nothing could save this crud. do not watch it!!!
