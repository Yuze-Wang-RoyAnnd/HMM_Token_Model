i have not yet decided whether this will replace anaconda as "the worst film i have ever seen".<br /><br />even if you ignore the dodgy accents, low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it. i only went to see it as i had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour film.<br /><br />the simple answer is - they didn't. characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative. even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches it's climax you don't care what happens to any of them.<br /><br />i can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from. but after my friends and i came out of the cinema i had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened.<br /><br />they even change the true meaning of the books title "rancid aluminium" by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title.<br /><br />a real mess of a film from start to finish.
