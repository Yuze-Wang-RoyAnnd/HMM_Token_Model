i had a video of the thing. and i think it was my fourth attempt that i managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep. it's slow-moving, and the idea of a mid-atlantic platform, which may have been revolutionary at the time, is now just a great big yawnaroony. apart from conrad veidt, the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable, and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting. when the water started to spill big-time it even, on one occasion, woke me up.<br /><br />but give the man his due. no one could hold a cigarette like conrad veidt. he doesn't wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals. he holds it in his fingers, while showing us the old pearly-browns. there are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark background,and looks very artistically done. but it does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke.
