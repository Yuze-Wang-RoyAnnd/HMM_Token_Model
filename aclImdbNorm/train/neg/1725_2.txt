- the movie opens with a meteor crashing into a lake. unbeknownst to the locals, a dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake. the meteor heats the lake, turning it into a giant incubator. you guessed it, the egg hatches releasing a dinosaur that proceeds to terrorize the community.<br /><br />- what utter garbage. it's not that i mind the stop-motion clay dinosaur, it's everything else about the movie that bothers me. the acting is atrocious. the dialogue is utterly ridiculous. the comic relief is anything but comic. logic is non-existent. any similarity between the "scientists" in this movie and an actual scientist is purely coincidental. i could go on for an eternity on the bad aspects of this movie, but you get the idea. i feel it's fairly safe to call this disaster "mst3k worthy".
