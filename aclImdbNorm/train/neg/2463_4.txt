i don't know how to describe this movie. it's definitely one of the weirdest movies i've seen in a long time. it is very unsettling at times but also boring in other places. the scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and may attract anyone who's into gore & splatter. i found myself holding my teeth during some of the aforementioned scenes. the clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and the dentist is therefore quite unsettling.<br /><br />the humor of the film is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone. but if you're a fan of weird and strange entertainment and teeth getting drilled to dust this is just the film you were looking for.<br /><br />if you read the comment and feel somehow attracted by this kind of entertainment, give it a try!<br /><br />my rating: 4/10 (maybe a little too weird for my taste)
