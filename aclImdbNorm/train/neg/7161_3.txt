a young american woman visits her irish roots and fends off a druid witch who is out to possess her. sounds intriguing but after an interesting start, i got lost and spent most of the time wondering where it was going. the movie seems to be dithering in two directions -- are we watching the travails of the irish-american woman battling her alcohol problem or are we watching a straight off horror flick about an evil witch that returns from the past? the director can't seem to decide. the two doesn't seem to gel and in the end you get nowhere. this could be so much better done and the story seemed to drag towards the end. this was most boring and disappointing.
