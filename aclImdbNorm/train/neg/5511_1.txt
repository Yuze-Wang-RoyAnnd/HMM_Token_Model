i must agree with the very first comment: this movie sucks very, very hard. despite having a very big b-list cast, the cover of this film (for those who aren't watching it on comedy central during a weekday which is probably the only exposure this film will ever get) tries to put the blame on dangerfield but in reality is just a paycheck for every has-been comedian from the '80s. randy quaid? check. ed begley, jr? check. the voice of lisa simpson? she can now say that maximum overdrive wasn't her only horrible flick: double check. and so many, many others.<br /><br />the saddest thing about this flick is that it was so lazily written with already-told jokes. nothing about this movie outside of its existence is funny. you're better off watching paint dry. this is definitely direct-to-video scraping-the-bottom-of-the-barrel stuff that still believes in the old video adage: throw an old-time star on the cover and you'll get some money back off of the rental. considering the days of video rental are changing, consider this one of the last examples of putting out garbage.<br /><br />the only use this movie has if you're having trouble falling asleep. it'll get you there.
