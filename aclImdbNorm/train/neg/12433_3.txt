i like to keep my reviews short and simple, but this pretty much sums it up. you can not beat the original two for a number of reasons one of which including the directing talent of chris columbous.<br /><br />this movie had terrible directing covered up by even more terrible acting. i cant even believe these people are considered actors.<br /><br />painful to sit through and watch. the storyline was a complete joke about a secret chip and russian terrorists on a painstaking quest to get it back. horrible, rent one of the original tow and enjoy yourself! <br /><br />the movie wasn't even set during christmas like the original. home alone was turned from an excellent christmas time family comedy movie to a joke with no moral or plot!
