this movie is really goofy! i saw it as an 11 year old, and even then i thought it was pretty ridiculous! i would only recommend this film to kids under the age of 12. i really didn't care for it, but i do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of, such as: 1)does money buy happiness? 2)should i lie (to my parents) about things i think they wouldn't approve of? 3)does money buy friendships? 4)is money everything? 5)shouldn't i tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me? granted, these are very unrealistic situations, but i do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children, maybe they should watch this video as well, in order to show/scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt.
