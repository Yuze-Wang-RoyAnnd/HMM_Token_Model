i couldn't believe how lame & pointless this was. basically there is nothing to laugh at in the movie, hardly any scenes to get you interested in the rest of the movie. this movie pulled in some huge stars but they were all wasted in my opinion. i think keanu reeves must've taken some acting lessons a fews years after this movie before he stared in the matrix. uma thurman looked very simple & humble. luckily i got this movie for a very low price because its certainly not a movie to remember for any good reasons. i won't write anything about the story of the movie, but as you should know that she is meant to be the most famous hitchhiker across america because of her huge thumb. i would give this movie a 2 / 10. before i watched this movie i was wondering why this movie has only got a 4.0/10, & now i know why. a very disappointing movie. don't buy it even if you see it for under $5.
