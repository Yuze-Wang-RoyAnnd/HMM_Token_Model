you know you are in trouble watching a comedy, when the only amusing parts in it are from the animal cast. it is a pity then that the parrot, cat & dog were only in support & not the other way around, as the humans in it were pretty abysmal throughout.<br /><br />if i were you, paul, eva, lake (what sort of name is that), jason, & lindsay, i would forget this acting lark & do something else, as all of you are as funny as watching paint dry, & awful actors to boot.<br /><br />the main gag in the film is one of the characters shouting, me not gay, which is funny as if you weren't, you might change your mind if you had to put up with the three bossy, tedious & dare i say very plain women leads in the film.<br /><br />the worst film i have seen in years, & hopefully never see one as bad again, though i expect not.
