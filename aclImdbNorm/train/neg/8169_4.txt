the movie starts with a pair of campers, a man and a woman presumably together, hiking alone in the vast wilderness. sure enough the man hears something and it pangs him so much he goes to investigate it. our killer greets him with a stab to the stomach. he then chases the girl and slashes her throat. the camera during the opening scene is from the point of view as the killer.<br /><br />we next meet our four main characters, two couples, one in which is on the rocks. the men joke about how the woman would never be able to handle camping alone at a double date, sparking the token blonde's ambition to leave a week early. unexpectedly, the men leave the same day and their car breaks down.. they end up arriving in the evening. when the men arrive, they are warned about people disappearing in the forest by a crazy ralph doppleganger. they ignore the warning and venture into the blackening night and an eighties song plays in the background with lyrics about being murdered in the dark forest. the men get lost.<br /><br />in the next scene we realize that this isn't just another the burning clone, but a ghost story! the women, scared and lonely are huddling together by the fire. two children appear in the shadows and decide to play peeping tom. well they are obviously ghosts by the way their voices echo! their mother appears with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead and asks the two ladies if they've seen her children, before disappearing of course. <br /><br />the children run home to papa and tell him about the two beautiful ladies by the river. this causes quite a stir and he gets up, grabbing his knife from atop the fireplace. "daddy's going hunting," the little girl, exclaims with bad acting. it is apparent here, that the dad isn't a ghost like his children.<br /><br />freaked out by something in the woods, the token blonde splits, running blindly into the night, carrying a knife. she encounters the father who explains he's starving and it will be quick. this doesn't make sense because of the panther growls we heard earlier (maybe he's allergic! are panthers honestly even in california?) she ends up wounding him slightly before getting stabbed in the head. a thunderstorm erupts and the men seek shelter, which turns out to be where papa resides. clearly someone lives here because there's a fire and something weird is roasting over it. the children appear and warn them of papa, who shows up moments later. they disappear as soon as he arrives.<br /><br />for whatever reason, our killer only goes after females. he invites the men to have something to eat and tells us the story about his ex wife. we are given a flashback of his wife getting caught cheating. the old man doesn't tell them however that he kills her and her lover afterwards, but daydreams about it. we aren't given the reason for the children's demise. the men go to sleep and are left unharmed. the next morning the men discover the empty campground of their wives. after a brief discussion they split up. one is to stay at the campsite, while the other goes and gets help. the one that is going back to his car breaks his leg. we are then reunited with the children as they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who killed themselves from being sad about their mother. they agree to help the woman reunite with her friends<br /><br />the following scene defies the logic of the movie when papa kills the guy waiting at the campsite. he was also dating or married to the blonde. somehow the children realize he is murdered and tell the woman about it. she decides to see it for herself and obviously runs into the killer. luckily the children make him stop by threatening to leave him forever. you know where this is going.<br /><br />overall the movie deserves four stars out of ten, and that's being generous. for all its misgivings, the musical score is well done. it's still watchable too. there are some camera angles that look professional, and some of the sets are done well. the plot is unbelievable. there is such a thing as willing suspension of disbelief, but with the toad 6 miles away; i can't imagine the token blonde would take off like that in the middle of the night. i mean, come on!<br /><br />- alan "skip" bannacheck
