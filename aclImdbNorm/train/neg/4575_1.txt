i will admit that i'm only a college student at this present time, an english major at that. at the time i saw this film i was a high school student--i want to say junior year but it may have been senior, hard to remember. my experience with quantum physics goes pretty much to my honors physics course, an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read up on the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article i can find in discover and the like. i'm not a phd by any means.<br /><br />that said...<br /><br />this movie is simply terrible. it's designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average new age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everybody is. my mother is such a person and ever since she's seen this movie she's tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film. i attempted to point out the various flaws and problems i'd seen with the films logic and science--and they are numerous--and she dismissed my claims because "oh, so a high school student knows more than all those people with phds." in this case, apparently so.<br /><br />leaving behind the fact that earning a phd doesn't necessarily require that a person be correct or, in fact, intelligent. leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half the film. leaving that behind, the film makers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when, in fact, he completely opposed them.<br /><br />i could go on and on but i think intuitor did a really good job of debunking the film so feel free to read that if you care to do so.<br /><br />http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
