honestly i can't understand why this movie rates so well here, nor why bakshi himself thought it was his finest film. i'm a huge fan of bakshi's earlier work - particularly 'heavy traffic' and 'wizards', but frankly 'wizards' (1977) was the last good film he made. after that he turned to the mainstream, beginning with the diabolical 'lord of the rings' and then knuckling down with sword and sorcery heavyweight frank frazetta, for 'fire and ice'.<br /><br />what can i say? the story is puerile, the animation is tv quality - i insist that it's considerably worse than his 70's stuff - and whereas 'wizards' had real imagination, quirkiness, some gorgeous background art, and an underground, adult sensibility, 'fire and ice' is just designed for 14 year old boys, and has the intellectual clout of robinson crusoe on mars.<br /><br />yes, if you liked the gor books, you might like this. in my view though, this was just another blip in the slide in quality after 'wizards' from which bakshi never recovered (though he's done some decent tv stuff fairly recently)<br /><br />4.5 out of 10
