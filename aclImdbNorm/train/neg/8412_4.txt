i just saw dreamgirls yesterday, and i was really underimpressed. despite all the oscar buzz, this is nothing special. anyone who was really impressed by this film has never bothered to see any of the true movie musical classics. except for eddie murphy's great musical and dramatic performance, dreamgirls is just a glorified tv movie with no style or flair. just a bunch of amateurs singing at each other!<br /><br />now, the first half hour was good, but i was irritated at how eddie murphy's terrific raveup performances were truncated and interrupted by montages. those were easily the best songs and best performances in the film. and the "rise to the top" portion of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any momentum. the remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless, rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting. it was also visually dull and included too many sound-alike tunes.<br /><br />condon didn't try to turn any of the tunes into big show pieces as i'd expected they would. each number in the 2nd half was just one closeup after another of people "singing" at each other. and the way they shot hudson's big "love me" number was criminal! condon just shot her stomping around the stage--no drama at all! god it sucked!<br /><br />and note to all involved--that "sing-talking dialog" stuff might work on stage, but it does not work in movies (see embarrassing failures of evita and phantom). all that "i'll teeeell youuuu something efff-ieeee!" crap should have been left on the editing room floor. those aren't "songs."<br /><br />again, the film--except for eddie murphy's amazing performance--was nothing more than a glorified tv movie. there must have been megabucks behind the pr work for this film! i wonder how much money was spent to give it that pre-release "one to beat" oscar buzz? as a whole this film was, except for eddie, nowhere near an oscar caliber movie! (except for eddie) i'd rank it right up there with grease 2. big disappointment, especially after all the (very expen$i've) hype!
