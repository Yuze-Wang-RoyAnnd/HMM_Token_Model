the cover art (which features a man holding a scary pellet gun) would make it seem as if it's a martial arts film. (hardly.)<br /><br />i find it interesting that the film's real title is trojan warrior. (trojan is a brand of condoms in the us) this movie is loaded with homoeroticism. if you like that stuff, then this film isn't that bad really. however, consider these points:<br /><br />there are numerous close-ups of actors' groins & butts, (one scene even features every actor with an erection bulging in his pants.) the film is also bathed in gaudy colors like lime, peach, and red. from a cinematographer's standpoint, this movie's a drag queen! several scenes feature characters standing extremely close to one another, occasionally touching as they converse. also, the cousin of the hero likes women, and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him. is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey? <br /><br />shall i go into the fight scenes? (yes, someone's private parts get grabbed in one fight.) the martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative. no fancy stuff here, just your standard moves you'd see in an old chuck norris flick. there's also a car chase scene which may be the first ever low-speed chase put on film.
