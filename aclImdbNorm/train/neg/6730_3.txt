this is a movie about how men think women think about love. no woman describes a one-night sexual encounter and declares it a love story.<br /><br />of the ten monologues i felt only three really had any kind of truth ring through them. i kept waiting for the film to get better, and it did a bit, but never better enough.<br /><br />this is an interesting concept, and i kept wanting it to be good, but it never succeeded. maybe if they actually were love stories it would have worked.
