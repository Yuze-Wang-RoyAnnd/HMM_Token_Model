okay like most steven seagal fans i know i not going expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film but i do expect the film to at least have some sorter budget. the main problem with the copy i watched was the terrible over dubbing i know that in some films this has to be done and i accept that but when they overdub with a totally different actors voice and keep doing this thru out the film it does take the magic of overdubbing away. also the sets seem to be built with no care as in one scene the sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack going thru it. i was truly disappointed with this film and only hope stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying/renting. the story of this film had me wondering if i was watching a sci-fi film or not some parts seemed alien like but they never fully explained what was going on i found it very confusing.
