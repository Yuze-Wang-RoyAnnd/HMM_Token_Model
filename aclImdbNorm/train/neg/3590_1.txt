how low can someone sink while trying to recapture an old glory? st:hf will be glad to show you.<br /><br />if you are used to seeing what made for a good star trek show, do not watch this.<br /><br />the writing is hodge-podge, the actors' portrayals of their characters weak, and most of all, the design work is downright doggy.<br /><br />like watching strong captains, don't look here! like the strong federation attitude? forget about it here! starfleet is mocked by ensigns wearing spikes in their hair.<br /><br />while a seemingly mentally feeble captain shuffles about and within two minutes of the opening show's credits, ensign spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an engineer. it just degrades from there. no, not even uniforms match, for goodness sake. they are too small or too big, collars down to their chests, and tng seasons one and two uniforms mixed in with season three and ds9 uniforms. the strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this production down to the treads! the only good thing about this show is its graphics, which seem to improve a bit with each season. ok, i take that back. who uses cg that inexpertly? the designers of this show.<br /><br />don't bother with it, it will offend your star trek sense, as it did mine. not even the throw backs to previous shows can save this catastrophe.<br /><br />i wept openly when i watched this, probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost ruptured. that bad.
