at what point exactly does a good movie go bad? when does a movie go from "watchable" to "where's that &^@_+#!* off switch"? thank goodness for dvds, like this one, that can be borrowed from the library - for free! likewise, thank goodness for the "fast forward" switch on the dvd player. i feel sorry for those people who were duped at the box office.<br /><br />at one point (i've forgotten exactly when because now it's all just a blur), our "hero," luke wilson starts running through traffic; i think he was looking for a cab. it was at that point when i gave up, realizing i couldn't care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truck.<br /><br />the last time the movie was interesting was when luke wilson climbs out of the dumpster, hair dryer in hand, and first meets the "heroine," uma thurman. that scene ended with the purse-snatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far, far above the departing luke and uma. that was the last time the movie was funny, and when was that scene? ten minutes into the flick?<br /><br />every time the movie tried to become "funny," it couldn't. every time the movie approached "excitement," it fizzled out, heading in the opposite direction. when a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this dullard, the sound track stayed empty and silent.<br /><br />the sex scenes were not needed and were beyond lame; the damage to sets and props unnecessary and childish. when uma turns into the crazy ex-girlfriend, i felt like i was watching "the 40 year old virgin meets pulp fiction"; that's when i realized that there was no turning back because i thoroughly disliked "the 40 year old virgin" and "pulp fiction."<br /><br />luke wilson's sidekick, rainn wilson (also seen in the dreary "the last mimzy") adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie. rainn wilson, the king of television boredom, should stay with that equally awful medium. hey, rainn wilson! leave full-length motion pictures alone! every time uma's rival, anna faris, came on screen, i expected jason or freddy or some fright flick monster to jump out from behind the scenery; once you see anna faris in "scary movie," that's all you ever see, no matter the movie, no matter the medium. the character played by wanda sykes was just plain awful and was so out of place in this flick.
