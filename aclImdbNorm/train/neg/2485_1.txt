there is only one use for a film such as bulletproof: it reminds you just how bad bad can be. we often see films which we describe as "pretty awful" or "not much good", but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films aren't "good" they are no way as stinkingly bad as bulletproof. this was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru' the dvd bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation (i.e. to give me a present). it could have been a serendipitous find but it wasn't: this is so utterly clich'ed, so badly written, so poorly directed, so badly acted that i'm surprised everyone involved hasn't been arrested and sent down for 10 years. god, it's awful. i suspected as much from about 30 seconds in, but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable. this isn't one of them. it is simply bad. i stopped watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow i shall throw it in the bin.
