a quite usual trashy italo-western, stupid storyline full of clich'es and lack of logic, some mediocre actors, dirty settings, lots of punch-fights and people shoot dead on a massive scale.<br /><br />this has nothing to do with django. - at least not in my german translated version, this german dvd-release is called "adios companeros" and has macho callaghan fighting against butch cassidy and ironhead because their gang killed his one (he's the only survivor). then you have butch cassidy and ironhead fighting each other because they quarreled and the gang split. and you have ironhead fighting against everyone because he's just the biggest and most greedy asshole anyway. yeah, that's it, no more cleverness in the storyline, hehe.<br /><br />a small role by klaus kinski as reverend cotton is remarkable (that's why i bought this dvd). in one scene he attempts to separate two men fighting by hitting them and screaming "i said love!" and in another scene he wins a competition in throwing horseshoes and goes nuts for a second - fantasticfantasticfantastic!!!<br /><br />it's also remarkable that joe d'amato aka aristide massaccesi did the cinematography - i love this master of incompetent exploitation-thrash, so it was an "aahhh" for me.
