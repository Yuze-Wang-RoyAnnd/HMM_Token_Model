i recently watched the first guinea pig film, the devil's experiment, and i must admit to being disappointed.<br /><br />this film is invariably included in any list of the "nastiest" films and maybe i was expecting more because of the hype. the truth is though, i don't rate it.<br /><br />if i'd been watching it believing the opening text to be true ("i found this tape..."), i might have been a bit disturbed by it, thinking it was real. even without the benefit of knowing it not to be real though, i think i'd have worked out that it indeed wasn't.<br /><br />throughout the film, the girl's reactions to what is being done to her just aren't what they should be. she should be screaming like a banshee in pain. the fact that she isn't means that it's obviously not real. i wouldn't want to watch it if it were real but if she were to be more convincing in her acting, the film would be more disturbing.<br /><br />and then there are the notorious scenes: nothing affected me at all up until the scalpel in the hand. the hot oil, maggots and innards just didn't bother me. i'm not saying i'm "hard"; just that i wasn't able to suspend my disbelief, partly because of the girl's inaction.<br /><br />the scalpel made me wince a little but the hammer to the hand just made the hand look rubber. and the final scene with the eye was again a little wincing but nothing more. i didn't want to look away and neither did i feel nauseous.<br /><br />perhaps it's because the film is twenty-odd years old, or perhaps i'm just jaded. the truth is, i didn't find this film at all disturbing.<br /><br />it's the kind of thing you might expect to see playing on a loop as a modern art installation and as an exercise in stripping away characters, story etc. and just leaving the torture, it works on some levels. as a disturbing piece of film though, it didn't work for me at least.<br /><br />i watched guinea pig with my wife, who is of the "it's just a film" bent and she wondered what all the fuss was about. we got to discussing why i watch these films and my reasons are many but include a desire to be affected by a film. she said that she didn't think any film could be so convincing as to disturb her and challenged me to do exactly that. i played her the fire extinguisher scene from irreversible and she was indeed disturbed.<br /><br />i'm not sure i have a point, other than that both of us were more disturbed by a scene in a non-horror genre film than any film thus far which sets out to disturb.
