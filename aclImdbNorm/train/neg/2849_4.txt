a comparison between this movie and 'the last detail' is made by some, but 'chasers' is flatter than a stretch of interstate highway in west texas. and like the scenery in the desert, there's nothing much to distinguish it, not even the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around. no one in the cast comes off too well; with this lame script that's not surprising. dennis hopper, the director, won't give much space to this one if he ever writes a memoir, i don't think.
