i'll start by apologizing to filmmakers everywhere for using the terms "filmmaker", "film", or "movie" in connection with this, but "criminal" and "crime against humanity" seem a bit harsh.<br /><br />the writing: pathetic.<br /><br />the directing: pathetic.<br /><br />the acting: pathetic.<br /><br />the cinematography: too inept for words.<br /><br />the technical skills used to assemble this atrocity: none whatsoever.<br /><br />this lump of waste could hardly be called cinema. the majority of family home movies come closer to earning that distinction than revenge quest. no, this is just a 10 car pile-up caught on video.<br /><br />we'll skip the plot in this review, because there are far too many holes to be covered at once. let's just say that it stinks worse than the rest of this movie. to call the acting one-dimensional would be giving them credit. what little there is, is atrocious to begin with, and made much worse by the terrible video and editing.<br /><br />the worst part of this atrocity, though, apart from the plot, would have to be the effects... or rather the disturbing lack thereof. there are no blanks in the guns, no flashpots, and what few sound effects existed were either stock "gun" sounds, or they were generated by mouth (yeah, you read that right). the filmmaker actually had the audacity to record a "shh" sound for the elevator doors; i guess he felt it made them sound more futuristic. this is supposed to be set in the year 2031, after all. that doesn't explain the sounds he created by mouth for the fist-fight scenes, however.<br /><br />if it wasn't bad enough that the sound quality is terrible (he just used the microphone that was mounted on the video camera, and it shows), the use of stock gun sounds was almost worse than not using any sounds at all. the sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunken yak in a herd of sheep, and they're just as clumsy. picture this: the bad guy enters an office building searching for his prey. a lady starts to run in fear. he raises his gun (an uzi), and shakes it. we hear a sound that is clearly not an uzi. the woman runs away from camera, and suddenly a single blood pack (only 1) explodes on her back (looked like she was hit by a paintball), and she falls flat on her face.<br /><br />bear in mind that my description does far too much justice to the ineptitude of the actual sequence.<br /><br />in another sequence, one which almost- but not quite- makes the movie funny enough to watch, takes place in a stairwell. the bad guy chases the good guy and the lady he's protecting down the stairs, shaking his plastic uzi all the way. you may wish to duck; there are badly timed sound effects flying all over the place.<br /><br />i supposed alan deherrera can't be locked away for conceiving of this train wreck, but he did follow through all the way to editing and releasing it. if there's any justice, there's bound to be some karma out there with his name on it.<br /><br />should you decide to watch this lump of industrial waste- and i would strongly advise against it- be sure to watch for the entire scenes lifted nearly verbatim from bladerunner, and the am radio that doubles as a walkie-talkie. try not to focus too hard on the plot; it will only hurt you more if you do.<br /><br />0 stars of 10. and that's being generous.
