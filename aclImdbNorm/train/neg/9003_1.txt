this movie really, i mean really, sucks. its got plot holes so big, and 30 foot dragon can fit through them. not to mention the dragon itself, which is inevitably the worst computer generated image ever to be put on the film real. i mean, when you see something like this, you gotta be thinking "wow, someone actually made this movie. then released it. that takes guts". whoever they are, i'm sure they don't work in the film business anymore.<br /><br />when i hired this movie, it wasn't in on dvd, so i (reluctantly) took it out on video. the first thing to appear, was a lord of the rings trailer, for the two towers. this was a very clever move, putting this trailer on the video. it justifies me (reluctantly) giving the film 1 star, otherwise i would have given it zero stars. maybe the producers though the star attraction of dean cain (i think thats how you spell it) would draw in the crowds (uh, to the video store that is).<br /><br />next they employed split screen technique (like in hulk) to (i assume) compensate for what an atrocity this piece of crap film is. on the box cover, we see a picture of our hero, and the dragon. does the dragon look exactly like the one in dragonheart, or is it just me? either way, the dragon in the film looks like a reject from gremlins 2, and has the cgi of a nintendo video game villain from the early 90's (perhaps worse). also, not the dragons movement as it pursues its victims- its the same f##cking monotonous movement- right leg, left leg, right leg left leg- dom, dom, dom, dom dom, dom f#$king dooooom! this just pisses me off. maybe the filmmakers thought this was thrilling and would have the same effect of jaws. why not then have a dragon pov shot. either way, that was just funny, much like watching a weebl toon.<br /><br />dean cain gives many puzzled looks during the film (maybe his coming to terms with the fact that this film could end his career). don't expect superman here. the first time i saw the trailer for this film, i thought it was an add for a ps2 game.<br /><br />as for the story, its so so bad, my 5 year old brother can come up with better ones when he's unconvincingly trying to lie about why he was messing around in my room while i wasn't there. oh, and did i mention that i f@#king hate the people who made this incredibly stupid stupid crap atrocious film?!!!
