absolutely the most boring movie i have ever spent my money on.this was a wrong choice for all these great stars to waste their reputations on. boring! boring! boring! each character was portrayed in a less than inspirational way. no acting talent shown -just reading a part. alec can play realistic characters normally, gwynyth made herself look ugly for an unrewarding part, annette needs advise on how to pick the movies she chooses to play in as do all these big stars who have left me disappointed at the way they have all allowed their talents to be smothered in a feature that leaves much to be desired in entertainment. "running with scissors" leads the public to anticipate great acting in a film that suggests experiencing tension and deep emotion. there was not one moment when the cast was able to portray any interpretation of this onto the screen. maybe it was the director's fault----whatever.
