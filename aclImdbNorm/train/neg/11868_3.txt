at first glance, this movie has got everything a psycho wants: a vampire story with a "not under 18" restriction, filled with hyper-violence, drugs, gore, sex (including lesbian sex), some fanatics zealots and even a gay necrophiliac cop! but then, this movie is a succession of bad story (so thin), bad acting -with a ridiculous english accent making you believe you're watching a bad monty python -, bad music ('80s hard rock), the videotaping is awful, the ending is a real shame... plus the scenes of sex are ridiculous, the gore not very impressive. and those vampires reflect in a mirror, and don't even fear daylight! you get to be very disappointed, unless you see it as a "space mutiny" or "troll 2". i hope bloodlust will one day reach the bottom 100, because that's its real place.<br /><br />i'd say it can still be fun to watch, if you have friends and enough beer.<br /><br />3/10
