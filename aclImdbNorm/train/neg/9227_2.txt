cq was the worst film i saw this year. nearly every film i choose to see in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say. this film looked like like it was directed by a film student for his intro. to filmmaking class. his father makes great films. his sister made a good one. but brother roman? no! one critic had the audacity to compare this film to godard's le m'epris (contempt). while coppola, jr. did take the same idea, a film about film, he tried too hard to make himself seem european, artsy, and witty, when it's all really just kitsch. the lead actor carries the same expression through the whole film, like he's either in awe or in shock of this film being made around him. schwartzman somehow manages to pull off his role as a flamboyant director. depardieu is alright. the one scene that has any real film spoof humor at all is, surprisingly, not the b-movie scenes, but rather one which takes place in italy; a montage of shots of several various characters inside a very small car, driving around picking up and dropping off random people. this was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema i am guessing he was trying to spoof. or rip-off. or both. the documentary with the lead talking into the camera and filming various objects has been played out, the ending was tagged on for the sake of a "twist" or artistic value... i suppose the funniest thing about this film was the film itself, and not in the way it intended. no wonder this film was sent back after a festival screening to be re-edited or re-shot or whatever, which makes me curious as to just how bad it was before. i can't believe it could have been worse than this. if you want to see a good parody of film check out the austin powers films. any of them. the opening to the third is more entertaining and more genius than this entire film. lil' romy, for the sake of cinema, please go back to directing your cousin's music videos. leave the godfathers to daddy.
