national treasure is about as over-rated and over-hyped as they come. nicholas cage is in no way a believable action hero, and this film is no "indiana jones". people who have compared this movie to the indian jones classic trilogy have seriously fallen off their rocker.<br /><br />i can't really figure out what kind of target audience this film was shooting for. maybe the pre-teen audience will like it, but i found it to be absolutely ludicrous. i also can't imagine adults or young adults to find this to be that great of a film. simply put: it's just ok at best.<br /><br />national treasure is unimagined and uninspired, borrowing what it does have from "the da vinci code". i would recommend waiting for that movie to be released in 2006, and passing on this nonsense.<br /><br />the whole idea of being able to so easily steal the declaration of independence and run around all over washington dc and philadelphia with it (while never damaging it once), while fighting the "bad guys" and experiencing what is supposed to be "non-stop action" is absurd. i particularly loved the scene with the declaration folded in its tube laying in the middle of a busy road while cars whiz by it without damaging it. oh brother! <br /><br />reminded me of that episode of the "brady bunch" where they go to the amusement park and mr. brady loses his architectural plans. except, that episode of the brady bunch was much better than this whole film! <br /><br />the idea of such huge treasure that nobody believes exists being buried within a secret ruin of the us is outlandish. literally, there are thousand of undiscovered "priceless" items in this treasure trove. yeah right!! ridiculous!! <br /><br />even worse, the speed and accuracy of which cage finds and figures out what are supposed to be "tough" clues to these ancient riddles are pre-posterous!!! oh.. the humanity! <br /><br />the performances by cage, voight, and the other actors in "national treasure" are as stiff ,wooden, and flat as they come. however, when you're working with such lousy dialogue, it's hard to fault the actor's 100% for that.<br /><br />national treasure is an ok film to see once. i can't recommend it beyond that and would definitely not purchase this over the top, outlandish scavenger hunt of a mess.<br /><br />rent it if you must see it first.......
