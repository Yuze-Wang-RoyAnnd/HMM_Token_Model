way to go ace! you just made a chilling, grossly intriguing story of a necrophiliac cannibal into a soft, mellow, drama. obviously a movie called dahmer would be one of two kinds: horror, or documentary right? this was neither. it wasn't close to any detailed facts, (in fact it barely had any substance at all) it wasn't really morbid or scary or didn't even try to be very disturbing.(as if you would've had to try!!) what the hell was this writer/director thinking?? here's one of the most real examples of sick serial killers ever and we get badly shot, poorly acted gay bar roofie rapes and lengthy droning flashbacks to alone time in his old parent's house. i think jacobson was actually trying to present (or invent) 'the soft side' of j.dahmer.
