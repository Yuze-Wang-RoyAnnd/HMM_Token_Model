this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. i saw it at the premiere at sxsw and was extremely disappointed. the director knew little about john lennon and even said as much at the premiere. this is a drama, but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was. that's never a good sign. the only saving graces were dominic monaghan and jason leonard as livien's roommates/bandmates. they were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously. the cheesy dropping of beatles lyrics was just absurd. the soundtrack was excellent, however, and was probably the best part of the movie. unless you're one of those crazy, rabid dominic monaghan fans, don't bother with this one.
