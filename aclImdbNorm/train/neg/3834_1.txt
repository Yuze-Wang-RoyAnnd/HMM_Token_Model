watched this film having really enjoyed gregory's girl many years ago. this was drivel. the plot was vaguely distasteful with the teacher and his friend perving over 14-15-year-old girls in very short skirts. previous commenters seem to think that this doesn't matter, but i found it rather nasty. if you have children at school then the last thing you want is to think that every youngish teacher is lusting after his pupils. we were surprised that the censor let that through. apart from that the film was just a waste of time. the script was poor and john gordon sinclair trying too hard to recreate his schoolboy image, slightly wacky and off the wall. why anyone would want to lust after him in this performance is incredible. this film failed on all counts for me. dreadful. please don't waste your time watching it. life's too short
