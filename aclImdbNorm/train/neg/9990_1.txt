having watched this movie on the scifi channel, i can only conclude that this film was made by a bunch of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives. the film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrences, or "delights" as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me. the plot isn't really worth commenting as, but basically a plane carrying football players crashes into yeti territory. before the movie is over, we are treated to yetis ripping hearts out, yetis waddling in an effort to run before jumping 50 meters, yetis ripping a man's legs off and beating him with them, a woman killing a rabbit at 30 meters with a javelin, a yeti surviving several bullets and being set on fire with no apparent harm, a yeti dangling off a cliff by holding to a man's shoe, yet then jumps off, and a whole collection of further, bizarre occurrences. basically, if you aren't staying up on a saturday for the expressed purpose of watching the worst of scifi channel original movies, avoid this film like the plague. or as my friend reading over my shoulder says: "it's the best movie i have ever seen." to which the friend on my right says: "only battle techno music could have made it better."
