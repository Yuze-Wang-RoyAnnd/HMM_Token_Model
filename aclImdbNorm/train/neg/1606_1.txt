in this movie, ch'avez supporters (either venezuelan and not-venezuelan) just lie about a dramatic situation in our country. <br /><br />they did not say that the conflict started because of ch'avez announcement firing a lot of pdvsa best workers just for political issues.<br /><br />they did not say anything about more than 96 tv interruptions transmitted by ch'avez during only 3 days in "cadena nacional" (a kind of confiscation o private tv signals). each one with about 20 minutes of duration.<br /><br />they did not tell us anything about the quiting announcement made by general en jefe lucas rincon romero, inspector general of the army forces, who is a traditional supporter of ch'avez. even now, in despite of his announcement, he is the ministro de interior y justicia. after ch'avez return he occuped the charge of ministro del defensa (equals to defense secretary in us).<br /><br />they did not say anything about ch'avez orders about shooting against a pacifical people concentration who was claiming for elections.<br /><br />they did not say anything about the people in this concentration that were killed by ch'avez supporters (either civilians and military official forces).<br /><br />they present some facts in a wrong order, in order to lie.<br /><br />they did not say anything about venezuelan civilian society thats are even now claiming for an elections in order to solve the crisis and ch'avez actions in order to avoid the elections.<br /><br />that's why i tell you.... this movie is just a lot of lies or a big lie.
