pet sematary , though a nice 80's horror movie, with a nice director and atmosphere, is a copy of the italian movie zeder by pupi avati. it's clear that stephen king has copied almost all the ideas from this director (the movie zeder was made before king wrote the book)<br /><br />the cat, the ground, everything was copied, this is a case of plagiary , but, being stephen kind a famous american writer , it's totally normal that he can get away with this , it's obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of italians movies with no -budget (and in part, it's crap itself ... ) but the original idea, i repeat it, it's italian director avati<br /><br />let the world know
