there's so little here of the fantastic anne rice book that what is here makes no sense. some of the characters--intense and surprising characters--don't make it to the screen at all, and those who do are watered down to the point that there's no reason for their existence.<br /><br />where's the relationship between christophe and marcel? where's the continued affair between marcel and juliet? why does dolly rose appear at all, since her story's never explained? where's the rape and redemption of marie, whose greatest attribute (and downfall) is that she can pass for white--and her marriage to richard? why does the film end with marcel's beating at the hands of his father? we learn nothing of aglae beyond that she's a bitch who hates her husband; why no backstory explaining this hatred? <br /><br />as for the performances, there's not a one that's better than mediocre, though that's likely due to the lousy script. best of the lot is that of the actor playing richard--but richard's not on screen enough to salvage the film. worst is jasmine guy as dolly rose, though again, it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she's given to work with.<br /><br />all in all, this is just terrible. i thought it'd be impossible for any anne rice book-turned film to be worse than exit to eden, but feast of all saints makes that mess look like a critical hit. how is it that rice is such a slut she'll allow her best works to become such junk on the screen?
