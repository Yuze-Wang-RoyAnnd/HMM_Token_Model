i give this movie a one, for it is truly an awful movie. sound track of the dvd is so bad, it actually hurts my ear. but the vision, no matter how disjointed, does show something really fancy in the italian society. i will not go into detail what actually was so shocking , but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal. so for the kink value, i give it one.otherwise, the video, photography, acting of the adults actors /actresses are simply substandard, a practical jock to people who love foreign movies.roberto, the main character, has full spectrum of emotions but exaggerated to the point of being unbelievable.however, the children in the movie are mostly 3/4 years old, and they are genuine and the movie provides glimpse of the italian life..
