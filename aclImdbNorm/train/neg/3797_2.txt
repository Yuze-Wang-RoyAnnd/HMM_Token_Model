years have past since alex rain (played by olivier gruner in the first movie) stumbled onto the horrific plot that involved replacing humans with machines however since then a war between cyborgs and humans has emerged and we lost, now a superwoman of sorts who is the daughter of olivier gruner's character (she also inherits only half of his minimal acting ability) which i think is the films minimal connection to the first, however when the superwoman is created she hides in 1980 while a bounty hunter from the future hunts her down in this confusing sci-fi clunker. nemesis became a cult hit, that i can see why people liked even though i was no fan of said film. nemesis tried very ambitiously to come up with different ideas, develop a beautiful look and provide tons of action, it almost worked. nemesis 2 doesn't even have that ambition, it's a cheap rip off of the terminator with a muscled female who is so low on acting ability she makes olivier gruner seem like a master thespian and the action sequences lack the explosive scope that was the main selling point of the original. i'll admit i was no fan of the original but it deserved a better follow up than this. the original also featured a good cast like tim thomerson, cary hiroyuki tagawa, thom mathews, brion james, thomas jane and yes jackie earle haley this one features nobody and this time it's just a dull movie with a pretentious vibe. in fact after i saw this, it inspired to add a half star to the original.<br /><br />* out of 4-(bad)
