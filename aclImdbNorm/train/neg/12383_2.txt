while some performances were good-victoria rowell, adrienne barbeau, and the two italian girlfriends come to mind-the story was lame and derivative, the emphasis on the girlfriend's racial background was handled clumsily at best, and the relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes, not as real people. i found myself wincing uncomfortably at many moments that were supposed to be funny. i can hardly comprehend why the local paper here in sf said this was a good movie, and wonder who posted the glowing review here on imdb. very disappointed in this movie, and mad i actually went to a theatre to see it, based on the faulty connection to garden state, which is a far funnier, more inventive, and touching movie than this one. i must especially mention the emotional climax in the church, which was so wooden and by-the-numbers that i nearly left, and some in the audience actually did. that was followed by a silly climax at the graveyard, which i saw coming 10 minutes before it happened. i really don't like being misled to spend my money so uselessly.
