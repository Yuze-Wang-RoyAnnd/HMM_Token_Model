in some ways, the concept behind the storyline was a rather interesting blend of several typical movie types in an interesting combination. however, no point in this movie was so obvious that it did not deserve lingering close-up shots. i felt as though i had been beat over the head with the so-called mysterious explanation for the disease killing people.<br /><br />the writer appears to have simply lifted clich'es from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to actual characters. the actors did not help matters. no chemistry. i guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason that such is an essential element of these stories. however, the writers didn't work very hard to develop the chemistry. sure, they're both attractive, but whether they're attractive to each other seemed to be an open question.<br /><br />the confidence turner's character shows in sabato's developed far too quickly and for no particular reason. sabato's character is supposed to be a discredited doctor who just can't seem to play by the rules. think of the jeff goldblum character in "independence day." usually, that kind of character is supposed to demonstrate some kind of talent or brilliance. sabato's character does not. he's cassandra with just the crazy and all the prophetic skills of a magic eight ball. he appears to be right by random chance.<br /><br />the death scenes are comical. every actor was really trying more than a little to hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them. the symptoms looked like bad claymation, sort of like that video from the 80s, peter gabriel, i think.
