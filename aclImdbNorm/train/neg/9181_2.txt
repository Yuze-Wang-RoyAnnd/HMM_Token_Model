i usually try to be professional and constructive when i criticize movies, but my god!!! this was the worst movie i have ever seen. bad acting, bad effects, bad script, bad everything! <br /><br />the plot follows a group of teen cliche's on their way to a rave (that takes place in broad daylight) at a remote island. however, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party-goers, the clan set's off on a mission through a zombie-infested forest. during this crusade, they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids. they also meet up with jonathan cherry and some other survivors. basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the "house of the dead." this fight came complete with cheesy hollywood violence, redundant clips from the hotd video game, and sloppy matrix-esque camera rotations. one of the character's even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others. why? not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled! i'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy?!?<br /><br />to sum it all up, there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is. the theater i was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and i'm sure the money i wasted seeing this piece of sh*t could easily cover the costs it took to make it. grade: f
