as myself and my other half are big fans of trash horror we couldn't resist getting out a movie that contained both of the greats we were thrilled! however for a 2004 movie with a rip off cover of freddy vs jason this is a disgrace! the worst film i have ever seen but worth a look for a laugh if you are able to sit through it!<br /><br />the acting is awful the effects...well i could do better on my camcorder in fact its so bad they only bothered to put make up on the zombies faces and left out neck, hands etc. no story line, weird flashbacks that make no sense and terrible script!<br /><br />"you broke my tooth!" from one vampire "you broke my cigar" was the response from the human who looked like uncle jessie from dukes crossed with santa!
