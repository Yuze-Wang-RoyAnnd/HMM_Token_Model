first of all sorry for giving even a rating of 1 to this movie (nothing less than this available). the film fails in every department be it screenplay, direction, characterization or acting. <br /><br />1) to start with, the name of the movie is really c class (though the movie itself match up to the name). 2) amitabh bachchan tries his best to live up to the character but the weak script coupled with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character. 3) in sholay gabbar singh has reward of 50,000 on him (which was convincing). here in aag the figure was 100 crores for babban (amitabh bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so called hero's and had only few men bikes to commute (with all automatic guns). making a sholay like movie in mumbai type setup in modern time doesn't look convincing. 4) as for nisha kothari, somebody needs to tell her that she doesn't know acting. why is ram gopal verma casting her again and again ? 5) mohanlal was good but there is hardly anything for him to do. 6) sushant singh and rajpal yadav who are great actors are wasted in the movie. 7) legendry role played by lila misra (mausi of basanti) in sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some gangu mummy. ramu please grow up and understand that there needs to be some intellect in your movie. enough of stupid characters in your movie like shiva and aag. 8) should not say anything about modern jai and veeru..pathetic to the greatest extent.<br /><br />to summarize, i was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of original classic. please don't waste money and time on this movie. i think watching aap ka surror (which i thought was the worst movie possible) would be a better idea than to see this horrible package of stupid characters, bad songs and miserable direction.<br /><br />thanks, saurabh
