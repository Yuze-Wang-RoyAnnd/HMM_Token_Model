what begins as a fairly clever farce about a somewhat shady security monitoring company turns, almost instantaneously, into an uninteresting and completely inane murder mystery. david arquette and the great stanley tucci try mightily to make this train wreck watchable, but some things are just not humanly possible.<br /><br />what, for instance, causes gale to turn suddenly from a sweet motherly figure into a drunken shrew at tommy's parents house? why would heinrich, although admittedly a sleezebag, want to destroy the business to which he devotes his life, by robbing and possibly murdering his customers? why does the seemingly sensible tommy believe that heinrich could be a murderer (based almost entirely on a dream), and even if that were believable, why wouldn't he go to the police? and why didn't gale activate the alarm when she got home, especially after scolding howie about it being off? of course, all of these events are necessary for the plot (and i use the term very, very loosely) to unfold. and it might be forgivable if it resulted in even the slightest bit of comedy. but everything, from howie's description of his date rape, to the coroner's misidentification of gale, to the final "joke" about gale and howie still being dead, is more tasteless and pathetic than anything else.<br /><br />i checked the box indicating that my comments contained "spoilers", but there's nothing more i or anyone else could do to spoil this thing that already stinks to high heaven.
