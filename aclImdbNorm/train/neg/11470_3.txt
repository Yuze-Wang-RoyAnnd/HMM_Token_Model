orca starts as crusty irish sea captain nolan (richard harris) & his crew are trying to capture a great white shark so they can sell it for big bucks, unfortunately when a hapless marine biologist called ken (robert carradine) comes under attack from it the shark is killed by a killer whale, this raises nolan's interest in killer whales & decides he want's to catch one of them instead. however while trying to do so he catches a pregnant female & injuries it to the extent she aborts her unborn foetus on deck which makes a mess & enrages her mate, nolan orders the whale be dumped back in the sea which is what happens. the male killer whale is annoyed to say the least & kills one of nolan's crew before they reach the dry land of newfoundland in canada, once there the killer whale conducts a series of attacks on the town & it's people in an effort to lure nolan back out to sea for a fight to the death...<br /><br />directed by michael anderson i thought this blatant rip-off was terrible, i'm sorry but i thought it was just plain ridiculous & utterly dull even at a modest 90 odd minutes. the script by producer luciano vincenzoni & sergio donati is so stupid i'm lost for words, the fact that it seems to take itself very seriously doesn't help & if i have to listen to charlotte rampling go on about how intelligent killer whale's are just one more time i'll scream. i'm sorry but i simply don't believe a killer whale is intelligent enough to know who any particular boat belongs to & sink it, i don't believe a killer whale can cause a huge explosion including knocking an oil lantern from a wall on the opposite side it hits as there is no way on earth it could know it was there, i don't believe a killer whale can identify someone's house, know someone is in there & then wreck it on purpose, i don't believe a killer whale can move icebergs around in order to trap a boat, i don't believe killer whales can physically recognise people & i don't believe it has any revenge instincts or at least none that are as strong as this dumb film makes out. maybe i'm being a bit harsh, i mean it's only a film after all but it's a film which is trying to be serious & things just got so ridiculous that i was half expecting the killer whale to write a letter to nolan to tell him his plan & hand (or should that be fin?) deliver it, the thing seemed intelligent enough to do just about anything else. they should have asked it to come up with a cure for the common cold! seriously, that's a statement that's no more far fetched than anything else in this film. i found the film very boring, totally dull & had awful character's with no on screen presence at all. it goes without saying this is a jaws (1975) rip-off which doesn't even come close to spielberg's classic.<br /><br />director anderson is no spielberg that's for sure, this rubbishy film has absolutely no suspense, scares, tension or atmosphere at all. all the attack scenes are as dull as dishwater & totally forgettable, there's no build up to them & virtually no pay off either as orca doesn't get to eat a single person. then there's the scenes which literally had me laughing, the shots of the killer whale appearing to cry are pure comedy & the opening scenes of the two killer whales i suspect tried to show them as a 'loving' & 'caring' couple but i couldn't help but think that this is the closest we'll ever get to killer whale porn, hilarious stuff. the footage of the killer whales themselves is bland & boring, instead of footage which matches & enhances the scenes around it it just looks like dreary wildlife documentary footage that has little connection to anything else. do you get the impression that i don't like this film? good. forget about any gore or decent deaths either, there's a brief scene when bo derek has her legs bitten off but blink and you'll miss it.<br /><br />this probably had quite a big budget & it still sucks, there's nothing outstanding about orca, it's well made i suppose but flat, bland & totally forgettable. the cinematography is quite nice though. the acting is bad, rampling is awful & the late harris' irish accent is embarrassing.<br /><br />orca is a lame jaws rip-off which completely ignores or messes up everything that made spielberg's film so good, this is one for bad movie lovers everywhere. definitely not recommended although not quite as bad as jaws: the revenge (1987).
