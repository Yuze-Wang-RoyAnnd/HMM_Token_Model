van dien must cringe with embarrassment at the memory of this ludicrously poor film, as indeed must every single individual involved. to be honest i am rather embarrassed to admit i watched it from start to finish. production values are somewhere between the original series of 'crossroads' and 'prisoner cell block h'. most five year olds would be able to come up with more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot. as for the acting performances, if you can imagine the most rubbish porno you have ever seen - one of those ones where the action is padded out with some interminable 'story' to explain how some pouting old peroxide blonde boiler has come to be getting spit-roasted by a couple of blokes with moustaches - you will have some idea of the standard of acting in 'maiden voyage'. worse still, you can't even fast forward to the sex scenes, because there aren't any. an appallingly dreadful film.
