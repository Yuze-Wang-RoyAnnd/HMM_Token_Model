any movie in which brooke shields out-acts a fonda is going to be both an anomaly and a horror. shields actually is only bad because she's youthful, inexperienced, and clearly not well directed by her co-star. peter fonda is bad because, well, because he's bad. i liked him in ulee's gold, years later, but lord above, he's awful here. not that anyone else is good. there's not a single performance (outside henry fonda's delightful cameo) that is even passable. i've never seen a movie with this many bad performances. in the case of luke askew, the chief villain, it's clear this is because of poor dialogue and direction, as he's done good work in the past. but his partner, played by ted markland, is an embarrassing ham. the writing is just bloody awful, and the actors cannot be faulted for the terrible things they have to say. but they say them so badly! the editing and direction are worse than pedestrian. shots are held way too long for no dramatic reason, or cut off before the impact of the scene can be realized. this picture was far worse than i'd imagined and would have been utterly forgotten (and probably never even made) without the participation of a couple of famous names. one bright spot: the cinematography in the grand canyon is exquisite, capturing the beauty of that area in a way even big-screen imax productions have not quite done so well. and finally: either this is a bad version of paper moon, with a lovable pair of father-daughter types, or it's a bad version of pretty baby, with a considerably more icky romantic relationship between a forty-something and a 13-year-old. it suggests more of the latter than the former, and thus is pretty disturbing.
