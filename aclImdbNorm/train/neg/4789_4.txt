"phantasm" of 1979 was a highly atmospheric, creepy, scary and very original horror flick, and, in one word, cult. the first sequel of 1988 was gory, witty, action-packed and highly entertaining. after the first sequel however, "phantasm" creator don coscarelly apparently lacked new ideas. "phantasm iii - lord of the dead" of 1994 is certainly not a complete failure, it even is quite entertaining, but there is no more originality, and the desperate attempts to bring in something new, are at times tiresome, which makes it quite disappointing in comparison to its predecessors. <br /><br />- spoilers - <br /><br />quite in the beginning, we are introduced the secret behind the mysterious sentinel spheres (the brain-sucking flying silver balls) is unraveled. thenceforward, a number of unnecessary and annoying new characters (such as tim, a "home alone"-style little kid who happens to be great at shooting, an rocky, a tough and super-cool nunchaku-swinging black chick with a crew cut) are introduced. the film also has its qualities - reggie bannister is again very cool as the pony-tailed, guitar playing reggie. angus scrimm is still quite creepy as the tall man, but the fact that the tall man talks a lot more in this film, makes him loose some of his creepiness. the character of mike is played by a. michael baldwin again (he had been replaced by james legros in part 2), which, in my opinion, doesn't make much of a difference. the gore also keeps the film interesting enough to watch, but it is still a disappointment, especially because the attempts to make up for the lack of ideas get annoying quite quickly.<br /><br />all things considered, "phantasm iii" is an acceptable time-waster, but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors. fans of the first two "phantasm" films can give it a try, but i recommend not to set your expectations too high.
