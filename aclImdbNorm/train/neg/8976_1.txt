the first point that calls the attention in "for ever mozart" is the absence of a plot summary in imdb. the explanation is simple since there is no story, screenplay, plot or whatever might recall the minimum structure of a movie. jean-luc godard is one of the most overrated and pretentious directors of the cinema industry and this pointless crap is among his most hermetic films. i believe that neither himself has understood what is this story about; but there are intellectuals that elucubrate to justify or explain this messy movie, and it is funny to read their reviews. <br /><br />my vote is one.<br /><br />title (brazil): "para sempre mozart" ("forever mozart")
