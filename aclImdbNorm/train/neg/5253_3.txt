the name (frau) of the main character is the german word for "woman". i don't know if that was intentional or not, but if sure got some giggles from the german audience at the fantasy film festival last year, when it was shown.<br /><br />but those were the only giggles the movie got. not that it was aiming for giggles, it's a horrible movie for heaven's sake! a horrible movie in more than one meaning. it's a shame that a premise like that was wasted with horrible even unbearable moments for the viewer (definetely not for the faint of heart!!)! and it wasn't even necessary to show all the things that are shown. i'm not even going into a moral obligation (because movies don't really have that kind of task or function) discussion of what is shown here, but this is a new low on the whole "torture movement" that has grown in the last few years!
