i ordered this extremely rare and highly overrated movie on ebay with very high expectations. i think i paid about 50$ for this movie. as an eternal fan of horror, from cheesy 80s american slashers to european zombie films, i told myself this was going to be great! i can't tell you how wrong i was. first of all, i thought it was gonna be pretty much gorier than it actually is. after all i've had heard about this film, i was almost scared to watch it. the murders are boring. the acting... forget it, there's no acting! the story, even if we don't care, is incredibly bad. it seems they tried to get your attention with some weird sexual scenes and naked girls, but unfortunately in this case it doesn't help the movie. why? there's no atmosphere, and this is the worst thing about this flick. it's just bad film-making from point a to b. though it's extremely funny and amusing to watch with your friends and a lot of beers, don't make any effort to get your hands on it. there are so many movies in this world, don't waste your time watching necro files!
