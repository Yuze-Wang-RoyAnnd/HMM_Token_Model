this barely watchable film was a bit of an ordeal to sit through. none of the segments are good, but at least the first one was mildly amusing, and the middle one was somewhat imaginative. the final one was just plain brutal, and after sitting through two weak comedic shorts, the third one was truly painful to watch. even by the low standards of a national lampoon movie, this one seemed especially boring and joyless.
