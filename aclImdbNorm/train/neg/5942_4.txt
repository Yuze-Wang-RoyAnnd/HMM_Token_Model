if this is supposed to be the black experience, let me out at either the front or back door.<br /><br />a mama's boy one day sees 2 young hoods walk by and from then on it's all down hill for him. angela bassett, the one shining grace in this film, plays his over protective, religious mother. despite her anger at how his life has turned, by the middle of the picture, she really decides to accept this. she allows his friends to come in and suddenly it's all right to use the profanity as long as it's not in front of the children.<br /><br />this is a sad state of affairs regarding gangster rap. you knew where this film was heading.<br /><br />i literally laughed out loud when at the end, when bassett is accompanying her son's body for burial, she states that while his life had been cut short at age 24, he had become a man. what man? he had been a convicted criminal, wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarity,and scorned society. that scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker, he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what goes on in our schools. the complete and utter lack of respect for the teacher.<br /><br />the east coast, west coast gang rap rivalry is never fully explained. all we see are guns blazing.<br /><br />a terrible picture doing nothing to prevent gang violence. what horrible role models are these rap singers and their foul music. the african american community should take umbrage at their very being. who was this classless fat slob who portrayed biggie? he made rerun from the old television show look thin by comparison. i know it was the streets of bedford stuyvesant that changed this chubby little boy into the vulgar monster that he was. what a sorry state of affairs when this is called motion picture entertainment.
