"serum" starts out with credits that are quite reminiscent of the "re-animator" movies, and it owes a lot to them. the story is very similar; a mad doctor develops a serum that he believes will alleviate pain, sickness and death, but he's apparently not a big believer in clinical trials and so winds up with a brain-eating zombie on his hands in the person of his nephew. the zombie even looks like one of those from "re-animator," and in fact some of the make-up effects in "serum" aren't bad. unfortunately, the script is pretty slow and unbelievable in quite a few places, resulting in a soap opera feel for most of the first 3/4 of the movie. for some reason, the director feels compelled to tell us the time of day every few minutes by flashing it in big white letters across the screen. i can't see why this was important, other than being an attempt to provide viewers with a sense of time passing; sometimes, that wouldn't be present otherwise as the plot plods along.<br /><br />there are a number of moments that just don't add up here. for instance, one victim is bludgeoned with a sledge hammer, but when we see the victim's head up close, there's no sign of that trauma. in another scene, a character runs down a fully lit hospital corridor (we can see the circles of light on the floor, in fact) with a flashlight in hand, looking for all the world like he's walking in the dark... but a moment later a second character walks down the same fully-lit corridor without one. these are just a couple of examples; moments of what look like directorial or editorial sloppiness crop up quite frequently throughout the movie.<br /><br />"serum" is better in some ways than much of what goes straight-to-video as independent horror lately. in terms of technical items
