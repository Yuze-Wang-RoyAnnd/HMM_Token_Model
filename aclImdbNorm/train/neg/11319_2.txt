vampire cyborgs rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel, however there is going to be a shift of power thanks to a renegade android (kris kristofferson) and a warrior woman (kathly long) as they face off against lance henriksen and gary daniels (who play the cyborgs in this ridiculous movie) of all the questions left unanswered by this dreadful movie, the most poignant is who's idea was it to cast country singer kris kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to give as good as he gets. no, don't get me wrong i could see kristofferson as a vigilante or something but not as a cyborg. strangely one suspects that this was written for dolph lundgren, however lundgren must have had the wisdom to not do it. however despite the disastrous casting, kristofferson is easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie. he gives a performance far more human then the inexpressive kathy long. (and kristofferson is playing a robot) despite the miscasting, kristofferson provides the few moments of interest. lance henriksen is slumming and gary daniels is wasted but basically knights is baffling failure. you stand back in horror wondering who the hell thought that this was even a good idea on paper. (this is a movie where a dismembered kristofferson is fighting robots in a backpack) worst of all it ends in a what if sequel, thankfully this has yet to materialize although i still have nightmares at the proposition of the likelihood of such an event.<br /><br />* out of 4-(bad)
