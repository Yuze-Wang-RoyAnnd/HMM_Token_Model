yeah, unfortunately i came across the dvd of this and found that it was incredibly awful.<br /><br />first of all, the characters suck. i mean, come on, if some dork in an orange hat who calls himself 'orange sherbert' is the best creative idea these guys could come up for a character, then they should definitely not be in the film-making scene. poor "costumes", bad "interviews", and basically there is not one "wrestler" on this whole disc with any shred of charisma.<br /><br />the "wrestling" in splatter rampage wrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and playfully bouncing together on a trampoline. they make sure to giggle together all the while, too, making the experience seem more like a toddler's playtime than a "wrestling deathmatch".<br /><br />basically, splatter rampage wrestling is a pretty lackluster backyard wrestling clone. only, instead of blood, weapons, mayhem, and wrestling, we get a trampoline, giggling kids, terrible audio, and some guy called orange sherbert.<br /><br />wrestling fan or not, avoid this dvd. it's awful.
