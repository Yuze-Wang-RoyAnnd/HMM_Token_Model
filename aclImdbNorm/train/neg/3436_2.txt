a girl is showering unknowing that a serial rapist is staring at her through the skylight. detectives martin manners and orville stone is hot on his trail, but not hot enough as they find him after he kills, rapes, and eats a nipple of the girl.he's the shot to death. one would hope that this would be the end of the film. not because it's too horrifying, but because the level of acting is atrociously horrid. sadly it's not the end and months later the rapist is resurrected as a zombie by a coven of satanists. so he continues where he left off, with the detectives on the case again, this time a flying baby is after him too (don't ask). there has been very good very low-budget movies (street trash and filthy mcnasty spring to mind), but this one is scraping the bottom of the barrel. horrible acting, crappy dime store special effects, lame attempt at comedy and oh yeah, and the ending sucks too.<br /><br />my grade: f <br /><br />eye candy: theresa bestul gets fully nude; anne r. key gets topless
