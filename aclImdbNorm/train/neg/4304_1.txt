this is an anti-serb propaganda film made for tv.<br /><br />"the muslims are good; the orthodox christian serbs are bad." <br /><br />that's the message.<br /><br />using "entertainment" to get across a propaganda message is nothing new.<br /><br />this movie lays it on thick.<br /><br />and apparently many viewers and reviewer lap it up.<br /><br />i know better.<br /><br />the serbs, under general draza milhalovitch and his chetniks, saved over 500 shot-down us fliers from the germans in world war ii.<br /><br />churchill decided to betray milhalovitch and put british backing behind communist tito. roosevelt followed suit and as a result, after the war ended yugoslavia was delivered over to communist tito.<br /><br />and us ally milhalovitch has been smeared by the media ever since.<br /><br />this movie is part of the anti-serb propaganda campaign engineered by george soros and his international crisis group (icg) which culminated in the kosovo "war," in which serbia was bombed by nato because of totally false claims by the icg of "mass graves" in kosovo filled with "victims" of the nasty serbs. the fact that there were no such mass graves and the albanians (muslims) had no business being in serbia's kosovo are facts that most of the media won't print.<br /><br />i chose this movie to watch because the one-sentence description on the video cover looked interesting.<br /><br />imagine my disgust when i discovered i had been fooled into renting another branch of the propaganda machine aimed at serbia.<br /><br />instead of this propaganda someone should make a movie about the unwillingness of the clinton administration to come clean with the congress and with the american people about its complicity in the delivery of weapons from iran to the muslim government in sarajevo.<br /><br />i won't hold my breath waiting for such a movie.
