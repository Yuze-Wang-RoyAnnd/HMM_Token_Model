exactly what you would expect from a b-movie. deritive, gratuitous nudity, boring in parts, ridiculous gore and cheesy special-effects. of course it could have been better, better acted (defintly) better written, directed, etc. but then i guess it wouldn't have been a b movie. the actors pretty much sucked, in fact this pretty much seemed like an episode of buffy the vampire slayer or something except with a lot of blood, profanity and nudity.<br /><br />tiffany shepis must be singled out. she absolutely is the scream queen of the new millennium. not that acting really matters in these movies, but she was better than any of the other actors. she's also smokin hot, in that plastic jump suit thing she wore for the whole movie - wow! her posterior is absolutely stunning in that outfit, i mean it every single time she turns around you can help but check her out. and near then end of the film the viewer is rewarded with seeing her completely nekked.<br /><br />so if your a looser b-movie horror buff (like myself), check this out. if not, you should probably avoid at all costs.
