what happened? 'doubt' had so much potential to be a brilliant film - but instead it faltered with a dragging simplistic plot line which made me want to stop watching. the only thing the film had going for it was the brilliance of meryl streep, who no doubt deserved the oscar-nomination. though it was not one of her best performances, she still gave a solid and truthful character to us which blossomed through the screen.<br /><br />however, not even the brilliance of a screen legend could save this film from going down hill. from the boring start, which had no power or punch - to the less than convincing ending, the film was truly a disappointment - especially since it provided so much potential through its promotion and trailers. it was obvious the director had trouble with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring film, which dragged on for too long, with too much talk and not enough action.<br /><br />furthermore, the other oscar-nominations were less than convincing. though philip seymour hoffman gave a decent performance, it was by no means oscar-worthy. (especially since they completely left out performances such as will smith, in seven pounds). amy adams did not deserve the nomination. watching amy adams was like watching a cardboard box - as it was one sided and plain. it would have made more sense to nominate her for a razzie, as i am sure she would have walked away victorious. viola davis gave a short but truthful performance, but the length of her performance made me question whether the academy really should have given her the nomination.<br /><br />overall, i consider doubt to be one of the most disappointing films of 2008. it was a mess of a film with so much potential, and i do not recommend it. the only shining light in the film is meryl streep, who though gives a stunning, solid performance - doesn't even do enough to save this film. *** / 10.
