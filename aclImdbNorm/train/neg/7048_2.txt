i chose this movie by the cover which was a bad move. it wasn't funny at all and the main characters were obnoxious. the girl was beautiful but the story and the acting were terrible. it had absolutely nothing to do with surfing. terrible movie with a surf "theme" that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers. catherine zeta jones was beautiful and the movie will probably see a resurgence just becuase she is in the limelight now, being married with gordon gekko and all, but if you haven't seen it don't waste your time. a bad movie with great surfing, real surfers and amazing, beautiful cinematography was in god's hands.
