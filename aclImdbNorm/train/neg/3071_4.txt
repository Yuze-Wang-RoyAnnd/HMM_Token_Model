i found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting. i never had to read this book (thankfully), or it would have been a painful experience. i got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasn't worth my time, or my friend's. i think this story is not worth telling. it's like saying that old people have a past before they got old (no kidding). the lives of the main characters were painful to watch, one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes. however, i think the actors did the best they could with a lame story. i've always been a big fan of ellen burstyn. i'm writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given, which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try.
