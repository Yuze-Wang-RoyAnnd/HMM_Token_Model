the word in the summary sums it up d'oh ;) five girls get lost trying to find their way home, when they stop at a store to get directions they hit a parked car breaking one headlight on it, they flea the scene in fair of getting in trouble but suddenly they see one headlight coming up behind them (ooooh).<br /><br />from there out everything is screaming, crying and violence when they try to get away from this crazy person who lost it because of a headlight ;), well the screaming and crying pretty much stays through the entire movie (very annoying) the movie is shot, with a cheap camera trying to make it seem "real" or "shocking" i guess, it's just embarrassing and useless though. in lack of anything better to compare it with, "blair witch style".<br /><br />the screaming and crying for pretty much the entire movie with crappy sound was over the top annoying, you literally get a headache :)<br /><br />i'm sorry but this was not scary, only an annoying painful piece of crap movie.
