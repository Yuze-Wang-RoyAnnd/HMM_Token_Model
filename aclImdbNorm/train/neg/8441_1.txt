this movie was long and boring. surprising that it was selected for cannes, although they tend to like pretentiousness. point is that contrary to other dutch stars of the arty genre like kerkhof and kruishoop, guernsey feels utterly empty. even more so it has no cinematic quality whatsoever. a long opening shot doesn't mean cinematic depth, it's just a long boring shot. the story wasn't interesting and the characters had problems i couldn't identify with at all. the actors didn't shine under her direction and seemed lost at times. leopold tried, but she is not the talent i hoped she would be. where are kerkhof and kruishoop? they really made some waves in dutch cinema. leopold just made another attempt.
