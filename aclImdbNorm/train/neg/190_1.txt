i always felt that a good film should have a plot. this particular film was missing one, and i feel that it would have been more effective with a plot. this was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever; i was anxious for it to finally end. however, i just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; it felt like four hours. not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict. it's not the worst movie i've seen, but i used to say that it was until i saw "the fast and the furious". so, don't think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action. i actually hate most action films out today; it's just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum. not much really happens in this movie. however, the scenery and costumes were nice.
