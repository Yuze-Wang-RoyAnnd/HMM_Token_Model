this movie is probably the worst i have seen. bad acting, bad script, bad everything. comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting. both cyborg (van damme, 1989) and nemesis (olivier gruner, 1993) are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it's albert pyun who has directed these two as well!<br /><br />the story is not original. the world has become a terrible place, possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war, and people live under medieval circumstances. a special breed of robots (cyborgs) live on human blood and there's the story... the cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there "prophecy" and the humans need someone to stop them. one girl together with a robot (kris kristofferson) built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankind.<br /><br />in this movie the director tries some hong-kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far. the movie fails miserably in this attempt.<br /><br />i recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new "worst ever" movie to relate to. and to fans of the genre i recommend "cyborg" since i think it's a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor. and if you can't stand van damme then check out "nemesis".<br /><br />i rated this movie 1/10.
