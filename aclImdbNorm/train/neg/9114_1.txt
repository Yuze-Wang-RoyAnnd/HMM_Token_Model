because 'cruel' would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers. where do you even begin? in a spout of b*tchiness, i'm going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie. scratch that. nearly does not belong in that sentence. i can't think of even one character who was portrayed well. although, in all fairness, it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way. still, the girl who played katherine (whose name i purposefully don't include - i'm pretending she doesn't exist) remains one of the worst actors i've ever seen, only eclipsed by the guy who played sebastian. the story was god awful. it attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways. pretty much every part of it was pointless - though i will admit (grudgingly) that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise. and the ending was at least slightly humorous. but this film is up there with the worst i've seen. don't watch it. just don't. there is absolutely no value in watching it. none. it only takes away the enjoyment of the first.
