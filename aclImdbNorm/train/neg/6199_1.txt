first a technical review. the script is so slow, it is really a 25 minute story blown up to 1 hour 40 min. the dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional. the "acting" is pathetic, they seem to really have lifted schoolchildren out of class to read a few lines from an idiot board. as for the whole "point" of the story, namely "war is bad" (oh, there's a shock!) is really non-existent. without out the "lets shock 'em and get great publicity" scene nobody would be talking about this film. it is so bad it actually bothers me to think what better things the money used this could have gone on. believe me i've seen some bad "emperor's new clothes" films but the one thing i can say for them is at least they were well shot and well made while the camera wobbled during two scenes in this! read all the other reviews - avoid at all costs and don't talk about it.
