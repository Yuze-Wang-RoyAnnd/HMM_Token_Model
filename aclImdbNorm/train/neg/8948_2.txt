'ninteen eighty-four' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted. it is a very dark film, and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself. it is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self-centred. the film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours (contrasting with happiness and bright colours in the dreams) and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places. however, despite the film's cleverness at portraying this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across. it seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling a story.
