not to be confused with the above average supernatural thriller "the sentinel". the sentinel was a big bore of a movie for me, not delivering the consistent action, a couple of critics promised on the back. to me it seemed like everyone was halfassing it, and only there to make some quick cash, because this felt very much like a made for tv film. the sentinel is a rehash of several better films, like "in the line of fire" this does not have any originality in it, and watching michael douglas run around, felt kinda silly in my opinion. the main problem besides it's unoriginality, had to be the poor pace. i often got distracted while trying to view this movie, while looking how much run time was left, more then once. not only the miscasting with eva longoria, who couldn't convince worth a lick.<br /><br />performances. michael douglas is usually a dependable actor, here is obviously going through the motions. he does not convince as a man on a run, or a secret agent. his chemistry with bassinger, was also off. i'm a big fan of kiefer sutherland, but here he is only ok, nothing more then that. he tries to come across as a gruff, but managed to be more bland then anything else, and to be honest, he didn't seem that interested. eva longoria parker is pretty mediocre. she does not convince in her role, and was pure eye candy. kim basinger is pretty terrible as the 1st lady. she looks bored to tears, and her role is a throw away, more then anything else. martin donovan has a big part in the end, but not enough to matter for me.<br /><br />bottom line. the sentinel is yet, another political thriller, that bored me to tears. it's too old, too tired, and most importantly the lack of effort sucked. not recommended.<br /><br />4/10
