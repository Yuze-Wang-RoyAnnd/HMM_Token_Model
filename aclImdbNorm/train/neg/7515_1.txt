sucks. that's all i got to say about this sorry excuse for a film. sucks. sucks. sucks. i mean, what the hell were they thinking? the idiots involved should never be allowed to make another films. the acting was so bad that it even failed to entertain on a bad level. the attempt at a "lesbian scene" was sad. i felt so bad for the ladies involved. this movie sucks! sucks! sucks!<br /><br />i heard rumors of a sequel.<br /><br />god<br /><br />help<br /><br />us<br /><br />all
