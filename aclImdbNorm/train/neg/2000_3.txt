i found the pace to be glacial and the original story blown way out of proportion to the content. my wife slept through most of it and i did not try to wake her because i felt she was not missing anything.<br /><br />when holmes and watson enter the house and then are potentially caught, it is unclear how they could hide all of their entry and burglary tools so quickly. it is also unclear how the door to the study is locked, preventing the servants from getting in.<br /><br />the thing that puzzled me was right at the end when there was a glint in the eye of the broken statute. i have no clue what this was supposed to represent.
