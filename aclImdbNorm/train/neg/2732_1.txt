when 'my deja vu, my deja vu' aired last season, i was pleased. scrubs, i thought, is doing something clever and unique in regards to the clip-show concept. instead of replaying footage, they're replaying jokes in a self-aware manner, and i really enjoyed it.<br /><br />i found it really unfortunate that i was wrong. one season later, they succumbed to that which almost all sitcoms inevitably do, the clip show...and it looked like it was put together by the work-experience kid. dr cox's shaved head shows just how lazy the editors were in putting it together, as it doesn't appear again until 'my long goodbye' some 4 episodes later. i can't imagine that a wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well-constructed sitcom. who knows why it was slotted there, it just seemed lazy and out of place, reminding me (largely) of episodes that have aired within the past year.<br /><br />three second clips jammed together with background music is a dvd extra for a (very) rainy day, not an episode of prime-time television.
