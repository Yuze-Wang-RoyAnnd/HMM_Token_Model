i find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream hollywood movies like indiana jones and the temple of doom, american graffiti and howard the duck would begin their career with a low-budget exploitation horror film like this. perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn willard hyuck and gloria katz an oscar nomination later in their respective careers, messiah of evil has potential, but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can't muster the film-making prowess to pull it off.<br /><br />the premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back. it doesn't take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity - and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe messiah of evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70's exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror.<br /><br />the surreal non-sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the 'blood moon', a scruffy and half-mad alcoholic (played by the great elisha cook jr. in perhaps the best scene of the movie) who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley 'eaten by dogs' a little later, the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father's paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded, murderous, squirrel-eating albino.<br /><br />part of the movie's charm is precisely this brand of bargain-basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way. whereas with lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator, with messiah of evil the boundaries between the 'intentional', the 'unintentional' and the 'didn't really expect it to come out this way but it's good enough - wrap scene' blur hopelessly.<br /><br />take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug-addled, feverish, stream-of-consciousness way, one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father, and the other narrated by her father's voice as she reads his diary. <br /><br />while we're still talking about a 'living dead' picture, messiah of evil is different and only loosely one - at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be. the origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse, bestowed upon the town by a mysterious 'dark stranger' who came from the woods one day. in the meantime hyuck finds time for snippets of mass-consumption criticism in a flesh-eating supermarket scene that predates dawn of the dead by a good number of years (you can hear the mst3k line already: 'man is dead, only his capitalist food tins remain') and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater.<br /><br />i generally think that the surreal works in careful, well measured doses - how is the absurd to work if it's not hidden within the perfectly normal? hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand. when the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her, you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience, amused and satisfied with his own hijinks. <br /><br />the general film-making level is also pretty low - after the half-way mark, the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either. add to that the choppy editing, average acting and hyuck's general inability to capture true atmosphere - the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused - and i'd file messiah under 'missed opportunity' but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate - even though it's not particularly gory, trashy or sleazy.
