this is not a very good movie, but it's not a stinker either. it is very confusing and unnecessarily long so rent it at your own risk.<br /><br />my gf and i have figured this movie out (we think) so here it is:<br /><br />***major spoilers below***<br /><br />firstly, this movie is actually quite simple after you remove all of the confusing unconscious-dream-state junk (95% of the movie.)<br /><br />ignoring the junk, what really happened is this: a group of school friends go to a rave one night. they leave and get into a car accident where everyone but cassie and sean die. that's the simple cut down version. (that's right, i said sean, bear with me)<br /><br />right after the accident, cassie lays in the hospital stuck in between life & death right up until the very end of the movie. this is where the dream part starts.<br /><br />the movie is called soul survivors, right? cassie's mind and soul carries on after the accident interacting with the other souls (annie, matt, raven, the 2 weirdos and jude) along with images conjured up by her mind (sean, school and everything else around her). the souls continue doing what they were defined as: annie the rave-going chick, the 2 weirdo-killers (from opening scene), father jude still helping people etc.<br /><br />we are then taken on a very long ride, shown lots of images (many of which my gf and i still can't tie in) but it all boils down to it not being cassie's time to die.<br /><br />at the end, cassie wakes up in the hospital after being "dead" for a while. her family and sean are there. this is reality again. she's ok.<br /><br />then the director adds a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream snippet of her in the wheelchair being strangled. but this part is really just a nightmare, and she wakes up beside sean, obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience.<br /><br />due to space restrictions, we didn't cover every little thing, but feel free to drop us an e-mail if you want to.<br /><br />
