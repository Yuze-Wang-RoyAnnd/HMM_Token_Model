the form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. there are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. at times, this is truly an "edge-of-the-seat" film. but it disappoints, and disappoints severely.<br /><br />the villain of the piece is not believeable; his character does not hold together. i refuse to "spoil" the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the end.<br /><br />the second major disappointment of the film is that--finally, it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film. there is little qualitative difference between this and one of the "friday the 13th" films. not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does drip gore on occasion.<br /><br />though the film features the magnificent sean connery, even he does not measure up to his usual standard, and often just seems to be walking through the paces.
