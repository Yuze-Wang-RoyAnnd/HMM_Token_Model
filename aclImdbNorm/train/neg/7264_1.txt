just another film that exploits gratuitous frontal male nudity; awful acting, plus, the lovemaking scenes are the most un-sexy i've ever seen (and this is not about me not linking the idea of two young men making love, since i'm gay).<br /><br />again, as in mil nubes de paz, julian hernandez directed an incredibly pretentious film with a story that makes enough argument for a short film of about five minutes but manages to make a 2 hour film with it... and this time, there isn't even the issue of racism and commodification in the mexican gay community to talk about! god gracious have mercy on us!
