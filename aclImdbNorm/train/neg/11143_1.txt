hi, i'm a friend of werewolf movies, and when i saw the title of darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like "hmm, simple and nice name to it at least. althou... i wonder why i haven't heard of it before."<br /><br />first of all, the movie starts with tits. lots of tits. tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to. who cares about a werewolf effect, just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots!<br /><br />so, about the mysterious darkwolf character (a little spoilers ahead, but who really cares...) he's your average everyday biker. not even super-tough looking, but like the old wise woman says in the movie "he is far more powerful and dangerous than you've ever faced before." just by describing her a tattooed biker-type of a guy. pretty original. i even had look twice when they first used the "red glowing eyes" special effect! i mean my god, that "lets-plant-red-dots-on-eyes-with-computer" effect has been used since the seventies. it looks plain ugly here! and don't get me started with the werewolf 3d-cgi. as said before, like an bad and old video game.<br /><br />and finally, as i do like werewolf films, like i said. they prettymuch always build a werewolf-legend of their own. darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well, about some silly legends of hybrid-werewolves and the ancient bloodline. but. it almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement "the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched" starts random-slashing. which just doesn't make any sense, why even bother telling us the rules of killing, when they aren't even gonna play by them... aplus the wolf-point-of-view shots are made with a sony handycam or something, filming mostly the floor and walls. just add growling noises and you've got a super werewolf effect. the gore is partially ok. but when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand, just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims, it just doesn't do the trick for me...<br /><br />truly, who gives money to make these heaps of junk straight-to-video horrortitles, they aren't even funny-kind of bad movies, just sad.
