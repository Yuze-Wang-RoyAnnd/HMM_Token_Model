first of all, f117 is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft.<br /><br />secondly, the f14's and f18's cannot change their appearances; they are not transformers. <br /><br />thirdly, the f16 has only one m61 cannon, not two. <br /><br />last but not the least, at the end of the film, seagle selected sidewinder missile. but somehow when he pulled the trigger, the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick. as i have the experience of seeing f18's and f14's being mysteriously transformed into f16's, this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me. however, there is still one question i have to ask: how did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f16...<br /><br />when students hand in really bad work, teachers assign 0's. now i think for the sake of properly marking this film, imdb should seriously consider adding a '0/10' option. otherwise, it is not fair for those who receive 1 out of 10...
