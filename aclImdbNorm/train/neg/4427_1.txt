final score...who cares - it's a reality show. it has no love for it's audience, it panders to lazy tv viewers, puts nothing in and gets nothing out.<br /><br />"joe millionaire", the most blatantly phony reality show of them all, is a television disaster of epic proportions. it's a watershed, rock bottom moment, not only for fox, but for the american viewing public who actually watch, like and talked about this crap the next day. you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves. because as much as fox promotes this junk it won't make any money unless it's watch by people (and boy was it, the finale got nearly super bowl numbers!?). it doesn't bother you people that there are many quality shows written, directed, acted and generally have effort put into them that are being cancelled while you sit back and lap up this effortless, cold game show?<br /><br />i used to be a staunch supporter of fox. it's those of us like me who like and seek out quality tv that helped build fox back in the days of married...with children and the simpsons. conveniently enough, now neither of those shows would make it 6 weeks with the current management. the gail berman "reign of terror" as it's often called. the network has waged war on scripted tv and, strangely enough, it's fans. the very people who helped build them in the beginning. now, not only do we have to fight for good shows, but we have to fight against their own network. it boggles the mind. nothing fox, has done in the past 3 years makes any sense. from canceling hits like "titus", "futurama" and "john doe" (nbc can renew "boomtown", but fox can't lift it's pitiful head to give the only decent show they had this season another shot?). and the reason they can do all this: the success of junk like "joe millionaire". they can now say "we don't need you tv fans, we have reality shows". they apparently seem to have no idea that the big audience the draw with this junk is fickle and will abandon them the second the next fad comes along. to alienate their base like this will eventually kill the network the way it has set back abc.<br /><br />the show itself is a joke. here we have a premise, in the now classic fox gimmick, that promises us something different and edgy, but then delivers something not in any way different from "the bachelor" or anything on the big 3. fox has gone mainstream. the finale and "twist" (quote/unquote) showed they have no ideas up their sleeve. now we know that all these shows, no matter how different they look, will all end up the same cornball, fairy tale ending. we got to see a bunch of lame aspiring actors that the network picked out of millions of head-shots to fit their demographics parade around like high school bimbos pretending they liked this evan marriott because...well because it was a competition and that's what you're supposed to do. marriott himself is like a hideously disfigured chro-magnum man who struggles to put together the simplest sentences. but, how can the women (all average to ugly looking by the way - an important minus is a guilty pleasure show like this) not fall for "joe" with such charming lines like "look, you're not stupid".<br /><br />i used to think that people who watched these reality/dating/game shows were just to lazy to change the channel, but after "joe millionaire" i think they must be genuinely mentally deficient. come on people, have a little more pride in yourselves. demand a little bit more from your entertainment then this.<br /><br />boycott fox.
