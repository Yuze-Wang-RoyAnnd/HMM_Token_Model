a vietnam vet decides to take over a backwater town run amok, and anyone who steps in his path is eliminated (including women). released to theaters just prior to "a star is born", which turned his career around, this action-drama mishmash starring kris kristofferson is wildly off-kilter, thoughtless and mean-spirited. filmed in simi valley, ca, the results are truly unseemly, with redneck clich'es and mindless violence making up most of director george armitage's script. armitage has gathered a most curious '70s cast for his film, including jan-michael vincent, victoria principal, bernadette peters, and, in a bit, loni anderson; however, the center of the whole thing is kristofferson, who is gruff and rude throughout. it deserves points i suppose for being a completely unsympathetic drive-in thriller, but the bad vibes (and the ridiculous climax) coat the whole project like an ugly stain. *1/2 from ****
