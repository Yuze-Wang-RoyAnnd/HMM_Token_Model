what's this? a canadian produced zombie flick that i have never heard of before. a mortician works on the body of a recently deceased young man. this allows for an extended flashback that show how the guy got there. basically, he and friends went to a cemetery on friday the 13th and raised the dead thanks to his silly chanting. cut back to the morgue where our dead body comes back to life and kills the mortician and owner (who gets his eyes popped out). the final wtf? shot has the funeral home owner in a straight jacket and screaming, "i'm not crazy!" amazingly, he has his eyeballs back.<br /><br />running a scant 58 minutes, this is certainly one oddity in zombie cinema. it feels a lot longer, but put me in some kind of trance where i couldn't stop watching. the film also has one of those "if you see this image, turn away from the screen" gags. it is the image of an old man getting sick in a theater (prophetic?) and when he pops up (only twice) the blood begins to flow. the scenes are pretty damn gory for the time period. there is a great gaffe where a zombie chops off a girl's right hand with a shovel, but - when he pulls the fake hand into the frame to chomp on - it is a left hand.
