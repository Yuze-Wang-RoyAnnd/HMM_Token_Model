this is a typical late universal horror flick: its technically comptent, if by the numbers, with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overacting. the most interesting part of this film is its stunt casting of rondo hatton, a man with a bone disease as the film's "monster". its sad to see this man exploited, but he probably made good use of the money they paid him. hatton is less horrifying than the studio hoped, as i more often felt pity over fear or even loathing. martin koslack is on board as the film's mad artist, and he is very amusing in this part. i for one enjoy seeing koslack in just about anything; for some reason the man amuses me. the only other part of the film that entertained me is the film's absurd take on the art world. here we are shown evil art critics who revel in their ability to break artists; this is side by side with the film's male "hero" who is an "artist" who paints...get this...pin up girls. somehow our hero's work is reviewed side by side with the villan's absurdist sculpture. also amusing is the film's chief nasty critic, who at one point claims that he despises the hero's pin up art because "women like that don't exist" to which our heroine replies with an assurance that the critic just doesn't get out enough. finally, there's a bit of a subplot about the heroine's (who is an art critic herself) domestication by the leading man....completely anti-feminist and ridiculous to witness. overall this film is a rather mediocre picture with a few amusing elements.
