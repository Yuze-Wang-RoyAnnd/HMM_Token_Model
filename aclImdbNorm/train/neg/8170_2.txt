a friend and i went through a phase some (alot of) years ago of selecting the crappest horror films in the video shop for an evening's entertainment. for some reason, i ended up buying this one (probably v. v. cheap).<br /><br />the cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. there's also a few very amusing scenes. among them is a scene where a man's being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects, it made me laugh at the time (doesn't seem quite so funny in retrospect but there you go).<br /><br />apart from that it's total crap, mind you. but probably worth a watch if you like films like "chopping mall". yes, i've seen that too.
