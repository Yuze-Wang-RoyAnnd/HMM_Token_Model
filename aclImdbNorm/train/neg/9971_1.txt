i can't for the life of me remember why--i must have had a free ticket or something--but i saw this movie in the theater when it was released. i don't remember who i went with, which theater i was in, or even which city. all i remember was how offended i was at this travesty someone dared to call a film, and how half the people in the theater walked out before the movie was over. unfortunately i stuck it out to end, which i still consider to be one of the worst mistakes of my life thus far. my offense became pure horror when just before the closing credits the smarmy demon child sticks his head out from behind a sign and says "look for problem child 2, coming soon!" that was hands-down the most terrifying moment ever recorded on film.<br /><br />the plot, if i recall correctly, involved john ritter and perhaps his wife (lord, how i've tried without success to block this film out of my mind) adopting a "problem child." maybe they think they can reform him, or something. i really don't know. if that was their intent, they fail miserably because from first frame to last this child remains the brattiest, rudest, most horrid demon-spawn ever to hit the big screen. forget damian, forget rosemary's baby. this kid takes the cake. the only difference is, we are supposed to feel sorry for him because he's a "problem child." however, this is impossible since this child is quite likely the most unsympathetic character ever portrayed. you want to kill him through the entire film, and when (spoiler, like anyone cares) john ritter decides to keep the vile hell-child you will be yelling "send him back!" in shocked disgust (like several of the people at the theater where i saw it did).<br /><br />this is only the second movie i have given a "1" to on the imdb. the other was superman iv, and by god i couldn't tell you which was worse. john ritter had a quote in tv guide about the time that problem child 3, which he was not in, came out. he said something like "the only way i would do another [problem child] sequel is if they dragged my dead body back to perform." amen to that!<br /><br />i would rather watch a 24-hour marathon of police academy sequels than see even twenty minutes of problem child again. 1/10, only because i can't give it a negative score, which is what it really deserves. someone burn the original negatives of this film, please!
