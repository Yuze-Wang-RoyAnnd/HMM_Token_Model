(some possible spoilers)<br /><br /> i'm not too sure what dreamworks was thinking when they decided to plunk $80 million down on this extremely tired and lame animated flick. they probably thought the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring audiences (mostly families) to see it in droves. well it seemed to work for the opening weekend, it made $26 mil., roughly and has made $38.1 mil. total (an estimation for this weekend). but i think audiences that came during the weekend saw pretty much the same thing i did, when i saw and they spread the word. this is one majorly lame movie, apart from the animation everything else, mostly the script seem to be done by a three year old.<br /><br /> the movie is only about 80 mins. long, but it feels like a three hour epic. a few sticking points for me are, well the irritating narration is one of them, and it's so obviously written. at one point he escapes from some captors and even though you can see the horse is obviously scared, up pops the narrator (the voice of the talented matt damon) to clear up any misconceptions (which would only happen in the simplest of mindsets.<br /><br /> another one is the constant pop up of bryan adams songs, now i'm a fan of his music, i think he's good, but come on did dreamworks really think audiences would be able to handle 8-9 of his songs throughout such a short movie, i certainly couldn't. finally and here's a spoiler, a horse gets shot at point blank range by a member of the calvary, no less, she (the horse) then falls into a raging river, spirit (the focus of the movie) tries to save her, but they both go over a waterfall that must have at least a 50 foot drop, well later in the movie near the end we see that this horse is alive and well. now i know this is a kids movie, but even that little amount of realism is unacceptable.<br /><br /> to sum up, this is a really lame movie, i'm not saying kids won't enjoy it, but anyone else will be checking their watches just waiting for this tripe to end. definitely on my top 10 worst list of this year. -** out of 4 stars.<br /><br />
