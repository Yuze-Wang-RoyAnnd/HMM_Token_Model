richard dreyfuss is, indeed, in this flick, but in a rather small part. he is not the "obsessed" filmmaker - he's the group's business manager/accountant. even the box describes the film inaccurately. there are no erotic scenes with sondra locke, as advertised, unless one uses the term "erotic" quite loosely. i would not have considered viewing the film without richard dreyfuss being in it as a major character. i might have, however, had i realized that the famous 60's anthem, leonard cohen's "suzanne," was an artistic influence. other than the brief recitation of lines from the end of james joyce's "ulysses", and an interesting visual reference to the end of ingmar bergman's "the seventh seal," i found it a poor attempt to meld symbolic elements and moods immortalized in films like "last year at marianbad" and "un chien andalou." if you like the idea of the eccentric artistic troupe, there are many superior films, ranging from "bye, bye, brasil" to "cecil b. demented."
