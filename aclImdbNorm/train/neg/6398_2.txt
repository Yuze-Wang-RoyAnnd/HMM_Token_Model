richard pryor's early 80s running down the street on fire incident must have affected him somehow. in his stand up,he jokes about it getting great laughs. it seemed to have done something involving the projects he chose. the toy is about the lamest he ever chose,aside from i guess another you.<br /><br />a movie where a white man buys his son a black man? nice little bit of underlying political incorrectness before thee was such a thing. it's seeing richard getting all sentimental that made me finally walk out before the end. i wanted to see pryor get even with this brat,instead it becomes the misunderstood kid nauseum! at least gleason had his moments. ignore this and watch pryor with gene wilder or any of his '70s stuff. this is a waste of any movie watcher's time!
