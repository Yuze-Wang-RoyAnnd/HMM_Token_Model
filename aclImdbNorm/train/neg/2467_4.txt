this movie gets both a 6/10 rating from me, as well as a 9/10. here is why: as a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd, where action and gore and scares are taken into consideration, this movie will bore you. it's basically a family drama similar to what you'd see on the lifetime channel, but put in a horror universe. the story and formula are age-old, retreaded hundreds of times. if you're looking for any originality in the plot structure or the minimal conflicts, you'll be disappointed. take away the zombies and you'll have something just as melodramatic as a beautiful mind, tripping on cheese. this is the 6/10.<br /><br />however, the basic synopsis and idea is pretty original and over-the-top. it's literally something you and your friends would joke about when you're half-drunk . . . but that joke actually got a theatrical release. the idea gets a 9/10 from me. the only reason it isn't perfect is because they could have taken it even further, but they didn't.<br /><br />the mix of both is mixed. i thought it was funny, but as with most all comedies, it wasn't that funny. i had my mom and little sister watch it with me and the jokes we made about it were funnier than the jokes scripted. there were moments of utter genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom.<br /><br />i sincerely hope that other movies take this kind of over-the-top risk and original ideas. i just can't say it was perfect, or even near it, because of the lack of originality to the plot.<br /><br />a great family movie. a great movie to watch with a bunch of guys (or girls). a great movie to watch with anyone . . . but if you watch it alone, it will be a bit boring. other people always make this kind of movie funnier and richer.<br /><br />4/10
