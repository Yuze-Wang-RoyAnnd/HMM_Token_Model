skippy from "family ties" plays eddie, a wussy 'metal' nerd who gets picked on. when his favorite wussy 'metal' singer, sammi curr, dies, he throws a hissy fit tearing down all the posters on his bedroom wall. but when he later gets an unreleased record that holds the spirit of his dead 'metal' idol. he first gets sucked into ideas of revenge, but then he doesn't want to take it as far as sammi does. which isn't really that far as his main victims only seem to go to the hospital. this movie is utterly laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as say, "rock star". ok, maybe a tad more than that piece of junk, but you get my point. and how anyone can root for a guy played by skippy from "family ties" i haven't a clue. the cameo by gene simmons is ok, and ozzy osbourne reaches coherency, i applaud him for that, but otherwise skip this one.<br /><br />my grade: d <br /><br />eye candy:elise richards gets topless, an a topless extra at a pool party
