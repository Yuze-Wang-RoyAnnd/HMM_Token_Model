this movie is bad news and i'm really surprised at the level of big name talent who would ever agree to appear in such a piece of junk as this. i imagine there were a few strangled agents sprawled across hollywood blvd. as a result of this fiasco. what really gets you is that it could have been good. the directors star appeal and the subject matter was sufficient fodder to spark interest and ticket sales, but this is a flop. the multiple story lines all go from bad to silly by the pictures end, and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten. what spike is able to achieve is revenge against any italians who may have beat him up when he was a kid or insulted him, as the movie does quite a number on perpetuating outdated and probably offensive italian stereotypes. as with any spike lee film there is some really thought provoking and magical camerawork. he does have the gift of grabbing your psyche and transporting you into his vision if only for a few memorable scenes. but the question remains...can you endure the other 2 hours of head scratching and clock watching as you wonder and wait for the ending that has to be there somewhere.
