"national lampoon goes to the movies" is the worst movie ever made, surpassing even the witless "plan 9 from outer space." at least that movie was just inept; the lampoon film, on the other hand, is both inept and mean. once upon a time, movies used to respect their audiences' intelligence. this one, however, holds a fetid, rotting carcass up to our faces -- and then tries to rub our noses in it.<br /><br />another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are the nude scenes; and i agree, misses ganzel and dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh, and very nice flesh it is. but the directors seem not to realize that even t&a needs a good story to surround it. there's none of that here.<br /><br />perversely, the film makers save the worst for last. the third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio. in this vignette, robby benson plays an eager-beaver young police officer reporting for duty on his first day on the job. he is paired with a weary, cynical oldtimer played by richard widmark. for just a moment, we are given hope that this film will end triumphantly. surely, we think, the youngster's spunky attitude will rub off on the cynic and change him for the better.<br /><br />forlorn hope! instead, the cynic wins the day -- and the youngster's spark is doused forever. "national lampoon goes to the movies" and heads right for the toilet, asking us to follow it down the drain. nominally, this is a comedy. but where's the humor?
