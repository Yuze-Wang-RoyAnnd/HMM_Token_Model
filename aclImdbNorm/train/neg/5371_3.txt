this film was rather a disappointment. after the very slow, very intense (and quite gory) beginning the film begins to lose it. too much plot leaves too little time for explanation, and coming out of the theater i wondered what this was all about. the characters remain shallow, the story is not convincing at all, most of it is d'eja v`u stuff without hints of parody, and there are some very cheesy parts... like, the young cop has to do dig up a body. of course it's night and it rains and he has to do it alone... yawn! or the manifestation of the evil being "nazis" plus "genetic manipulation"... wow, that's really original. there are some nice bits, though, like the fistfight scene, mountain views and some (running) gags, but (though reno and vincent cassel do what they can) that's definitely not worth it. (3 out of 10)
