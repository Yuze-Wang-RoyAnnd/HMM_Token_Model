if you made a genre flick in the late 80s, you basically had a 50/50 chance it would either be set underwater or in a prison (sadly, we never got an underwater prison flick). framed for murder by mafia boss moretti (anthony franciosa), derek keillor (dennis cole) ends up on death row, right alongside the mob boss' brother frankie (frank sarcinello jr.). but this is the least of derek's problems as rogue government agent (and mob stoolie) col. burgess (john saxon, who also directs) is using the prison as a testing ground for a new supervirus. this is the only flick saxon directed during his storied career. for a guy who has worked with tons of directors, it appears the only ones he picked up any tips from were the cheap-o italian ones. sure, it is low budget, but that can't excuse the stilted staging, shooting gaffes, or clumsy exposition in the first 15 minutes. to his credit, saxon did make it slightly gory and he works in a hilarious nude scene (our lead falls asleep during a prison riot only to fantasize about a female scientist). cole, who looks like a more rugged jan-michael vincent, is decent as the stoic lead and franciosa - sporting a really bad rug - gives it his all as the clich'e mob boss. the end takes place at marty mckee's favorite location, bronson canyon. retromedia released this on dvd as zombie death house.
