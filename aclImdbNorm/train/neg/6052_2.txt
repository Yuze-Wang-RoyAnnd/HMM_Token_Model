despite its flaws, i enjoyed "cigarette burns", john carpenter's season one episode in the masters of horror series. yes, the story seemed like a cheap cross between in the mouth of madness and 8mm, but it was still quite good for the budget and time constraints given to it. with "pro-life", however, the low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else. there is solid directing as always from carpenter yet there is a quality to the writing and whole production itself that gives the feeling it was made in a total and complete rush. the script isn't always clear, the message fuzzy, and the story is full of plot holes once you look back on them. maybe had carpenter re-written the script, it could have been a worthwhile episode. instead, it's a mess that only hardcore carpenter fans will find the slightest enjoyment in. definitely the worst carpenter has ever done. 2/10
