that is quite an outdated movie which aims to showcase the youth's yearning for freedom in some dehumanizing british school. oh yes it's like in the army, you learn to obey and do what you're asked to. yes the young dream of something else but it breaks their dreams and sweeps away their optimism on the threshold of life. great.<br /><br />basically that's how you could sum up the nice intentions in if... nice intentions that arouses no cinematographic challenges: the result is a declamatory movie. do you see how boring i mean?<br /><br />at least that oldie helped kubrick cast mcdowell in a clockwork orange, a movie with a truly powerful social satire and no self-indulgent sentimentalism.
