i considered myself to be quite melancholy, especially when i watch a great touching and tear-jerking movies. but not for this one (which surprised me!) and it is also really surprising me to see how many people praised this movie so highly.<br /><br />there are several disturbing facts throughout the movies: 1. despite guilt-ridden ben's real intention to save 7 lives to redeem his past, i find it disturbing that the film seems encourage this type of suicidal action. some people may perceive this is a heroic action and some others think he behaves cowardly, in the end this was a disturbing action to me.<br /><br />2. the movie story line is over-dramatized, but the logic is over-simplified. medically, blood type match is required to be an organ donor. toward the end of the film we learnt that emily had rear blood type that limited her chance to get the donor within short time period. nevertheless, it seemed that ben had the rare blood type, same as hers which allowed him to be her donor and conveniently, despite the rarity of ben's blood type, he was able to donate not only his heart, but also his kidney, his cornea and his bone marrow which in all cases require not only matching blood type but also tissue antigen.<br /><br />3. why the doctors allow ben's organs being donated despite the jellyfish venom he used to kill himself?<br /><br />i might be over-analyzing the whole story as after all this is just a movie. however, some disturbing facts outlined above hopefully will help you reconsider your plan to go to watch this movie. if you go for a soap-opera type of film, go for it. but it you go seeking for an intelligent entertainment, give this one a miss!
