i rented this one to see vanesa talor one more time. she can act, but doesn't get a chance in this clunker. the opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes. must have come from a stock archive, because the movie is shot direct to videotape. the production values make _blair witch_ look professional. there's a really cheesy animated statue, but no other effects worth noting. this movie is bad, but not amusingly so. the players would do well not to mention it on their resumes.
