it wasn't good. the characters were underdeveloped and the only personality were from the memories i had of the previous movie which contrasted with the 'new' personalities (or lack thereof). i seriously thought the opening scene was a nightmare by ariel because of how absurd it was. it was serious. it just reminded me of all the annoying characters on the disney channel-everyone is hyperactive and the story jumps from action to embarrassing scenes without any really connection.<br /><br />the most disappointing part was the horrible songs-not catchy, not amazing. in the original ariel had an amazing and powerful voice and all the song are catchy and fun. you remember them and want to sing them. but the songs in this movie weren't creative in the least; it's as if they're talking in a annoying sing-song voice-quite weakly, disappointing. i don't have that want-to-sing-them feeling you normally get from a disney movie.<br /><br />it's as if not one wanted to do this movie, so they barely made an effort . . . this movie would needs a new story line, new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without the annoying "look at me! look at me! i'm so annoying!" mentality of this generation of disney. :'(
