i never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie, i gotta come really hard on it. talking about vivah, this guy, sooraj badjatya, seems to have completely lost it. after success of hum aapke hain kaun, he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos. vivah is so so cheesy that badjatyas have left johars and chopras behind.<br /><br />there was not a single moment during the movie where i can say 'oh! at least this thing is good'. aloknath does clich'e in a role of girl's father, shahid kapoor looks fat and shahrukhed, amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets, bad costumes, hackneyed storyline, monstrous stepmother, trying-hard-to-act actors, cacophonous background music, cheap soundtracks.<br /><br />now the spoiler, i'm warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies, after a calamitous incidence movie ends on a happy note.
