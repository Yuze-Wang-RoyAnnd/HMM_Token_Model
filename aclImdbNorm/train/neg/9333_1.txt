terrible!!! i don't want to be too negative but this film has an iq of stupid monkey.what a disaster.i just couldn't believe how bad this movie is.the dialogs are just very strange and off topic,the camera work at times just horrible,the music at times like a soundtrack for lawrence of arabia,i just watched this film to see how much worse it can get.some of the side kick "actors" are total disaster.sorry but all my thumbs and toes and anything that can hang downwards on my body is falling to the ground. harvey keitle is a great actor but who knows maybe he is in financial crunch to take a part in such a fiasco film. . . . . this movie should have been presented to all the students in all the film schools just to teach them a lesson of how not to make a film
