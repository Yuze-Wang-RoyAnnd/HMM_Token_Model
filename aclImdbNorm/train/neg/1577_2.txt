this 1997 film-blanc classic tale of smoldering passion has achieved its well-deserved legendary status as one of the screen's greatest sagas of a doomed and hopeless love. the pervasive, ongoing and progressive magnetism between judge reinhold and what's-her-name is sure to set many a viewer's heart a-flutter with memories of one's own first crush. the brilliant screenplay dangles this embryonic affair-to-be in front of the enraptured audience, sitting transfixed as the abstract, almost-expressionist cinematography deep-focuses on the just-under-the-surface desires that ebb and flow between the principals. you can cut the sexual tension with a dull tire iron. <br /><br />a tiny drop of perspiration on the end of a nose catches the bright sunshine, and leaves no doubt as to its significance. scenes like this abound and bear watching again and again. as with "jane eyre" and "rebecca" (to which this masterpiece is so often compared), the closeups of the actors' faces as they experience the slow dawning of the great love-that-is-not-to-be will haunt you forever. <br /><br />the now-classic rc soundtrack score, with its creative and unique use of solo synthesizer, emphasizes the emotion that drips throughout like a leaky crankcase.<br /><br />if i had any criticisms at all by mentioning what i consider a minor flaw (and dared to risk the wrath of the millions of fans who hold this classic so dear to their hearts), i would say that the hallmark of "runaway car" - its sense of mounting sexual tension - is briefly broken by the highway scene, which now after repeated viewings seems just a bit overlong (and probably even unnecessary?) to the eternal, bittersweet tale of love interrupted.<br /><br />dare i advance what i perceive as the tiniest of flaws in this critically-acclaimed triumph of modern cinema? 'citizen kane' had its 'rosebud' . . . 'runaway car' should have its catchword as well. perhaps the film could have opened with an extreme closeup of judge reinhold saying something such as "a car is an extension of its owner!", and the rest of the storyline could then be dedicated to parsing every syllable, subtlety and nuance of that phrase. had that plot line been done, this film could have topped "titanic" at the golden globes that year, i'm convinced.<br /><br />my one regret? that i didn't read the novel first.
