oh my. how can they make movies of such beauty, but that are so terribly bad. i mean, even uwe boll doesn't make crap like this. there is not even a hint of a decent story, multi-layered characters, or attraction. it's just a random sequence of pointless chatter joined together to make a 'movie'. i suppose only children up to 3 years of age could enjoy it, given the world is so utterly dimensionless and the story so incoherent, that anyone older would be annoyed by it. but then again, it's far too scary for anyone under 6 years of age, that there's probably no one that should watch this movie at all.<br /><br />take my advice and stay far, far away from this movie. your little daughter can make a better storyline, and though she probably isn't able to draw pictures this pretty, her tales are much more worth listening to. and please, in the name of whoever you believe in, do not expose your children to this piece of ****. i'll give it 2 out of 10, and that's exclusively for the graphics, because the story and character development are so awful they'd deserve a negative rating.<br /><br />and if you decide to watch it anyways... remember that i warned you.
