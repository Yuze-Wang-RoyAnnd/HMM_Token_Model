it pains me to write such a scathing review but by not doing so i'm simply encouraging these people. first off, just because a film is made on a small budget does not automatically make it good nor endearing. in fact in this case, the small budget is probably the films sole achievement in that it prevented large sums of money from being squandered on a one legged race horse with the shits. have you ever seen a comedy at the theatre? ever heard people laugh and thought "what the dickens are you on"? well even these twats weren't laughing. things got so bad by mid way my cat took his first ever bath. this is not film, this is children....no monkeys making images that leave you feeling like moving to france. got to go, there's a clown at my door.............
