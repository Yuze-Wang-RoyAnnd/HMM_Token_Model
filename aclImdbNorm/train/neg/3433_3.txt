it is such a strange movie, you can call it awful or if you sit with friends it can give you a killer laugh-athon. strange comes to mind again and again. shot amateurishly, acted even worse and the directions, maybe none. the special effects are funny but the music accompanying a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit. see it if you got time to kill. but don't, don't even try to take it seriously. supposed to be a tribute to 'porno holocaust ',. since i haven't seen it, from the tribute i can assume it to be as bad. should have given it 1/10, but it did give me a good laugh or two, so it gets a 3. excessive gore, the only thing somebody worked on. stay away if you are squeamish, more gore than laughs. wonder if the makers had a laugh making it?
