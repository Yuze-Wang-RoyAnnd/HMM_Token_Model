first of all, i would just like to say to everyone who has seen this movie, that the actor who played the "transvestite" is one of my friends, his name is robert dugdale, he's a terrific actor, although it doesn't say much about his filmography, he's been in several plays and musicals. he is currently residing in terrace b.c. that is where i am from, he comes over to our house almost every saturday *laughs* okay, now about the movie, i wouldn't recomend this to anyone who hasn't seen it, for it is not a movie worth watching, the main reason i found it to be a bad movie is it never stays in place, it keeps bouncing back between time, so kinda hard to follow at some points, and second, its really boring *laughs* although the acting is great, the movie just doesn't compare.
