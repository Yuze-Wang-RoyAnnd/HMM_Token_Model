1940. - a visit to the lodz ghetto in nazi-occupied poland, recorded by a german cameramen with the naive co-operation of the jewish community, is combined with archival footage, clips from international newsreels, and excerpts from related cultural films to portray the world's jews as swindlers and parasites. this 'documentary' interprets jewish life from the viewpoint of traditional anti-semitism and nazi ideology. a candid, cinematically-unique expression of racial hatred. i personally find this film frightening and highly offensive. one can only hope that such pictures as this will never reach the screen again.
