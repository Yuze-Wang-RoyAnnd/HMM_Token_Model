this movie wasn't awful but it wasn't very good. i am a big fan toni collette i think she is a very beautiful and talented actress. the movie starts off about robin williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid. the book is great and he cant't believe a kid wrote it. toni collette plays the kids guardian who you don't know if this kid really exists or if she's making it all up. i am not gonna ruin the movie but i will say this the movie is not scary.<br /><br />the acting is pretty good and toni collette's performance was awesome as well as robin williams. <br /><br />the movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion i would wait for it to come to dvd.
