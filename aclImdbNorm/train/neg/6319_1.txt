this film reminds me of how college students used to protest against the vietnam war. as if, upon hearing some kids were doing without cheeseburgers in cow dung collehe, the president was going to immediately change all us foreign policy.<br /><br />the worst thing is that, while dangerous, the concept of a policy based on if the ussr and us went to war it could mean the end of the world, worked. the us and ussr never went to war.<br /><br />had we only conventional weapons, the notion of yet another war, a "win-able" war, in europe and asia was not unthinkable.<br /><br />not that i think they should get rid of this movie. it should be seen by film students as a splendid example of "how not to make a film."<br /><br />it should be 0 stars or maybe black holes...
