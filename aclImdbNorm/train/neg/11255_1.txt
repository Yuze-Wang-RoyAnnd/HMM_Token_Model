in a word, this film was boring. it lacked life and spark. a big problem is with the two leads. jude law and gwyneth paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever. he was boring, and she was annoying. <br /><br />the visuals were interesting, but they didn't enhance the scenes. if anything, the visuals tended to detach the audience from what was happening on screen. none of the action sequences felt real, and hence, the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger.<br /><br />the film had potential, but it needed a better script, better acting, and a better director. i kept thinking during the film, you know, this movie would've worked if harrison ford was sky captain, karen allen was polly, and steven spielberg was the director. <br /><br />ignore the critical acclaims for this film. the critics i think are praising the film because they *want* to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels.
