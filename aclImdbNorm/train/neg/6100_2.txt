effort aside (this isn't a review about good intentions, its about the final product), this film is poorly written, overacted, and poorly directed. the story obviously had potential, but that story is nowhere present in this film.<br /><br />clara barton was a human being. she had passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness, and self doubt just like the rest of us. you would never know that from this film of the lead actress's performance. in fact apply that to every character in the film, but in barton's case: every sentence is a speech. an epic over the top speech as though from an inhuman robot. in fact the only scene that plays well in one in the board meeting, and i realized thats because she's making a speech! every idea she has is unbelievable in its context and she comes up with ideas that sound like they take a lifetime of soul searching right on the spot. for example, when she sees a wounded man, she'll start pontificating about the needs of the battlefield and to protect soldiers and putting up white flags, etc. as played in the film, there's no way she could come up with such a detailed well thought out idea in seconds.<br /><br />in conclusion, this film robs clara barton of her struggles. it robs her of her humanity, and it inherently cheapens all she did because the script is written in clich'es. the writer doesn't know clara barton, and seems to have based his script on an encyclopedia britannica article. (yes they had those back then) but hey, nice technicolor! (who cares)
