waldemar daninsky (paul naschy) travels to tibet and is bitten by a yeti, which causes him to become a werewolf. he is accidentally killed after he attacks his cheating wife and her lover, and is later revived by a female scientist, dr. ilona ermann, who uses him in mind control experiments. daninsky later discovers an underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctor's failed experiments.<br /><br />upon hearing of naschy's death from colleague jon kitley, i rummaged through my collection for a suitable film to watch. in my scramble, i found i own not one but three(!) copies of "fury of the wolfman". the film is of questionable video quality, the sound is dubbed in a mediocre fashion, the cinematography is sort of slapstick style at times. and the american versions have two love scenes removed. quite frankly, without a remastered, uncut copy, i wasn't really getting the proper movie in all its glory.<br /><br />this film claims to be the fourth in a long series about the werewolf count waldemar daninsky. i suspect this is true, but you wouldn't know this from the film itself. the plot is confusing at times, and there's really no indication that this is a sequel. if you read the plot summaries on wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box, you'll see that i'm not alone in my confusion.<br /><br />perhaps the film's shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand the production hell it went through. while floating around for years, it was only released in 1973, due to problems involved in finding a distributor. and naschy said in his autobiography that the director, zabalza, was an incompetent alcoholic, and that he hated working with him. those really aren't light accusations, and i have no idea what zabalza had to say on his own behalf.<br /><br />chances are, sooner or later you'll come across a low-grade version of "fury of the wolfman". it appears in a variety of three-packs and box sets, so you might accidentally acquire it and not even know. what really needs to happen is an american uncut version, with a decent sound and video mix, and the love scenes thrown back in. as far as i know, this does not exist. let us honor paul naschy's legacy and get his films to a wider audience in a level of quality he deserves.
