it was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including john ritter, ben gazarra and audrey hepburn. they looked quite wonderful. but that was it. they were not given any characters or good lines to work with. i neither understood or cared what the characters were doing.<br /><br />some of the smaller female roles were fine, patty henson and colleen camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. they showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. sadly, i didn't think dorothy stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role.<br /><br />the film appears to have some fans, and i was very open-minded when i started watching it. i am a big peter bogdanovich fan and i enjoyed his last movie, "cat's meow" and all his early ones from "targets" to "nickleodeon". so, it really surprised me that i was barely able to keep awake watching this one.<br /><br />it is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. five years later, bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, cybil shepherd had a hit television series called "moonlighting" stealing the story idea from bogdanovich. of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines.<br /><br />bottom line: it ain't no "paper moon" and only a very pale version of "what's up, doc".
