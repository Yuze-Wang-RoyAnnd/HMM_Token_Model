this movie starts out very very slow, but when the action finally gets started, it's a little had to follow. i couldn't understand why some of the events were taking place, and a lot of events happened before they were explained, making them sort of confusing. the only thing it really has going for it is the massive amount of blood/gore it has, although most times the special effects are lacking. blood looks like red kool-aid. skin tearing sounds like somebody is stepping on a pile of sticks. again, the story has a sort of amateur feel to it, like the writer didn't take a long time to perfect it. i feel like it could be a much better movie if the effects were done better and more time was taken on the script. i honestly wish i hadn't watched it, not because of the gore, but because i feel that i wasted 90 minutes of my life. if you like extremely gory movies, this is for you, if not, stay away.
