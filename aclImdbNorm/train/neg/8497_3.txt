my title ought to be enough.<br /><br />it baffles me that a culture so rich in literary excellence (dumas, flaubert, balzac, maupassant) would churn out such tosh as the "nouvelle vague" cinematic movement. until the 20th century, france had a great tradition of artistic lucidity and clever philosophy. but the minute you hand them a movie camera they start acting like wooohooo look how weird i can be! plot? theme? pshaw! let's film an amusement park ride going round & round! at least this is not as bad as godard (who has an unhealthy fascination with the backs of peoples' heads. oh-la-la, quel artiste.). no, truffaut maintains a degree of visual clarity. but so does the security camera at a quickie-mart. the two are indistinguishable.<br /><br />haha, just as an aside to all you dweeby film school nerds: i bet the vein is popping out the side of your neck right now. but don't leave without reading the last sentence of my review.<br /><br />anyway, if you like french literature, you will hate this. people who like this movie probably have never read any books other than the ramblings of jack kerouac or maybe "hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy". or maybe they have read the lyrics to the doors songs, and they think that's profoundly moving. whatever floats yer boat. i find it ironic that this film injects some (weak) allusions to balzac, one of the finest and most meaningful writers who ever lived. nice try, truffles. but you're nowhere near the ballpark.<br /><br />avoid this film like an aids-infected syringe.<br /><br />if you're the type of person who likes to think, then stick to jean cocteau (orphee), robert bresson (pickpocket) and the japanese masters kurosawa (ikuru), kobayashi (kaidan) and teshigahara (suna no onna).<br /><br />if you're an idiot, enjoy your truffaut, godard, and andy worhol. and for pete's sake push that vein back in your neck. you look like a cabbage.
