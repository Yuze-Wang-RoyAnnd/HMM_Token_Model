jamie foxx is fun but this movie has been done before. the bad guy plays a "malkovichian" character from "in the line of fire". the cops will do anything to find the bad guy - and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him - all the while he is just trying to turn over a new leaf...
