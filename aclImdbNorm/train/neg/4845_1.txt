there is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award. well, it does not deserve an audience as well. ironically, one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly, the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least. every frame, you feel you are getting the "full picture", its like someone is "cropping your view" from the edges. the story is pathetic. well, i will be honest, i could not bear to watch the entire movie. the part that sucked the most was when i saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor. these and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of steven seagal.<br /><br />take my advice, stay away from this piece of crap.
