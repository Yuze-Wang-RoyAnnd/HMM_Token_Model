well, i just ordered this on my pay-per-view at home because i was bored and needed a laugh. i have to admit, i did chuckle a few times, but i don't even remember what parts they were at. i don't understand why this movie was made. it claims to be a comedy but seriousuly, i don't find a singing penis, or a naked 70 year old woman very funny. this movie was trying to fit itself into the 'gross-out' comedies of recent years such as american pie and road trip, but it just failed miserably. it was way to much gross-out then it was comedy. also, why on earth did cameron diaz attach her name to this movie?!?! the only thing i liked about this movie was when dave and angela were in the pool. i thought it was sexy and enjoyable and well-done. besides that, avoid this movie. 3/10
