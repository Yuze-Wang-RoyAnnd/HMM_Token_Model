as good an advert for republicanism as you're ever likely to see,"mayerling"is an everyday story of royal folk in late nineteenth century austria.set during one of europe's seemingly incessant internal turmoils it concerns itself with the emperor franz joseph (mr james mason),his rebellious son,the crown prince rudolf (mr omar sharif)the empress(miss ava gardner) and various mistresses,secret policemen,spies,extravagantly-uniformed popinjays,gypsies,dancers,wives, soldiers,swans,horses and the bizarre inbred web of european royalty at the time of franz joseph's austro-hungarian empire. filmed in what the old movie posters used to call "a riot of color" it resembles nothing more than an expensively-dressed but intellectually-challenged production of "the student prince" .mr james mason,wearing a very natty little white number,utilises his all-purpose mittel-european accent whenever he remembers.i am a great admirer of his and i sincerely hope the remuneration was comensurate with the distaste he clearly felt for the character he was playing. mr omar sharif,who built a career largely founded on looking directly at the camera with his big brown eyes and looking soulful,gives a stupefyingly monotonous performance as his son the crown prince.he is utterly unconvincing as a man who -in the movie at least-cut a swathe through the distaff side of the austrian aristocracy.with his well-buttered locks firmly in place he preens and poses in ever more unlikely uniforms.as a rebel he talks the talk but conspicuously fails to walk the walk,leaving a bottom button undone on one of his tunics is about as far as his defiance goes.unhappily married,he falls in love with a commoner."forbidden love" is one of the movie's come-ons.as she is played by the most uncommon miss catherine deneuve he is scarcely pushing the envelope there.miss deneuve has a profile to die for and we see rather a lot of it,particularly in the sequence set at the ballet. now i love ballet as much as the next man,but this sequence does seem to go on for an excessive amount of time,a more cynical critic might consider it to be "padding". rudolf's mother,the empress is played by miss ava gardner.she gives the part some good old american oooomph,making her a bit like "auntie mame",but it's done with undeniable style.rudolf is certainly very fond of his mother - i'll put it no more strongly than that. the only performance worth watching is that of mr james robertson justice as sir lancelot spratt - sorry,edward,prince of wales.he is so wonderfully unconcerned about everything going on around him it's a joy to behold.i waited vainly for him to ask rudolf the immortal question "what's the bleeding time?". i am not qualified to dispute "mayerling" 's historical accuracy,but,in my opinion,everything else about it is risible. it is a ruritanian opera buffa without the tunes to send you home from the theatre whistling.
