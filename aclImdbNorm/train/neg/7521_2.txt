i probably give this more credit than it deserves because it's halloween, i was just at "knott's scary farm" and i was in a mood to watch a really cheesy halloween movie.<br /><br />oh, and it only cost me one dollar.<br /><br />usually i'll ffwd through a movie like this to get to "the good stuff," but i resisted the urge here and i'm still not sure why. it was obvious from the opening shots this wasn't a "real" movie, not even a b-movie. it's more in the category of the decoteau "horror" movies like "the brotherhood" that are shot on film-look video for about 50 cents (in fact, i was half afraid any minute one of his beefy college boys would stagger out rubbing himself in his underpants or something). there were no cutaway shots (too expensive to do multiple camera setups) and flat lighting but...it's hard to pinpoint. there's something refreshing about watching a director with no money pull off a half-decent movie. the fact that he's doing even a half-decent job is commendable, and this movie has it's share of merits--the acting isn't bad, the photography is pretty good (if too bright to be scary), there are some surprises, and the whole thing is sort of...different somehow.<br /><br />a bunch of college kids are (for some unknown reason) stuck in the warehouse where they are decorating the annual haunted house. a creepy old man gives them a satanic book and they accidentally summon up the powers of hell. this results in the costumed people in the haunted house becoming who they are made up to be, and causing a lot of mayhem and human suffering. along the way we are treated to an oddly complex and thoughtful lesbian relationship subplot--it's interesting that this couple seems to be the most well-rounded in the movie. yes, there's a sex scene but it isn't salacious--or at least no more so than you'd find in any legit movie about lesbians that shows them having sex. it's rather unusual for a horror film to take the time and effort to do this without resorting to cheap exploitation. <br /><br />the other thing about this that held my interest was how it was clearly trying to emulate the "stupid kids have sex and get killed" vibe of the 80's slashers. it's hard to take that on because there are so many of those films that already exist, the genre has been done to death. i'm not sure if it's good or bad that these filmmakers simply tried to make another entry in that genre, without irony, as if it was still a living genre, but i appreciated the attempt.<br /><br />which is why i sat through it; sometimes you just want to watch a mindless, no-budget, "a-for-effort" horror film. there really was too much set up, not enough gore, endless plot-holes, dead-ends and clich'es and the unfortunate overall feel of a movie that simply did not have enough money behind it to be the film the producers envisioned...but at the very least the haunted house scenes were pretty cool. i'd pay to go to that haunted house if it existed, and didn't mind paying a dollar to see it on dvd even if i'll never watch this again.<br /><br />oh, and **possible spoiler**, but there was great, brief business with the vampire girl in the coffin: "i used to be claustrophobic. but i've changed." ha ha, good one.
