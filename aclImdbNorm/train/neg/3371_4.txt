awesomely improbable and foolish potboiler that at least has some redeeming, crisp location photography, but it's too unbelievable to generate much in the way of tension. i was kinda hoping that stanwyck wouldn't make it back in time because, really, she was saddled with the wet, in more ways than one, husband,and she had an idiot child as well..why not run off with meeker? but the nagging question remains..what sort of wood was that pier support made of if a rotten piece of it pulled off didn't float? stanwyck, always impeccably professional, does the best she could with the material but it's threadbare.
