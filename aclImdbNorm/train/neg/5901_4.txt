something to sing about was produced at grand national studios where james cagney was working while under a contract dispute with the brothers warner. he did two films for this b studio, neither of which rank high in the cagney credits.<br /><br />one of the great losses to cinema is the fact that jimmy cagney did so few films that utilized his terrific dancing abilities. the two that come to mind immediately are yankee doodle dandy and footlight parade. two lesser films are the west point story and never steal anything small. cagney himself said he never used to watch anything but his musicals in retirement. so why did he make so few of them?<br /><br />well this one was all wrong. the plot of something to sing about concerns a hoofer who fronts for a band who's discovered and given a movie contract. there are the usual complications of a conniving studio boss and a conniving press agent played respectively and well by gene lockhart and william frawley. his contract calls for a no- marriage clause, so cagney and band girl singer lady evelyn daw marry in secret. then we get the complication of a publicity driven studio romance with screen leading lady mona barrie. i think you can figure where this is going.<br /><br />the most disappointing thing about something to sing about is the lack of dance numbers for cagney. he dances briefly at the beginning and the end of the film and nothing in the middle. evelyn daw had a nice singing voice and the charisma of a ham sandwich. she got the musical numbers such as they were. i'm sure the movie-going public was paying their tickets to see cagney dance. <br /><br />also in addition to giving him some dance numbers a female dance partner would have been nice. he danced well with ruby keeler in footlight parade and with virginia mayo and doris day in the west point story. weren't ginger rogers, eleanor powell or ruby keeler available?<br /><br />no memorable songs came out of this. and daw's voice is waisted as well. she has a jeanette macdonald soprano voice which was so out of place with a swing band.<br /><br />no wonder cagney went running back to warner brothers. but they should have given him some decent musicals.
