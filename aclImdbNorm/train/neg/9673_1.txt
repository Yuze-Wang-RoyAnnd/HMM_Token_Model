"plants are the most cunning and vicious of all life forms", informs one dopey would-be victim in "the seedpeople", a silly, flaccid remake of "invasion of the bodysnatchers", "day of the triffids", and about a thousand udder moovies. and why are seeds moore dangerous than plants, one might ask? because, according to the same dolt, "seeds can chase us". yes, i can remember one horrifying incident when the moocow was just a calf, being chased all the way home from school by ravenous dandylion seed... yeah, right. unfortunately, the "monsters" in this seedy little turkey kind of look like shaggy little muppets, some of which roll around like evil tumbleweeds, others which sail about on strings. there's not even the tiniest inkling of terror or suspense to be found here. for reasons left unexplained, the seed monsters are knocked out by 50 volt ultra-violet lights, even though they can walk about in the daylight, which has about 1,000,000,000,000 times more uv energy. as you can see, not much thought was put into this cow flop. the moocow says go weed yer garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here. :=8p
