i felt brain dead, i'll tell you. this is the worst film i have ever bought. (in my ignorance i thought this was the peter jackson film of the same name). the performances are so terrible they are laughable. the special effects have not stood the test of time and look dire. the script promotes that kind of tv movie, stare into the middle distance kind of acting. the cast look as if they have been taking lessons from joey tribbiani, they have one look each, and stick to it. plus i have never been confused by a movie until i sat down to watch this. the is it a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within a few minutes. avoid like a plague.
