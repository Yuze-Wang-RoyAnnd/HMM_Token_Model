when a small glob of space age silly putty lands on earth it soon begins consuming earthlings and putting on weight. the only part of this senseless drivel that i enjoyed was all the cool classic cars. this dog had so many holes it could be sliced and sold for swiss cheese. this thing actually made 20 million bucks? and mcqueen's salary was 3k? all were vastly overpaid. the 'monster' looked a lot like a large beanbag and the 'teens' looked as though they could have children approaching their teen-age years. and those blasts from the shotgun; sounded like a pellet rifle with a sound suppressor. the ending was pitifully trite; obviously the producers were leaving the door open for a sequel....and there were many. thumbs down.
