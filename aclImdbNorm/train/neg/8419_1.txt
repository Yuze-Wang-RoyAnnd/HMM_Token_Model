i had been looking forward to seeing dreamgirls for quite a while...what with all it's raving reviews, nominations and media attention. and i must say, the first quarter of the movie was good! it really portrayed the black music scene back then. however, as the movie wore on, me and my whole family were bored out of our wits. the singing just kept coming, one after the other. i mean seriously, just one more music number and it would have broke even with rent.<br /><br />furthermore, i noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters; i just didn't care what happened to them! even when eddie murphy's character died of a drug overdose, i knew i should have been sad, but i just couldn't feel any emotion for that character. the characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot, but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in.<br /><br />finally, the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care, which goes along with the lack of character development. this movie reminded me of a copy-cat movie based on ray, chicago, and rent (ray and chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). overall i think this movie would best suit someone who doesn't really care about an overall story, yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances.
