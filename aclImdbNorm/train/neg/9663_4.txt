how cynical are the writers, to pander so. i may be an american citizen, but i don't need to see other americans pat each other on the back for an hour and half in order to enjoy a film. i'm astonished that so few have commented on how utterly jingoistic, sentimental and trite the dialogue in this film really is. the historical inaccuracies of the film are not as gross and offensive as in "u-571" (which changes british submariners to american ones) but you still walk away feeling a little slimy. really, the germans in this film do nothing but admire the americans between battle scenes! how sad, unnecessary! i'd just like to say to the writers: it's obvious to many of us that you can't capture real people, with real problems, under real pressure, and that you've taken some very well tested shortcuts. lucky for you there will always be nationalist nutjobs to appreciate your sugar-coated tripe.
