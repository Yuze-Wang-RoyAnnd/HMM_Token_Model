once again i took a chance and rented this bag of crap. billed as a horror flick, there wasn't one scene, not one, that was even remotely scarey. not one!! sure there was some nudity, but all the lesbian action got a little old. i guess maybe that was suppose to be this movie's saving grace? and dan, what an annoying ass bag!! right from the beginning i knew i was in for it when good ol' dan first spoke. and he was suppose to be intimidating? what a laugh!! all in all, this movie is dreadfully awful! how in the hell do movies like this get made? if you want a movie with a few thrills in it, don't rent this one. this movie is about as thrilling as the teletubbies.
