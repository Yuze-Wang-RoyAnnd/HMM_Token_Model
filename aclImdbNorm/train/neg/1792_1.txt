allow me to start this review by saying this: i love vampire movies. they can suck (har har pun intended), and i'll still love them because vampires are just cool in movies. van helsing, considered by many to be a steaming pile of crap, was enjoyable to me because of the fact that there were vampires. you may ask: "what does that have to do with this movie?" the answer is that i intend to inform you of how horrible this movie truly is, that even a sucker (harharhar) for vampire movies like me can despise a movie like this so much.<br /><br />the movie stars van helsing, a college professor guy who isn't at all convincing. he's a terrible actor, like everyone else in this movie, and he wrote it, to add salt to the wound. i honestly to not mean to offend him, and i'm sure everyone had fun making this movie, but watching it was actually painful. i'm not sure why i watched the whole thing; perhaps it was a morbid fascination, like watching an impending train crash: it's horrible, but you can't manage to force yourself to look away. its main fault is that it's just so ****ing boring, and its plot is so damn ridiculous, even for a science fiction horror movie.<br /><br />but, i digress. by the way, van helsing has sex with his mom. of course, he doesn't know it's her at the time; he just thinks it's one of his students (which is still illegal and all, but not as disgusting and creepy).<br /><br />if i were van helsing, i would at least pull an oedipus myself when i found out i had done something so gross. it would've made for one entertaining thing if he just made some comment on it, but no. the point isn't even brought up at all, by any of the characters. it's as if the writer didn't even think of it. i would've at least had another character laugh at him and say "ha ha, you had sex with your mom," which would be mildly humorous (although blatantly immature). i'm probably running out of room, so a few more words to dissuade you from ever seeing this film: there's a vampire ninja fight with an old man. it would be funny, but the filmmakers expect us to take it seriously. it's not even worth watching the movie to see how bad it is. stay far, far away from it if you value your time at all.<br /><br />i will say one thing positive about the movie: the guy who plays van helsing is pretty slick with that knife of his. there's like, a minute long segment where he swings around his knife and actually does some pretty nifty tricks. it would be boring in any other movie, but here, sadly, it was the highlight.
