i only rented this because i loved the first movie. however, calling it john carpenters vampires: los muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it. he is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film (jeepers creepers anyone?)<br /><br />a tragic storyline, terrible special effects and jon bon jovi as the least convincing vampire hunter of all time. it's not even comically bad.<br /><br />what we end up with is a dull, uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clich'ed acting. it just reeks of low budget.<br /><br />avoid like the bubonic plague.
