being a fan of silent films, i looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time. i was pretty disappointed. <br /><br />as has been mentioned, the film seems to be one long, long, commercial for the maxwell automobile. <br /><br />perhaps if the chase scene was about half the length that it is, i may have enjoyed the film more. but it got old very fast. and while i recognize that reality is stretched many times in films, without lessening a viewer's enjoyment, what was with the mexican bandits? i mean, they are chasing a car through the mountains, a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour, yet they can't catch up to it?
