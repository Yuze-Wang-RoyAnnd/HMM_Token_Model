i'll admit. i think uma thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and have made it a mission to see every movie she has been in (unfortunately that includes the horrible films batman and robin, the avengers) and this one.<br /><br />this has to rank as the worst movie i've ever seen. (yes it ranks even lower than the avengers). everyone looks lost in it and it is incoherent beyond belief. <br /><br />even if you think uma is a goddess like i do, please please don't subject yourself to this movie. you'll hate yourself the following morning for it.
