this film is horrible. bad acting, bad writing, bad music. it's just horrible. not only is it incredibly misrepresentative of role-playing games, but the key elements of the film are poorly executed. may the god i don't believe in have mercy on the souls of the miserable wretches who conceived and gave birth to this abomination.
