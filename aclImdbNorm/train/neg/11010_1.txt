this movie doesn't even deserve a one. this was an utter waste of time. it was a waste of film and money. it was not offensive but everything was provocative and disgusting. my spoiler is one that i think should be read by everyone. there is full frontal nudity and disgusting language. but not only that, there is no plot line, the actors are terrible, the accents are horrible, the actors are small time and i was even excited to watch this movie! <br /><br />the only reason i rented it was for brian van holt (who got only a fifteen second part, by the way). i think this might have been a mistake on the directors and editors parts but they repeated the same segments two or three times, adding only a new sentence.<br /><br />a film similar to this is eraser head, possibly the most disturbing movie in existence. there is no plot line, and is not funny. although it isn't trying to be funny. do not watch either movie.
