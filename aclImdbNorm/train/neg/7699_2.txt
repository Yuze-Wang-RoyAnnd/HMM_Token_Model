i expected a comedy like the "big mama" movies. instead, the movie was a bizarre mix of comedy, drama and a love story.<br /><br />this movie has three plots: the first involves madea and her taking in a foster child. the second involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who is abusing her. the third involves a relationship between a single mother with 2 children and a single father.<br /><br />there is actually very little comedy in the movie. there are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie. for example, madea beats the foster child with a belt (in a comedic manner), to convince the child to straighten out. the child does, in fact, turn herself around. apparently, it pays to beat children.<br /><br />there are plots dealing with child rape (with the consent of the mother). there are scenes with old men ogling young girls who are related to them. (the ogling takes place at a family reunion.) the movie jumps from plot to plot such that you are always off-balance. is this a comedy, a love story, or a drama? it is, in fact, nothing ... except a waste of time and money.
