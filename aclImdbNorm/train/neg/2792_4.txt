studio 666 (aka the possessed in the uk) is another sub-par slasher that has the appearance of a straight-to-dvd movie.<br /><br />whilst many of the straight-to-dvd movies are fast-paced or unintentionally hilarious in the so-bad-it's-good sense, studio 666 is a lamentable failure.<br /><br />at the time of writing, every comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review. every one of these people have hit the nail on the head.<br /><br />the two people (at the time of writing) who wrote comments with a rating of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously. obviously they've seen few slasher movies and have an even more limited understanding of horror.<br /><br />the only really positive point i can make about this movie is that it does fare better than the choke and one of them, two extremely mediocre slasher movies that i would not wish on my worst enemy!<br /><br />the plot of this movie must have been done hundreds, if not thousands of times. the movie only has a slight twist (and one that is badly handled) to the usual expectations. a depressed singer commits suicide. soon after, her spirit returns to possess one of her surviving friends. the said possessed friend goes on a killing spree. the rest of the plot really is too bizarre to sum up. you'll just have to see it for yourself, providing your interest has not yet waned to the point of extinction of course.<br /><br />the acting in the movie is very poor for the most part. the actress who played dora was an exception to this. her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen. she helps to elevate the movie above similar contemporary efforts. unfortunately, some of the lines she was given to say were badly written to put it mildly and thus prevent her from saving the movie.<br /><br />the direction was equally poor. the villains did not seem the least bit menacing, every killing was totally devoid of suspense or tension, atmosphere was non-existent and the camera-work was incredibly basic. some of the special effects (if you can call them that) reminded me of the tv series, ghost stories. unfortunately for the producers of this movie, ghost stories had intelligently written scripts, believable performances and made superb use of camera angles. maybe if the producers had watched that tv series closely, they'd have picked up some more techniques that might have saved this excuse for a movie!<br /><br />the music is completely unsuited to the tone of the movie. it's just rock music and not the best examples of this type either. don't get me started on that awful song played at the beginning!<br /><br />some aspects of the movie, particularly dialogue, are unintentionally funny. unfortunately they are not funny enough to move the movie up (or should it be down) to the so-bad-it's-good level.<br /><br />overall, studio 666 is a mundane mediocre slasher with very little noteworthy aspects. i recommend this only to those who are fans of straight-to-dvd movies and have a desire to see every single slasher ever made.
