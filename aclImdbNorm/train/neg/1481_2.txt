did they use their entire budget paying the porno stars or what?!?<br /><br />sound effects, background music and the editing in general was so bad you'd think some 12-year-old wanna-be made the film.<br /><br />most of the acting was good considering the script... the "innocent virgin" played her part really well.<br /><br />the mutants look really cool and this actually could have been a really cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel... but, unfortunately for all involved, that's not the case.<br /><br />turn left was made better than this movie and those guys didn't even have any money!!! good thing i didn't rent the movie myself!
