joel schumaker directs the script he co-wrote and has a group of georgetown grads confronted with adult life situations. the story line is a scrambled mess, but some scenes are actually good. there is a lot of wasted talent and time here. the cast is more impressive than the movie. featured are demi moore, rob lowe, judd nelson, andrew mccarthy, emilio estevez, ally sheedy and mare winningham. the most notable being mccarthy and moore. lowe is quite obnoxious. coming of age is not so damn easy.
