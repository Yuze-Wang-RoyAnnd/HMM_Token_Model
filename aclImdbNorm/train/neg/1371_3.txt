i can't figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie this bad. it's like the tv station are desperate for anything, anything at all. they're buried underneath a bunch of snow, the electricity constantly flashes on and off, yet magically there is a background light that stays constant. where does all this (fake) light come from? that, and all that stupid bickering between the characters. they seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive. it tries to create that feel of emergency and people helping. but because it's such bad directing and acting, you will not your florence nightingale fix with this flick, sorry. i'm joining the negative feedback, and i concur that this is one of the worst movies ever.
