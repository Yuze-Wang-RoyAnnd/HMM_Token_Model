i thought harvey keitel, a young, fresh from the sex pistols john lydon, then as a bonus, the music by ennio morricone. i expected an old-school, edgy, italian cop thriller that was made in america. istead, i got a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that left me saying: wtf!!! too many unanswered questions, and not enough action. the result: a potential cult classic got flushed down the toilet. keitel and lydon work well together, so maybe quentin tarantino can reunite these guys with better script. oh, and the morricone score: ok, but not memorable.<br /><br />overall, not a waste of time, but not a "must see", unless you are a hardcore keitel fan.
