it is considered fashion to highlight every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male dominance, however moronic this illogical 'logic' may be. however within the story and theme of the film, there is no grey area and the woman who should be called the film's antagonist, is the ''villain of the story''. under no circumstances can what she did be justified. sexuality of women is just hype in this case and has nothing to do with the actuality. it is betrayal of the ultimate sort. the man ended up spending his resources and time in the wasteful raising of another man's offspring. to top it all, the most feeble of arguments raised by the 3 'liberated' female characters in the climax is pathetic. a woman's sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and worse, there are no other children. so in essence his life has been wasted. in some societies where justice still prevails, such situations result in the execution of the unjust.
