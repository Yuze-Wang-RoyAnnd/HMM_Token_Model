for every series that makes it to television, a 100 ideas are formed, 50 scripts are written, 15 pilots are made, and one, just one, actually makes it to production. from such a selection process, we are lead to believe that the final product must be the cream of the crop, for what other reason could so many ideas be rejected to give us a single television series.<br /><br />and so it goes with true blood; all the stars were in alignment and what started as a series of novels was transformed into an idea, a screen play, a pilot, and finally a series. unfortunately, it can sometimes be a long journey and along the way there are many turns that ultimately change what was good and pure into and show that production people feel would be best for ratings. oh how wrong they so often are...<br /><br />true blood is an example of a creative concept that has developed into one of the poorest story lines, worst acting, and silliest subplots as anything in recent television history. its international cast of relatively unknown actors struggle to find their voices but keep tripping over their fake southern accents. alan ball's not so secret desires for ryan (jason stackhouse) gives us a fresh nude shot each week although it often has nothing to do with the storyline. tara's angry black woman characterization fails to connect and you find yourself secretly hoping the vamps take her out quickly before she goes into another speech about white suppression while attend a ceremony for the glorious dead of the confedercy. sam finds suppressed love for sookie and suddenly we are to believe he needs to watch over her morning, noon, and night despite years of working with her and avoiding any such relationship.<br /><br />as for bill the vampire, his moral high ground is quickly surrendered at the first chance to make love with sookie and has no issue with make a quick snack of her (although she remains somewhat unharmed). we find the other vampires not so mainstream as bill but greatly desiring to become accepted by a public as they look at the living as happy meals with legs.<br /><br />despite my best efforts of suffering through the first six episodes, i have come to the realization that no matter how long you watch a bad show, its still bad. somethings die for a reason, even vampires. maybe this show should to.
