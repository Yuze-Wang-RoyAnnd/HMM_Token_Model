i have never read the bradbury novel that this movie is based on but from what i've gathered, it will be interesting (when i finally do read it and i will). my comments will be based purely on the film. as soon as i saw the trailer i knew i had to see it and was so excited but when i finally did, i was so disappointed it hurt. this is because the movie itself felt so amateurish. the actors were not well cast (though robards and pryce are both good actors - just not here). the kid actors, it seemed, were merely asked to show up, get in the characters' clothes, say the lines and make the faces. the set and props were cheap and unrealistic. the direction was surprisingly bad. i was so surprised at the awfulness of it that i had to go online and check who directed it, just to see the kind of work he had done. the editing was cut and paste and the plot (screenplay) was just that as well (even though the author had been involved himself, irony?). the building up of the tension, fear and suspense was so mild it was ineffective when the climax finally came.<br /><br />i've read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it. what hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing. it had so much potential. unfortunately, the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the story.
