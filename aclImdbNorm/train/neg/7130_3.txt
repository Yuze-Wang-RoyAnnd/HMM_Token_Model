this movie should have been named need for speed: the movie. for those who have not played the games need for speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot. this applies perfectly to redline. the only thing about this movie that was a-level were the cars. the acting seemed forced and scripted, the premise was flimsy at best, and the plot was almost nonexistent. i only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and, while it was pretty bad, it could have been worse. and at least it was entertaining. i just wish they had showed eddie griffin crashing the enzo somewhere in the movie. all in all, don't pay for it, don't go out of your way to see it, but if it's on showtime or hbo and there isn't anything else on, it's a decent distraction.
