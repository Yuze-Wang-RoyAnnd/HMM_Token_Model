maybe i've seen one too many crime flick, or maybe i don't take the right drugs.<br /><br />this was the most clich'e ridden, plot deficient, plot-absurd, just plain stupid movie i have seen in a long time.<br /><br />as for the direction, it looks like it took less time to show this than it did to put it together.<br /><br />in fact it looks like to made it straight to video before it was completed.<br /><br />it's a bad rip off of "m" the classic fritz lang film starring peter lorre. you'd be so much better off renting that instead.
