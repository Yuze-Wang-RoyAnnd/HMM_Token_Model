well this film has certainly had a fair amount of hype; from the buzz at the toronto film festival to gushing reviews on cbc radio. a refreshing, wacky, hilarious indie movie apparently. i'd been looking forward to it for months.<br /><br />how can i put it this simply? it sucked in a very big way. an exercise in cinematic lameness that makes adam sandler look like a comic genius.<br /><br />at best it was mildly amusing and at worst coma inducing. an amerterish script badly directed and shoddily edited into a ramshackle mess.<br /><br />and what was with the music being 500db louder than the rest of the sound track? that was about the only truly odd thing about it.<br /><br />if you want to see a genuinely funny, bizarre movie involving aliens then try repoman. there is no comparison!
