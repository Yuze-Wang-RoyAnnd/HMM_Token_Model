i saw the movie last night here at home, but i thought it was too long first of all. second, the things i saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what i thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before. the things isn't funny in the movie: fianc'e hitting his girlfriend, beatings. the movie was way too long--talk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing! some of the things at the reunion were too much to capture--like the lady singing--i felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here! come on perry, you can do better then this!
