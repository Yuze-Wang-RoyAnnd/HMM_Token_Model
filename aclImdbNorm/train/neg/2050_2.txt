not that "a film by ulli lommel" filled me with hope, but i must confess that zodiac killer managed to sink beneath my lowest expectations. there is a recent trend among young filmmakers of utilizing digital video for their early projects, which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock. but many of these young filmmakers have also wised up to the notion of filtering the finished movie so that it appears qualitatively more like celluloid. the effect is never perfect, but it helps. unfiltered digital video really only works for the "mockumentary" style, because it never looks like anything other than video. therein lies the primary trouble with zodiac killer. watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer. it does not feel like watching a movie. and what's even more unforgivable is that the lommel is not a young filmmaker. he ought to know better. he ought to know that it's virtually impossible to generate horror (or even suspense!) on video. for the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties! he may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business. and lucky us, he wrote the script too! so you can expect convoluted actions that mean nothing, unjustified behavior, and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you utterly unsatisfied. please, please miss this film. you'll thank me later.
