if another hitler ever arises, it will be thanks in part to nonsense like this film, which propagates the absurd notion that he was a visibly deranged lunatic from the start. far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office in the land, sane people would cross the street to avoid him, and he would have died in a ditch, nameless and unknown.<br /><br />anyone who reads the accounts of hitler's close companions - the autobiography of his secretary traudl junge for instance - will be struck by the fact that people found him a kindly, intelligent, generous man. he was also a brilliant orator, and the fact that his speeches seem overblown and ranting to modern ears ignores the times in which they were made, when strutting pomposity was common in political speeches. ditto the overstated anti-semitism, which was neither a central plank of the early nazis - who were primarily anti-communist - nor uncommon or unusual for the times. the film makes it look as though hitler's sole ambition from the start was the holocaust.<br /><br />if you want to identify the next person who will cause the death of tens of millions, you can ignore fleck-lipped ravers life the one portrayed here. look instead for a charming, charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation, and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country. i'm afraid his personality will be much more like barack obama's than fred phelps'.<br /><br />i hoped for much here, and got nothing but caricature. the fools who made this thing perpetrated a crime against reality. this is the historical equivalent of 'reefer madness'.
