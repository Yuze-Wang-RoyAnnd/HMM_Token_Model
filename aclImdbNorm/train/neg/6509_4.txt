sean bean is great, as are the photography, locations and costumes. however, the plot is somewhat muddled, and the conclusion flat. the plot has been substantially altered from cornwell's novel, and not to the better. unfortunately, this adventure is much better read than watched. sharpe was too narrowly drawn here, in contrast with his literary alter ego, who seems more intelligent and determined despite his apprehension in his new role as an officer promoted from the ranks. i really enjoyed the brief scene in which sharpe is tripped by a "real" officer, and after a quick pause and piercing stare, pushes the surprised and cowed officer right back. it sets the tone for his later trials as a commanding officer.<br /><br />rating: "4" of "10."
