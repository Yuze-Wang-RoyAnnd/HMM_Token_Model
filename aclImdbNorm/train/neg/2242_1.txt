i caught this film at the edinburgh film festival. i hadn't heard much about it; only that it was a tightly-paced thriller, shot digitally on a very low budget. i was hoping to catch the next big brit-flick. but i have to say, i was severely disappointed. "this is not a love song" follows two criminals, who, after accidentally shooting and killing a farmer's young daughter, become embroiled in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt them down.<br /><br />the real problem is that this is yet another example of style over substance in a british film. the camera angles and editing are completely at odds with the story, as are the over the top performances, and the appalling use of slow motion, which only serves to make the whole thing look like an expensive home video. there are repeated attempts to make the film look edgy and gritty, which instead come over as hilarious and over the top(cue a pathetic, obligatory drug scene, and countless, pointless camera zooms). no amount of cliche's such as this can disguise the fact that this is a pretty bad story.<br /><br />we've seen this kind of thing many times before, and made a hundred times better, particularly in john boorman's masterful "deliverance." but while in the latter film, we actually cared about the characters, in this film, i found myself just wanting them to be hunted down and killed as quickly as possible. even this wouldn't have been so bad if their adversaries had been frightening or worthwhile, but instead, are merely a collection of stereotypical, inbred-looking countryfolk. again, another offensive, overused cliche' coming to the fore. surely there are some nice people in the country, filmmakers?<br /><br />in its defense, "this is not a love song" does contain a couple of good, suspenseful moments, but it's hard to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video, or, at a push, getting a very limited cinema release. it's not a patch on last year's low-budget hunted in the hills movie, "dog soldiers". maybe british cinema could actually get kick-started again if the right money stopped going to the wrong people.
