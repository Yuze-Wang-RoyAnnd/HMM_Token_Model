i had to compare two versions of hamlet for my shakespeare class and unfortunately i picked this version. everything from the acting (the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all medium or close up shots...no scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots) were absolutely terrible. i watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that i feel that i was gypped out of 114 minutes of my vacation. not recommended by any stretch of the imagination.
