for some reason, tv guide gave this two and a half stars, plus faye dunaway is in it, so it definitely looked like something to see. my, oh, my, this may be the worst film i've ever seen. ever. from its horrid acting (every time the girl asks the boy what's wrong with him, i shouted to the tv "i can't act!" when she asks what he needs, i yell "i need acting lessons!" to the unbelievably bad dialog ("give me back my organs!").<br /><br />and the brian depalma wannabe ending, too, it was all just beyond awful. i wanted to like it. dunaway is one of the best actors ever. and the production values were pretty good.<br /><br />but wowzers, this had me laughing, laughing!, most of the time.<br /><br />don't even bother out of curiosity, that was my first mistake. staying with it was definitely my second, and third and fourth.
