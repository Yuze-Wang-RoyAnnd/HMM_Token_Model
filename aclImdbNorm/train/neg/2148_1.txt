possible spoilers, perhaps. i must say that "cinderella ii: dreams come true" is one of the worst movies ever made. first of all, the movie was made during the height of disney's sequel rampage. it was created around the same time as "the little mermaid ii," "the jungle book ii," and "peter pan ii," all of which were disservices to their original film classics. (disney also made "the hunchback of notre dame ii" and "atlantis ii," but i'm going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place.") let me go ahead and say that i am an avid supporter of good disney films, and i absolutely adore the original disney "cinderella." the sequel to "cinderella," however, was a waste of time. the character of cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that i grew up watching. in the original, cinderella was kind and loving. the new cinderella had very out-of-character moments with current-era phrasing like, "i'm going to do this banquet my way!" let me also tell you that new cinderella (as i have affectionately named her) says, "ewww!" that is the anti-cinderella. i try to find the best in people, but in the sequel, anastasia, one of the stepsisters, is good! what the heck? why? they made it all out to be like lady tremaine and drizella are just horrible family members for poor little anastasia. my question to the world: did the people at disney watch the original "cinderella" when making this sequel? well, it surely doesn't seem so. if i remember correctly, anastasia was just as abusive to cinderella as drizella and lady tremaine. i am all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no point of redemption for anastasia in this movie. in the first one, anastasia was evil. in the second one, she is good. one just can't leave a story like this. i hope disney realizes that this movie, among other movies, is shaming walt disney's name. perhaps now that michael eisner is gone, things will start shaping up around the house of mouse.
