a typical goth chick (rainbow harvest looking like a cross between winona ryder in beetlejuice and boy george) gets even with people she feels have wronged her with the help of an old haunted mirror that she finds in the new house she and her mom (horror mainstay, karen black, the only remotely good thing about this travesty) buy. the acting's pretty laughably bad (especially when rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror) and there are no scares or suspense to be had. this film inexplicably spawned thus for 3 sequels each slightly more atrocious than the last. people looking for a similarly themed, but far superior cinematic endeavor would be well advised to just search out the episode of "friday the 13th: the series" where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror. that packs more chills in it's scant 40 minutes than this whole franchise has provided across it's 4 films.<br /><br />my grade: d <br /><br />eye candy: charlie spradling provides the obligatory t&a
