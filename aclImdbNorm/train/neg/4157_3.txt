the above seemed a much more appropriate title when me and my suicidal underlings decided to watch this masterpiece of modern bullshit <br /><br />erotic,scary, suspenseful, well thought out, these are all the things this film fails to be.<br /><br />it is however incredibly funny, the slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to this to make one of the greatest comedies i have seen in recent years. and yet this film doesn't even try to be funny and that is one of the movies grand achievements, it becomes a comedy without even attempting to amuse.<br /><br />throughout the film an old guy who looks amazingly like santa claus goes around ploughing over zombies and smashing vampires into the ground. this made me fail to believe the films title, if this was vampires vs zombies why were the vampires and zombies not fighting? oh well whatever, besides there were more flaws to this rental than the title. such as this one; there has been a virus sweeping through america creating zombie like beings who go around acting a lot like your average tourist. and yet there's only four zombies in the entire film. another problem is besides one shop everywhere is deserted. surely you'd see zombies roaming about in the woods or in the background a bit. in fact i believe they just drove around in a circle of forest over and over again since they didn't have a high enough budget to film in a wider location, that or the director didn't want to waste his precious time filming in different areas of wood he was to busy sitting in a trailer jerking off to be bothered with such trivial matters.<br /><br />in fact the director had so much fun doing this that he didn't have enough time to hire a big enough cast or even an editor. and so he told the eight members of the cast to dress up as different people and try not to act inconspicuous, whilst i assume he changed his name and began randomly snipping at the film reels "editing isn't a hard job anyway right?" the only reason this "movie" found it's way into our bag was because somehow we got it confused with freddy vs jason, strange how these things happen isn't it. and the only way we made it though the night was by strapping gas masks on and bolting them to our skulls to avoid the stink of this nauseating mess.<br /><br />oh yes we did laugh at the end, but i'm sure one does that a lot when he has lost his sanity...................
