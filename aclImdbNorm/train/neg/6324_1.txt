i spent eight years running movie theatres in the 80's and 90's. this was, by far, the worst film i ever showed to the public. one thing that made it so bad was that it put on airs of trying to be a great, inspiring film. even the great gregory peck could not save this horrid piece of drivel from being far less than mediocre. jamie lee curtis, in an early non-horror film role, demonstrated clearly that she had not yet learned to act (she's still trying, but it isn't getting much better).<br /><br />i'm sorry, and here's the spoiler, international nuclear disarmament is never going to happen just because it makes children afraid to play little league baseball! even the shows on nick and the disney channel are not stupid enough to try to make us believe that dreck.<br /><br />this is not worth the time you would waste watching it on cable tv. it is not worth the price of a movie rental; your dollar would be better spent on an extra package of microwave popcorn to go with the other movie you picked (because it can only be better than this).
