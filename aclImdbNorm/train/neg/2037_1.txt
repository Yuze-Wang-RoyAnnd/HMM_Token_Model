if i could give it a zero, i'd change my mind and give it a -10 instead. absolutely horrible movie with no movie plot, doesn't make sense of what is happening. just plain boring. please don't waste your money on this one. pleaseee!!! this movie could have done so well if it truly depicted the real zodiac killer's story, but nopes, i didn't feel anything but disgust while watching it. do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead, its better to watch a movie you've already seen like 3-4 times than watch this crap! i don't understand why people even bother to make such movies when they know its not going to do well. zodiac killer should be called 'boriac killer' instead!!!
