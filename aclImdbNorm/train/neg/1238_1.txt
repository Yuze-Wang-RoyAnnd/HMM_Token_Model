this tim burton remake of the original "planet of the apes" from 1968 (and starring charleton heston) is a far, far cry from the quality and plot of the original.<br /><br />certainly special effects have improved since 1968, but writing has not. the characters were boring and the dialog was awful. i sat through the entire film with a friend (who thankfully only rented it) and completely understood why, before christmas, all of the "planet of the apes" toys at target were in the clearance bin.<br /><br />my advice to tim burton: don't put this on your resume.<br /><br />my advice to everyone else: watch the original 1968 "planet of the apes" movie.
