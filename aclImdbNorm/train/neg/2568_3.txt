dear me... peter sellers was one of the most oddly talented actors there has been. but his choice of films, say, after 1964, was very unfortunate. he didn't seem to realize how to use his talents. he would have been better off working with more of the kubricks of the film world than the people he did. of his later films, only "the optimists of nine elms" and "being there" have impressed me of those i have seen.<br /><br />that said, the boultings and sellers had made a few films prior to this that hardly sound that bad - i have yet to see "carlton browne" and "heavens above!" - at least in the sense of using sellers well to a degree. but, "there's a girl in my soup" really is a poor film and a dire choice on sellers' part in terms of character. in his films from 1955-64, you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles. here, you have peter sellers trying to play a typical romantic lead. it's almost sellers playing a niven cad without the joviality. he certainly does not convince, try as he might, or create an interesting character. he should have left such parts to masters of suavity such as cary grant, and concentrated on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles that he was famed for.<br /><br />hawn and sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry; this is no easy, genial romance of the like perfected by william powell and myrna loy. it is very artificial seeming, all the way through - i know that it is part of danvers' character that he is a dry procurer of ladies, but he doesn't really change from that in a way that convinces. sellers has a very grating way of playing "charm" as well... this character really has no depth, and really does not gain the viewer's sympathy or interest. sellers goes through the motions in a way one would not think possible when remembering the magnificence of his shifty, iconoclastic performance in "lolita".<br /><br />there really is nothing to say about the plot, direction or characters, as frankly they leave little or no impression. this is truly one of the most anaemic, complacent, misguided and lightly dull films i have ever seen. a nonentity of a "vehicle" for sellers' undisputed talents.<br /><br />rating:- * 1/2/*****
