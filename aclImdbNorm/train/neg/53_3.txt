i'm studying catalan, and was delighted to find el mar, a movie with mostly catalan dialogue, at my art-house video store.<br /><br />hmmm... not so delighted to have seen it.<br /><br />yes, as other reviewers have said, it's well-made, and beautifully photographed. although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent, it's well-acted and convincing. (for the most part, that is... would the mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square, in full view of the dead man's 10-year-old boy?) oh, well... minor detail. up to this point, it had something of the feel of a non-magical pan's labyrinth, also set in the spanish civil war.<br /><br />fast-forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age. francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, manuel and ramallo, both are patients. i know, but hey, coincidences happen.<br /><br />the problem, as with so many spanish movies (apologies to almodovar fans), is that with one exception (francisca) the characters are just so dang *weird*. their motivations, personalities, and dialogue are often simply incoherent.<br /><br />what's more, it descends into some horrific wretched excess. be prepared for lots of pain and lots of blood. the reviewer who called it a "potboiler" is quite on track. if it had been made 40 years ago, the poster would've said: see forbidden love!! rape!! murder!! mutilation!! fanaticism!! animal cruelty!! betrayal!! <br /><br />the opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable. to work, this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters. as it is, it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between "brother sun, sister moon" and "pulp fiction." if that sounds like something you've got to see, by all means, enjoy. i think i go with something that doesn't make me feel i need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom.<br /><br />as for the catalan, it's the mallorqui dialect, fairly different than the barcelona dialect, though i was surprised by the comment that said that even barcelonans apparently needed catalan subtitles to understand it.
