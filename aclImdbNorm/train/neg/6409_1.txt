i just saw this movie yesterday...i cannot believe the reviews on this site. the ones that give it over one-star must be buffy fanatics. well, i am a buffy fan of the first order, but i know crap when i see it. on every level, this film is terrible. technically, much of the time you don't know where you are in this movie, even within one scene, it jumps pov like crazy for no reason. no logic whatsoever in cinematic terms. emotionally is bleak for bleak's sake and attempts to be a psychological thriller when it is just confusing. throwing nasty-looking red-necks in your movie is a cheap way to convey "atmosphere". i ran out of patience with it a long time before the last act, but i was having too much fun with my friends doing mst3k riffs to turn it off. since leaving buffy, smg has had 2 successful movies, if even listing "scooby doo" on your resume could count. gellar is a fine actress, but she (or her agent) sure can't find a vehicle for her. and mr. shepard, if you are having trouble paying your mortgage, i'll send you a few bucks if you promise to not appear in a movie like this again! ( also, the estate of patsy cline should sue for defamation! )
