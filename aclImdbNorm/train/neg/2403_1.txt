whack!!! i got this movie because elizabeth hartman was in it. i was disappointed to find out she was in like two short scenes towards the end. other than that i was basically hitting the fast forward button the entire time. some teenager goes on a trip to romania with his dad and gets bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf if there's a full moon. he kills his father and friends. about 30 years past but he doesn't age a bit and enrolls in a high school. there he meets a shy teacher whom he ends up biting and then has kids with her. this movie sucked and i don't recommend it to anyone. read war and peace instead. only ms. hartman did a great job. check out a very young bob saget in this one!!
