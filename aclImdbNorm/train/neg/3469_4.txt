while filming an 80's horror movie called 'hot blooded', the director is brutally murdered and the leading lady is scarred as she survives the attack and manages to kill murderer. after all of this, the production is abandoned and the stock reels are left to gather dust. so a group of filmmakers decide to pick up where the film left off even though they're warned by people to keep away from the film, as the last person who was interested in the flick turned up dead in the cinema while watching the film. from this it's labelled as a cursed production. not taking these warnings seriously the crew goes ahead with the production and they get the original star of the movie to return from hollywood to reprise her role, but not as the daughter but the mother. but again the murders start occurring with the cast and crew getting butchered by an unknown figure dressed up as the film's killer.<br /><br />look what 'scream' started! hey, i enjoy those films, but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses. during this stage the sub-genre came back with vengeance, but it wasn't much of a good thing as they were mostly unsuccessful and unoriginal attempts, where they followed the derivative pattern of the scream franchise. 'cut' which is an independent australian take on the textbook slasher genre is purely shonky garbage that lacks basically everything and shamelessly knocks off every other slasher flick. but you know what, i found it a cheesy delight. yeah, it's gawd awful and highly forgettable, but it's a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted. although i did hate it when i originally came across it, but the second time around i knew what i was getting myself into and it worked better for it. it was just like helping myself to a nice slice cheesecake again, but this time it wasn't so sweet.<br /><br />the film came out around the same time as 'scream 3' and 'urban legends: the final cut' did, which all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie. 'scream 3' is obviously the strongest of the three, but i would actually watch this trash over urban legends: the final cut. though, it did seem more of a throwback to the 80's slashers than that of one of scream's bastard offspring. pretty much the film is given b-grade treatment and that shows up in the script and performances. the dialog is truly unimaginative and hardly comes up with any surprises and suspense. while, the performances are pure mockery and molly ringwald takes the crown for it. she plays the wash-up actress returning to finish the cursed flick and i had good fun with her laughably ridiculous send-up performance. she provides the bite here and nails it down perfectly. the rest were mostly recognizable australian tv stars (that's if you're an australian) with a ravishing jessica napier leading the cast with the likes of stephen curry and frank roberts. also pop singer (and supposed actress) kylie minogue makes a cameo appearance in the opening just to be hacked up! nice. these teens mostly followed the formula of horny and dim-witted kids that have nothing better to do but to be killed. sometimes it feels like they just waiting in queue, because they have no real substance to be there.<br /><br />the plot starts off rather interestingly, then heads into a mystery phase where red herrings pop up, but then it makes a sudden u-turn where it becomes a somewhat satire on the horror genre. simply it's rather choppy and when it comes to the explanation for all of this madness i was kind of left thinking
