last week, i took a look at the weekly nielsen ratings, and there was veronica mars, supposedly "the best show you're not watching".<br /><br />well, they're right that you're not watching it. it aired twice and was ranked 147 and 145 out of 147.<br /><br />translation: this is the lowest-rated show on any nationally broadcast network... and deservedly so. i tried to watch it a couple of times because of all the press coverage hyping it as a "great" show, a "realistic look" at life and all such nonsense. the reality was otherwise. veronica mars is a bore. it's as unrealistic as it gets, and it richly deserves to be canceled.<br /><br />the only mystery is why cw felt compelled to put on its inaugural schedule the lowest-rated show in memory, after two years of continued commercial and artistic failure.
