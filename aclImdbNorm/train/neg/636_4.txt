a couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in china. wang lung (paul muni) buys o-lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (luis rainer). american stars appear in the leading roles, talking with fake accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. a good wife, many children and land are the best things for men to have. they are seen as property and investment. because it is a big budget movie, in which many extras cooperate, big sets are built and special effects take place, the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors. luise rainer won an academy award for this performance, which is definitely the worst in the movie. her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience. o-lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with. on the other hand paul muni gives a better performance, showing his talent ones again. another problem with the movie is the ending. it seems like franklin did not know when to end the picture. this film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of chinese culture and traditions.
