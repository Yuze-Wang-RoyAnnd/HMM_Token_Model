i don't know what you guys are talking about, the first time i watched this movie with two of my friends we couldn't stop crying. this is one of the funniest shits i've ever seen. that comment about the porn is so right though hahahaha.<br /><br />yeah this movie actually is the worse, but it did bring tears to my eyes due to the phony characters, poor dialog and acting. not to mention the expensive cameras they used to film it?! it looks like one of those movies out of my drivers ed. class. the props look like they came out of a high school drama show. the music sounds like it is from an original nintendo system game. the only thing that even came close the scaring me about this movie was that it had a killer clown which, who isn't creeped out by fat, lurking clowns? hahaha if someone were to ever watch this though, they need to look out for the actors verbal errors like lisping on words and some of their facial expressions. hahahaha i died.<br /><br />susan
