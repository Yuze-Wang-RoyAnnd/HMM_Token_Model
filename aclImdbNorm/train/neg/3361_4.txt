this movie was one of the greatest movies ever made,,,, it had everything to make a movie great. incredible acting, awesome special effects...... oh wait i must be thinking of a good movie. well this wasn't one of them, it just plain sucked. <br /><br />what i want to know is, what kind of bone head would think that this movie was a 10. when i casted my vote there were 206 out there, god knows what goes on in their head. now as for any other vote, a 8 or 9 was even too high, but a 10??? come on, what made this movie sooooo good to give it a 10? i know these are the same 206 that thought that jean claude van damme is a great dramatic actor.
