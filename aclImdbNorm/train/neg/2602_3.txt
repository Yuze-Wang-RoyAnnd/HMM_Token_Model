drew barrymore keeps seeing her alter-ego all over town and it's really starting to become a pain in the butt.<br /><br />after dee rents a flat from a hack writer, her encounters with 'the other drew' become more frequent. writer-dude feels that it's his responsibility to snap 'the real drew' out of her stupor, so he does what he can to help including seducing her as soon as he has some free time. not very interesting, and even less scary, but drew is sexy as usual, especially when she gives a group of rude construction workers the finger... yeah drew, that's hot! <br /><br />best scene just might be where drew stabs her real-life mom, jaid, with a big kitchen knife... hmmm... and how was your day?
