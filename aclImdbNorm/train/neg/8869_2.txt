with the releasing of "farligt f"orflutet" swedish film industry has truly hit rock bottom. stefan (jens hult'en) has for the past years lived a calm life with his wife marie (regina lund). one day an old friend of stefan's arrives with a favor to ask him. stefan is to do a small courier job. he is supposed to bring a suitcase filled with heroine through the sweden-germany customs. unfortunately things in germany don't work out as planned and stefan is now in big trouble. it is always nice to see a swedish film that breaks the traditional family-drama pattern. unfortunately if the people involved in the production have no clue of how a movie is supposed to be written, filmed or cut the result can only be catastrophic. the content can be concluded with: bad acting, an incoherent plot and idiotic dialogs. the only highlight in the movie is the unprovoked sex-scene wit the incredibly beautiful regina lund. this lasts for only a few seconds leaving approxamitly 90 minutes of pure, let's say what it truly is, crap.
