why would a person go back to a person, who kicks them in the teeth, not once, not twice, but over and over again.<br /><br />this film teaches us that in order to find love we must accept abuse (not just forgive it, but fully accept it). gosh! no wonder my first relationship only lasted ten years. i obviously wasn't embracing my inner masochist.<br /><br />as bucatinsky's writing debut, there are many wonderful aspects to this film; however, in order to justify the reunion of eli and tom, more character development would have been helpful. we are never acquainted with eli's masochism, in fact, we are led to believe that he is not a masochist, although tom's psycho-emotional sadism is highly evident.
