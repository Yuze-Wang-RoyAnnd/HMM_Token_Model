this kind of storytelling is unacceptable the only reason this film is anywhere above the 5 stars out of 10 line is because it's got george lucas behind it, and it has the words "star" and "wars" in its title. that is an insult to aspiring filmmakers, and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story, writing and acting, but did not get the credit. this is a travesty.<br /><br />first things first. the story. anakin's evolution? there is none. apart from a little make-up around the eyes, and a little yelling, there is none. he becomes young, stupid, cocky anakin skywalker to darth vader in a single blow. the only thing consistent about darth vader in the original series was his intelligence, how good he was at almost everything he did, planning, fighting, you name it. the only consistent thing about anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity. he even loses his body because of a bout of stupid cockiness.<br /><br />what part of the emperor palpatine telling him legends of the sith does not point to the emperor being a sith? unacceptable!<br /><br />the fight scenes used too many digital doubles. everyone's flying all over the place like teddy bears in a make-believe doll house. count dooku, emperor palpatine, anakin, obi-wan, almost every fighter had a rubbery digital double jumping around.<br /><br />in one specific fight scene, obi-wan and anakin in the climactic battle, they both actually stop in the middle of parries and ripostes, to twirl their sabers a few times while inches apart. i realize the fights are choreographed, but that just got me shaking my head in disbelief and disgust.<br /><br />the writing was awful. all the dialogue was of tremendously low quality. the good actors like ewan mcgregor and natalie portman did the best they could with their lines, but that just wasn't enough. i can't say enough bad things about this film. too much special effects, plot holes bigger than the centre of the universe, and absolutely no insights into any of the characters. this is the biggest mistake of this film: nothing new is offered. we know the rough picture of everything, all lucas did was colour it in.<br /><br />we knew anakin lost his limbs. we knew luke and leia are brother and sister, we knew luke is anakin's son, we knew obi-wan and yoda go to exile, we knew everything. nothing new is offered in this film. if that's all the fans wanted, then that's fine, lucas couldn't have gone wrong.<br /><br />but when anakin finally becomes darth vader, and he asks after padme, and hears she is dead, he reaches out his arms awkwardly and screams "nooooooooooooooooooooo." that scene screamed b-movie all the way, and i was half expecting darth vader to go "danger will robinson, danger" at any time. that is what this is. a b-movie, disguised by a huge budget and a ultra-loyalist fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two movies have pulled their standards down to the pits of the earth.
