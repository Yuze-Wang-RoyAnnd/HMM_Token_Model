it is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today. maybe i am a dinosaur from the fifties, and i am out of touch with todays movie going generation, and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie, since so many people loved it. i found it foul and vulgar. i haven't said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill. the humor is sophomoric and crude. i am not a politically correct person, and even i found the gay jokes, not only not funny but downright offensive ( i'm not gay). the main character in the movie is not even a likable person, just pathetic. when the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see.
