wow...ok. so, after reading the little feud on here, i decided i had to see this movie for myself. this movie is horrible. i stopped watching it. i strongly recommend cleaning a closet instead of watching this movie, you'll be more spooked/entertained.<br /><br />it's low budget with bad acting.<br /><br />whoever is giving this movie 10s is completely incorrect and should be disregarded.<br /><br />i am in no way connected to any of the other reviewers.<br /><br />simply put, this movie is not worth watching.<br /><br />very, very bad movie.
