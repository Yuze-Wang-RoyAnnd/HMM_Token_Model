made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this film in the edinburgh film festival. it was well shot from the outset, but that's the last positive comment i have about the film. the acting was awful, i wonder if actual gogo girls were hired? but it was the plot that was truly laughable, in fact that it was laughable and not boring is the only reason i gave this 3/10.<br /><br />** spoilers below **.<br /><br />i just want to mention a few of the scenes that really got the audience laughing:.<br /><br />shoving the girl in the field: who would have thought that a kid shoving another kid could be acted so badly. a real eye-opener.<br /><br />the getting on the bus scene: the girl is getting on the bus. but, according to the music, the world is ending.<br /><br />the rolling under the clothes line: wow, this one really demonstrates the plot writer's skills. in the room, followed by raw meat and skill selling. why not just get her to perform all three 'sins' at once? at least then the film might have been slightly shorter.<br /><br />the running down the stairs of the mall: watch as one of the girls takes to flight down the stairs pursued by a flesh eating dau, no wait .. she *is* just walking quickly trying not to break her nails.<br /><br />the running covered in blood: this is definitely my favourite scene, and a fitting end to the movie. a half marathon in red paint, completed by vaulting up stairs and over the bridge, only to be sent flying most unrealistically by a passing car. not only this, but this suicide is undertaken by the most self obsessed girl in the film, now that's sticking to character for you.<br /><br />i'd like to think that this film was created by a 16 year old and their mates. sadly, having met the director at the presentation, this is not the case.<br /><br />but, if you're in a sarcastic mood, and fancy a laugh with a few mates.. then still don't even think about it.
