david arquette is a young and naive home security alarm<br /><br />salesman taken under the wing of stanley tucci. arquette is a<br /><br />golden boy, scoring a big sale on his first call- to widow kate<br /><br />capshaw and her dopey son ryan reynolds. things are going<br /><br />well for arquette, he is appearing in commercials for the security<br /><br />firm and he is falling in love with capshaw.<br /><br />then tucci and his right hand woman mary mccormack let him in<br /><br />on a little secret- they sometimes break into the houses of their<br /><br />clients in order to scare them and to get their neighbors to buy<br /><br />security systems from the firm. arquette decides not to get<br /><br />involved, taking capshaw to meet his family, and going through life<br /><br />with a goofy smile on his face. then, someone breaks into<br /><br />capshaw's home and murders her and her son. arquette suspects tucci, and sets a series of traps, resulting in a gun to his<br /><br />boss' head as tucci pleads his innocence.<br /><br />based on a stage play, "the alarmist" is not opened up well. the<br /><br />scenes where arquette takes the capshaw to meet his parents<br /><br />are badly played and completely unfunny. they are also out of line<br /><br />with the character capshaw is playing, as she gets drunk and tells<br /><br />sexually explicit stories to arquette's mom michael learned. other<br /><br />than these scenes, capshaw is not given much to do, but she<br /><br />does a lot with the little she is given.<br /><br />stanley tucci, looking just like terry o'quinn, is a riot as the<br /><br />security firm owner. he is a creep who really does not understand<br /><br />arquette's moral revulsion. however, when he turns into a<br /><br />sniveling whiner after arquette kidnaps him, he is hilarious. mary<br /><br />mccormack seems to have been groomed for a bigger role, but<br /><br />she mostly stands around and agrees with tucci. ryan reynolds<br /><br />is too old to play a dumb teenager, but he is funny, especially<br /><br />telling his own explicit sexual story to arquette.<br /><br />the screenplay lurches from romantic comedy to dark comedy too<br /><br />soon. capshaw meeting the parents is completely unmotivated,<br /><br />except to give her a reason to get out of town so someone can<br /><br />break into her house. capshaw and reynolds are in the film just<br /><br />to give arquette a reason to take revenge on tucci.<br /><br />arquette, who has proven he is a good actor, is awful here. he<br /><br />relies on the constipated mugging that got him through those<br /><br />at&t ads, and he is not a strong enough presence to build this<br /><br />weak film around. actually, reynolds might have been a better<br /><br />choice in the role.<br /><br />dunsky's direction is good, nothing that will win an oscar soon.<br /><br />christophe beck's light jazzy score recalls the type of film noir this<br /><br />film tries to be, and it is really catchy on top of that.<br /><br />despite the pluses, arquette's failure as a lead and the script's<br /><br />schizophrenic quality sinks the film. i do not recommend it.<br /><br />this is rated (r) for physical violence, gun violence, some gore,<br /><br />strong profanity, brief female nudity, sexual content, strong sexual<br /><br />references, and adult situations.
