i have 2 words for you. sean bean. he is the only worthwhile presence in this film. but even so, don't see this movie. even though he is good as the main villain, you don't want to waste your time. <br /><br />i didn't care about the characters (except the little boy) and in fact, i didn't really care if the star crossed lovers ended up together or died. the movie did not make me care or believe that these people cared about each other at all. i have read a lot of "classic" novels after seeing the movies and this movie made me not even want to read the book. the story seems so boring. but i may go ahead and read it to try to redeem the story in my head. <br /><br />stay away from lorna doone. the actress who played lorna was also in sense and sensibility and she was much better in that. watch sharpe, horatio hornblower, a & e has great movies of novels like pride and prejudice. or miniseries like the forsyte saga. check them out, don't bother with lorna doone.
