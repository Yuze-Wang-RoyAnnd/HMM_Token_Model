it never ceases to amaze me how you can take an excellent actor, and put him to waste in a film such as this. robert de niro is one of the best hollywood stars of all time, but even he couldn't save this movie. in fact, his character is much the same as the one he played in cape fear, which was actually pretty good, but i can't stand it when actors do the same schtick over more than one movie. i believe it gets old, and that is the case here.<br /><br />there's nothing surprising in this movie, but then, the story has been told a million times before. wesley snipes is your typical baseball player, and his conceit shows through in his characterization. de niro plays the obsessed fan, but his role in this film is less than entertaining.<br /><br />however, because de niro is in this film, that makes it a draw if you are a fan (no pun intended) who sees everything he does no matter how bad. but to see de niro at his best, see "midnight run", "goodfellas", or "cop land", or even go way back and check out "taxi driver" or "godfather ii". don't waste your time with this drivel.<br /><br />my rating: 3/10
