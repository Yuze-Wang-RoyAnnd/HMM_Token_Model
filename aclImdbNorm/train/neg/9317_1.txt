i bought this from blockbuster for 99p. the guy behind the counter said the reason it was so cheap was because the disc was scratched to sh*t, but failed to mention that the reason it was so cheap was because the film was a p*ss poor effort that sucked harder than paris hilton in a hotel room home video. talking of home videos, since when has it been fair game to release them as films - i mean to say, films used to employ actors and technicians and scriptwriters and so on - not any more - just gather your friends and lame-o ideas together for the weekend, lavish the production with an lb8.00 budget, and get someone to fall down the stairs with a casio keyboard (the soundtrack) - then slap it on the shelves, for some poor sap (me), to take home in lonely desperation. but here's the clincher - i fast forwarded through most of this, and tossed it to one side, ready for the hammers... until the next night, while watching a darren day horror 'hellbreed' (lb1.99 to take home and keep from a different blockbuster). now this film made 'grim weekend' look like the exorcist, so i slapped grim weekend back on, to catch up on some of the moments listed on the wonderful imdb boards, that viewers claimed were hilarious. sure enough, once i had got over the misery, the pain, and the horror, of realising grim weekend was utter chod on toast, i could enjoy, savour, and downright get down to the funny stuff. and there's a lot of it. check the boards. then check the flick. hell, it might even be worth it. awwwww crap!
