one has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a<br /><br />script existed that made any sense. was the rough cut 3 hours<br /><br />long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives? <br /><br />why would anyone finance this mess? i will say that tom<br /><br />wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can<br /><br />with the dialogue and dramatic (?) situations he is given. but<br /><br />characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity is<br /><br />non-existent, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are (to<br /><br />put it politely) amateurish. not one sleeps is an unfortunate<br /><br />choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyone<br /><br />actually attempt to actually watch this film.
