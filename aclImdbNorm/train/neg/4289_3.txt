the education of little tree is just not as good as it could have been. little tree's education is about things like the circle of life and how you should look at a star to help you. whatever happened to the three r's? readin' 'ritin' and 'rithmetic? when the idiot back talks the teacher at the boarding school place he starts crying and talking to the sky. oh my gosh. sure, the lady was a little harsh, but then james cromwell's character comes and takes him away, leaving the audience thinking that little tree was absolutely right. he should learn to adapt to new discipline. those were the times! talking to a star is not going to change a thing! little tree needs to learn that his adoring guardians are not always right.
