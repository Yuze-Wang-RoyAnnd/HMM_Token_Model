i think i laughed twice. the line where the main character says something about being from the streets. and then i forget the other time i laughed. it was probably in the beginning.<br /><br />this has to be one of the thinnest movies ever. doesn't hollywood realize that this kind of humor is degrading and sad, really. you can only insult yourself so many times.<br /><br />2/10
