i dont know about you, but i've always felt drawn to 'art' cinema. the first 'art' film i managed to get a hold of was peter greenaway's "the cook, the thief, his wife and her lover", which blew my mind and creative spiret into overdrive. the film was the ultimate paradox, both beautiful and grotesque...this is what 'art cinema' was about, exploring intellectual ideas and bringing the visceral to the screen with purpose. life, real life, can be like living in a madhouse, and art expressed shows it for what it is. i love movies of all types, but especially those that both entertain and have something to say, whether i agree with it's stance or no...<br /><br />"8 1/2 women", is a dry, clinical 'comedy' where a father and son gather a harem to fufill their many sexual fantasies. there is only a very brief allusion to fellini in the film, unlike what the previews have suggested. the main focus of the film falls on the 'close' relationship between father and son, brought together after the mothers' death. in the early scenes of the film the fathers' sadness is believable, you can feel his pain. what happens afterwards is plain by greenaway standards, the gathering of the harem, observations on love and death, and flesh displayed for the sake of flesh...one could argue this, but i feel the movie to be shallow and pointless. and the idea that this could be a comedy is perplexing to me. the acting for the most part if fine,...especially good are polly walker and amanda plummer(though poor mandy should put her clothes back on) what the film lacks is a compelling story, and the usual greenaway touches of excess that made his other films so wonderful to watch. <br /><br />while filled with moments of insight, and the occasional taboo, "8 1/2 women" is too cut and paste to be considered art, too bland to considered 'funny', and simply too dull to be considered worthwhile.<br /><br />save your money...i can only recommend this film as a sleeping aid.<br /><br />4 out of 10
