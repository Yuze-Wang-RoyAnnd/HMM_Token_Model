yay!... i think. it's hard to say. it's hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion. this movie is as sterile as a surgeon's scalpel. for a setting, it has a few stone pillars, some stone seats, a couple stone crosses and some stone actors. they have no emotion! the only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is hamlet, and hamlet is a terrificly written piece of literature. the dubbing really wasn't all that bad though. the voices stuck true to the dull, gloomy, dreary, life-sucking atmosphere the movie gave forth. i have seen this version of hamlet on the fabulous mystery science theater 3000 three times, and each of the three times, i was on the brink of turning off the tv, despite it being mst 3k.<br /><br />not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better.
