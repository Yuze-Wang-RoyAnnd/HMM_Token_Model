this film is just another distortion, among many distortions, on the so-called 'sins of consumerism'. please note that 'reverend billy', an actor (bill talen), is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the 'sins of consumerism'. we might want to ask are questions, like: what does 'reverend billy' do for a living? how does he make his money? does he make his living off his 'tax-deductible' organization? how does the internal revenue justify this as a 'tax-deductible' church or organization? <br /><br />everyone knows that christmas is commercialized, but it affords one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be charitable, and allows a significant number of people to spend time with their families, friends, or extended families. everyone is not charitable. everyone does not spend time with their families, friends, or extended families. but, holidays and vacation time give people that chance and opportunity. yes, america does have more than its share of problems--but, with perseverance, americans have and always make it through great difficulties. and, even in times of strife, america has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world. that happens when americans pull together and unite, rather than to separate and divide. yes, there are problems with corporations and monopolies, but it will take americans to bring back the small businesses, along with the ethics to responsibly care for people living in our individual communities. yes, globalization has brought us its share of problems, but it will take americans to bring production back to america. americans and the u.s. government need to learn how to stay on a budget, no matter how large or small it may be, and we must stop our dependence on credit. our over-reliance on credit will make, and keep us poor, from the cradle to the grave. it is important to buy--but, if we buy less, we will rely less on credit. and, if we are able to save, even a small amount of money, we will have money for a rainy day. not to say that, as americans, we will gain an equal share of wealth. wealth is not guaranteed, and has never been guaranteed. but, stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of americans hold most of america's wealth. there is a good proximity that you or i can reach the level of the upper, middle class. and, who knows what can happen from there?!? be positive, work hard--and, at the very least, you and i will be able to reach at least some (if not all) of our dreams. in life, nothing is guaranteed, but we always have that something to reach for. and, if you or i don't have dreams, we might as well be dead. in america, there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams. as individuals, we are a part of the pack, but we always can become the leader of the pack.<br /><br />it has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions, but i pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs, values, and perspectives. but, as far as the distortions expressed, within this film, i do not have any faith in such beliefs, values, and perspectives. i rank this film with a 1 out of 10--but, in all honesty and truth, this film deserves a zero. this film has no integrity, and i cannot recommend it.
