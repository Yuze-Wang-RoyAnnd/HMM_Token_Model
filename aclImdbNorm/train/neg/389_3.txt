i bet you gene simmons and vincent pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in. isn't just too contrived for gene to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword? and big pussy? what the hell was that "look at me, i'm a rat!" double episode crap? all that clich'e mafia banter- come on! the big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit. hmm... this is not reality but staged drama! mark burnett's other show, "survivor" also raised questions for me when johnny fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born.<br /><br />yuk!
