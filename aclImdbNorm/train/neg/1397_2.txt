let's see, here are the "highlights" of the brain machine: 15 establishing shots of a pool and a house; 15 establishing shots of a nondescript office building; 5 countdowns by a bland technician; 7 close-ups of a menacing guard; and a myriad of technical babble to show us this is a high-tech experiment.<br /><br />various posters have commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of 1972 and the release date given on the dvd box of 1977. that's an easy one to explain. this dog simply sat on the shelf unreleased for five years, until someone dusted it off, thinking it fit in perfectly with the post-watergate mood of distrust in government. after seeing the brain machine now, my only wonder is that it ever got released at all!
