hollywood does it again. lots of money, no creativity. i'm sure the writers were on something other than oxygen when they wrote this one. based on the previews, i thought that this would be a funny movie. but if you are not up on the latest stupid pop culture then you'll miss most of the silly humor in this movie. why waste your time. you can sit on a log doing nothing and have more fun than this movie will provide.<br /><br />
