basically this is an overlong, unfunny, action/comedy. first of all i'd like to say that i did enjoy the wayans brother scary movie (1) and the sequel had it's moments. unfortunately white chicks doesn't even deliver half the laughs. <br /><br />the humour in it is absolutely crude. if you like burping, farting, stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this. when it isn't crude it's idiotic. the first 10 minutes of the film gave everything away to me, totally unfunny, simply idiotic. <br /><br />however i watched the whole thing since i was with a friend (otherwise i wouldn't have bothered). the story is undeniably thin, it was in scary movie too but there at least the laughs were quick and constant. i think this is probably one of the main problems too with this film, the laughs don't come quick enough. some jokes are dragged out too long when they're more disgusting than funny in the first place. if you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this. if you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movie, airplane, hotshots 1 + 2. <br /><br />1/10 completely unfunny, thin storyline, a film that seems to be based on one idea (i.e. what if we dressed up as white chicks for a film?) but simply didn't have enough material.
