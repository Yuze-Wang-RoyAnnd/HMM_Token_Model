the statistics in this movie were well researched. there is no doubt about it! al gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got. al gore is certainly quite an actor. he sounds so concerned. but actions speak louder than words! throughout this movie, there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the movie.<br /><br />jimmy carter, unlike al gore, is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk, but walks the walk as well. when carter thought we needed to conserve energy, he turned down the thermostat in the white house and got warm by wearing a sweater.<br /><br />al gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet. how much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create? how much energy does it take to heat gore's swimming pool behind his mansion? it would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used. but if we did, the power company would react to a 50% reduction of energy by calling it a "50% loss in revenue" and recouping their losses by raising the rates by 50%. so "just turning it off" would not be a very good idea.<br /><br />this movie is a veiled appeal to allow big goivernment to take control of everything, in the name of saving planet earth, that is.
