yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. a love biangle, (sorry for the poetical license, but is not a triangle!) an interesting story, unfortunately badly told. the image is sometimes weird, sometimes ok, the picture looks crowded and narrow-sighted. the sound needs more attention (it usually does in romanian movies), the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. the soundtrack is short and is not helping the action. about the acting... sorry but the best actress is the landlady. the others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer. the acting is poetical when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetical. it's a picture for adults, told by the children. bother only if extremely curious.
