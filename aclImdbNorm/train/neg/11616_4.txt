i did not enjoy the film, joshua, at all. perhaps it is because i saw another, much better similar film titled orphan 2 days prior but perhaps it's really just because this film was not very good. i am going with the ladder. sure, the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that doesn't mean the film could not succeed. it could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building, boring, uneventful and really didn't leave me thinking anything more than 'that wasn't very good' when it was all over.<br /><br />at the end, joshua's motivations are revealed. i won't give that away but the reality is that he didn't really accomplish his goals since despite vera farmiga as his mother, abby, disappearing about 3/4th through the movie, all arrows point to her returning home soon. she was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then joshua's father/her husband was accused of tampering with her medication which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally ill but rather was being dosed medically. so.. shouldn't she be coming home soon? won't joshua have failed? won't his mother be living with him and his sister and possibly his father soon? i question the father since his future is left open ended.<br /><br />at the end of the day, i didn't care about the characters. the evil demon child joshua wasn't really scary. the storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring. suspense fell flat every single time. when it was over i couldn't believe i had sat through the whole thing. <br /><br />4/10 just because the acting was good from the parents especially vera farmiga as the mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil 'child' go see orphan. now that's a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie.
