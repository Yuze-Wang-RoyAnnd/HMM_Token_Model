i think this is almost all i need to say. i feel obliged to explain my actions though. i've basically never seen such an armature production, and i mean that in all senses of the word. although he physical camera work, boom mic operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable, unfortunately its not the only areas. <br /><br />unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot, this unfortunately has an awful script, awful acting and worst of all, awful annoying characters. <br /><br />it's a crime that for the every independent film that gets, distribution like haiku tunnel, there's a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths. i don't know who the kornbluth brothers know at sony, but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution. i'm quite bemused as to why they picked this up.<br /><br />the only part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title. however, the reason for that is even a let down. i hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it. i've seen a lot of films in my time, and i'm very forgiving when in the cinema, but this was too much. i'll never forget 'tunnel', for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema. shame it's such a low point.
