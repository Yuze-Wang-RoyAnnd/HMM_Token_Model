i went to this movie expecting a concise movie relating the effect the son of sam had on the society. i didn't expect spike lee to force-feed me more garbage on racial tension, mob-justice, or the inability of the common citizen to make a choice under pressure by peers. lee has presented an extreme opinion.<br /><br />the entire movie could have been more effective if in a 90-min format with more focus, less tangential sub-plots.<br /><br />don't even bother renting the video unless you passionately enjoy spike lee; in such a case, the theatre is worth it. this is not an escapist movie.
