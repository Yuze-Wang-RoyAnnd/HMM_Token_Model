i've given 'k^oh^i jik^o' a low score not because it was a bad movie, but because it doesn't do anything worth praising.<br /><br />i've not seen any of hsiao-hsien hou's work before, but for the uninitiated (me included) 'k^oh^i jik^o' is advertised as a homage to yasujiro ozu. (a japanese director whose last film was way, way in 1962) the film is an extremely sparse work...containing very little dialogue, story, music or emotion.<br /><br />yo hitoto plays 'yoko' a jobless, wandering character who spends her time in her local coffee shop or loosely investigating a taiwanese composer she likes. tadanobu asano plays her friend, who works in a cd shop and occasionally indulges his otaku interest in trains. and that's about all it.<br /><br />we watch as yoko drinks coffee alone...walks around...waits for a train...catches a train...falls asleep on the train. the kind of mundane reality anybody in japan can see on a daily basis. hou captures these ordinary moments of these characters life, but without any meaning to these vignettes it's an entirely pointless film to make or watch.
