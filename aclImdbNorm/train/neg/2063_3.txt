hearing about how hilarious this movie is, i finally rent it at<br /><br />the video store and for 75 minutes maybe i laughed 3 times. this<br /><br />movie, a collection of skits that make fun of television is an<br /><br />incoherrent mess. the jokes fall flat, the humor deals with<br /><br />issues from the 1970's that just aren't relevant anymore, and<br /><br />the jokes go on way too long (almost like the new snl skits the<br /><br />past few years). yeah, chevy chase is in this but maybe of all<br /><br />about 1 or 2 minutes. i liked the fact that this was very<br /><br />raunchy and had nudity galore but couldn't it be funny? do<br /><br />yourself a favor and rent kentucky fried movie which is a far<br /><br />superior film made in the
