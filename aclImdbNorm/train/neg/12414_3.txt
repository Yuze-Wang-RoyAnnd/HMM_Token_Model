jennifer jason leigh and mare winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings, but only winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role. leigh, playing bar-band singer and alcoholic sadie flood, constantly leans on older sis georgia, an acclaimed folk singer in the joni mitchell mold. perhaps due to her double duties as co-producer on the film, leigh seems to have boxed herself into a corner: she isn't credible as a singer and, even if this is intentional, gives herself far too much screen-time at the microphone. probably hoping for a tour-de-force, leigh is wire-drawn and nervous and jagged; however, we simply do not see any talent within this character (leigh is obviously a solid actress, but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her). if sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal, we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the (small) breaks that she does. as it is, the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim. director ulu grosbard crafts a few intense dramatic sequences, and the editing at the finale juxtaposes sadie's bar performance with georgia's sold-out arena show--both singing the same song--and it's a sadly nuanced moment...but really, what's the point? *1/2 from ****
