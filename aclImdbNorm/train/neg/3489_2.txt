this was my first, and probably the last angelopoulos movie. i was eager to get into it, as it featured mastroianni, one of my favorite actors and was a film by theo, of whom i've heard a lot. the opening was promising, a long shot over a jeep of soldiers across the albanian-greek border. ok! but that was all. nothing left. the movie had big holes and i don't know which to mention first. the main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman. during a long walk. it's like a 15 minutes monologue, killing the action and viewers patience, nothing happening on screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, apart this old lady telling a story. all that is presumed to be shown through action, was simply told to the camera by the old lady. in a moment, the equippe of tv was heading to the bar. they turn the corner and immediately the winter begins! probably, shot in different days, continuity leaked. a lot of problems with the story-telling, it went from absurd to irrational never sticking to a style, making the viewer asking questions that never got answers. poor mastroianni, given a role which lacked integrity or charm. on the other hand, as many greeks or albanians or balcan people would agree with, the movies showed lot of historic, ethnic, or politically incorrectness, just for the sake of making a movie about "humanity" as a red in another review. a lot more to say, but no time to lose on a poor movie, which was not movie at all, but lunacies of a person impressed on film and paid with state money.
