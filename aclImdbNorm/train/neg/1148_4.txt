pedantic, overlong fabrication which attempts to chronicle the birth of the federal bureau of investigations. begins quite promisingly, with a still-relevant probe into an airplane explosion, however the melodrama involving james stewart and wife vera miles just gets in the way (miles had a habit of playing tepid wives under duress, and her frayed nerves arrive here right on schedule). esteemed director mervyn leroy helmed this adaptation of don whitehead's book, but despite the talent involved, the picture fails to make much of an impression. best performance is turned in by murray hamilton as stewart's partner, however most of the dialogue is ludicrous and the dogged pacing causes the movie to seem twice as long as it is. *1/2 from ****
