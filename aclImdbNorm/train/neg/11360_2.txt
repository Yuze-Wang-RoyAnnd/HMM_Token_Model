okay, so, someone, somewhere, a few years ago, thought it would be a good idea to make a 3d imax movie about some flies stowing away aboard the apollo 11 and going to the moon. so they did. someone, somewhere, was an idiot.<br /><br />i want to give the artists props for doing their homework on the hardware. as far as i can tell, the rockets and the launch hardware were bang on. the graphics in general were pretty good - the rocket launch gave me chills, like a good rocket launch always does (my popular mechanics flying-car gearhead blood still runs strong) and the 3d was pretty effective. the cg wasn't pixar-quality, but it was generally good. the flies were kinda mediocre anthropomorphics, with some half-assed late-60s characters thrown in for colour (hippie flies, african-american flies with giant afros and black shades, etc.) and the maggots looked more like grubs with human baby heads (although they made suitably gross squelching noises).<br /><br />the scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework, relying on offensive and outdated clich'es (60s gender politics including mostly-useless female characters, racial stereotypes, evil russians, a fat fly who only wants to eat, grade-two level gross-out humour). in a movie aimed for imax, they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel - they didn't get their physics right (zero-g in the lunar module during landing burn? please.) they couldn't even be bothered to read the original radio transcripts between houston and the astronauts, all of which is in the public domain; instead they wrote their own dialogue, which sounds like crap.<br /><br />but we liked the maggots.<br /><br />so they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots. uh, yay. 1.5/5.
