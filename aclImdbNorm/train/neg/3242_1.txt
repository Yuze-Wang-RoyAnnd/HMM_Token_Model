here's a review for people like me. this movie sucks from beginning to end. i threw popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining myself a la msf2000. the plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart. the lead falls for a con man and it doesn't occur to her that she might get conned????? and she's rich???? and she's a famous psychologist????? come on, people. she enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her??? that was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half-witted movie viewers. rain man would have been insulted. i also admit that i despise mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat-eaters, war-starters, and fur-wearers. my hatred is so complete that it defies logic. but i'll give it a shot. that it's not supposed to sound real is fine. i don't care. it's that everyone talks the same. mamet can't create characters; all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actors. no wonder his actors are so wooden. they're confused about everyone being the same character. (however, his later films do improve.)
