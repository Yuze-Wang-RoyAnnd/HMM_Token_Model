this movie is so bad, you almost feel contaminated by it. actually, there is a strong sense of relief when it's over, relief that you can now put the cassette back in the rewinder and rush this back to the video rental store before it contaminates the rest of your video collection. i jokingly suggested when we rented it that it looked like the kind of film where william hurt would "phone in" his performance. i meant that he would not be trying very hard. but lo and behold, in a huge number of scenes in this film, bill hurt is actually on the phone! our realization of this irony was the only pleasure we derived from this confusing mess. the cinematography and editing are murky and befuddled, the story is chaotic, and the soundtrack is barely audible. there is a very slight resemblance to "falling down", but that film had a boldly disturbing story-line, great writing and acting, and an engaging soundtrack. "contaminated man" is just some kind of broken down old european tourist trap, and watching it is like driving along some unfamiliar back road in an unknown country where you don't speak the language in a steady rain just after nightfall as the windshield keeps fogging up. you get the picture? don't get this one.
