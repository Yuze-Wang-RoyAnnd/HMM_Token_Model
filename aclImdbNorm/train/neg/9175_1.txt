this is about the worst movie i have ever seen. this movie does match the quality of such movies as "they" & "cabin fever", but even those had name actors where this one fell short. the "eye candy" of this movie looked to be a 50 woman with a bad face lift. (just an example of the quality). i would have rated this movie in the negative if possible. ladies i have to tell you that the men were not bad to look at, but not much either. if you were planning on going to see this movie i would strongly recommend saving your money.
