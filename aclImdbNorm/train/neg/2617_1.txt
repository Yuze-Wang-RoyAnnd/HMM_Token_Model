this film was pure pain. sitting in the theater for x-amount of minutes, i was wondering when the film was going to start. all the setups were in place; typical love story, characters have to overcome their short-givings, villain has to emerge, but none of it ever initiated. by the time these things happened, i was already bored stiff and the devices were completely ineffective. in scenes that required immense tension and buildup, it felt like necessary frames were cut. kid's stuff does not have to be this way. children's films can be as riveting and engaging as adult ones. the excuse, "hey , its for kids," is bull. i'll take "sword in the stone" any day. this was terrible. i'm getting the feeling that disney will put out anything these days. and as for the kids, the 10-year i saw this with will agree...pure trash.
