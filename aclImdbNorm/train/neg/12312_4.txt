for 50 years after world war 2 the united states was in a state where key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests. at the same time, because of the draft and wars, everyone in society had served, or was connected to someone who had.<br /><br />this allowed for a minigenre based on the notion of american cleverness in the midst of an inflexible military machine. sometimes that machine was non-us military, for example in prisoner of war situations. once removed are stories in other machines: science fiction and corporate, but they always reference this military genre, and indeed the testosterone shots of action even reference their comic sibling.<br /><br />you can trace it, i think, perhaps starting in the comic, meaning amrican, sections of "the great escape," which immediately spawned teevee offspring in "gomer pyle" and "hogan's heros." then a second wave triggered by "catch 22" and "mash," both of which had been real life, then books, then movies, and in the mash case, then teevee.<br /><br />but before all that, there was the "phil silvers show," about a sergeant bilko and this followed from "mister roberts." a happy con man, who only committed harmless crimes, and then only as response to an overly crude system which attempted to limit his life. this was in the day when teevee shows mattered. you absorbed them instead of merely carrying them to work to chatter about. it wasn't particularly clever in any way, except in finding that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom. <br /><br />its one large zone where americans worked out how they think about forgivable, even endearing lies in a military context, a zone that has been appropriated by one of our political parties here.<br /><br />because its big, it sometimes pays off in laughs. "stripes" was pretty darn funny i thought. it had the twist of the misfits actually defeating serious foes, sort of folding in some "dirty dozen." and sexual adventure.<br /><br />now this, well before the cultural wars escalated. it tries to touch that sweet spot, like other remakes that manhandled steve martin. it is so unfunny, you actually root for the army to be the stronger player. yet another way to track how societies work out the handles on military power.<br /><br />ted's evaluation -- 1 of 3: you can find something better to do with this part of your life.
