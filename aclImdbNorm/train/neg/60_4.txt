i like goldie hawn and wanted another one of her films, so when i saw protocol for $5.50 at walmart i purchased it. although mildly amusing, the film never really hits it a stride. some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purpose.<br /><br />then, of course, there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as i'm concerned. i don't think this scene added to the movie at all. i don't like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written by some '60's burn out especially!<br /><br />in the end, although i'm glad to possess another hawn movie, i'm not sure it was really worth the money i paid for it!
