simply put, this is the worst movie since "police academy: mission to moscow" (if you liked that movie you will probably like this one).<br /><br />what were they thinking ? some ideas should stay just that, an idea. the fact that this idea could itself to film should be a criminal offense.<br /><br />what was so bad about it i hear you ask. one word ... everything.<br /><br />cost to hire: $4.50 cost in time to watch: 89 minutes<br /><br />i want a refund on both!
