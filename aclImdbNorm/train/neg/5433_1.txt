noel coward,a witty and urbane man,was friends with louis mountbatten.mr coward,a long-time admirer of all things naval,was commissioned to write a story loosely based on the loss of mountbatten's ship.in a peculiarly british way it was considered that a film about the royal navy losing an encounter at sea would be good propaganda.it was also considered a good idea to have mr coward play the part of the ship's captain.amang the many qualities needed to command a fighting ship,the ability to speak in a very clipped voice and sing sophisticated "point" songs does not come very high up the list at admiralty house,or at least one would hope not.a captain must earn and retain the respect of the wardroom and the lower deck alike. mr coward might have had the respect of the gentlemen of the chorus at drury lane and binkie beaumont might have been terrified of him but his ability to tame,mould and direct a ship's crew in wartime must be brought into question.he folds himself languorously around the bridge,patronising the other ranks and barking orders at the officers,he only needed a silk dressing gown and a cigarette holder to seem right at home. much is made of the "warship as a microcosm of british society"theme,and the crew largely comprises of the usual cheery cockneys,canny northerners etc.without whom no war can be fought.they spend most of their time on board smoking,moaning about lord haw haw and getting blown up. never mind,there's plenty more where they came from.once ashore they go straight to the pub where they spend most of their time smoking,moaning about lord haw haw and getting blown up .by contrast mr coward lives in a dream cottage with a rose covered door somewhere very quiet with very little chance of getting blown up.he,his lady wife and their two rosy cheeked cherubs converse in ludicrously convoluted tones and said lady wife spends much of her time knitting things for the poor unfortunates who comprise his crew and who she refers to by their surnames.that nice young master johnny mills has a prominent role as a completely unbelievable lower deck type who worships mr coward in much the same way as a thrashed dog will worship its master.he marries his girlfriend after kissing her on the cheek,presumably on the grounds that she might be pregnant after such unfettered passion. so yes,we do have a microcosm of british society here,but perhaps not in the way the makers of "in which we serve" intended. at the end mr coward gets one last chance to patronise his men as the few survivors shuffle past him,"goodbye edwards,it was a privilege to sail with you"he enunciates as if he was reciting "how now brown cow". it may have been david lean's feature debut,but the hand of noel coward looms large right across this picture.he was a funny and clever man,better suited to writing waspish plays about poor little rich girls and boys interspersed with the occasional wry song.he had a talent to amuse,no doubt,but he could neither write nor speak convincing dialogue. being noel coward was a full-time job,he had no time to be a real person.
