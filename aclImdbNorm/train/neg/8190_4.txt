my take: a tired formula christmas comedy. the laughs are tired and the talents behind it seem to be too.<br /><br />i love the holidays as much as the next guy (even if i often have a bad case of the holiday blues), but it seems it's just being a dumping ground for a bunch of holiday comedies that would be bad movies on any day of the year, but that doesn't make them any less painful during the season. as if we already had enough santa clause movies (three and *gulp* still counting), who wants to see a movie about his brother? in a plot that would be at home with disney's santa clause franchise (save the occasionally crude humor and santa's "little" helper wearing a short skirt), fred claus is a one-joke premise that goes on for 116 minutes. sure, jolly ol' saint nick has a brother, but where does it go from there? <br /><br />it's a shame really. fred claus is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow, but it would have been so much better than this. vince vaughn is your typical snob, but we are led to believe he's really the long lost brother of the never-aging santa (paul giamatti), who invites his good ol' brother to visit. mrs. claus (miranda richardson) is reluctant, and worse, an efficiency expert (kevin spacey) has come to keep a watchful eye on father christmas, and his this close to being shut down. hah! and guess who plays santa's mother! kathy bates of course. elizabeth banks is santa's helper charlene, john michael higgins is one of the elves, and rachel wiesz plays fred's girlfriend! si don't know if i'd praise the casting or to bash it. here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they're given way too little to work with.<br /><br />as for humor, the best that fred claus could possibly come up with is santa's brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a dj elf. i have to admit i had a few giggles involving fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers (where he is joined by stephen baldwin, roger clinton and frank stallone), but the giggles begin and end there. worse still, the movie even succumbs into sentimentality that's supposed to make us "feel good" and teach us a lesson about "what christmas really means". apparently, what christmas means to hollywood is getting as much of our leftover christmas shopping money as they can.<br /><br />rating: ** out of 5.
