disappointing and irritating. the screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clich'es in a disjointed fashion. character is not explored in depth. these are puppets plunked down in a plot he openly confesses needed a dramatic element, the mother's affair with her daughter's lover. <br /><br />anne reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines, such standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye. the script portrays darren (daniel craig) as a dr. jekyll/mr. hyde without any hints about why, except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene. <br /><br />a mature writer could have done so much more with this topic.
