i mistakenly kept myself awake late last night watching this thing. about the only thing i could say good about this horrid film is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie. no proper character development, wait, i'm not even sure they were characters. set-ups were hokey and inane, and the overuse of split screens was wasted since sometimes they couldn't even synchronize with alternate shots. if i could give this a zero or minus rating i would. sadly, it isn't even worth the time for a few laughs.<br /><br /> it's just a sad example of money wasted by hollywood, and now i waste my time even thinking about it.
