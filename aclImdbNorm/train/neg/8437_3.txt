as a big fan of david mamet's films and plays, especially his first film house of games that also starred joe mantegna, i was expecting great things from this film. instead, i found myself annoyed by the film's superficiality and lack of credibility. racial slurs are thrown about without any feeling or meaning behind them, in the hopes of setting up a racial tension that for me never materialized. identity is totally reevaluated and men become "heroes" for no apparent reason. because of his oaths taken as a cop, the lead character adamantly refuses to perform one relatively small action that would harm no one and could possibly save lives, and yet performs another action which is very violent and very illegal, but then still refuses the minor action. in addition, a highly unbelievable subplot involving a man who has killed his family is introduced just for the sake of a plot point that was all but advertised with skywriting, and the cop's reaction to that occurrence stretch credulity way beyond all reasonable limits. needless to say, after expecting another exciting thriller from david mamet, i was extremely disappointed to say the least. 3 out of 10.
