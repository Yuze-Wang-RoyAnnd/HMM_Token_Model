welcome to movie 17 on the chilling classics 50 pack. where we'll see, that's right. another movie that makes absolutely no sense. seriously, this movie had me so confused at the end, i thought i was rewatching "at dawn they sleep." the plot seems simple enough....well that is until 3 seconds into the movie where a girl supposedly killed a cat and then...um.. explodes? i have no idea what happened. and that was before the title screen. that's really sad when i can't even tell what happened in the first 3 minutes.<br /><br />anyway it stars a photographer with a big mustache who finds this girl after dumping his other girlfriend on the way to take pictures of something somewhere. so we get there but not before somebody steals their jeep to drive it 200 feet out of the way towards a town. suspicious? nah. so they decide to stay at this deserted village with one old lady. and then blah blah stuff happens and blah blah talking. the guy with the mustache goes out in the fog for some reason even though the old lady tells him not to. he gets lost and then finds his way back.<br /><br />oh, i forgot to mention this is all after an incredibly pointless 20 minutes of them staying in the house of a guy who looks like that buggy eyed guy from casablanca. then they leave. there's really no point to this scene. it's really just padding. if you cut it out no one would have noticed or cared.<br /><br />but sadly, that was actually the best part of the movie. wait. let me rephrase that. really sadly that was the best part of the movie. because the rest is so confusing that i had to look on imdb to find out what happened. but of course no one else knows so i'm sol. <br /><br />seriously, the last 30 minutes of the movie were some of the most mindscrewing moments i've ever seen on film. they dressed her up in a dress, he gets kidnapped, then released, he runs back to the house, then at the end the witches are in the house and it ends? seriously. i have hardly ever been so confused in a movie. i mean, as bad as movies such as "war of the robots" are, at least they make sense. this movie doesn't even make the attempt to be coherent. the ending was as confusing as the end of "at dawn they sleep" and the plot was much more boring. this movie gets a 1 just for its sheer "i have no idea what happened in this movie"ness. "witches mountain" gets 1 confused movie watcher out of 10.
