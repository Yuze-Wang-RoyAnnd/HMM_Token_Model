it is nice to see the likes of oliver stone, brian depalma, al pacino, and even michelle pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage. it is nice to see people so rich and 'successful' wasting their time on one of the most forgettable, trite, and pathetic pieces of film-making of all time. this movie represents the worst of hollywood.<br /><br />what is this? is it based on a true story. well, they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off usa today. but then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the american drug subculture; kind of like rocky on cocaine. is it a movie about cuba or cubans? for the life of me i don't believe there is a single cuban in this movie. the accents are totally fake, and scene with antonio's mother looks like a poster for midwest american values. the whole scene looks like something out of the dick van dyke show. is this movie about miami? it looks more like l.a. transposed in florida. afterall, a palm tree is a palm tree. is this a romance novel. the relationship between pacino and pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo, and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other. is this a drug movie? well, no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned. the behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water. admittedly, the acting is terrible.<br /><br />let's get to the rest. the music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a lawrence welk show. i think i heard a polka? the camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective. clearly, the photography budget was excessive. the sound is bleached in a number of spots, and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse. the writing is appalling. this is one of those movies were the script writes itself. you are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next, each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks.<br /><br />so i am going to ask, is this even a movie? it could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours. but at least a drama series has some kind of focus. maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together. whatever it is, movie or not, it is a piece of crap.
