lets start off by saying that "jawani diwani" is just a pathetic movie. i agree with the last person who said "i missed the joyride". lol. <br /><br />the jokes were just terrible. performances were average. something went terribly wrong with the film. emraan totally deserved something better. all celina jaitley did was expose. hrishitta bhatt was ok. emraan hashmi was ok too.<br /><br />mann (emraan hashmi)is a desperate guy who wants to become famous. therefore, he uses radha and pretends he loves her, only because her father is a music director and could help him become famous (since, the father obeys everything his daughter says). one day, mann and his friends go to goa to have some fun. there he meets roma (celina jaitley) and totally falls for her looks and tries to flirt with her bla bla bla. <br /><br />then, that night roma cannot open the door to her room, and mann decides to help her. seeing that he cannot as well, roma goes to ask for help. while she is gone, mann is able to open the door and decides to come inside and sits on her bed bla bla bla. roma comes in and they have a one night stand. however, in that one night- stand roma falls in love with him. that morning, they spot the underworld don (mahesh)who sees it all. the don loves roma and couldn't stand what he saw. he orders them to get married, and being frightened, mann obeys the order and merry's roma. then, their marriage news ends up in the newspaper. mann is later finds out that he loves roma after they do a music video together. he is now trapped between love and fame. bla bla bla.<br /><br />the movie is horrible. the songs "sini ne sini ne" is fantastic the remix version is even better. "dil diwana" is also great. the title track is also awesome. guys, avoid watching this movie.
