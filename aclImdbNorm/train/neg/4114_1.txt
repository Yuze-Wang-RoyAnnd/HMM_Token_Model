there are some great philosophical questions. what is the purpose of life? what happens when we die? and why do they make movies this bad??? the premise is absurd. thre acting is one dimensional. the special effects are overdone. and the movie is one unending gun battle among some of the lousiest shots hollywood ever produced. but then, if they had been good shots, everybody would have been dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movie. too bad it didn't happen that way. tempted to turn it off several times, i stuck with it to see just how bad it could get. glad i did because (spoiler?) the last line is the crowning stupidity of the whole dopey, dismal scenario.it is not even worthy of second feature status at a third rate drive-in in off season. apart from the general awfulness of the film, i worry deeply about its impact on young audiences. the americans crank out crap like this and then wonder why events like columbine happen. this is truly banal cinema on a brobdingnagian scale!
