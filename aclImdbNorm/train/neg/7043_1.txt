i was prepared to laugh throughout this movie like a mystery science theater experiment, but it was just boring. it appears that the producers had many biker enthusiast friends, and from there casually decided to make a movie. <br /><br />it is frequently unwatchable. lots of footage of the bikers riding on a dirt road, with the same music played repeatedly. unfortunately, renee harmon is barely in the movie. harmon probably would have livened things up. perhaps she had other commitments the day this was filmed.<br /><br />of course, the bikers terrorize a small town. fights, murder, a cowardly cop, a goofy mechanic, etc. one of the bikers always wears a football helmet, a weak attempt to distinguish him from all the other outlaws.<br /><br />the script has nothing to offer. one scene features a biker assaulting a woman, yelling in the lady's face "you're all the same! you're all the same!". we come back to the scene a minute later and he again declares "you're all the same!". couldn't the writer think of something more creative to say??<br /><br />at the end the good guys have killed the bad guys. we also learn that the wedding between middle-aged mechanic joe and young susie has been canceled. susie is going away to college, and we abruptly learn that joe's wedding is still on (but with a different bride). end.
