i really tried to like this movie. it deals with an important problem in any society: sex addiction.<br /><br />in this story we learn that you can lose everything when you're addicted to sex. in this case, our main character and hero, for having non-stop sex with all kinds of women (crazy, kinky, neurotic) puts in jeopardy his marriage, job, and even his life.<br /><br />the production values are terrible; mainly the acting. oh, you won't enjoy any of the sex scenes, most of them are done in very poor taste and you might think you're watching a home made flick.<br /><br />second, the plot is just non sense. how could such a smart and beautiful wife stand all the nasty stuff from the husband? how could she believe him?! the threesome situation is priceless and will make you chuckle for a while.<br /><br />also, the scene with the black movie theater attendant is just pointless and will leave you thinking "wtf?". <br /><br />scenes like those you will find plenty. <br /><br />avoid this movie. please, avoid it; it's not soft core, it's not a documental, it's not a dramatic feature. it's a pretentious effort form a so called documentary director or whatever.<br /><br />only mrs. kinski's legs on display are worth the watch. i caught it on hbo and i'm glad i didn't spend my money on it. but those 90 minutes of my life won't come back.
