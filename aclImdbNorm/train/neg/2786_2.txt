okay, i'm not going to critique this film in depth. i note the many elogious reviews in advance of me, and as i generally like maria de medeiros, i have been long hesitant to make a disparaging comment - and in such fashion nearly a year has passed. but each time i see that dvd on my shelf, i sense an inner groan. anyway, let the elogious voices override me! but for other cinephiles like me - beware.<br /><br />expressed in simplest and gentlest terms, here's my stance:<br /><br />the political turmoil and overthrow providing the backdrop for this film also served as a backdrop for a certain period of my life - via newspapers i read daily in my local middle-european pub. at that time, i followed the newsreports, but never fully grasped what the heck was transpiring. the reporters tended to report either in non-partisan terms, or with a conservatism which frowned upon any groups disturbing the peace or fomenting rebellion against the establishment. those were times when other winds of unrest swirled through paris, berlin, prague, and various places in the u.s., all of whose issues i understand clearly at the time - but dictatorship or not, my papers tended to treat the govermentment of portugal simply as the establishment - not as a well-fleshed out "evil empire", to use flippant star war terms.<br /><br />so, week after week, i read of disturbances, but never found an intelligent editorial that might provide the history behind them, or evaluate the practices and social-economic impacts of the dictatorship, etc.<br /><br />so, in purchasing this film, i had at least two hopes: to finally understand the details leading up to the social unrest, and to enjoy a well-conceived drama. this film gave me neither.<br /><br />the film presupposes that viewers already have ample knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical facts. and the drama - well, as i said, i want to encourage maria de medeiros and the portugues film industry, but - it was trite and shallow.<br /><br />i obtained my copy of the dvd from france - "selection official cannes 2000 - un certain regard". the box shows smiling clean-shaven actors, the lead giving the victory sign in a fashion that reminds me more of the playboy bunny. after seeing the work, i wondered what the french could have thought of it - though as a shallow piece of "cinema verite'" with sensitive ethnic content, i can understand their natural inclination to praise it for its "honesty" but...<br /><br />look at the back of the box: "un regard chaleuruex sur la revolution" - a warm regard? try describing allende's overthrown and murder with a a "warm regard"! try it with czechoslovakia in 1968! try it with the whole line-up of overthrows, and civil rebellions!<br /><br />another review: maria de medeiros a renoue' avec son pays, son enfance et son histoire." rubbish, rubbish, rubbish! at least for me.<br /><br />i love portugal. in all of europe, lisbon, barcelona and prague are my favorite cities. but my love for a city and a country doesn't flesh out a vacuous film. i'll hang on to my ancient vhs tapes of capas negras and a cancao de lisboa - meanwhile, i'm stuck with a zone 2 by the above title that might as well go in the trash.
