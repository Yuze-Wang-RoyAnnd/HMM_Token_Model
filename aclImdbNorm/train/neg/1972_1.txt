this really doesn't do the blues justice. it starts out badly with images from the voyager probe and blind willie mctell (or was it blind lemon jefferson? someone blind anyway) apparently narrating from outer space (?) and telling us the life stories of various blues musicians. corny as it is, this might be the visually most interesting part of this documentary. afterwards the only thing to see is actors incompetently mouthing the classic tunes, filmed in fake 20s black and white intercut with the likes of beck and shemekia copeland raping the same songs afterwards. this is a good device to show us why the old blues greats were really so great, but it doesn't make for compelling viewing. there is hardly anything in here that could justify making it a film and not a radio play. nobody should be forced to see these badly done reenactments. it's a shame for wenders, scorsese and especially for the blues. avoid at all costs.
