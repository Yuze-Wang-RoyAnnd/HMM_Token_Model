cabin fever is the first feature film directed by eli roth.roth and randy pearlstein co wrote the script from a story by roth.this a zombie film,which owes a lot to george romero and his earlier "living dead movies",and to the original texas chainsaw massacrenot to mention sam ramie's "evil dead".there is nothing original here,and the story is not compelling.the acting is about par with this genre,it's just that the story fails.we have pretty much seen this movie before and better made.having said that,after having achieved commercial, if not artistic success from this movie,roth decided he was a director and came out with the abysmally atrocious,mean spirited,pointless(though much more ambitious)crap fest hostel.roth should have quit while he was behind.cabin fever is not a good film,however compared to hostel it is a work of art.i hope somebody (preferably a psychiatrist)convinces this guy that film-making is the wrong career choice.as for cabin fever,a weak 3/10 for not being as abysmal as hostel.
