what's to like about this movie???<br /><br />it is in colour! <br /><br />it has some impressive underwater photography! <br /><br />it has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times! <br /><br />so 3 out of 10! <br /><br />sometimes the music is speeded up! especially when the shark or the baddies are about to move in! <br /><br />sometimes it is slowed! as if to convey to the audience it's about to be time for sympathy! <br /><br />as another one bites the dust! as if in a "spagetti western" this has much similarity to! <br /><br />it's not that the italians can't produce quality productions! there was a series of tv movies with a heading like "octopus" numbered about 1 to 7, screened on sbs tv in australia in the 1990s about mafia-type conflicts! and they were excellent! but alas, you won't find it here!!!<br /><br />i assumed it was made about 1960s! sadly it was 20 years out of date, as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end! <br /><br />then there was the razor-sharp bite of the speedy shark that makes for a red dust repeatedly emerging in the bluish waters! <br /><br />amidst it all, either in bar-room brawl or in observing the latest sea-side bloody demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark, the mate of the hero looks on through his glasses of little concern, as if he too was bored in his relentless role amidst a lack of much evidence of plot or anyone's character development! <br /><br />at least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly, for his ex-wife! <br /><br />but of course, even if the music fails to awaken our realisation, we have the sinister sound in the baddies' voices, as if to nudge us that another dark deed is about to emerge! <br /><br />and near the end, someone thought of a twist! just when we thought it was all totally predictable! but stay tuned, folks, for you may find another twist! if you are watching closely! to, more or less, warm your heart! <br /><br />follow the advice of the hero, and have a few beers along the way! it'll make your viewing of "night of the sharks" more enjoyable! <br /><br />then you'll be ready for something like a "007" movie to ease your way back into reality when this is over!!!
