i was excited to view a catalu~na's film in the berlin's competition. but after the presentation i was total disappointed and furious. too much blood, too much time, too much themes for nothing. the spanish civil war, like every war, was horrible. the revenge, a very human behavior, not pretty at all, is shown in uncountable films and plays, as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in spain about catholicism . but what mr villaronga try, is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the film's history. it is really a pity to see angela molina in this movie. i advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film.
