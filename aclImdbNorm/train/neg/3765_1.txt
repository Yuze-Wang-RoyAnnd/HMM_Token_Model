i have always been interested in anything about bigfoot, so when i was browsing around looking for a movie to rent, this one caught my eye. it was the worst $4.50 i've ever spent and i want my money back! please don't waste your money on this!! this was one of the cheapest movies i've ever seen. the entire movie was so incredibly boring and i found myself rolling my eyes a lot and i didn't even watch it all the way through. i just got fed up with it. the acting was horrible, the effects were horrible, everything was just really bad and tasteless. it all added up to be a really bad, boring movie and total waste of time and money. i hope that one day they'll make a good movie about sasquatch, but until then, i'll have to sit through countless cheap duds like this one to find the real masterpiece.
