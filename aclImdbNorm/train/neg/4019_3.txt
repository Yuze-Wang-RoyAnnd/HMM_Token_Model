dakota (1988) was another early lou diamond phillips starring vehicle. this film is similar to the later released film harley. there are a few differences but they're both the same. i don't know which one came first. i guess it'll remain one of the mysteries of life. but they both are troubled "kids" who are trying to turn there lives around. instead of bikes this one involves horses. they're basically the same movie and they're both cheesy as hell. if you're a serious l.d.p. fan then i recommend that you watch them both. you get some extreme mugging and posturing from l.d.p. if you're game then go for it.<br /><br />not recommended, except for l.d.p. fans!!!
