four best friends young male chauvinist pigs (with the emphasis on pigs) meet weekly at a nyc diner to recount their dating sexploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. peet is the common denominator who dates the three bachelors in the group which leads to conflict and the inevitable "whipping". although the film's premise has potential and there are some funny moments to be had, overall the flick doesn't work especially in the end where the girls are made to appear no better than the guys which runs contrary to the crux of the story. one of those one-man band flix with a dozen producers, "whipped" is likely to be enjoyed only by the kind of young males who think "the man show" is emmy material.
