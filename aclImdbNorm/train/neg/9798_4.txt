15 years ago, power rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations, especially that of the youth. when i was a 3-year-old kid living in the philippines, i would watch this show every friday on abs-cbn (channel 2 over there). when the movie came out in 1995, it was all shock and awe to me when i watched it with my dad and 2 uncles. my grandparents even sent me a "balikbayan" box full of power rangers stuff (including the easy-to-build megazord figure and the stuffed toys of the rangers). i even played the video games, and loved only one of them ("mmpr: fighting edition"), which was really sad. anyway, it was the show that set a stepping stone on my interest on robot series (especially anime mech series like "gundam") now that i'm 18, i'd like to think this show is pretty cheesy to me now. to prove this, i took a trip down memory lane by buying a 2-set dvd collection with "mmpr: the movie" and "turbo: a power rangers movie" and watched both of them. i was like, "ugh. how awful. just another junk in the attic for me." for all of you people of my generation, this is not a show that you'd want to watch over and over again. i'm not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life, but occasionally is not a bad thing now, is it? instead of "power rangers", i'd recommend something like "mobile fighter g gundam" (highly recommended), "ninja senshi tobikage" (aka ninja robots), or even the original sentai shows that were the basis of "power rangers."
