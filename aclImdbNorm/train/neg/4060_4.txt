the cat o'nine tails (il gatto a nove code) <br /><br />aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (cromoscope)<br /><br />sound format: mono<br /><br />(35mm and 70mm release prints)<br /><br />a blind ex-journalist (karl malden) overhears a blackmail plot outside a genetics research laboratory and later teams up with a fellow reporter (james franciscus) to investigate a series of murders at the lab, unwittingly placing their own loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic killer.<br /><br />rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut the bird with the crystal plumage (1969), dario argento conceived the cat o'nine tails as a giallo-thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner, toplining celebrated hollywood actor karl malden - fresh from his appearance in patton (1969) - and rising star franciscus (the valley of gwangi). sadly, the resulting film - which the ads claimed was 'nine times more suspenseful' than "bird" - is a disappointing follow-up, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too plodding and aimless for general consumption.<br /><br />malden and franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer enrico menczer (the dead are alive) uses the wide cromoscope frame to convey the hi-tech world in which argento's dark-hearted scenario unfolds, but the subplot involving euro starlet catherine spaak (the libertine) as franciscus' romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding. highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station (edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart franco fraticelli), and a nocturnal episode in which malden and franciscus seek an important clue inside a mouldering tomb and fall prey to the killer's devious machinations. but despite these flashes of brilliance, the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next, simmering gently without ever really coming to the boil. it's no surprise that "cat" failed to emulate the runaway success of "bird" when released in 1971.<br /><br />(english version)
