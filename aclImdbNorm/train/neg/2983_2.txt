zombi 3 starts as a group of heavily armed men steal a experimental chemical developed to reanimate the dead, while trying to escape the man is shot at & the metal container holding the chemical is breached. the man gets some of the green chemical on a wound on his hand which soon after turns him into a flesh eating cannibalistic zombie. within hours the surrounding area is crawling with the flesh easting undead on the look out for fresh victims, kenny (deran sarafian) & his army buddies find themselves in big trouble as they stop to help patricia (beatrice ring) & her friend lia (deborah bergammi) who has been pecked by zombie birds (!). general morton is in charge of the situation & has to stop the zombie plague from spread throughout the whole world! but will he & his men succeed?<br /><br />this italian produced film was to be directed by italian zombie gore film auteur lucio fulci but the story goes he suffered a stroke & therefore couldn't finish the film so producer franco gaudenzi asked second unit director bruno mattei & writer claudio fragasso to step in & complete the film. apparently mattei & fragasso did more than just finish it they actually disregarded a lot of the footage fulci shot & added a lot of their own & zombi 3 ended up as nearly a straight 50/50 split. the script by fragasso is an absolute mess, none of it is well thought out & is just as stupid as it gets. the scenes of zombie birds attacking people are not only technically inept but the whole idea is just absurd. the zombies themselves have no consistency whatsoever, look at the scene where patricia is on the bridge & the zombies are slow as they shuffle along but then look at the scene earlier on where she was attacked by the zombie with the machete because that one runs around like it's on steroids, then for no reasonable explanation about 10 minutes before the film finishes the zombies suddenly develop the ability to speak which also looks daft. there are so many things wrong with zombi 3, scene after scene of terribly thought out & ineptly directed action, awful character's & really dull broken english dialogue which doesn't make sense half the time. then there's the embarrassing scene where the zombie head inside the fridge suddenly develops the ability to fly through the air & bite someones neck, the scene when the guy's in white contamination suits at the end are about to kill kenny & roger but instead of using their automatic rifles they decide to try & kill them by hand, even when kenny picks up a gun himself they still refuse to use their rifles & when kenny starts to shoot them all they still refuse to use their rifles & it's one of the most ineptly handled scenes ever put to film & then there's the end where kenny takes off in the helicopter but can't rest it down on the ground for literally a few seconds to pick his buddy up & then a load of zombies suddenly spring up from under some piles of grass, what? since when did zombies hide themselves yet alone under piles of grass? this all may sound 'fun' but believe me it's not, it's a really bad film that is just boring, repetitive & simply doesn't work on any level as a piece of entertainment except for a few unintentional laughs.<br /><br />it's hard to know who was responsible for what exactly but none of the footage is particularly well shot. it has a bland lifeless feel about it & for some reason the makers have tried to bath every scene in mist, the problem is they clearly only had one fog machine & you can see that at one corner of the screen the mist is noticeably thicker as it is coming straight out of the machine & thinning out as it disperses across the scene. since a lot of it is set during the day it doesn't add any sort of atmosphere whatsoever & when they do get it right & the mist is evenly spread across the screen it just looks like they shot the scene on a foggy day! the direction is poor with no consistency & it just looks & feels bottom of the barrel stuff. even the blood & gore isn't up to much, there's a gory hand severing at the start, a scene when something rips out of a pregnant woman's stomach, a legless woman (what actually took her legs off in the pool by the way & why didn't it take the legs off the guy who jumped in to save her?) & a few ok looking zombies is as gory as it gets. for anyone hoping to see a gore fest the likes of which fulci regularly served up during the late 70's & early 80's will be very disappointed, there aren't any decent feeding scenes, no intestines, no stand out 'head shots' & very little gore at all.<br /><br />technically the film is poor, the special effects are cheap looking, the cinematography is dull, the music is terrible, the locations are bland & it has rock bottom production values. this was actually shot in the philippines to keep the cost down to a minimum. the entire film is obviously dubbed, the acting still looks awful though & the english version seems to have been written by someone who doesn't understand the language that well.<br /><br />zombi 3 is not a sequel to fulci's classic zombie gore fest zombi 2 (1979), it has nothing to do with it at all apart from the cash-in title. i'm sorry but zombi 3 is an amateurish mess of a film, it's boring, it makes no sense, it's not funny enough to be entertaining & it lacks any decent gore. one to avoid.
