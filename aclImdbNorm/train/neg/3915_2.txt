this movie is not only poorly scripted and directed but is simply distasteful. a beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film. many changes have been made to the storyline, presumably to streamline the timeframe. but what results is simply confusing. the acting can't possibly overcome the script which removes the characters' motives for their behavior. plus, the conversion to english does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch esteban as esteban. horrible. please please please read the gorgeous novel, in spanish if possible. don't see this film. it will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience.
