this was such a waste of time. danger: if you watch it you will be tempted to tear your dvd out of the wall and heave it thru the window.<br /><br />an amateur production: terrible, repetitive, vacuous dialog; paper-thin plot line; wooden performances; lucy lawless was pathetically hackneyed.<br /><br />seriously flawed story, completely unbelievable characters. the two worst concepts in film and t.v. are: (1) the evil twin, (2) amnesia. there are no twins.<br /><br />the plot "twist"? outrageously simplistic and obvious - like watching a train coming down the track in the middle of the day on the prairies. it doesn't even resolve properly. the evil is not punished for the original crime.<br /><br />please, please, please - don't watch this even if its free and your only other choice is to go to a synagogue.
