gwoemul (the host) - due to pollution in the han river a mutated beast goes on the rampage. the youngest member of the park family is snatched by the beast, and it is up to the rest of her family to find her, before she becomes the beast's latest meal.<br /><br />firstly, i love monster movies: mutated bears, over-sized alligators, packs of ravening komodo dragons, the whole lot. creature features are my favourite kind of horror film. so, i really wanted to like the host, but it wasn't to be. <br /><br />there were three major problems with it:<br /><br />the first can be seen with a quick look at it's imdb page<br /><br />genre: action / comedy / drama / fantasy / horror / sci-fi / thriller<br /><br />too many damned genres. it took itself too seriously to be a comedy, and yet was too light hearted to have any real message (though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement. anti-pollution, anti-american or anti-government). the drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mish-mash with all the other styles.<br /><br />secondly, after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film. the central family wander about looking for one of their own while the governments of korea and america, apparently, do nothing. and that's it, they just wander about, occasionally hitting one another, presumably for a bit of comedy relief. this lack of action made my attention wander, and apparently it did the same for the director, as whole plot threads go unresolved (a mystery plague invented by the evil americans is completely forgotten about, and is never resolved).<br /><br />and lastly, the film is clumsily political. it paints the americans as being stupid and evil, but gives us no american characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain. the opening scene has the most obvious stupid american vs wise korean moment. with a korean morgue assistant asking his boss, the coroner, not to pour chemicals into the han river. the american coroner all but cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to carry on. as well as being racist, it's lazy film-making and there is no excuse for that.<br /><br />on the plus side, the monster is good, kind of a mix of the relic and deep rising. some of the movement effects are quite cool, and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun. there are also some nice shots in the film. some of which remind me, strangely, of the way firefly was filmed (shuddering cameras, out of focus shots etc).there is also a nice scene at the end, where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the family's mobile food stall. it's night-time and snow is falling, the street-lamp is giving out a cold light, but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it.<br /><br />overall, i was really disappointed by this film. i'd been looking forward to a decent creature flick, and instead i get some pseudo-political,horror-comedy lite. looking at the comments on imdb i can't help but think that if this had been a us production it would have been slated. just 'cause it's a foreign flick doesn't mean it's any good. there have been some great movies out of korea in recent years (the vengeance trilogy and brotherhood, for example), but this certainly isn't one of them. <br /><br />for once i'm in favour of a remake. tighten up the directing, improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film. as it is, it's not worth a couple of hours of anyone's time.
