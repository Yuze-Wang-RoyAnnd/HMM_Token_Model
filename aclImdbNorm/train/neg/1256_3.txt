this film is another of director tim burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his `vision' to the screen. he has done it with `batman', `sleepy hollow' and now this. this is not a remake. the only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak (and charleton heston makes a cameo). burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for today's mass viewership.<br /><br />the original planet of the apes was a product of its time. during the 1960's america was struggling to redefine its civilization. it was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms. it was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal. in that context, pota was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day. pota was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of american society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior. the dialectic between colonel taylor (charleton heston), dr. cornelius (roddy mcdowall) and dr. zira (kim hunter) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious.<br /><br />burton's version is as much a product of today's times as pota was of the sixties. this is apes for dummies. it is superficial and jejune, substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance. the `surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel. while the ending of the original pota gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene, burton's ending simply mocks the audience, taunting, `i know something you don't know, and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.'<br /><br />from a technical perspective, as is always the case with burton's film, the film is excellent. the makeup is fantastic and burton's camerawork is outstanding (though i continue to dislike his dark look). however, thirty-three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script.<br /><br />the story has been reduced to a monster movie. the humans band together behind captain davidson (mark wahlberg) to fight the monstrous apes, aided and abetted by a few turncoats (notably helena bonham carter as ari). the presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality.<br /><br />the acting is mixed. mark wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role. walberg is excellent at playing dark, sullen characters that are tormented but strong. this part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in wahlberg's repertoire. helena bonham carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable. she tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character, but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager.<br /><br />then there is tim roth. his is a virtuoso performance, single-handedly saving the film from total ruin. roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent general thade. he creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys i can remember in some time. additionally, his physical acting is superlative, rendering a chimp-man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists.<br /><br />this film is a great disappointment. it is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door. i rated it a 3/10. from a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a 9/10. however the story is an insult to the original franchise. it is simply another attempt by burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is. of course it's true, but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption.
