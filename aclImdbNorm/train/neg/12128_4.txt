in case half of this film's footage looks strangely familiar, it means you watch way too much of this gory italian cult-crap! for you see, the notorious demigod lucio fulci did not only produce this movie, he also took the liberty of re-using the most sadistic killing sequences in his own (and more easily traceable) "cat in the brain". the opening scene already, in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe, features in fulci's later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments. andrea bianchi's "masssacre" fails miserably as a giallo, since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie-crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful, but it's still good entertainment if you're into cheap 'n shlocky horror trash. the incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters who're all potential maniacs, but none of the red herrings biachi comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately. whatever remains to enjoy are the truly misogynous make-up effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast. whenever there isn't any bloodshed on screen, like between the first and second murder, "massacre" is a slow and almost intolerable with its inane dialogs and thoroughly unexciting photography. thankfully in the second half, there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes. the music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative. my advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned "cat in the brain". that one features all the great moments of "massacre", and then some.
