this is waaaaay to much.. so frustrating to watch.. i was waiting for the whole damn movie to end and to finally get some answers!!.. and what i've had in the end was nothing but a huuuge neon-sign question mark above my head!!!!! i haven't seen such a bad acting and such a nonsense movie in a long long time.. and what's bothering me is.. how come someone (an actor) read the script of such a bull!?#@ movie and say: ok, i'm in!!! let's film this! this is horrible!!! this movie suuuuuuuuuuuucks!!!!!! i just can't believe i've spent an hour and a half of my life on something like this!!!
