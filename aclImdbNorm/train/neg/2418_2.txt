the first mistake you make in titling a film is to use "of the living dead" without really having a budget for real zombie fx. sure, this was a low budget zombie flick - really low budget. i thought it was a film school project. amateur actors and amateur effects.<br /><br />it was really not too bad considering the above, and it presented an interesting twist to the zombie genre. if you are going to get an "r" for violence, you might as well give us some good shots of the babes being attacked. the women were so little used in this film that it could almost be classified as "gay interest."<br /><br />and, i am staying out of oakland. there was a heck of a lot of shooting going on and no cops in sight!
