first some background; i am english and have lived in london all my life. i have been to many games at 'the den' and most other london club grounds. i am familiar with the type of person who gets into hooliganism and i know just how they act and how they speak. have to say this is a bad, bad movie. i can tell you that green street is one of the most unrealistic movies i have ever seen. i spent most of the movie cringing with embarrassment. i felt i should write a mini review because i felt i needed to point out a few things.<br /><br />a) people just don't talk like that in london in real life; the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it sound stupid. unfortunately hooligan types do exist, but those you see in green street are more like parodies. b) the actor who plays pete dunham (charlie hunnam) unfortunately sounded about as 'english' or 'cockney' as osama bin laden. he's from up north in newcastle and i'm just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him - how are we supposed to take him seriously. why they didn't just get someone from east london to play that part is beyond me. i could have done 'a bang up job' myself, hehe. c) mr frodo. i mean how can i be expected to take seriously elijah wood kicking the ass of people twice his size and who are genuinely nasty hooligans. he'd be dead. simple as that. honestly (as a brit) it was hard to watch this film. i'm pretty sure this film will bomb here in the uk. it may do a little better in the states because the americans just wont know (or care) how inaccurate it is. <br /><br />please my american and foreign friends, don't believe a word of this nonsense. yes these firms do exist but it's all extremely underground and hush hush, and on a vastly smaller scale. the movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed some of it in london. usually they try to film these things in cardiff (wales) or something and expect us all not to notice.
