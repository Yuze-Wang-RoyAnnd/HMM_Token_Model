ridiculous fluff, that compounds its error by trying to have meaning. joan, this time as a congresswoman, agatha reed, chairwoman of a committee dedicated to "investigating the high cost of food." says congresswoman reed, "the housewife has been getting it in the neck too long. i'm going to keep fighting long enough so that the american family can take a vacation once a year, see a movie every week and feed an occasional peanut to an elephant." she's all business, but becomes all gushy when she is awarded an honorary degree from good hope college, where she was expelled for the crime of having stayed out all night (the parallel to joan's real life is unmistakable here, as it is in all joan movies). the degree causes much consternation on campus ("that would make it the most broad-minded institution in the history of education!")
