it started out with an interesting premise. i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies. the more the film progressed, the more i realized that this was a b movie at best. in the latter half, it quickly became a c movie, then d, then f, then "i wish that this wasn't a rental so that i could put it in the microwave!" i can't say that the acting in all cases was awful, just most. the writing, however... i never read the book. maybe the book is well written. the screenplay was written by a 10 year old. it was ridiculously shallow, the dialog drab and uninteresting, the characters about as interesting as a 5 pound bag of fertilizer. i really hated this movie, as did my wife. i am a christian and i have no problem with movies that promote or support christianity. this movie did a great disservice to the cause. awful, terrible, worthless. if you liked it, i strongly recommend superman 4.
