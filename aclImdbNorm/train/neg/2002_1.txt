a shaky hand-held camera was used, presumably to give the film a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that i started to get motion-sickness just from watching it. it looked like someone with cerebral palsy was holding the camera (no offense meant to cp sufferers, but i don't think you would expect to get much work as a cinematographer!) the camera work was so nauseating, and so distracting, that my wife and i considered it unwatchable and gave up on it after 10 minutes of torture. i checked back a while later (it was showing on tv), and it hadn't gotten any better. i suggest giving this one a miss unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you may have eaten!
