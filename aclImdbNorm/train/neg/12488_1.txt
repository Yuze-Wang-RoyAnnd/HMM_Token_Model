0.5/10. this movie has absolutely nothing good about it. the acting is among the worst i have ever seen, what is really amazing is that everyone is awful, not just a few here and there, everyone. the direction is a joke, the low budget is hopelessly evident, the score is awful, i wouldn't say the movie was edited, brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase. it combines serial killings, voodoo and tarot cards. dumb. dumb. dumb. it is not scary at all, the special effects are hopelessly lame. laughably bad throughout. the writing was appallingly bad. the cinematography is real cheap looking, and very grainy sometimes, and the camera-work is dreadful. again, what really does the movie in is how badly all the actors are. cheesy.
