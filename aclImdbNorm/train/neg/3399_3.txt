birthday girl doesn't know what it wants to be - is it a comedy,, is it a drama...it just doesn't know. what could have been a very funny or touching film ends up in no-man's land. the premise is original enough to have warranted a script full of interesting scenarios but hardly delivers any and ends up petering out. this is a real shame if you look at the cast - it's very solid all the way through but they don't get the chance to shine. very disappointing.
