it looks like the brilliant team of shonda rhimes outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore, maybe to the mediocreland? "pp" reminds me any one of the many tedious, promising at first but predictable within 1 season david kelly flicks (picket fences, ally mcbeal, and now boston legal). the crazy cases they get are so outlandish, they barely evoke sympathy or sadness. and that's what actually makes good medical dramas tick - dramatic situations you are afraid of, "this could be me" sentiment. they are not funny either.<br /><br />the actors are quite good, but the plot lines are dead and cannot be brought back to live. i'm a therapist, and let me tell you - amy brennan plays the most unbelievably incompetent, unethical, untrained therapist. whoever writes her stuff flunked the ethics and the transference/counter-transference courses in stanford. somebody should give them a code of ethics to read (the episode with the nose-bleeding wife and the therapist's involvement in it). no therapists are that bad.<br /><br />women yearning for men who have moved on - had been done to death, we've all graduated "sex and the city". addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy she likes - very age-inappropriate, looks so unnatural on a woman over 40, and this otherwise talented actress doesn't believe it herself and doesn't deliver it very well. the only successful/palatable developments are addison struggling with her decision to move to la, and the "voodoo dr" and his coping with widowhood.<br /><br />this concept might work with a whole new writing team.
