(when will i ever learn-?) the ecstatic reviewer on npr made me think this turkey was another citizen kane. please allow me to vent my spleen...<br /><br />i will admit: the setting, presumably new york city, has never been so downright ugly and unappealing. i am reminded that the 70's was a bad decade for men's fashion and automobiles. and all the smoking-! if the plan was to cheapen the characters, it succeeded.<br /><br />for a film to work (at least, in my simple estimation), there has to be at least one sympathetic character. only ned beaty came close, and i could not wait for him to finish off nicky. if a stray shot had struck mikey, well, it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the most.<br /><br />i can't remember when i detested a film as strongly. i suppose i'm a rube who doesn't dig "art" flicks. oh, well.
