hmm, hip hop music to a period western. modern phrases like "cool" and too many others to keep track of. "the sistahs are in tha house"!?french manicured nails on hard riding girls. microphone packs clearly visible on li'l kim's back. i just can't go on with the litany of errors made by the director and editors.<br /><br />the acting isn't as bad as i've ever seen. the women did well enough with a poor script.<br /><br />it was weird hearing louis mandylor speaking in his native accent.<br /><br />the girls are beautiful. the costumes fabulous albeit completely incorrect. i just can't believe they would dumb down what could have been a great story. i would feel offended to believe that this movie was loaded with such trappings that it would play well in the inner city.<br /><br />
