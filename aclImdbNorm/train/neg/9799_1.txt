power rangers, the completely awful kid's show from the 1990s still continues to disturb young children with it's complete cheesiness, and awful settings.<br /><br />this show was not entertainment, it was an excuse to teach children violence in showing kids how to fight one another in order to solve their differences.<br /><br />the toys were further demonstration in how to promote a violent television show and such.<br /><br />i have never been able to figure out what the purpose of this completely ridiculous show ever was.<br /><br />as such, it remains one of the worst kids shows ever made.
