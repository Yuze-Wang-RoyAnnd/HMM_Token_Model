despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in new zealand, any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved. apart from a clich'es-only plot, the movie is let down by some weak acting, accents, and overall lack of tension.<br /><br />whilst having the overall look of a big budget (for nz), the feel is decidedly small-town kiwi...<br /><br />has anyone not seen the brothers ?? ( http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/ ) those who have will pick the similarities straightaway....i've heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clich'ed "boys talking crap", but it comes across as forced...<br /><br />i believe oscar keightley sees himself as deeply ironic, but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious.<br /><br />those who have any doubts left at all that samoans-living-in-nz culture has been deeply , hopefully not permanently ,affected by american speech , culture, and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie.<br /><br />robbie magasiva always looks good on screen , but is let down by the script..<br /><br />it always rubs me up the wrong way when a "comedy" has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way, you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clich'ed punchline - see the wanna be white boy...<br /><br />i know someone who found this movie hilarious -however, that person has the brains of a tadpole, and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars....<br /><br />that kinda sums up the mentality of this flick , ok but not great , fun but not funny.....wake up nz - this is not a 5 star movie despite all the glowing (middle class white guilt ?? :-) ) reviews....<br /><br />my advice ? if you watch it, get drunk first!!!
