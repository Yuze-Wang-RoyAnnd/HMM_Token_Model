i had recently been watching johnny test in an attempt to find humor in it. i failed, horribly. cartoon network usually has a tendency to make their shows enjoyable by all audiences, but johnny test is "entertainment" in it's lowest form. the writing is incredibly predictable, and the running gags aren't much gags at all. kids will love it, and that's about it.<br /><br />now, this isn't to say that it's all bad. the original opening theme was actually pretty catchy, but for some reason they took the skeleton of it and figuratively smashed it with a figurative aluminum bat. it's a shame, because that was really one of the best things it had going for it.<br /><br />some of the characters could be very interesting, in theory. with a little work, the characters could work well together, but they're too one-dimensional. then again, this makes it easy for the kids to follow. <br /><br />the pace is a bit too fast as well. the episodes are too busy, leaving little time for clever writing. this is a real shame, because there are so many interesting concepts that the show brings forth. on the upside, however, the fast pace will stop the kids from losing interest, and that's really the entirety of the target audience.<br /><br />overall, the show looks very good on paper, but just doesn't succeed in being funny or interesting. this is a show i want to like, but i'm incapable of it. there's just so much potential that isn't realized. kids will enjoy it, but that's about it.
