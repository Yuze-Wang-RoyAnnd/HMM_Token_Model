this movie was horrible, simply put. it was so bad i registered with imdb to warn you of its dangers.<br /><br />i am a campy horror film expert, per se. i have watched "redneck zombies", "house of the psychotic women", "slumber party massacre ii" and many others. i know my schlock. and i know this movie sucks.<br /><br />three fourths of the film is comprised of scared individuals running from one side of the screen to the other. when they are not running, they are spouting non-sequitur lines, devoid of emotion or motivation. when the actors begin to be acceptable, the direction falls to pieces. there were so many jarring low-angle shots; i figured leif jonker had a 3 foot tall tripod. he used what i call the "leif maneuver" several millions times: that is, zooming out from an object of interest like an amateur. apparently the film crew couldn't get up early enough to film a sunrise, so they filmed a sunset... and played it in reverse. with direction this lazy, you are actually impressed with the final gory scene. the only thing you can figure is that the last five minutes was filmed before the first eighty-five minutes.<br /><br />if you want a good (bad) gory movie, rent "riki-oh" or the foundational "dead alive." if you are a schlock buff, and are looking for a challenge, give "darkness" a go.<br /><br />quote o' the movie-<br /><br />vampire: it's die time!
