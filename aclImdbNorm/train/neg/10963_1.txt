i went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned alice entertainment.once i realized i would not be getting that,i watched it for a pretty well made movie (in terms of filming,and yeah..that was it).but aside from it having a good film quality,considering i had been watching grainy movies all day long,there was nothing good about that movie.<br /><br />he killed 42.why were tweedle dee and dum played by mudler and scully?serisouly,who can answer that for me?who can answer anything awful about this movie for me.<br /><br />i agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the staff.that's all it seemed to be.<br /><br />poor mr.carroll.i'm so sorry somebody did that to his wonderful tales.
