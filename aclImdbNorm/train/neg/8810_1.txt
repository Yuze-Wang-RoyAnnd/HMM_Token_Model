this movie is one of those i regret having invested 90 minutes of my life that i'll never get back in. the premise is really interesting - essentially it's a zombie flick from the perspective of the undead (let's not split hairs as to whether they're actually dead or not}. unfortunately, they fail to deliver a compelling story within this framework. the nearly unbearable monotony of the lives of the central characters may add to the realism of the film, but it sucks all the entertainment value right out of it. if they had put a little more effort toward keeping the viewer engaged, it would have been much more likely that they drive home the social commentary.
