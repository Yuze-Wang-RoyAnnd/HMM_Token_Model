jungle fever is too highly stylized, stereotyped, and comes across as essentially dishonest. wesley snipes was wrong for the lead and there was no chemistry between him and annabella sciorra. even though there's plenty of talent in this movie, it's mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to little more than decorative cameos. also, instead of simply showing racism for the ugly and stupid thing it is, spike lee chooses to wave it around like a flag in a most whining and irritating manner. i made it through most of the film but i couldn't quite finish it, and that, for me, rarely happens.
