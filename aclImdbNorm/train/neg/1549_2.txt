while leon is cute on snl, he's only on for a minute. like most snl skits-to-movies, this one can't fill 90 minutes. it has some cute moments (the ones you've seen in the trailer) but the actors are largely wasted. tim meadows does his best but the plot just doesn't have many high points. will farrell has a bit part. farrell may be the funniest man alive... but not in this movie. what a shame.
