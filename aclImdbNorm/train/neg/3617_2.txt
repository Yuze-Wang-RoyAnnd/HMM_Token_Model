really, really bad slasher movie. a psychotic person escapes from an asylum. three years later he kills a sociology professor, end of scene. one semester yesterday later (hey, that's what the title card said) a new sociology professor is at the school. she makes friends with another female sociology professor who works there, and starts dating another professor. the students are all bored, as are we.<br /><br />there are a number of title cards indicating how much time has passed. scenes are pretty short, and cut to different characters somewhere else, making for little progression of any kind. a lot of scenes involve characters walking and talking, or sitting and talking, and serve little purpose. despite the passage of time, many of the characters are always wearing the same clothing. sometimes the unclear passage of time means when we see a body for the second time, we ask ourselves: how long has that body been there? and also, at least one of the dead people don't seem to have been missed by others.<br /><br />the killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the breast, another by stabbing him in the crotch, and another by slicing her forehead. is his knife poisoned or something?<br /><br />the video box cover has a cheerleader: there aren't any in the movie. the rear cover has a photo of someone in a graduation cap and gown menacing a group of women in a dorm room. the central redhead in the photo is in the movie, but nobody ever wears such an outfit, and there is no such scene. the killer is strictly one-on-one.
