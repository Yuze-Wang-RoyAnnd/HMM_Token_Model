"a trio of treasure hunters is searching the west indies for a hidden fortune. the lure of gold makes for a rise in tension as the men come closer to the treasure's location. the deep-sea divers hope to track down the gold, but find that greed and hatred leads to murder," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis. "manfish" is the name of their boat, not a monster. the skeleton who gives muscular captain john bromfield (as brannigan) his half of the treasure map is very good. old salt victor jory (as professor) provides the other half of the map. first mate lon chaney jr. (as swede) plays dumb, and sexy tessa prendergast (as alita) guards the rum (not very well, obviously). serious editing and continuity problems mar the picture, which otherwise might have amounted to something.<br /><br />*** manfish (2/56) w. lee wilder ~ john bromfield, victor jory, lon chaney jr.
