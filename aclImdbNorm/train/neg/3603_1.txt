does this film suck!! horrible acting, horrible script, horrible effects, horrible horrible horrible!! nothing redeeming here for even the most die-hard of horror fans! a crazy killer stalks students at a college. people are showing up dead in the hallways, but still, class carries on as normal??? after about the 4th body, i would think that they could allow the students a few days break! lol. this about as bad as it gets folks. this film should be shown as a means of torture to criminals. you have been warned!
