horrendous! avoid like the plague. i would rate this in the top 10 worst movies ever. special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. appear to be done by day care students...wait, i have seen programs better than this. opens like a soft porn show with a blurred nude female doing a shower scene then goes bad from there. good nude scenes, but that is it. sound and light problems were persistent throughout the movie. at times i would swear i could hear the roaring of the camera motors. yikes! i would like to see another movie on this story, but done by different people. this batch of actors and crew need more acting and movie making lessons. voted 1 out of 10.
