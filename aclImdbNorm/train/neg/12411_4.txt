there were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies - but this film certainly isn't one of them! it's a shame the child isn't better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. we have the idea of a vengeful child, which worked so well in classic films such as the bad seed and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie. the plot is basically this: young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge (as you do). this is all well and good, except for the fact that it's boring! nothing happens for most of the film, and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore; it's not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it. the film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish. there's really not much i can say about the film overall as there isn't much to it. the child is a dismal seventies horror flick and i certainly don't recommend it.
