may i start off by saying that casey affleck is a very talented actor and i respect his work very much. i wish he was in more movies that showcased his talent. with this said, soul survivors was a very, very bad movie. very bad.<br /><br />i would have to say that i lay almost all the blame on the poor script. affleck is a very talented actress, wes bentley had an outstanding performance in american beauty, melissa sagemiller did well, and eliza dushku is currently the it girl in hollywood. i don't think any of the actors really got into the script, and i understand why. to say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an overstatement. it did have the twists and turns you would expect, but they just didn't lead anywhere... except to more confusion. i just found the ending very anti-climatic, because it just didn't seem to make any sense or really answer any of the questions that i had about the storyline.<br /><br />i wish i could give this movie a good review, but i can't. in all honesty, the only thing i think you will find scary about this movie is that you paid for it.
