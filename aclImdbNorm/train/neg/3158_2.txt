this really was the worst movie i have ever seen. michael vartan is hot, but who is this woman? and she looks absolutely awful through the whole movie, the hair is so bad! they talk in like monotone voices and there is nooo chemistry. the cover of the dvd does not even remotely come close to what the movie actually is. really, really boring. i had to fast forward through some of it because it was so painful to watch. i really want to know how i on earth anyone could think this is good? hhaha they literally just like talk and say "yeah" and there is no passion whatsoever. i could not tell at all that they were in love. i'm sorry but this was the saddest excuse for a movie i think i have ever seen.
