some news reporters and their military escorts try to tell the truth about a epidemic of zombies, despite the 'government controlling the media'. the makings of the film don't understand that the george romero zombie films only worked because he kept his politics subtly in the background of most of his films ("land of the dead" withstanding). this satire is about as subtle as a brick to the face or a bullet to the head is more apropos for this scenario. what's subversive or subtle about seeing a military guy masturbating to death and destruction? anything nuanced about the various commercials that are inter-cut with the film? nope. furthermore the acting is uniformly horrible, the characters thoroughly unlikable, and the plot inane. add this all up and you have the worst, most incompetent zombie film since, "c.h.u.d. 2" reared it's hideous head.<br /><br />my grade: d
