crude, some times crass - to me that's the summation of madhur bhandarkar's latest work - page 3. he has no point of view - just shallow, funny digs at stereotypes. what is the movie about?? is it about reporting a clan of people (so called page 3 types) who are so busy socializing and progressing their profiles in life - that they have no time for anything else. and you are either in it or out of it. is it that there is no press at all to report everyday incidents. madhur bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and page 3 is just a supplement; perhaps an entertainer for checking out who's who and what's what. don't mix the two. and then there is power play - that would happen in every walk of life. so what have you told at the end of it all - nothing - just a few crude jokes strung together in an otherwise direction less movie.
