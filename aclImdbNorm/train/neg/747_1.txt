finally i thought someone is going to do justice to h.g. wells's classic , not another version set in the wrong locale or era , but one based firmly on the book . well it definitely follows the book pretty closely , and that is the only plus to this mess.<br /><br />this is 180 min's (yes 3 hours) long , the book is only around 150 pages .<br /><br />if timothy hines had the nerve to come on here and say "if you can do any better ..." i would say "yes , i could" and i have never used a video camera or been to any sort or drama school in my life.<br /><br />i paid good money to get this crap over to the uk from the usa , do not make the same mistake as me .
