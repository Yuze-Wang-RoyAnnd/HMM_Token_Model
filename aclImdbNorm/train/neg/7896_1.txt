not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave reviews.<br /><br />while watching "bang" one night on tv, i found myself bored by the nonsensical, random plot which was occurring on screen. the entire movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in meaningless, artsy-fartsy self-indulgence on the part of the filmmaker. the fact that the director/writer goes by a one name moniker only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness. <br /><br />those interested in indie flicks would be better off looking for something better written and dare i say, more entertaining than this complete waste of time.
