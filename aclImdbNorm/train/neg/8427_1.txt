let me start by saying how much i love the tv series. despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing, manipulative father, it was incredibly light-hearted and fun to watch in practice. in my opinion, it is without doubt one of the greatest british sitcoms of all time. the tv series has my 10 out of 10 rating without reservation.<br /><br />this movie spin-off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word. hardly any of the essence of the tv show is transferred successfully onto film. this movie has a very dreary, depressing tone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions. seeing harold being beaten up in a pub (and not in a comical way) is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the tv series will not like this movie. the movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbour.<br /><br />the romance between harold and zita is completely out of tone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie ever bothered to watch the tv series. in the tv series, harold always went after respectable girls, not strippers.<br /><br />albert's reactions to the remarks made against him by harold's girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the tv series. in the movie, albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity rises.<br /><br />most movie spin-offs of british sitcoms tend to be quite dull, with the notable exception of the on the buses films (which in some respects were actually better than the tv series itself!). but, steptoe and son has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile, even below george and mildred.<br /><br />my advice - skip this one and see the second spin-off, steptoe and son ride again instead. it has a much lighter tone, is more faithful to the tv series, and is actually very funny.
