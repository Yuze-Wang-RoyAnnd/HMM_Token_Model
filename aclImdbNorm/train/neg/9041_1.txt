i kinda liked the film despite it's frenzied pace. but, i did not appreciate the comment that canada was referred to as montana north. it is definitely not montana north and never will be. americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world, and that is one reason why. stop teaching the kids of the united states of america to think they own the planet. such a centrist world view is not becoming of one of the world's great nations. even in jest. i would never refer to the usa as 'alberta south'. walt would never put us down, so why start now. other than that the film was pretty goofy, better luck next time.
