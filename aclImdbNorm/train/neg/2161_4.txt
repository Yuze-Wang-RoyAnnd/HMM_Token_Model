ira levin's broadway smash comes to the screen with hardly any meat on its bones, a mystery plot with just a few tricks and twists but nobody worth caring about. frustrated writer michael caine plots to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass it off as his own; his devious plan may include murdering the talented kid, which has caine's flighty spouse up in arms. the first act in which everyone is introduced is excruciatingly dead, with caine doing everything an actor can to keep the pacing up. dyan cannon is miscast as his wife (she's too smart and clever herself to be passed off as a ditz) and christopher reeve (in the middle portion of the film) seems extremely uncomfortable in the role of the better writer. these three characters, and irene worth's bothersome neighbor, are so undefined that what happens after the set-up barely even registers until well after the second act has begun. sidney lumet's direction is stagy and fuzzy, the set design unconvincing and poorly-lit, and the finale is a total disaster. the actors struggle to give the script some substance, but with such thin material all we see are their laborious efforts. *1/2 from ****
