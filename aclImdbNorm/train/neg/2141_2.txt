i had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is a fan of the first. this movie down right sucked! it lacked the magic of the first. you could actually understand every word the mice said, the animation is crappy, the palace is much much different from the first movie, there's new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible, luckily the prince didn't have many lines which kept him from sounding stupid. basically its like the lion king 1 1/2 except its different stories all told by the mice. the reason i'm giving this a 2 out of 10 is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable.
