for the first couple of seasons, i thought the apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show. the combination between reality tv and a 16 week job-interview was innovative, and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too "out there".<br /><br />the new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business - at all. in the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the business-related tasks - now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do everything to keep them on the show (that means lying, trash-talking, backstabbing etc.). the boardroom can be entertaining to watch, but it's entertainment at it's low-point - sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old jerry springer episode. the tasks on the show are, at most, boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay nbc for the publicity. and what is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season 6? that is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in real-life. <br /><br />i have absolutely no respect for any of the contestants this season, they all seem like idiots to me. in earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity, now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show. it also seems like donald trump's massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest, i can't see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him. his rationality in the boardroom mostly doesn't make any sense at all and sometimes it seems he just like to trash people for what it's worth.<br /><br />r.i.p the apprentice. please nbc, for god's sake, get the show off the air as soon as possible. it's just too embarrassing to watch. the apprentice was once a great tv-show, but now it's just a big fat joke.
