i just got back from the film and i'm completely appalled. this movie is an absolute mockery to all of mankind. the theatre i was in maybe had 4 other people. this movie was recommended to me and i couldn't believe that this person liked it. i can't believe that any sane human would like it. there was no plot no plot at all. it was a joke. how can you make a movie about nothing. this movie only goes to show why hollywood is in such a shambles. i can only just look at the spiral of the "horror movie" industry and giggle. what a travesty to all filmaking, this is true of all the new "teen horror flicks" grudge,boogeyman,ring,saw series. it is all such trash. don't support this kind of hogwash!
