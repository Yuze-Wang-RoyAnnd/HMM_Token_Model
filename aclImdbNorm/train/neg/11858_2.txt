i'm a fan of matthew modine, but this film--which i stumbled upon on cable--is absolutely witless. i see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same, so there was no one around to check her worst instincts. there are no surprises, no original lines, and no original characters. the goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character. what a waste of all this acting talent. given how expensive it is to film in new york these days, i have to wonder how this got made in the first place. and if you're wondering why i watched it at all, it came on after a film that i like on cable and i left it on while i worked at the computer. it's not a very demanding picture!
