seeing this movie, as i just did for the first time on turner classic (which lists it as "dangerous female"), can only multiply your appreciation for the 1941 bogart-astor version. ricardo cortez must have been getting paid by the smirk. i hope he remembered his dentist and his brylcreem salesman in his will; they made him the actor he was. the women are all good, but no better than that. well, una merkel is a little better. more interesting are the "original" joel cairo and mr. gutman, who competently deliver many of the individual tics but almost nothing of the set-changing atmospherics of their successors in the roles, peter lorre and sydney greenstreet. humphrey bogart and mary astor somehow transcended the essential seediness of their characters in the remake; here, sam spade and ruth wonderley(!) can't. <br /><br />this movie doesn't exactly stink; it lies there like a big slice of ham. its chief value today is as a reminder that great movies like the '41 "falcon" don't just happen. on the 1-to-10 scale i rate it a 4, mainly for the camera work and the supporting players.
