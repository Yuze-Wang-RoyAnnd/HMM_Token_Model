stilted, stagy, strange and opaque, if visually striking ... a wannabe-erotic fantasy. really boring, way too much male nudity (including father-son incest), and just a sort of shameless pointlessness. i will confess, however, that certain passages of dialogue, taken on their own terms, do have a lulling, haunting quality.
