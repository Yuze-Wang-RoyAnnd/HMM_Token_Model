i watched this film recently on dvd and i have to say i wasn't impressed. i know it's taboo to knock independent films, but this one felt devoid of entertainment.<br /><br />the premise was interesting, but the execution of it fell short. i found myself thinking "okay, they're just getting into it, the story will pick up soon". before i knew it, the film was over and the story never picked up. i can't say i found the acting all that impressive either. it was pretty bad. not star wars prequel trilogy bad, but bad nonetheless.<br /><br />i'm not sure what the running time was, i'll assume two hours (because it's a safe estimate). anyway, when the film was finished, i felt as though i deserved some kind of recognition for the will power i exerted in not stopping the film and walking away halfway through.<br /><br />again, i was thoroughly unimpressed, and eventually bored out of my wits. i'm not one of those guys who requires fast-paced action and explosions in a film, so don't start in on me as that being a reason for not liking it.
