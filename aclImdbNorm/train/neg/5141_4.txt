1914 was an amazing year for charlie chaplin. it was his first year in films and he appeared in more than 30 films! while most of these films weren't particularly good, they did give him a chance to slowly evolve his screen persona. however, by this film, the familiar "little tramp" character was still in development. sure charlie looked the part, but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed. instead, chaplin often hit, kicked or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason at all.<br /><br />as for this very slight film, it is interesting to watch for the cast. while they are not familiar today, chaplin stars along with mabel normand, chester conklin and mack swain--all exceptionally popular stars with keystone films. the problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes, the plot seems very vague and improperly developed. chester and mabel got to the race track (a very common theme in keystone productions--it must have been located near a race track). charlie and mack show up and sneak in. mack is chased by the police for doing this while charlie slaps chester around and steals his girl. in the end, for no apparent reason, the cops take chester and mack away--leaving charlie with mabel (who, oddly, didn't seem put off by charlie's boorish behaviors).<br /><br />unless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian, this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of chaplin. what he and the other actors actually do on stage, while not unusual for a keystone film, isn't particularly funny when seen today.
