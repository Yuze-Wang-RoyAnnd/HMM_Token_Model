(aka: demons iii)<br /><br />made for italian tv although shot in english and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier demons films. it was supposed to be simply titled, the ogre, which is how director lamberto bava had released it.<br /><br />an american family rents an italian villa for the summer. the woman (virginia bryant) has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine-cellar of this villa an encountering this cocoon-like structure hanging down from the ceiling. it glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it. it drips what looks like green paint.<br /><br />of course the husband doesn't believe any of this. the villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it.<br /><br />but then the ogre itself appears in what looks like some kind of 16th centaury costume with what looks like a wolf's head attached to it and it's attracted to the scent of orchids.<br /><br />the films isn't really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring. there's no real gore other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool. the ogre itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family's jeep cherokee. <br /><br />the copy of the shriek dvd i watched was defective, with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film, a flaw i hope shriek has since corrected. extras include a short interview with lamberto bava where he explains how this wasn't a sequel, etc..etc...along with some trailers to other shriek dvd releases. this is pretty standard stuff.<br /><br />3 out of 10<br /><br />
