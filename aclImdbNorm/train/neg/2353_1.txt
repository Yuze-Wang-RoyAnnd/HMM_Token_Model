madhur has given us a powerful movie chandni bar in the past. his next film page 3 was one of the worst movies of all time. it apparently tells the story of some high class people in india. after seeing a scene where the man forces another man for sexual reasons to star in a movie. i felt like spitting and breaking the dvd. coincidently i did. the reason why was the movie contains scenes of child pornography and molestation. i literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children. very disturbing stuff, there was no need to show the children fully naked. one of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreign people, british men in this movie. i am shocked to know this film was a hit in parts of india, otherwise super flop in uk, usa and australia. i'm from uk, and this kind of stuff makes me sick, shouldn't of been released in uk.
