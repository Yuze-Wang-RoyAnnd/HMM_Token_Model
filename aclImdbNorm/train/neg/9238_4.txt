one-note comedy that probably sets modern day feminists' teeth on edge. department store clerk betsy drake is in love with the idea of babies and marriage, pinning her hopes on women's magazines until she spies super-bait in the form of sleek bachelor cary grant. the rest of the film plods from one ploy to the next as the relentless drake pursues her quarry. i guess the word "perky" just about sum's up drake's approach to the role. she does have a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of memorizing her dentures, i began to overdose. grant's role is basically secondary and minus his usual flair. there is one scene, however, that almost salvages this slender exercise. drake queries the hapless grant following his lecture to a roomful of respectable ladies. here her perky manner has an unforced freshness that is really quite remarkable, and had the production not rubbed our noses in that upbeat grin for 90 minutes, the film might have amounted to more than a girls' camp day-dream, circa 1948.
