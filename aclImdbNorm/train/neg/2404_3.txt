man, was i disappointed.<br /><br />1) adam arkin is more whiny than ross geller from 'friends' <br /><br />2) a great cast is wasted (kenneth mars, alan arkin, ed mcmahon, pat morita, louis nye) with this amateurish script.<br /><br />3) the movie suffers from horrible pacing. it jumps around through in a jumbled, confusing manner.<br /><br />4) the story doesn't even make sense. why does he want to break the football streak? what about the stupid violin music? none of it is explained.<br /><br />5) it's not even funny. it's like a bunch of accountants trying to do improv, saying "lookit me! lookit me i'm being funny!" this was a bad attempt at making another "love at first bite".<br /><br />i like larry cohen movies, but man he failed here. i couldn't wait for the credits to roll. horribly disappointed.
