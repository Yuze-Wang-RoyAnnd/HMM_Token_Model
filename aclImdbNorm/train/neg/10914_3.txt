ain't it hilarious when an average schmo leading a pathetic life suddenly has something outrageously magical happen to him, turning his life upside down and causing him to learn a few valuable lessons along the way? that formula never gets old, does it? it's such a sure fire way to make a classic film! just look at major hits like liar liar and big!... this must have been rob schneider's line of thinking when he made semi-successful deuce bigalow: male gigolo and followed it with the animal. since i've already traced the plot through sarcasm, allow me to color it in more: schneider plays a loser cop who's suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved through surgery... by a loopy veterinarian who loads him up with animal parts, causing him to whinny like a horse at inappropriate times, run like a cheetah, etc. this movie is slightly more likable than other schneider-starring flicks (such as another lame same-plot follow-up the hot chick), but it almost feels like they want audiences to hate it by casting a reality tv star as the romantic lead (colleen haskell from "survivor") and inserting a cameo by norm macdonald. my favorite scene... just does not exist. sorry - nothing memorably good except the production value. i just want to end this review by saying that slight references to other movies in a movie can be okay, but when it comes to lines being delivered the exact same way ("you can do it!"), there's a word for that - "milking." actually, here's another word - "cheap."
