i really, really wanted to like julian po. i think that slater is underrated as an actor, and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film. i realize this is based on a short story which i have not read. so, i do not know if what i see as the film's faults originated with the story, or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter. the premise is wonderful, and i loved the voiceover, confessional tone the opening narration strikes. but then...? nothing! several of the cliched local characters ask julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. one could argue that he doesn't answer, because it's none of their business. but julian is the one who, under only token pressure, blurted out his intentions in public. then neither julian nor the director/writer, despite the fact that the julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for god's sake, seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on julian's life. he says he was a bookkeeper. he says his family moved around when he was a child, due to his father's job. so what? there are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate julian's purpose. but none of them go anywhere, because julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet, as if he were the ultimate (and only) sane one among them. this might work as an allegory, if julian po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart. the closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive, religious wife of the mechanic. and what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for julian. i can only see the julian character --as rendered--as selfish, petty, and totally condescending. sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half-baked, contrived film. and poor michael parks, an actor who once had so much promise, is given nothing to work with here.
