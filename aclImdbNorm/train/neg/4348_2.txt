this was just a terrible movie. it hurt me to watch it. almost every action was unmotivated within the context of the movie, the acting was really poor (p.diddy was the best actor which really says something about the movie) and the plot was generally predictable. some links to carlito's way were okay, for example his dream of one day moving to the carribien, but on the whole they were weak. the love interest in my opinion was flat out wrong but hey that's debatable. anyways i really wasn't expecting much before watching the movie and i guess you could say even those expectations weren't met. i feel bad for jay hernandez because he actually is a decent actor (friday night lights). he's lucky though because i'm sure there won't be too many people watching this movie. i generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so i'm gonna go ahead and give this one two stars. better luck next time. and yes i did enjoy carlito's way.
