i'm not a regular viewer of springer's, but i do watch his show in glimpses and i think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time. so naturally, i'm going to watch this movie expecting to see "jerry springer uncensored." first of all, jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the film's running time. the other hour and twenty minutes is spent building up this pseudo-farce about trailer-trash, jealousy, incest and deception. jaime pressley (who looks hot as hellll) is a trailer-trash slut who sleeps with her stepfather (a very unusual-looking, chain-smoking, drunken michael dudikoff who finally strays from his action hero persona). the mom finds out about the affair, they get into a fight, they want to take it to the "jerry" show (that's right, no springer). and then we have a parallel story with an african-american couple. they take it to the "jerry" show. the characters collide. blah, blah, freakin' blah! trash has rarely been this borrringg!!!! i was wondering why the hell springer has millions of fans, yet none of them checked out his movie. well, now it's totally obvious!! whether you love him or hate him, you will hate this movie! how can i explain? it's a total mess of a motion picture (if that's what you call it). it's so badly edited, with scenes that just don't connect, and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and it's simply all over the map! just imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce. with seldom laughs. <br /><br />my only positive note is a hot girl-girl scene. that's as risque as it gets. don't get me wrong, the scene's pretty risque, but if you look at the overall film comparing it to the material on springer's program--this disastrous farce seems extremely sanitized.<br /><br />my score: 3 (out of 10)
