this is just one more of those hideous films that you find on lifetime tv which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner. along with other such nasty films as "the burning bed," "enough," or "monster," this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why she's not such a bad person after all. give us a break! here's my question to the filmmakers: if letourneau were a man, and vili were a 12 year old girl, would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person? answer: hell no.<br /><br />imagine switching the genders in this film, and then you'll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage. were the genders switched, there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal. instead, we'd likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl, his lascivious behavior landing him in prison, and his brainwashed victim suffering from stockholm syndrome. the only reason letourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex.<br /><br />let's call a spade a spade. letourneau is a pedophile. plain and simple. no ifs, ands or buts. she's a criminal who belongs in prison, and deserves our derision and contempt, but certainly not our pity or empathy.
