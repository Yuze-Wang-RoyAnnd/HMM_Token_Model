my commentary has nothing to do with the political sentiments found in the film. in fact, they're quite congruent with mine. what gets me is the fact that in terms of a movie, it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of story, motive or dialogue. maybe someone should tell neal that substituting lyrics of songs which are failing to inspire anyone outside of a dwindling audience isn't the same thing as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or director. a silly narrative remains as such despite the iconic legacy of neal young. the most childish scene is the one where the devil dances his way into a bar, slips a tonic to an unsuspecting hero, who then finds his way onto the dance floor to mouth the words to young song to the heroine, who is unaware of what's taken place. somehow these two dream up a scheme where they will go up the west coast in search of????? sorry neal, stick with music and leave film making to steven stills.
