let's start by the simple lines. from the viewer's side, there a couple of good "director details", some points of view at the movie scenes that are nice. the special effects are good enough, a good acting/good scenery also. but the story is way too simple. it shows how a elite army bomb squad unit lives, acts and sometimes dies. it shows the drama of living in war. in my movie experience as a serious action movie "addicted" guy, i missed that click that gets my eyes and mind stuck on the screen. one of the things that need to be present in a movie in order to i consider it a good one is the ability of immerse the viewer in the movie reality and time. it didn't happened to me. i stayed "conscious", for the entire movie.<br /><br />honestly speaking, i think that this movie gained its place in fame based on the "subconscious" appeal of american patriotism, a healthy and genuine feeling, but not the adequate use as a movie fame generator. more than a movie about war, it grows its popularity based on that.<br /><br />a simple thought: if this was a world war ii or i movie, only changing time, with everything remained the same, would it be this awarded? sure not. why? because there are great ones that elevate the bar way to high.<br /><br />compared against its rivals in the oscars, i don't think that all of the prizes it won are correctly awarded.
