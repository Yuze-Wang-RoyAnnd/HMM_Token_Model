i don't know what it is about this movie- director sam mraovich somehow messed up just about every little aspect in this movie. i would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist, but this movie may be the most important of all time. this movie should exist for the sole purpose of being without a doubt 'the worst movie ever made'. i've seen bad movies in my lifetime, but this somehow breaks what i considered bad into something much more hard to imagine.<br /><br />everything in this movie is hilarious, but the single funniest thing is that mraovich himself considers this to be a great movie.<br /><br />oh wow...
