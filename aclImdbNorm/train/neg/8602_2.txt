all you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene, where a guy falls into a lake and gets eaten. then they start rolling the title credits: you see "slugs!" in big letters, followed shortly thereafter by "the movie." whew! i was worried i had accidentally tuned into "slugs: the musical" or "slugs: the game show." anyway, from there the movie deteriorates into a kill-fest. you see a guy cut his hand off because he had slugs in his gardening glove, two people get attacked by slugs while having sex, and a girl falling on her back in an underground passageway get stung to death by killer slugs. it's a pretty silly movie, falling in the "so-bad-it's-good" category. it also is shot so poorly with such grainy film that you're shocked to learn it was made in 1988 (my guess was 1974). i'm very surprised it has received as high a score as it has here, because most people here don't give those types of movie any love. but if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being laughable, this is one of your prime candidates.
