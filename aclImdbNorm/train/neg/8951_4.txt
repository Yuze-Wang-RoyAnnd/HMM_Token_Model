i am a massive fan of the book and orwell is certainly my favourite writer ever since studying animal farm at gcse. i bought the dvd out of sheer curiosity, burton is an actor i hold in high regard so when i heard that he played the role of o'brien i was swung.<br /><br />i watched the trailer on the dvd first and some fears started to set in, mostly regarding the frankly terrible "theme song", hearing the eurythmics mechanically shouting "1984!" over and over again to an electronic beat is as bad as it sounds.<br /><br />the acting on a whole is pretty good, burton and hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the ministry of truth towards the end can be felt, especially in the harrowing room 101 scene. however this is also where the movie is let down. the movie spends too much time focusing on the love affair between winston and julia, which frankly isn't what orwell was writing about. he was writing about a harrowing future, about how ingsoc build up a mans beliefs and then shatter them all in the name of him being made to love big brother. the movie skips over what is essentially the most important part of the book, winstons coming to terms with his position in life and the world, and his re-education via o'brien.<br /><br />the comment on imdb at the moment states that the movie sticks to the book is completely incorrect. julia is not present when winston visits o'brien, they do not commit themselves to goldstien's brotherhood and confess their crimes. there is no obvious mention of the initial instances where winston finds the article with the unpersons but it does get mentioned near the end, if you have not read the book it is completely confusing.<br /><br />a terrible screenplay, which some excellent acting cannot rescue. michael radford seems to have completely missed the point orwell was trying to make, and the electronica sound track is frankly terrible.
