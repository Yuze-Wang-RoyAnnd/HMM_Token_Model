why do they insist on making re-makes of great movies like "high noon" "from here to eternity" and this one?<br /><br />why do they think that color is more engrossing to a viewer than stark black and white?<br /><br />why did robert's insist on wearing that dopey, broad-billed, baseball cap?...it made him look like jim varney.<br /><br />why would anyone spend four hours suffering through this?<br /><br />watch the original. then you won't have to ask yourself why.
