what an awful movie! the idea of robots fighting each other is cool, but the storyline is ridiculous, real human action laughable, acting non-existent and special effects (on which, this type of movie must depend) are archaic. i thought it must have been made around '80-'84 and was amazed to see it was from 1990. that's 5 years after aliens! ok, lots of people said it was good considering the low budget, but i just think 'what's the point?'. it looks totally unbelievable. i wouldn't mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely re-written story because i still like the idea of huge robots beating crap out of each other.
