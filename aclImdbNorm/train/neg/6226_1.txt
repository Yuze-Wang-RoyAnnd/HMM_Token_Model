i cringed all the way through this movie. first of all, the idiotic plot has little to do with parson's own story. hollywood has attempted to create a kind of comedy car chase movie. imagine "englebert sings hendrix".<br /><br />do not take anything about this movie to be accurate. the name parsons in the title and stealing of his body is just used as springboard for a low budget chase movie, a blatant attempt to grab a few bucks from the parsons legacy and his fan base. gram's father had long since been dead in 1973, the other global characters are fictional, none of this has anything to do with grams life or death.<br /><br />if you are a gram fan, i advise you to not see this movie. i wish i hadn't. it's saddening to see something special be treated as such disgracing fodder. i'd swear i could hear gram turning in his grave while the movie was playing. if you are not familiar with gram's life and legacy, do not take anything in this movie as being representative of gram.<br /><br />i cannot say enough bad things about this movie. if gram were alive and saw this movie, he would kill himself. then again, maybe he'd be afraid to if he knew this movie were to result.
