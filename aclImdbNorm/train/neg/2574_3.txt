i know that movies aren't necessarily supposed to mirror reality, but this one got on my nerves. it perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about "psychological trauma" and mental illness. the "psycho mom" thing has been done too many times before (and usually done better) and much of the rest of the plot is far-fetched as well. the acting was not horrible but nothing to rave about.<br /><br />one highlight: i am a long-time fan of general hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by former gh regular, jon lindstrom.<br /><br />anyway, if you can overlook the bogus psychoanalytical part of it, in the same way a person must suspend reality / judgment when watching a lot of movies, then this movie might be tolerable. if you have nothing better to do and fairly low standards.<br /><br />i'm sorry i spent my time watching it.
