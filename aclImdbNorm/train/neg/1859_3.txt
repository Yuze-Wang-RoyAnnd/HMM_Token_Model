boy this movie had me fooled. i honestly thought it would be a campy horror film with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever, boy i got the cold shoulder that time. this movie was, and i'm truthful, pretty damn good. it was not scary at all but the campiness and the sly humor really mad this movie interesting. some to the horrible acting and clich'e killings were so painful to watch, i almost laughed at how bad it was, but to some extent i enjoyed it. the killings all vaguely relate to snow sports and christmas, which made things more intriguing. the pov camera angles were awesome.<br /><br />the movie is about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident collision with a chemical truck while being transported to prison. he is later resurrected in that very same chemical with snow spliced into the mixture. these were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman. he than takes his revenge, as the snowman, on the police officer who convicted him.<br /><br />this movie had such bad acting, with the exception of christopher allport, that is was funny. i will say that i am also pretty disappointed that this movie was not a horror, but in fact a dark sitcom. they had a great story with a good plot but it wasn't executed right. all in all i like the movie at first but now it is really annoying. but this movie is way better and darker than the sequel.
