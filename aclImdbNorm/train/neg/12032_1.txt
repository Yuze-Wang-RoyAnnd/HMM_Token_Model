this movie was awful. i had a very difficult time watching this all the way through. i didn't get the point of the movie. what was the point of this movie? the soundtrack was bad, acting was bad and the story uninspiring. the two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting. there was no chemistry among any of the cast members. i don't know this for a fact, but i suspect that most of the actors were first timers. the movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot. that indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie. i would have rather ha a root canal during the two hours of the movie. i want those two hours back! if you want to watch good, funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mormons, watch napoleon dynamite instead.
