now please don't start calling me names like, "unpatriotic" , "weirdo" and more .<br /><br />the very length of this movie (4 hours .. !!!) is its biggest mistake . no editing at all - seems like j.p. dutta fell in love with his project too much . even lagaan was 4 hours long - but it was entertaining and gave a message as well .<br /><br />it's based on true incidents and real people . kudos to it , but were the repetitive war scenes really needed ? on top of it the focus constantly shifted from one battalion / squadron to another and it was impossible to keep a track of them all .<br /><br />between the skirmishes , there were songs about loneliness , lovesickness and related stuff . there were chummy conversations . in the beginning it gave some relief from the violence but became so monotonous later that one could even correctly predict nature of the forthcoming talk .<br /><br />why were the soldiers walking around as if they were lions in jungle , fully unaware that enemy was lurking somewhere near? and when they were shot , it elicited sympathy but it seemed unmindful of them to be so cocksure of their safety in the first place .<br /><br />music was melodious and the lyrics were soulful but did not fit with the movie . better to listen to them on the soundtrack rather than in the movie .<br /><br />acting was the saving grace : from seasoned veterans like sanjay dutt and ajay devgan , to relative newbies like abhishek bachchan and akshaye khanna , everyone acted like a pro . manoj bajpai and ashutosh rana deserve a special mention for lightening up the mood whenever necessary .<br /><br />dialogues ranged from brilliant ("from madhuri .. with love!!") to illogical / monotonous ("pakistan se zyada musalman hindusthan mein hain") . and the expletive spree consisting of all the mcs , bcs , cs and f-words wasn't really required . <br /><br />loc kargil attempts to provide a fitting tribute to the brave indian soldiers , but tries too hard and ultimately fails . indian soldiers surely deserve a better tribute .
