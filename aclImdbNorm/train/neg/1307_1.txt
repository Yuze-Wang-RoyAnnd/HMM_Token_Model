this was really a very bad movie. i am a huge fan of italian horror, argento, mario bava, fulci and yes, even our good friend here lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one. i found the first two 'demons' films to be highly entertaining - they were so bad they were great but this one is just so bad that it is really, really bad. it is intensely boring, the story never goes anywhere and i hated the characters - the wife slapping husband and whiny cry-baby pain in the *** wife drove me mad, there was nowhere near enough of the story devoted to the ogre who was probably the best actor in the whole film. i turned it off about three quarters of the way through because i was very, very bored! don't bother.
