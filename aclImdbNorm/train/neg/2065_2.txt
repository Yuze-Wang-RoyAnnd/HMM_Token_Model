rented it last night. the opening(2001) ran waaaaaaaaay too long. the hitchiker scene served no purpose. some skits were just retarded. i knew beforehand, chevy chase was on for less than 2 minutes. no problem. here are the best parts:<br /><br />koko, uranus, babs commercial, curtis mayfield song<br /><br />total: 7 minutes of good material out of a 75 minute movie<br /><br />everything else was either unfunny or stupid as hell.<br /><br />let me give you some advice: if you want a crude movie spoofing tv and movies, rent "kentucky fried movie". if you want a less crude movie spoofing tv and movies, rent "amazon women on the moon" or "uhf"<br /><br />otherwise, don't bother renting this movie. you'll save 2-3 dollars.<br /><br />imho: ken shapiro's best movie is still "modern problems"
