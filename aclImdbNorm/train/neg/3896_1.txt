well. astronaut steve west sits in a plastic space capsule, commenting that "you haven't lived until you've seen the sun through the rings of saturn", all the while the obvious mid-day sunlight is streaming through the window, when suddenly he has a nose bleed. next, west is back home in some secret hospital, a melting gelatinous mass who goes berserk and causes a chunky nurse to run through a fake glass door. apparently, west "gets stronger as he melts", which makes about as much sense as anything in this hopelessly purile, adle-brained moovie. then this dopey "army brass", who looks kind of like coleman francis (director of many bad moovies) tries to cover the info up, but goo man runs around killing everyone he sees because he is melting. he attacks a bickering old couple because he is melting. he makes one terrible actress scream and moan helplessly for about 10 minutes because he is melting. he is melting because he is melting. the fx by the slumming rick baker are supposed to be the star here, but they just look hokey. the film is poorly shot and everything looks so dark and muddled that it's very difficult making out what's what - not that it would help any. moocow says who cut the cheese with this one?? :=8p ps - "didn't you get any crackers?"
