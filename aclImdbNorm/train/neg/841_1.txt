i just watched this film 15 minutes ago, and i still have no idea what i just watched. mainly i think it's a film about an internet s&m "star" of cd roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online. she's murdered by someone, which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 fbi agents to investigate the death. the local homicide division of big city, usa is also investigating, though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the cd roms which he claims are as realistic "as the real thing". i know. wow.<br /><br />michael madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him. he's in the film for about 15 minutes, and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason. i won't even explain the ending, because quite frankly i can't make it out myself. but before the final scene, we're treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film. honestly, they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all.<br /><br />all in all, stay away from this film. i got it because i love bad movies and i love michael madsen. i really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied. like, playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly. that for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining.
