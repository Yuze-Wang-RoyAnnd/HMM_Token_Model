come on! get over with the pakistan bashing guys. bollywood can not only make brilliant movies- but can seriously affect a generation of viewers.<br /><br />i am a huge bollywood fan- but anti-pakistan movies just make me wince too much to enjoy screenplay, cinematography, action sequences- everything.<br /><br />i'm really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda, and there are movies like main hoon na out there that have done brilliantly not only because they deserved to because of the quality of its bollywood masala- but also because it tries to say: give peace a chance and shows that there are crazies out there on both sides who do not represent the masses.
