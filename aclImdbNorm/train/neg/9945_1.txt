after watching about half of this movie i noticed something peculiar ... i found myself constantly switching through tv-channels to see what else is on - not exactly a good movie trait.<br /><br />this movie is listed as being in a number of genres, and i must say it mostly failed misserably in every one of them. 80% through the movie i switched over to watch an old rerun instead. bottom line - the whole movie felt as if the ones making it didn't exactly know what to make and ended up in a concoction with no discernable taste.
