mario lewis of the competitive enterprise institute has written a definitive 120-page point-by-point, line-by-line refutation of this mendacious film, which should be titled a convenient lie. the website address where his debunking report, which is titled "a skeptic's guide to an inconvenient truth" can be found at is :www.cei.org. a shorter 10-page version can be found at: www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf once you read those demolitions, you'll realize that alleged "global warming" is no more real or dangerous than the y2k scare of 1999, which gore also endorsed, as he did the pseudo-scientific film the day after tomorrow, which was based on a book written by alleged ufo abductee whitley strieber. as james "the amazing" randi does to psychics, and philip klass does to ufos, and gerald posner does to jfk conspir-idiocy theories, so does mario lewis does to al gore's movie and the whole "global warming" scam.
