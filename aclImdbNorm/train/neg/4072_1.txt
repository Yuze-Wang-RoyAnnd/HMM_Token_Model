i watch bad movies.<br /><br />this movie is not good enough to be a bad movie. not an ounce of humor, not an ounce of talent throughout.<br /><br />i am lazy.<br /><br />usually, i see a bad movie and curse. this was so bad, i actually made a review to try and save others from the completely boring mess i fell victim to.<br /><br />i am smashing my copy of this movie.<br /><br />it's too lame even to use clear a room. so boring. watch 'bloodsucking freaks' or 'shock, shock, shock' for absolute crap that has some merit as entertainment. this sludge looks awful, is awful, and whoever made it should feel awful.
