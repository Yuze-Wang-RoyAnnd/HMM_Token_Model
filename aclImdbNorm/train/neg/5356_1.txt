i am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad. it reminds me of a c-grade porn movie with one major difference: no porn.<br /><br />the story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul. maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable. at the very least, the pacing should have been picked up.<br /><br />while i accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had, he should have spent more time on the story or better yet, get someone else to write it. many of the action scenes were just pointless.<br /><br />it was a complete waste of my time.
