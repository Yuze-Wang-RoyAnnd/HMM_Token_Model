sometimes i rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks and/or crocodiles are still getting made these days. they've been making these lame "jaws"-copies since the 70s, it's not like they're getting any more well-liked. the idea is still exactly the same. so we have an animal that starts murdering people. first it takes down some secondary characters, then it starts attacking the main characters, usually played by a couple of nobodies except for someone who used to be a bit more famous, who usually plays a specialist. one of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow, usually with an explosion. then, we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or has laid eggs, etc. etc. "krocodylus" basically uses the same overused ideas, and does absolutely nothing to create even a tad bit of variation. unless you count the fact that the "specialist" is a captain in this one variation, in that case your standards are pretty low. it's funny that he's played by duncan regehr though, he like totally used to be zorro.hell i'll give it a bonus point for that.
