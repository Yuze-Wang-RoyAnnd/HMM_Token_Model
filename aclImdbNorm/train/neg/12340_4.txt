"transylvania 6-5000" is an insignificant but occasionally funny and charming mid 80's horror parody with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to chuckle in the script. two bozo journalist of a gossipy tabloid newspaper are sent, very much against their will, to transylvania to do a story on the alleged return of mad scientist frankenstein. there are some adorable little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the film, like a little guillotine for hard-boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are being used to put in cream and sugar at the breakfast table. the wholesome of the film, however, is not as successful as it could and should have been, with jokes and parody situations that are way too overlong. the roger corman production "transylvania twist", which came out four years after this, is a lot funnier and much more recommended. the film is particularly parodying the classic universal milestones of the early 30's, so you better make sure you've seen those if you want to grasp all the tiny gags and references. there's a pretty original twist indicating that the frankenstein character only behaves like a mad-raving evil scientist when he enters his laboratory. it's also revealed that he's actually more of a father damien sort of messiah who's only concerned with the condition of exiled monsters. michael richards, the freaky guy who plays kramer in seinfeld, stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments. i'm pretty sure john turturro's character in "mr. deeds" was inspired by richards's role here.
