i have to admit i did not finish this movie because it was so amazingly stupid and not worth watching. i watched it with a room full of kids, who also were not laughing at the stupid and crude humor. the director, bob dolman, seems to be so obsessed with sphincters and genitalia that it overrides the real story that i grew up with. this is not a good film for kids! besides the fact that the content is so crude, the movie is just stupid has bad flow and has no intelligence behind it. what a waste of a perfectly good story. if you read the book when you were younger and loved it, then don't waste your time watching a movie that so badly botches it that it makes you angry. buy your kids the book instead.
