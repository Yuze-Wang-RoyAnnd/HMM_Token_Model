i had to watch this in school. and to sum it up...<br /><br />talentless actors, talentless script, and a talentless director.<br /><br />this movie is such a waste of your time. don't even watch the movie. don't bother. you will be so disappointed. my teacher said it was supposed to be good. how wrong she was. she even slept through it a little. the movie's actors were just bad. the best actor in there was the old man and that's not saying much. it's has horrible plot with awful characters. so unrealistic and i can honestly said it had no point. the script was unemotional and confusing. there was points in the movie when i furrowed my brows and said, "what?". also there were just too many loose ties and plot holes. it was just absolutely horrendous.
