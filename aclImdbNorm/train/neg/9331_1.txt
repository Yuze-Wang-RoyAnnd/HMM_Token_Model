are we talking about the same movie? this movie is totally ridiculous, the plot is disgusting and completely without logic. its a typical straight to dvd/tv-movie including all the necessary ingredients for a horrible movie experience: over-acting by has been actors, side steps from the plot that are left unexplained, the girl shows her t*ts(why, god, why??), people do not react to things as they would in real life. i'm not even gonna bother you with details, it would take all night. well, ok, just one: if two people were murdered in front of you as you were walking down the street, one of the victims practically dies in your arms, his blood spurts from his head-wound all over you, would your first concern be; "oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!"? my thoughts goes to harvey and his lost career.
