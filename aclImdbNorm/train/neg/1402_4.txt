dynasty revisited in hawaii... full of clich'es, highly predictable, unrealistic and sometimes even stupid. if you have nothing better to do however, it does provide 40 minutes of simple, unpretensive entertainment, endless looks at great male and female muscles and very good photography of the spectacular hawaiian scenery. on the other hand, if you are looking for anything more than that, stay away...<br /><br />oh, and by the way, if you have ever worked in a hotel or know anything about running one, you have two options: 1. you will feel sick every two minutes at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents hotel business or, 2. look at it as science fiction comedy as i did, lie back, relax, and laugh about it!
