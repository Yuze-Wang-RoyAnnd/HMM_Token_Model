i'm working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and revolt of the zombies is one of the movies in the set. i am watching them with my soon-to-be seven-year old daughter, which makes most of these movies a laugh riot.<br /><br />i had high hopes for revolt of the zombies, after watching white zombie, which is really the precursor to so much that is the mainstay of zombies in cinema (think clive barker's serpent and the rainbow and james bond's live and let die funeral scene, not night of the living dead).<br /><br />however, even though the title includes the word "zombies," it is little more than a love triangle, involving anthropologist armand louque, who is smitten with claire duval; who in turn is taken with his companion clifford grayson. what a yawn-fest, my daughter fell asleep half-way through.<br /><br />i had a real hard time deciphering who these people worked for -- the allies or the axis; but, i guess that doesn't really matter.<br /><br />i was shocked to see bela lugosi in the credits for this movie; but, of course those were his eyes (from white zombie) serving as the mind-control device for the zombies.
