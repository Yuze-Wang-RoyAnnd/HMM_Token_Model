there are only two movies i would give a 1/10 to, this stinker and "the man who fell to earth." i remember seeing protocol at a theater in the early 80s when i was in high school. the script is insulting to anyone (including a high school student's) intelligence. it completely lost me with the "hillarious" gag of someone getting shot in the butt. goldie hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic. then there are offensive stereotypes about arabs, followed by goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble. the acting was terrible, including goldie hawn's. i could not stand to see another movie she was in until imo she redeemed herself in everyone says i love you. this is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing. the worst.
