this is a truly terrible film.<br /><br />i'm only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it. if i have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film i shall die happy.<br /><br />unutterably dull, although since it stars al pacino i was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen. then the credits rolled, and i realised i had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel.<br /><br />i cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at imdb (over 5 stars when i last saw the voting). are you people voting ironically?<br /><br />please, please, please do not watch this film!
