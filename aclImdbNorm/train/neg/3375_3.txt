hi, everyone, if you saw "singing in the rain," you remember the scene of gene kelly dancing in the rain. you also remember the dance number of donald o'connor, "make 'em laugh." if you saw "royal wedding," you will remember fred astaire dancing on the ceiling. if you saw "jailhouse rock," you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by the king himself.<br /><br />that is what is missing here. there could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation. the closest was chuck mcgowan's "i can do that." the mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance film. richard attenborough was to blame for this failure. he pointed the camera at the stage and thought that would be a good thing.<br /><br />yelling at people auditioning for a part in a broadway production is not entertainment. michael douglas would be just as badly cast if he were in a western or a comedy. he is ok when he is in a michael douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we would like to yell at. it does not work here.<br /><br />the cast was good except for michael, of course. a good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production, but someone should have thought about how to film it.<br /><br />next time they do one of these i hope they call me first.<br /><br />tom willett
