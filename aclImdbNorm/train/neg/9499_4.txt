i thought the movie was a poor documentary. nothing of substance was discussed. it seemed to cheapen the ideas and did not provide anything new. the film lacked wonder or romance or anything that would really drive one to science. most scientists appeared "stereotyped" and sometimes weird. a woman said that her awards didn't matter a whole lot, only children that were helped. she said that after a 10 minute scene where she explained all her awards. playing "humble scientist", are we? "i have equations dancing in my head," another said. i don't see how that explains anything to us. it hasn't covered significant effects of science on our culture. politics of science were barely touched.<br /><br />not a bad flick for a 10-14 year-olds. other than that, i felt it was boring and unrevealing.<br /><br />4/10
