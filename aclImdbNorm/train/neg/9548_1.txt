i can't believe i watched this expecting more. it starts out ok. this movie pushes the limits of reality way to far!! at least the first one was somewhat realistic. it rips off the first movie and even mentions the joshua project. anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie. it does have one good message in it though, watch out for big brother!!! the movie just makes it seem like big brother is way bigger than he actually is in reality. that was very aggravating. even the make-up on the actors was completely bad. some of the acting is pretty good. some of the acting is really bad though. the script was ok at some points and completely messed up at other parts. this movie plays on convenience about every five minutes. like i said, i can't believe i watched it expecting more. i think i am gonna pop in the original to get back to earth...q
