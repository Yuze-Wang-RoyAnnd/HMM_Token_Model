i saw this movie twice through a pentecostal church my family attended in nanaimo bc in the 1970's. i was of the tender age of 6, my brother 4, then again when i was 8 my brother 6. this movie terrified my brother and i and shaped how we viewed the world with distrust. it wasn't just the movie, but it was also the philosophy that engulfs so many "christians" about the "mark of the beast"and the rapture. this movie, the church, and a volatile neglectful upbringing, lead to severe paranoia towards the future. for years, i lived under the delusional affects of the church and fear of being forgotten by christ. i am now 40 years old. went through years of counseling. i once explained to a psychiatrist this movie and the belief system of the church and family. i was pegged with a delusional disorder. i actually began to believe this, it was my brother who reminded me, that this cultic philosophy actually happened. i no longer fear the future, i have come to terms with the fear injected into it's members by the church. i have taken this experience to fulfill a purpose, i am nearing my licensure as a psychologist specializing in childhood trauma.
