it is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many levels. the script, the acting, the directing and the choice of cast are all appalling. the costumes, sets and pseudo-medieval language are also utterly awful. in an odd way i actually enjoyed this film, once i had accepted that it wasn't going to be any good. it seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor, when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise (albeit not very believable!), but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragons and knights, that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films. let's just hope that the lord of the rings is a bit better! oh, and david thewlis' haircut makes him look like he-man. it does!
