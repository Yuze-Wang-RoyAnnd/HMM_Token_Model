my teacher taped this and showed it to us in child care to demonstrate how teen pregnancy affects people. it just demonstrated how teen pregnancy affects a childish jock not properly educated on how sex works and a whiny, unloved girl who throws fruit when angry and couldn't tell she was with the wrong man even if he wore a sign stating he was such. i wouldn't be surprised if the father of the baby had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script. stacy's (the carrier of the baby) mother is a riot. she is oblivious to the fact her daughter is past the age of four and is seemingly unshaken when people spy on her through her dining room window. bobby's (the father) best friend's name is dewey, and is an obvious rip off of sean penn's character in fast times at ridgemont high. this movie is horrid, simply because none of the characters are believable. thank goodness it's only made for tv, limiting the public's chances of viewing it.
