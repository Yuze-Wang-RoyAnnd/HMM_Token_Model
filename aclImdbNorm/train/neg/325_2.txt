having decided some time ago to collect the films of billy bob thornton (on the strength of class movies like "sling blade", "a simple plan" and "the man who wasn't there" amongst others), it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there. what i didn't realise however, was that there could be one this bad. i'll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: "knock knock", "who's there?", "the big stinking man", "the big stinking man who?", "the big stinking man - is you!". yes folks, it really is that bad. billy bob is only in it for about two minutes (i guess he needed the work at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is painful. for some reason though, although it's undeniably awful, i don't hate it. that's probably because i save my ire for any high budget, special effects laden junk like "the fast and the furious" and not a "no-budget" flick like this one. 2/10 at a push.
