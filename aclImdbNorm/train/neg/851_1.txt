after just finishing the book the same day i watched the movie, i knew what was supposed to happen. i had high expectations of the movie, because of the rating. the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie. i have a couple main points for not liking this movie.<br /><br />********** spoilers **********<br /><br />1. the casting. jack nicholson barely fits into jack torrence's character. also, i would have never picked shelly duvall for wendy. i pictured wendy much differently. i can see why they picked jack nicholson though, the grin, the pointy eyebrows, but he's not supposed to really look 'evil'. he's supposed to look normal, and he turns evil. also, they make one of the worst movie couples. danny was alright, he needed more life though. he acted way to droney.<br /><br />2. the screenplay. they cut out so many things that were in the book, and added things. some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted, changed, or handled wrongly. some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to seeing (the hedge animals, the roque mallet, the elevator) were not in the movie, and it was 2 and half hours!! i was extremely irritated.<br /><br />3. the ending. the ending was changed completly, halorann died, jack froze to death, wendy never got hurt...the overlook didn't blow up. the ending was so cool in the book, and the movie messed it up so horribly, i was apalled. hallorann was never supposed to die, but jack killed him with an ax. if they wanted to kill him, at least have jack use a roque mallet. you never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie.<br /><br />there are other things that i didn't like about the movie, but there are things that were all right. the camera angels were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (didn't happen in the book) was cool, but maybe i was too irritated that the movie didn't go with the book, to try to be scared at all. i reccomend reading the book, before you see this movie. i applaud stephen king for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis stanley kubrik any more. i would never have done that, i would have taken all the rights i could get to yell at him all day. i can't wait to see the 6 hour version, at least it has the hedge animals.<br /><br />rating: 2/10
