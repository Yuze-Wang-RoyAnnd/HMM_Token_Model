this is one of those films that i remember being in the can for years before anything happening w/it. i don't think it's terrible, but it's not really good either. alec baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is it kind of flimsy at best. the cast is pretty good in what they're given, but again you are only as good as the script. baldwin directing this although i could have sworn he didn't direct all of it, i thought i read somewhere or lots of re-shoots wasn't bad but he definitely has some potential in there. although his work on "30 rock" is nothing short of genius & should keep him busy for a little while longer. i just hope the show bows out gracefully a la seinfeld, but maybe not even that long. 9 years it went. so if you want to see a film that you won't get much from, but won't really hate either well this is for you. i can't remember the last time a film had been wrapped so long before finally being released & only on dvd at that. it was nice to see alec baldwin & anthony hopkins again together since their excellent yet not much people have seen "the edge." now pick up that excellent film for some real entertainment.
