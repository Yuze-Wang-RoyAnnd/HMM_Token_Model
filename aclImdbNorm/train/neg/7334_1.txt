i consider stuart bliss the worst movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />the acting was terrible and the plot ludicrous. i get the fact that the main character's wife leaving him triggered a mental breakdown, but it got so silly and boring, after a while i could have cared less about any of the characters.<br /><br />the movie kept going over and over the same ideas without anything fresh or surprising to add to the plot. the whole thing with the geiger counter got too much after a while after stuart started opening up his wall to see what was behind it after the counter indicated something was there.<br /><br />then there was the repetitive scenes with the flyer, and the confusing ones where he meets himself.<br /><br />i should have guessed that this movie was a flop when i didn't recognize any of the actors. do yourself a favor when this movie comes up, read a book! you'll be better off.
