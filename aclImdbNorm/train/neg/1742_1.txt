well, maybe i'm just having a bad run with hindi movies lately. i asked the video store guy for apharan (prakash jha) but being a new release, wasn't available yet. so i had to settle for this one. it turned out to be the stupidest hindi movie i've seen (and i've seen quite a few). no wonder bollywood is the laughing stock of the whole world! if imdb had negative ratings, i would give garam masala a -10.<br /><br />i remember seeing a tv show about the jazzy premiere they had for its release in mumbai. all the usual celebs and their sideys showed up. for some strange reason, people expect good stuff from piyadarashan. i did not like hulchul, hungama, or his other films. hulchul, probably dubbed from tamil or telugu, came across as very loud, in-your-face fare that again didn't make much sense except in a bollywood flick. this latest piece of utter cxxp proved that this guy has no brains. who made him a director, even a bollywood director at that??? <br /><br />anyhow, to the film now. what starts off as a romantic escapade turns into a non-sensical woman-hunt. two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment (isn't it similar to no entry where the 2 dudes work for a gossip magazine and share an office? jezuz christ, now they're copying their own stories!) well anyways, there's some cook or chef that tries to help one of the dodos in his quest for multi-lateral love (aka multi-tasking + multi-timing). what happened in the end, i've no idea. i switched off mid-way. what ridiculous junk. i can't believe they even released it. and how sadistic to wallow in their own filth! for which audience did they make it - the poor illiterate indian masses (700 mil at last count) or the well-heeled nri desis staying in phoren? either ways it doesn't matter. neither group has any clue what makes a good movie and probably deserves such god-awful stuff.<br /><br />its a short review because there's nothing to write about but the usual bag of f-grade garbage. bollywood should change its name to follywood. and yes, this review is much better than the movie itself.
