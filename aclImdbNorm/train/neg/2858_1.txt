this has to be one of the worst movies of all time. the graphics were horrendous, the acting was b-movie and the effects were just plain nintendo 64 qualified. you would think that they would put a little more effort into it. of course, it is a scifi channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rate, but this one takes the cake. hell, i'm still laughing. so, as a shake-your-head in disbelief movie, this one does well. <br /><br />although it appears to have some 'known' actors and actresses in this, it is difficult for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort. <br /><br />the graphics might have been good in the '60's or even early '70's but come on, this is 2009! i wont give spoilers out, let's just say that if you have played "jurassic park" on the nintendo 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this film<br /><br />it is definitely not worth the 2 hours it took to sit through the thing
