please, even if you are in the worst of the moods, refrain from watching this flick. <br /><br />i don't think whether anything was right with this movie at all. on a friend's recommendation i watched this and i literally flushed 1h and 48 min of my life down the closet. poor acting, stupid direction, weak storyline and pathetic action sequences - and when you blend this together you get "double impact". even least of the expectations were not met. <br /><br />i guess i did learn one thing - never watch van damme action flicks. they are pure wastage of time !
