this film has the kernel of a really good story. the work of the men and women of the coast guard, especially in the north pacific, is the stuff of heroes and legends. this film mucks up a good story with three endings (none satisfying), a couple of unneeded and pointless bar fights and two alleged "romantic" relationships that have as much spark as dead campfire. the rescue scenes are great - even if the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal - but the backstory is lame and disappointing. costner is good - especially his hand acting (watch for it). ashton kutcher is flat but not terrible. the main female characters are one dimensional. the best female is one of the coast guard sailors in the rescue center and she's on camera for about two minutes in the whole film. it could have been an excellent film - and costner needs one!
