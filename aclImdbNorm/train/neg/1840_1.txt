this has to be the most brutally unfunny "comedy" i've ever seen in my life. ben stiller, jack black, and christopher walken as a crazed homeless man can't make me laugh? something's got to be wrong with this picture. this is the only movie i've ever felt like walking out of. i used free passes, and still felt like i wanted my money back. i can wholeheartedly say that the only movie i've ever seen worse than this one was house of the dead. the. only. worse. movie. i laughed very slightly at the merry-go-round scene, and that's it. spending 2 hours in something billed as a comedy should get you more than one laugh, right? i don't know, i guess the filmmakers thought that "flan" was a funny word, or something. and the other running joke really is beating a dead horse--literally.
