a female vampire kills young women and paints with their blood. she has an assistant who doesn't want to be a vampire, so he has to do what she orders or be turned into a blood sucker. after a few kills, the assistant gets remorse and falls in love with a homeless girl.<br /><br />what can i say about this movie ? that its pacing is over-slow, that it has some strange sound effects (never a bite sounded so strange) and ambiance (new jazz here i come) and that lights don't seem to be included on the set. it looks like an "auteur" horror movie with all the self-sufficiency inside.<br /><br />the plot is completely stupid and as you can guess, it's the female vampire who explains how to kill her even if she doesn't have to do it; of course, crosses, light, garlic and sticks don't work.<br /><br />it's not even a funny lousy movie. perhaps with some friends and a lot of beers, it can't have its funny sides (to be honest, it's funny during 10 - 15 minutes near the end of the movie). don't be fooled by the troma sticker, it's one the bad movie they present.
