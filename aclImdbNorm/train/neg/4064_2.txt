this movie is extremely boring, it tells a story of a female gas station owner and her life. nothing exciting ever happens. the director has really "kept it real" and it feels just like a camera following a woman around as she lives her life. i had to watch other films by this director for a class, the others were not as boring. this film was also watched for an assignment...it better be worth the boringness with a good grade!! overall, unless it's required, don't watch the film. but don't discount other films by this director, because they're not as bad...and don't discount other films about africa, they're usually good, especially when done by a western director.
