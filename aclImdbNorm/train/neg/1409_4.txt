not really spoilers in my opinion, but i wanted to cover myself, nevertheless. as the executive producer, morgan freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 items or less, a movie with an intentional indie-feel, and just be absorbed in the mentor/be-all-that-you-can-be theme. he plays a alternate universe, semi-washed up version of the real morgan freeman, who is chauffeured in an old econovan by a kid all the way into carson, ca from brentwood to research his next movie role. why carson, is a mystery to so. cal residents. he could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the san fernando valley and found the same elements. paz vega is pretty to watch, a cross between salma hayek and penelope cruz, playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for moragn freeman's research. his character is only known as "him" to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people-"psst, that's 'him,' etc. unfortunately, i was too distracted that him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in brentwood, carried no cash or debit card, or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him. if one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like him does, then i gotta see cash and a blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which him definitely has. nothing really happens in this movie. i don't believe that either of the main character's were substantially changed by their encounter with each other. it flirts with the idea of adultery, but then that thought fizzles. this to me was similar to steve martin's shopgirl, without the sexual affair. it was self-indulgent for freeman and unconvincing to the audience.
