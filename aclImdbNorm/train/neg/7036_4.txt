i'm not ruining anything when i inform you that you get to see a woman have sex with a goat in this movie. if that is your thing, then your movie has arrived.<br /><br />a woman and her husband go to see her estranged sister in the family mansion in the woods. her sister is a creepy lady to say the least, and she seems to have interests that go beyond family love. on the side a group of unsavory characters show up and begin enacting all kinds of pagan rituals.<br /><br />the plotting is pretty weak and the characters are pretty dumb. the woman sticks around even after her husband starts turning into a jerk and hanging out with the pagans, even continues the have sex with him. on the exploitative side of things, there is much bared flesh and a couple of kinky couplings, but nothing that hasn't been better somewhere else. oh, and the aforementioned goat-sex scene.<br /><br />most viewers won't make it to the end. exploitation fans will ride it out, but will be left wanting more.<br /><br />4/10
