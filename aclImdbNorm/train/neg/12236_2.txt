quite simply this shouldn't have been made. it's predictable and clich'ed. the on screen chemistry which made the first "my girl" so captivating is nowhere to be found here, and the acting as a whole is stilted and forced. the writing also leaves much to be desired, some of the 'memorable' lines such as "earpeircing a barbaric custom" are just shocking. where "my girl" provoked a genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments, like so many sequels "my girl 2" tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience, and fails miserably. maybe i'm being hard on this film because of how great the first one was, but quite honestly it insults the quality of the original with the sort of drivel this installment serves up. surely this has to come close to "son of the mask" as being one of the worst sequels of all time. in both cases, the old saying rings true; "if it ain't broke, don't fix it".
