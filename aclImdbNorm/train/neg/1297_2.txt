i basically picked up this movie because i had seen kitano takashi's brilliant remake of zatoichi and was in the mood for another updated samurai tale which also starred asano tadanobu. these two movies are worlds apart. zatoichi added humor and depth to its characters and subverted traditional samurai movie clich'es. gojoe goes off the deep end in the other direction.<br /><br />first off, i hate movies that have other characters inform the audience what the main character is like instead of having the character develop over the course of the movie. "you cannot decide whether you are a monk or a warrior" says almost every character in benkei's presence, yet this inner turmoil is barely conveyed within the character himself. instead of character development, we get bloated, boring, gory battle scenes. asano's character is undeveloped and even he looks like he is bored and doesn't know what he is doing there. i know that he usually looks distant and cool and that is part of asano's appeal, but this movie doesn't serve him.<br /><br />a lot of the camera movement is nauseating. there is a scene that goes on forever in which the camera spins around the main characters until my wife and i felt like vomiting. the ending is ridiculous and rather anti-climatic. <br /><br />its too bad that really good samurai movies aren't being made in japan nowadays with this type of budget. the colors, scenery, and costumes were great, but the rest is just a loooong waste of time. i would rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth.
