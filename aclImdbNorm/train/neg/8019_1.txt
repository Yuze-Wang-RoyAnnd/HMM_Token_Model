i read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly. i have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful. it pains me to write that since i would have hoped this would have been great, or i wouldn't have bothered to see it the other day. i like supporting indie cinema, especially if they are gay-themed, but this movie is almost too much to tolerate. those that walked out, as i considered doing after about three minutes, probably didn't mind shelling out $11.00, or just figured it was going nowhere, fast, and not going to improve. maybe i am slightly more optimistic than they are..either that or they didn't pay to get in in the first place.<br /><br />logan is bored. he's a klutz. he's gay. i'm okay with that. the problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also! there are endless scenes of this kid just laying around like a load of laundry, re-establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc., etc...nothing or no one goes anywhere. no one says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting. probably most appalling of all is that i didn't feel the slightest bit of empathy for logan. that in itself is a major accomplishment. he didn't grow, he didn't change, he didn't learn (there is no one to teach him anything), he didn't do anything, and neither did the movie! scene after scene of the same thing do not a movie make.<br /><br />additionally, the title makes no sense at all. 1/10.
