i saw this movie on mystery science theater when it was called "it lives by night". that title is much less misleading than "batpeople". in fact it would more accurately be called batperson. this movie is about a doctor who studies bats i am thinking because he wants to make a better cure for rabies. this is not really clear. what is clear is that he and his wife take a tour of a cave and he gets bitten by a bat. why a scientist needs to take a tour to study bats is beyond me. shouldn't he be able to go in by himself. well after being bitten he and his wife go on their honeymoon where he starts having fits. they go to the worst doctor ever. the guy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse. in the end the guy kills 3-4 people and his wife stands by him and you are supposed to be rooting for him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders.
