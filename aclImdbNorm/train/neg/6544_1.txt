i paid one dollar for this dvd and at first i was feeling ripped off, but then i started thinking about it and i should be grateful. i have found a holy grail, a real touchstone of bad cinema. if you think the opening dramatic shots of an empty stadium successfully fizzle with evel's awkward camera address monologue, then wait until the opening credits roll on the chauffeur's butt. the script seems to be pasted together from press clippings, and esl textbooks. but..... i just can't believe how bad george hamilton is. he seems to have absolutely no connection to anything he says, the only internal monologue i can detect is "gosh i bet they think i am cute. really cute!". this is an epiphany! i now know how bad it can get.
