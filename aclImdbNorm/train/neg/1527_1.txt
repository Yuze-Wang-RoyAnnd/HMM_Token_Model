if you really, truly want to waste two hours of your life, do the following: <br /><br />1) look through the tv listings. 2) find the movie 'men in white'. 3) when 'men in white' comes on, sit and watch.<br /><br />and that's it. after sitting through two hours of bad puns, dreadful (and not that funny) movie references, and experiencing something with possibly the lowest production values ever made in recent history, you will have wasted two hours of your life, and wonder exactly why.<br /><br />why did i do this? i was stupid enough to think that this film might actually be some good. it wasn't.<br /><br />but, on the other hand, if you're old enough to remember power rangers, you might spot some familiar faces during the film. presumably to save on production costs, saban (who also make power rangers), decided to liberally sprinkle old monster costumes from everyone's favourite tacky toy-spawning franchise throughout the film. i spotted quite a few old monsters from episodes i saw from when i was a kid, so i guess it could at least be said it has some nostalgia value.<br /><br />but, if you want to see actual power rangers monsters, go watch power rangers itself. it's much better than this piece of garbage. (and that's saying something!)
