i was raised watching the original batman animated series, and am an avid batman graphic novel collector. with a comic book hero as iconic as batman, there are certain traits that cannot be changed. creative liberties are all well and good, but when it completely changes the character, then it is too far. i purchased one of the seasons of "the batman" in the hopes that an extra bonus feature could shed some light on the creators' reasoning for making this show such an atrocity. in an interview on the making of "the batman," one of the artists or writers (i'm unsure which) said that "we felt we shouldn't mess with batman, but we could mess with the villains." so, they proceeded to make the joker into an immature little kid begging for attention, the penguin into some anime knockoff, mr. freeze into a super-powered jewel thief, poison ivy into a teenage hippie, and countless other shameful acts which are making bob kane roll over in his grave. <br /><br />to sum it all up: i wish i had more hands so i could give this show four thumbs down. it squeezes by my rating with a 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the batman name. warner bros...rethink this! please!
