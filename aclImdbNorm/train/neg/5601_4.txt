i only watched this because it was directed by lucio fulci and featured claudio cassinelli, an actor i like. i was certainly disappointed.<br /><br />the idea that condemned prisoners would fight to the death for tv ratings has been overdone with rollerball, logan's run, blade runner, and the new film, death race, which will certainly suck me in because it stars jason statham.<br /><br />this was just a bore for the most part. the "kill bike" action was ridiculous. the "training" was a snooze-fest. it just never grabbed me and made me want to care about anyone, including "dallas" star jared martin or fred williamson.<br /><br />pick one of the others mentioned and you'll be better off.
