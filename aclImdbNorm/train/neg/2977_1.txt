title: zombie 3 (1988) <br /><br />directors: mostly lucio fulci, but also claudio fragasso and bruno mattei <br /><br />cast: ottaviano dellacqua, massimo vani, beatrice ring, deran serafin <br /><br />review: <br /><br />to review this flick and get some good background of it, i gotta start by the beginning. and the beginning of this is really george romeros dawn of the dead. when dawn came out in 79, lucio fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it zombie 2. that film is the one we know as plain ole zombie. you know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark! ok so, after that flick (named zombie 2 in italy) came out and made a huge chunk of cash, the italians decided, heck. lets make some more zombie flicks! these things are raking in the dough! so zombie 3 was born. confused yet? the story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we've seen in a lot of american zombie flicks that we have seen before this one, the best comparison that comes to mind is return of the living dead. lets see...there's the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. canister gets released into the general population and shebang! we get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh. a bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel. they gotta fight the zombies to survive.<br /><br />there was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie. first and foremost, lucio fulci the beloved godfather of gore from italy was sick. so he couldn't really finish this film the way that he wanted to. the film was then handed down to two lesser directors bruno mattei (hell of the living dead) and claudio fragasso (zombie 4). they did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good. you see fulci himself didn't really have his heart and soul on this flick. he was disenchanted with it. he gave the flick over to the producers and basically said: "do whatever the hell you want with it!" and god love them, they did.<br /><br />and that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great fulci credited as its "director". the main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore! there's no substance to it whatsoever! after the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it, the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies. now in some cases this can prove to be fun, if #1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and #2 there's a lot of gore and guts involved.<br /><br />here we get neither! well there's some inspired moments in there, like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people. that was cool. there's also a scene involving a flying zombie head (wich by the way defies all logic and explanation) and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs. but aside from that...the rest of the flick just falls flat on its ass.<br /><br />endless upon endless scenes that don't do jack to move the already non existent plot along. that was my main gripe with this flick. the sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non-existent. i hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished! i like my b-movies, but this one just really went even below that! its closer to a z-level flick, if you ask me.<br /><br />the zombie make up? pure crap. the zombies are all asian actors (the movie was filmed in the philippines) so you get a bunch of asian looking zombies. but thats not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway. its the look of the zombies that really sucks! they all died with the same clothes on for some reason. and what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up (more like smudges) on their faces. one or two zombies had slightly more complex make up, but it still wasn't good enough to impress. its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces. so not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap. these are supposed to be dead folks! anyhows, for those expecting the usual coolness in a fulci flick don't come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody else's flick. and those two involved (mattei and fragasso) didn't really put there heart and souls into it. in fact, when you see the extras on the dvd you will see that when fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick, he doesn't even take it to seriously. you can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they "just had a job to do and they did it". and that my friends, is the last nail on this flick. there's no love, and no heart put into making this film. therefore you get a half assed, crappy zombie flick.<br /><br />only for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made. everybody else, don't even bother! rating: 1 out of 5
