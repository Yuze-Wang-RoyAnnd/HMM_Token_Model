murder and insurance fraud take an adulterous couple to "the end of the line"...<br /><br />tv was visually vulgar back in the early 1970s and this truncated, made-for-tv knock-off hurt my eyes. it can't possibly compare to the 1944 billy wilder film noir classic as anyone in their right mind ought to know -sight unseen- but that doesn't mean this update should be seen as a separate entity, either. although based on the original paramount screenplay, there's over half an hour cut out and the director's bland indifference makes what's left imminently forgettable. with rare exception, the younger generation wasn't interested in watching old black and white movies on tv back in 1973 (still true today, alas) so this lurid, compelling tale was new to the overwhelming majority of viewers; then as now, ratings rule and cashing in was its only reel raison d'etre. gus van zandt remade alfred hitchcock's psycho for similar reasons and if these redux led to the seeking out of the original films or novels, so much the better. i loved the james m. cain source novel enough to tune in back then and i enjoyed this time capsule curio the second time around for the longish hair, halter tops, turbans, ugly decor, and lush auburn locks of "guest star" samantha eggar, who didn't try too hard. in addition to recognizing a few of the incidental cast from a childhood spent in front of the boob tube, lee j. cobb was able to hold my interest as a world-weary, tired-looking keyes but richard crenna's affable and inoffensive walter neff only reminded me of bill bixby on a bad day. improvement upon the original was, of course, never intended in a rush to make a buck but, instead of a mindless retread, a new adaptation of the novel would have been a novel idea. cain's book differs somewhat from its celluloid incarnations and the horrific shark fins in the moonlight ending is killer. the completist in me is thankful this speeded up "me decade" update was included as part of the double indemnity dvd extras but the experience not only made me long to see the original, it had me nostalgic for any episode of the better-made columbo tv series. i also flashed back to a very good 1973 abc tv movie of the week that i haven't seen since its initial airing: john d. macdonald's linda starring the beautiful stella stevens as a ruthless femme fatale who murders her lover's (sexy john saxon) wife and then frames her mild-mannered husband for the crime and, if i remember correctly, there's also an open-ended ending. like double indemnity, it was needlessly remade with tv movie queen virginia madsen as the titular vixen and richard thomas as the milquetoast husband.
