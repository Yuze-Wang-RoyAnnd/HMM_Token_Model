one of the worst romantic comedies (nay, worst movies) i've ever seen. boy (who works as a phone psychic!) must pretend to be gay to move into apartment with woman of his dreams. hilarity does not ensue. boredom, light gay-bashing, and horrible dialogue do. if you read brad meltzer and like his crappy dialogue, you'll like this movie.<br /><br />be smart. avoid this. if you see it, destroy the copy.
