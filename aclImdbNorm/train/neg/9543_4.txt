let's face it-- if you rented a stdvd sequel of a forgotten 80's gem, and expected it to be better than the aforementioned, then you are an idiot. wargames: the dead code joins the long running list of unnecessary sequels that the dvd market has filled so easily. movies like this don't need spoilers, because you already know them.<br /><br />the "plot" for this "film", is as follows: nerd meets girl; girl likes nerd; nerd likes girl; nerd gets accidentally involved with top secret government computer; nerd and girl go to another country; nerd and girl end up being persecuted by government suits in the other country; nerd and girl meet some important old guy that dies at key point in the "film"; nerd and girl are captured; the top secret government computer gets crazy; nerd is hired to beat top secret government computer; nerd beats top secret computer by using the same old top secret computer from the first wargames "film"; nerd saves the day; nerd gets laid. <br /><br />the end.<br /><br />the acting, script, effects, score, and cinematography are what you would expect-- b-grade. some familiar faces are in here, and unless you are a mega fan of colm feore, then you should avoid this one. granted, the movie won't make you insane enough to eat your own toes by seeing it, so if you like cheap looking stdvd sequels, then you are right at home.<br /><br />sadly, mathew broderick was too involved with some "masterpiece", that he couldn't even do a five second cameo in this one. but can you blame him?
