normally i'm not motivated to write reviews. but this movie was so excruciatingly painful i feel i must. i cringed at the appallingly predictable plot, the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense. indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the "most tense" moment of the movie. molly ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production. even the "twist" at the end wasn't. i've heard it said that the movie didn't take itself seriously; but i could find little evidence of that in the movie.<br /><br />cut should have been left on the cutting room floor. do yourself a favour and spend your time and money on something else!
