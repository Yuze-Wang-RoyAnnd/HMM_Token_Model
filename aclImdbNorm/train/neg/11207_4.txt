as an avid fan of the flashman books by george mcdonald fraser, i looked forward immensely to seeing flashy on the big screen when this film was first released. sadly it was a huge disappointment then - so i left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again, but it was no better the second time. mr fraser is a tremendously skillful writer, but i am not a fan of his film screenplay work with richard lester. the penchant for slapstick spoilt 'the three musketeers' for me and the same applies here. to me, the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong. the flashman books are uproariously funny in parts, but they are adventure novels. there is much seriousness in the way the adventures that flashman has - after all, he is involved in dangerous situations. this is conveyed in the novels, but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style. it is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book. when i first read that the book was to be filmed, the article said that the film was to star oliver reed. i rejoiced, as reed to me was the epitome of flashman. how i would have loved to see him in the role. malcolm mcdowell is a good actor, but does not fit the visual image of flashman created by the books (too scrawny looking! flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow). neverheless reed was excellent as bismarck. what kills the film is that it is made as a comedy. the only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which flashman kills de gautet (tom bell). a great shame, as the production values, costumes, sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent - just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from malcolm mcdowell. possibly the directorship of richard lester was responsible for the way the film is, as a recent radio adaptation of 'flash for freedom', adapted by mr fraser, worked quite well. perhaps one day we may see flashman done justice on screen.
