this installment of masters of horror was terrible. apparently, mr. carpenter needs to learn a thing or two about pacing and decent, plausible dialog. there were times when i literally shouted at the tv for something to happen. maybe he thinks he building suspense, but carpenter needs to trim back that overdone, over-simplified musical score of his (or his son's) and advance the action a little bit. how many times did the girl say, "oh no, i can't have this baby!" and "oh, no here it comes"? carpenter takes elements from much, much better films (assault on precinct 13 and the thing) and throws them in here as if we are supposed to acknowledge and appreciate his trademark style. what is lacking here is genuine suspense and energy. it's as though he's sleepwalking through the process of movie making. <br /><br />for better carpenter films, stick to the tried and true classics-- the thing, halloween, and they live. for better masters of horror episodes, check out my personal favorites: family, jenifer, and dreams in the witch house.
