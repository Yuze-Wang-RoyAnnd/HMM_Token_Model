when a movie like "the dukes of hazzard" brings in over $75 million it makes some incredibly sad statements about the condition of our own society. either we are collectively too stupid to stay away from trash like this or maybe i'm just not realizing how many people this kind of no-effort trash will appeal to.<br /><br />hollywood has had no incentive to make good movies since if it puts out trash then people will see it anyways since there is nothing else on screen. this is that. i walked out despite getting a free movie pass. the dialogue could not be dumber. the stunts could not be more over-the-top and outrageous. perhaps this "bigger that big" image appeals to texans but it didn't appeal to me nor anyone else in the theater. none of the "big names" were in this career-ending flick, except for burt reynolds, which says all you need to hear. jessica simpson -- don't make me laugh.<br /><br />i wouldn't even recommend this film for video, even if you were desperate. this was all about fooling the public to make enough money after opening day to equal or do better than it cost through marketing. they did despite the public being forewarned. stupidity abound.
