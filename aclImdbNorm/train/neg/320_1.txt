with adam sandler.<br /><br />this is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made. it's about cruise ship waiter shecky (sandler) wanting to be a comedian on the cruise ship. first off, there is not one funny or clever line in the entire movie honestly. it is so unfunny it's pathetic. there is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor, but the f-word is plentiful. the budget is really low, and that also ruins the film. it takes place on a cruise ship, but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras, one of which is billy bob thornton. the opening credits are animated reeeeeaally cheaply, and it is just pathetic. i hate this movie and everyone else that sees this will hate it too.<br /><br />86 mins. rated r for language.
