i guess that "gunslinger" wasn't quite as god-awful as most of the movies that "mystery science theater 3000" shows, but westerns just aren't roger corman's forte. portraying rose hood (beverly garland) becoming sheriff in an old west town after her sheriff husband gets murdered and having to fight off baddies, the movie is pretty predictable. john ireland is rose's new hubby, secretly working for unctuous allison hayes (yes, the 50-foot woman). also appearing briefly is frequent corman co-star dick miller as a mailman (miller nowadays stars in joe dante's movies).<br /><br />i do wish to assert that you'll probably want to watch the "mst3k" version to really enjoy this movie. they had a great time with it.
