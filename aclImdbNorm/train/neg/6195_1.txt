badly made. dreadful acting and an ending that the director appeared to contrive out of nowhere as the film had frankly been nothing short of dull. shocking that this film is considered for an award at the gij'on film festival.<br /><br />everyone that came out of the theatre was of the same opinion as i - what was the point of even making the film? the references to iraq were either bizarre or just not thought through properly. i am astonished that this film has been given a release - very, very disappointing and a waste of my time. sorry, terribly negative review but hopefully will deter some people from making the same mistake. what a pity we did not have a q and a at the end of the film - now that could have been interesting.
