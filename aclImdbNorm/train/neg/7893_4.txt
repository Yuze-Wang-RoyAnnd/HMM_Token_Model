at the beginning we get to see the start of a secret council of some sorts. it all looks very promising from the get go. with some supernatural elements thrown in, the mystery gets more interesting by the minute. the main character who seems like a good bloke gets into trouble because of his claim for money he is entitled to (temptation) and other factors. you really empathize with the guy and you want to know what exactly is going on. normally a person in his situation would have several options. somehow he does not have those options. in this movie there only seems to be one solution even when it is clear it is not his fault. out of the blue he encounters characters who talk about church,prayer and god. and they provide the answer for his problem. it should be obvious at a point in the movie what this solution is. now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. since it always is helpful. but was it really necessary to disguise this message. this religious element actually ruined the viewing experience for me. while the message is good,it's simplicity can't escape the fact that in real life more needs to happen to resolve issues presented in this movie. the mystery that is presented to us never gets solved. in stead you are forced to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot. don't get fooled because of malcolm mcdowell. the once brilliant actor is adequate,but if you watch closely you will see that he is not serious at all. he really must be desperate for money. otherwise what would posses an actor of his caliber to act in a movie like this.
