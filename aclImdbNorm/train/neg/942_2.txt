saw this late one night on cable. at the time i didn't know that the girl billed as "shannon wilsey" was actually porn star savannah, but she was so beautiful (and got naked so often, thank god) that i actually sat through this brain-rotting drivel. i like cheesy flicks as much as the next guy--more than the next guy, actually--but this was way beyond cheesy and more into rancid. the truly annoying overacting by the mad scientist and the director's, writers' and special effects people's virtually total incompetence detracts from the gratuitous nudity that is the movie's only saving grace. savannah, before she turned into the plasticized barbie doll she became as a porn queen, is really interesting to watch--she's drop-dead gorgeous, bursts into uncontrollable giggling at times, glances off-camera and laughs and just generally seems to be having a really good time, which is more than can be said for the audience. for even though savannah and her colleagues spend a fair amount of this picture naked, it still can't hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid, badly made and annoying movie. if you know someone who has it on video, or if it comes on cable some night, check it out, but don't waste your money on a rental.
