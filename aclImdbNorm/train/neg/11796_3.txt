is nothing else on tv? are you really bored? well, then watch phat beach. however, don't rent it and definitely do not buy it. that would be a big mistake.<br /><br />i watched this on tv and found myself laughing at certain points. i did not laugh long and i did not laugh hard. however, there were subtle jokes and comments i laughed at. if you are looking for an extremely funny "hood" movie then watch friday. if you are looking for a powerful emotional movie (something that this movie tries at..kind of) watch something like hoop dreams or jason's lyric. if you are lookin for some good black "booty" go watch a dominique simone porn flick, because the nudity in this movie is nearly non-existent. however, if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable, go ahead and watch it. you will be slightly amused.<br /><br />***3 out of 10***
