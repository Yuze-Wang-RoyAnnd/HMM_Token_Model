was this movie stupid? yup. did this movie depth? nope. character development? nope. plot twists? nope. this was simply a movie about a highly-fictionalized springer show. it shows the lengths that some people will go to get their mugs on tv. molly hagan did a great job as jaime pressly's mom. jaime is....well...gorgeous! this flick wasn't so much made to be a "breakthrough" movie, rather, it was intended to life in a trailer park (i live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie) where everyone sleeps with everyone else, all the girls get pregnant by different guys, and all the guys drive rusted-out '66 ford pickups (exaggeration, of course, but that's the picture everyone sees when you mention "trailer park"). some people over-analyze movies (case-in-point: star trek freaks). i watch movies purely for the entertainment value; not to point out that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene (read the "goofs" bit about connie's shirt. could it have been better? sure. but it was funny as hell.
