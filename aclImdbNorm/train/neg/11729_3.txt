virgin is selected to marry rich guy. rich guy urinates. woman on boat likes sailor. sailor urinates. virgin attends gross-out commune dinner. man urinates on dinner table. boatwoman does strip tease for little boys. man pretending to be baby urinates. there is an underlying theme here. makavejev is trying to say that he is pi$$ed off at the world. to say that this is a bizarre movie is an understatement. to justify the title, there is a scene where laure, who hardly speaks ten lines the whole movie, bathes in chocolate syrup. it is a sweet scene indeed but the rest of the movie leaves a bad taste in one's mouth unless one happens to share the director's fetishes.
