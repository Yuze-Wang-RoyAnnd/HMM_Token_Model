"power play" starts off interesting but it goes down hill fast. the only good actor is tobin bell and he has a very small part. beyond bell, "power play" has no redeeming value or interest. "power play" has more earthquakes in a few days than california has in a year. the earthquake scene in the mall is so contrived and completely unbelievable. and all the action scenes look like a bunch of third graders putting on a play. it's awful, simply awful.<br /><br />bottom line, if "power play" was made in the 60's or 70's it would be considered a poor "b" class movie. the fact that "power play" was made in 2001 is really sad. is there such a thing as a "d" class movie? if so, "power play" casts the mold.
