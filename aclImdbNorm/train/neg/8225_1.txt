do not watch this sad excuse for a film. i have wasted time and money on this and am pretty p**sed off about it.<br /><br />the acting is comparable with high school plays. the script is shocking. there is no plot. twenty minutes from the end (which i believe i should be rewarded for reaching) i had a headache from all the screaming, crying and wailing the five girls make.<br /><br />the majority of the violence is (rare for a film nowadays) suggested rather than graphically depicted but i found the characters so damn irritating that i wanted to see them, and indeed every single person involved in the making of this piece of s**t, die in the most horrible ways possible.<br /><br />i spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very poor 100 minutes of yours. don't do it.
