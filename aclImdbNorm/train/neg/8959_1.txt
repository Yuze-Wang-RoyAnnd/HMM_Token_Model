some people might consider this movie a piece of artwork - to be able to express your imagination on film in order to create a movie filled with antagonizing pain and death.. i personally think that this movie is a disgust, which should have never been released. this movie is repulsive, illogical and meaningless. not only is it a complete waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come. the appalling images shown in the film not only make you grasp for air but they set in your mind and it takes days to forget them. such a shame that people waste their imagination on such inhumane suffering.. "kill bill" would be another example but at least "kill bill" has its purpose, meaning, climax and resolution..
