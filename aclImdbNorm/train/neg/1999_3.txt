at the end of this episode holmes asks watson not to record the case for posterity.for a good reason! the super sleuth left his little grey cells(sorry agatha)at home for this tale. there is no deductive reasoning,no acute analysis of signs at crime scenes. holmes bumbles along fifty yards behind the plot. the dastardly cam is finally dealt to by an old frail-in a manner that would have made charles bronson's heart swell with pride-six bullets in the breadbasket.in an ensuing chase a pursuer gets hold of one of watson's shoes.mercifully the writer didn't decide to tack on the story of cinderella to lengthen the film.the murderess,holmes and watson,escape scot free. oh well,it is a bit of a change of pace in late victorian london.a bit of sixgun law:-)
