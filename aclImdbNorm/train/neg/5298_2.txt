i rented this movie because i was browsing through the horror movie section for those movies that no one's heard of and could be a possible gem. i saw this and, since i'm a fan of violence and gore, i got it. it got the rating of em which means: extremely mature. thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else, i got it. the warning on the box said: extreme violence, extreme langauge, and nudity. the "extreme violence" struck my fancy. the movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick. it had one or two gory scenes but i've seen worse in a pg-13 movie. of course the amount of gore in a movie isn't all that counts, right? you have plot also. well, the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it. don't rent it. i speak the truth. i can't imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point where they say: "i'm gonna rent that again." it had it's moments where it kept you going but i'm never going to see that film again.
