from watching only the trailer to theodore rex, you would think this is a bad buddy cop comedy with whoopi goldberg and a guy in a dinosaur costume. that is true, but this is mostly a futuristic story, which looks a lot like batman forever with it's direction style and weird character designs. it was mismarketed, and should have been marketed as a futuristic tale, instead of just a lame cop comedy. whether or not this movie is mismarketed, it's still a horrible movie.<br /><br />in the future, dinosaurs have been brought back to life through amazing technology, and they talk and walk around like humans. teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously, but after a dinosaur is murdered, he's given the case to work on, but he has to be partners with the toughest cop of them all, katie coltrane (whoopi goldberg). it's up to this mismatched duo to solve the murder, and it's up to the audience to stay awake long enough to make it through this piece of crud.<br /><br />teddy starts the picture as a normal acting character, but by the end he is unbearable to listen to. for some reason along with being a detective, he's also a bad comedian and a bad impersonator. he does imitations of famous people and accents, and has some truly awful lines. whoopi blames him for farting and he says, "it's not my butt trumpet!" wow! what a puerile, immature line, even for a kid's movie of this caliber. whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. i was hoping teddy would bite her head off the entire length of the film.<br /><br />this movie never knew what it wanted to be. when the futuristic scenes and action occur, there is no comedy or humor. in any non-action scenes, the characters try to be as funny as they can, which just results in nonstop straight faced boredome. the action scenes don't work as they're too weird and not violent enough, and as stated earlier, the comedy is just a bunch of massacred jokes. nothing ever works here.<br /><br />having a dinosaur/human detective duo seems like a pretty original movie, if nothing else. nope! this movie is a huge rip-off of who framed roger rabbit. just replace dinosaurs with cartoons, and set it in the future, and it's the exact same plot. a man is killed, a dinosaur is killed. a dinosaur and detective solve the murder, a toon and detective solve the murder. the bad guys in roger rabbit are christopher lloyd and weasels. the bad guys here are a guy who sounds like christopher lloyd and guys who act just like the weasels. the club scene in roger rabbit where jessica rabbit walks down the stage is imitated with dinosaurs. this is a huge rip-off of a much better movie!<br /><br />overall, this is a bad movie, not even deserving of it's straight to vhs stature.<br /><br />my rating: 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins. pg for mild violence, language and crude humor.
