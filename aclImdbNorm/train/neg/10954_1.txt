if there was a 0 stars rating i would gladly hand it out to this absolutely horrid pile of waste. the fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it had been made different it could have been brilliant only makes it worse. the basic task of locking up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine, but wheres the experiment? all i see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture i don't know or want to know about... the challenges are pathetic and silly. the whole point of reality tv is to show reality. if you set a 'challenge' don't make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in 'friday night games'. make them do an actual challenge. and as for 'earning' prize money, thats fine, if they actually earnt it! these people are nuts. if only they would make the show better, the actual idea would be glorious. but that ain't gonna happen!
