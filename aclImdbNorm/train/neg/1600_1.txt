the biggest national lampoon hit remains "animal house", and rightly so. it was funny, raucous and good-natured.<br /><br />the exact opposite of every other national lampoon film. including "class reunion".<br /><br />please do not be fooled by the inclusion of stephen furst ("flounder") from "animal house". or by the fact that john hughes wrote this jumbled mess. this reunion is about as hilarious as root canal and twice as painful.<br /><br />one star, and that's being generous. then again, i always thought most of my old classmates were demons, vampires and serial killers, too.
