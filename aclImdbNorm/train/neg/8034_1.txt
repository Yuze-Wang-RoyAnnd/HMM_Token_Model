i know slashers are always supposed to be bad,but come on,what the hell is this?it's like a bunch of 10-year-olds saved their lunch money and started filming this by the end of their week.<br /><br />anyway,six young people all go to the same house to get killed off screen.we have the brainy one,the slut,the other slut,the black guy,the killer,stereotypes like that.after one gets eaten by a shaking boat,the others all get stalked by some guy who wears a mask the people at the poor box rejected.there's one pretty decent murder somewhere in the middle,but then it's back to even more boredom,and especially more false scares.seriously,we actually know it can't be the killer when a person gets attacked because the guy sure loves to take his sweet time for everything.<br /><br />after every character you expected to die dies,the standard ugly blonde chick and her soon-to-be-boyfriend eventually get captured by the killer(they get like,pushed down and then faint)and the killer reveals himself.i think the writers of this movie just took a blindfold and a pen and put it somewhere on the list of characters.the motive is just lame and don't even get me started on the damn secret.the killer then of course takes way too much time to explain everything(and then about ten minutes extra in which he slices up his own arm for some reason)and eventually gets overpowered by a guy with a gun.hey,no fair!<br /><br />really one of the most awful movies i've ever seen.i could enjoy myself more by watching a lindsay lohan-movie,i swear.i mean sure,most 80's slashers sucked as well but at least they threw in some t&a.this movie just has nothing going for it.
