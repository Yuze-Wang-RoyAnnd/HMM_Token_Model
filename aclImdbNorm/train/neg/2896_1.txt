i couldn't bear to sit through he entire movie. do families like this really exist somewhere? there have been many comments describing this family as akin to llbean models and such, and i think that that is a great description of how they behaved.<br /><br />more absurdly unbelievable writing/acting occurs as we meet a character referred to in high school as "pigface" who, of course, has grown into a drop-dead gorgeous 20-year harvard-educated plastic surgeon (but only to do good in the world-not for the money,) and she beds steve carrel on the first date. that's when i quit watching...<br /><br />if you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours, then perhaps you'll enjoy this sentimental, self-indulgent waste of time.
