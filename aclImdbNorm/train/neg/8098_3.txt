this is one of the most atrocious rewrites i've ever viewed. if they want to make a movie with a lousy story, they should refrain from giving it a title of a fine book. there is hardly a relation between wolfe's book and this movie other than the title. i don't mind changes if they help a story flow on screen. at least the changes shouldn't hurt the final product. the last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing. the actors are miscast. the director and/or screen writer obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon.<br /><br />if you've seen this movie and disliked it, try the book. if you've seen this movie and liked it, read the book.
