this movie is nothing like "office space" except in the premise. office space was hilarious. i would not recommend this movie to anyone, as i laughed not once during the entire film. mr. cornbluth's self-indulgent tirades quickly become more annoying than 15 jason alexanders in the same room. if you decide to see this movie, use a free rental or watch it at someone else's house so you can leave if necessary.
