i'm beginning to see a pattern in the movies i give a 1 to. they are almost all movies that my wife made me watch. maybe i should stop having faith in her taste in movies. anyway, this is typical drivel aimed at pre-teen girls but done even more poorly than usual. once again, the writer broke the cardinal rule of any movie. he/she made the main character unlikable. she starts off by being a complete b*tch to her friend at the beginning, and then finds out when she becomes 30, that she's basically a sh*tty person (having affairs, etc.). why the f would we feel for this person? ok, let's say we can get past that. jennifer garner is about as far from attractive as you can get without having some sort of deformity. i don't know if it's her or the writer's fault, but her character goes well beyond my threshold for annoyance. here's a tip for future filmmakers: 13 year olds are not entertaining, they're annoying. far and away the most embarrassing moment in the movie came when they danced to "thriller". holy crap that was painful. it showed her practicing that dance at the beginning. that explains why she knows it, but an entire club full of people?!? argh!!! the macarena would be more believable! all of a sudden she's completely incompetent and has no clue how to do her job and no one notices? at least tom hanks' character on "big" had a job that made sense to a child. these body-switching/child becoming adult overnight movies are really getting out of hand, and this is by far the worst one yet.
