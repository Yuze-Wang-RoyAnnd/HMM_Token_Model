i am a huge fan of the comic book series, but this movie fell way below my expectations. i expected a heavy metal 2000 kinda feel to it.....slow moving, bad dialogue, lots o' blood.....but this was worse than anything i could have imagined. <br /><br />the plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points pretty much stop there. the characters don't have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series. the movie only covers a small portion of the comic, and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts. the focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic book.<br /><br />with the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing. sadly, it wasn't that way, so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love. my copy will surely collect dust for years until i finally throw it out.
