i have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest/worst attempts at one. a lot of the scenes work in a plug-and-play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic-comedy genre. usually this is okay because we're dealing with a genre, but the challenge generally resides in making it original, new and inventive. this movie fails to do so.<br /><br />there is no sense of who the characters really are, apart from sylvie moreau's (who is the real star of this movie, not isabelle blais). they fit into this one-dimensional clich'e and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrative.<br /><br />the pacing of the movie can become annoying, rhythm lacks, and the editing is filled with unnecessary close-ups. i should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally, or rather, making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious. of course, along with that, you have the right-on-cue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatched.<br /><br />i can't believe that a movie who makes obvious woody allen allusions ends up being this deceptive. if you expect a good light-hearted romantic comedy, this is not it. or rather, this a poor attempt at it. you will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are far superior quebecois directors making better flicks.<br /><br />les aimants is a good movie for what it is. but it's a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteur's.
