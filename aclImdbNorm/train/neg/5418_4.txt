this movie is like the material s.e. hinton was writing in the 1970s and copola was adapting to the screen in the early 80s, and, had trueblood actually been a product of either, the results might've been much better (especially in the acting department). instead, we get a rather so-bad-its-funny piece of mediocrity.<br /><br />jeff fahey plays ray trueblood, a former street rumbler, i suppose is the accurate description. this was in the days of action movies that used guys in their 40s and mid30s and dressed them up in greaser threads or some kind of more effeminate selection of gang garb and they fought to lousy 80s music. nonetheless, ray is the lone caretaker of his younger brother, donny (chad lowe in a part where he screams a lot), who he is forced to leave behind inexplicably in a train station when, on the run from the cops, he is nabbed and forced to serve time in the marines. flash forward to present day and ray is back in town and looking for his brother who has also become part of the street gangs, although in a gang that was ray's adversary and now old scores must be violently settled (and again, cops must be dodged and this time, a lady's honor defended in the action film sense) before ray can carry on life at normal pace with his brother, donny.<br /><br />for the most part, the film is quite ridiculous. for me, most of this has to do with far too much overacting, although not by fahey or sherlyn fenn who plays the waitress he befriends. the guys in the gang and lowe himself seem to do quite a bit of needless exaggerated as new york street toughs. although, the bigger hang up is recycled plot lines and perhaps a kind of movie that was well past its prime as a product of 1989.
