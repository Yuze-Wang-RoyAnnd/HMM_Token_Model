i went into this with my hopes up, by twenty minutes into the movie i couldn't have been more let down. despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake, i kept my hopes high that maybe...just maybe someone would get it right this time around. sadly, prom night is about on the same quality level as the recent april fools day remake, bad script, bad direction, cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror.<br /><br />from beginning to end it's boring, repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls. we've seen it all before and we've seen it done a million times better then this. if you go to see prom night in the theater (i'd say wait for the dvd or ppv), get ready for the audience to laugh, because laugh they will. the laughs aren't at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny, they are in response to key "thrilling" moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of scary movie. seriously, was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof? the film makers missed the mark so badly here, that a large number of the audience in the theater i attended walked out about halfway through the movie. which in retrospect, i wish i had done. not me though, i had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better. needless to say it didn't. the "horror" scenes are a joke, not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction, the script, the "special effects" and the camera work. the movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it, but still came out of it with a micro budget movie. i halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking i would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere. <br /><br />this movies scary alright, if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed.
