just looking at the sets, staging and editing it is easy to tell this project lacked a proper budget. maybe bela lugosi is meant to take your mind off of things like that. young brides drop dead at the altar after saying "i do". their corpses are stolen by a renowned horticulturist dr. lorenz(lugosi)and a couple of his freakish minions as his aging wife(elizabeth russell)needs injections of the glandular fluids of the young virgins to remain forever young...forever beautiful. an eager local cub reporter(luana walters)realizes that each missing bride wore the same rare orchid to the altar; an orchid in which dr. lorenz would be most knowledgeable. a typical horror movie storm brews making a visit to the lorenz estate a bit spooky; especially with a dwarf and a slobbering hunchback on the premises. other players: angelo rossitto, tristram coffin, minerva urecal and frank moran.
