wow it's ironic since this movie has been out for awhile i think that someone else just reviewed it a couple days ago.<br /><br />anyways, i watched this movie simply because it has nick stahl, for the record.<br /><br />the movie was ridiculous. the characters drove me insane, they were so clich'e and stereotyped. this movie had some of the worst dialogue i have ever heard. it had way too many plot twists too.<br /><br />there is one scene in the movie worth seeing however, the scene: "warm heart, cold gun" where nick stahl kills the obnoxious girl in the shower. (well, actually they were all obnoxious.) but his acting in that scene was excellent. the look on his face, it reminded my of american psycho (a good movie). the scene is worth seeing but not worth seeing the rest of the movie for, do yourself a favor and don't watch it.
