spoilers. strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this film. allow me to add balance by pointing out the following:<br /><br />script: dreadful. as tom and dan are "getting to know each other," bantering about films, the talk is clearly that of one person, and i suspect it was the director, who carefully worked his words to sound intelligent. at one point, dan asks, "have you heard of the hiv virus?" and it sounds about as natural as asking, "have you communicated with the nine alien races?"<br /><br />acting: white teeth do and a chiseled face do not a sensitive performer make. speedman did well enough with what he was given, i suppose, but marsden was terrible -- unsympathetic, unbelievable, and downright smug and smarmy throughout his captivity. there is an emptiness to his performances (also see interstate 60).<br /><br />plot: spare me! the moments of half-escape were not thrilling but irritating and weak. recall marsden pretending to try keys in the door and then throwing them down: "they don't work, man!" tee-hee. and beware the semi black-and-white flashbacks, which are initiated with some schlocky sound taken from csi and other crime dramas. <br /><br />most important of all, most dangerous, evil, and offensive, is the homophobia (external or internal, you decide) in a film in which hiv is considered a weapon. tom says that dan may have taken off the condom or not used it at all -- excuse me, where was tom while they were having sex? there is some villainizing of the inserting partner which comes off as a villainizing of the gay man in general.<br /><br />in sum: beware!
