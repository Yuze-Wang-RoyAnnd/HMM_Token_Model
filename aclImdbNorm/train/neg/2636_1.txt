i saw the film tonight at a free preview screening, and despite the fact that i didn't pay a dime to see this film i still felt ripped off. ladies and gentlemen, time is money and if you see this film you are leaving a benjamin on your seat. the acting is torpid at best; kiefer sutherland phones in his worst impersonation of jack bauer, and michael douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving catherine zeta-jones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey. eva longoria is a non-entity; she looks like she's reading her lines off a teleprompter. and if you can't spot the "mole" within the first 20 minutes, then you just landed on this planet from a world without tv and recycled story lines. if you truly want to see a good secret service thriller, rent in the line of fire. if you see and buy into this one, you'll start to fear for the president's safety because the secret service looks and acts like the grown-up versions of the kinds from 90210. no matter what your feelings about w, let's hope this "art" does not imitate life.
