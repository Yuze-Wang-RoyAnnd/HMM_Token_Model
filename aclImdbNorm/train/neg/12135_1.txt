although it has been 2 years, i still remember the complete waste that comprises the entire plot of the movie. unfortunately, i came across this movie after my friends and i selected it while browsing through the new releases at blockbuster. we decided to pick the movie because it was the only one we all had not seen and it sounded like it may be enjoyable. although it has been quite some time since i viewed the movie, i still remember the lack of plot (seriously, there is no true plot), and complete waste of time that was spent watching the movie. if you are in the video store and this film catches your eye, walk on and find a better movie. if you did end up seeing this movie, i understand your pain :)
