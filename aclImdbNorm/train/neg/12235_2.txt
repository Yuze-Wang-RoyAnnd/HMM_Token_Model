if you want to know what kind of music white people listened to in 1974, this is the movie for you. but you'll have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins, too (see my remarks on my girl 1 for the reference).<br /><br />indulgent admission: i approached my girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance, having just viewed its predecessor. but as an adoptee preparing to finally set upon a search for my birthmother, my girl 2 made me look, with its theme of searching for mother.<br /><br />put another way, anything i liked about my girl 2 had nothing whatsoever to do with my girl 2, but relating to a protagonist who asks, like so many adoptees, "who's my mama"? and if there are home movies of my mom in an acting troupe, i'll be sure to make my own movie about it.<br /><br />people are listless. movies should not be listless. my girl 2 (like my girl 1) is just...listless.<br /><br />avoid unless you're a complete sap who's comforted by a series of small annoyances.
