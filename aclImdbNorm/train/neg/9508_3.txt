this movie looked like it was going to be really funny. i was very excited to see it but was very disappointed. it was very unrealistic. the plot was also pretty weak. i was expecting it to be really funny but the jokes weren't even that good. i was also really disappointed with the ending. i would not recommend this movie to anyone.
