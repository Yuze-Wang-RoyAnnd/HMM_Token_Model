this apocalyptic zombie film tries to be vicious and shocking; but feeding the masses comes off lame as some of the stiff-legged zombies stalking the streets. in rhode island, a zombie epidemic known as the lazarus virus is being played down by the government manipulated newspapers and television stations. a couple of brave, but dumb, souls at channel 5 tv news feels its audience is being given false hope and no idea of the real danger at hand. an eager reporter(racheal morris)and her cameraman(william garberina), with the aid of a military escort(patrick cohen), risk life and limb to present a 'live' broadcast to show the doom at hand. do yourself a favor and don't watch. this thing is obviously very low budget and comes across with the feel of a high school play gone bad. acting is atrocious and the flesh-hungry zombies are almost comical. also appearing are: michael propster, william decoff and brenda hogan. feeding the masses should be left to starve.
