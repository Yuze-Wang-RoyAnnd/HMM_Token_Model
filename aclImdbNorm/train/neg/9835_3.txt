before i explain the "alias" comment let me say that "the desert trail" is bad even by the standards of westerns staring the three stooges. in fact it features carmen laroux as semi- bad girl juanita, when you hear her mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as senorita rita from the classic stooge short "saved by the belle". <br /><br />in "the desert trail" john wayne gets to play the moe howard character and eddy chandler gets to play curly howard. like their stooge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53- minute movie is moe hitting curly. wayne's character, a skirt chasing bully, is not very endearing, but is supposed to be the good guy. <br /><br />playing a traveling rodeo cowboy wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been good-the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar (actually even less after wayne robs the box office). no explanation is given for wayne's ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl. <br /><br />things get complicated at this point because the villain (al ferguson) and his sidekick larry fine (played by paul fix-who would go on to play sheriff micah on television's "the rifleman") see wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager. moe and curly get blamed. <br /><br />so moe and curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to smith and jones. who do they meet first but their old friend larry, whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest (senorita rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie). <br /><br />larry's sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful mary kornman (now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of hal roach's "our gang" shorts). kornman is the main reason to watch the mega-lame western and her scenes with moe and curly are much better than any others in the production, as if they used an entirely different crew to film them. <br /><br />even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film- making is staggeringly bad. the two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse. both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground, but there is no horse in the frame, the film stock is completely different, and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider. there is liberal use of stock footage in other places, none of it even remotely convincing. <br /><br />one thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where moe and curly get on their horses and ride away (to screen right) from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left. the cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse. outside of home movies i have never seen anything like this, not because it is looks stupid (which it does) but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner. they would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action. or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background. <br /><br />then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.
