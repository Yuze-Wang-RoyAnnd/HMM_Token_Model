i have to say i was really looking forward on watching this film and finding some new life in it that would separate it from most dull and overly crafted mexican films. i have no idea why but i trusted sexo, pudor y lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non-existent industry. maybe it was because the soundtrack(which i listened to before i saw the film) sounded different from others, maybe it was because it dared to include newer faces(apart from demian bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors) and supposedly dealed within it's script with modern social behaviour, maybe because it's photography i saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical. the film turned out to be a major crowd pleaser, and a major letdown. what serrano actually deals here with is the very old fashioned "battle of the sexes" as in "all men are the same" and "why is it that all women...;" blah,blah,blah. nothing new in it, not even that, it uses so much common ground and clich`e that it eventually mocks itself without leaving any valuable reflexion on the female/male condition. full of usual tramps on the audience like safe gags about the clich`es i talked about before(those always work, always) and screaming performances(it is a well acted film in it's context)..and by screaming i mean, literally. the at first more compelling characters played by monica dionne and demian bichir turn out to be according to serrano the more pathetic ones. i completely disagree with serrano, they shouldn't have been treated that way only to serve as marionettes for his lesson to come through...he made sure we got his message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only solid ground in which this story could have stood. anyway, it is after all, a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it (if you accept to be manipulated by it).
