i got this movie because i worked at a movie store so i got free rentals. it came in, and the cover made it look alright. hot chick, carrying a weapon, alright, i'll check it out.<br /><br />oh man, bad move. this was so horrible, i spent half the movie watching in fast-forward to get to the nudity, which was minimal. i think maybe three scenes of partial nudity.<br /><br />cheesy dialogue, crappy violence, poor excuses of characters. i feel bad putting this movie down, because i know it was made on a cheap budget, but so was "clerks" and it became a cult classic and a franchise.<br /><br />2/10.
