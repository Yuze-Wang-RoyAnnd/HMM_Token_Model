apparently, the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so-called "movie." they described "blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence." i saw no "intrigue." i instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie. i saw no "violence." at least, i saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with "impervious" skin--but here i am perhaps revealing too much of the "plot." furthermore, as a viewer of many and sundry films (some of which include the occasional kung fu movie), i can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable. whatever you may choose to do, i will always remain<br /><br /> correct,<br /><br /> jonathan tanner <br /><br /> <br /><br />p.s. i was not blinded by the choreography.
