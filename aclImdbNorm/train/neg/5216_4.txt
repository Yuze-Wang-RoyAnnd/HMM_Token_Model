'metamoprhis' is the story of a dashing young scientist, revered at the local college, is brought under investigation by financial providers for the college. this forces him to take shortcuts in typical bad-hollywood melodramatic fashion.<br /><br />my first thought after this movies conclusion was this. "not good, but not bad, for early-to-mid eighties." of course, i then realized that it was made in 1990, which almost propelled it down to a '4', but decided to keep it at the mediocre '5' that it is.<br /><br />'metamorphis' does on a few occasions, seem like a good movie desperately trying to get out. the acting, while not stellar, is mostly competent. you can even see the occasional glisten of a modest quality. pacing is a large problem with the movie. after thinking i had been watching for ninety minutes, i realized i'd only been watching an hour. special effects aren't stellar, but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around that weakness.<br /><br />the lead, a mildly charismatic male that seems to be attempting a blended channeling of tom cruise and christopher reeves, reminded me mostly of matt dillon's character in 'wild things'. the female heroine does an ok job, but does not distinguish herself in anyway. there's a 'naughty girl' role in here, and the actress does what she can with it, but it doesn't seem like much. there is a child actor that the director can't decide if he's morose, cheerful or just weird. <br /><br />pacing, as i said, is the worst problem with this movie, until a final battle with the bad guy that would make a power ranger blush. it is bizarre and inexplicable, until the final scene which is supposed to be dramatic but simply hilarious, saturated with every bad camera trick and overacting that can be compressed in about thirty seconds.<br /><br />a decent one-time watch on the 'mill creek 50 chilling movie pack'. nothing that is going to bring you back, and nothing to buy on its own.
