<br /><br />this movie (not a film -- clearly recorded on a cheap cam-corder) may be one of the greatest cinematic stink-bombs in history. beware: the packaging advertises the flick as an erotic exploration of sex-addiction. the film is not an exploration of anything, and it is no more erotic than staring at one's own warts. the script is pointless and meandering, with all plot elements serving as segways between supposed sex scenes. however, even the sex scenes are lame lame lame. except for the first, they are around three seconds long (then again, maybe my version was cut) and comically overwrought.<br /><br />if you are looking for a decent film, you don't want this. if you are looking for a titillating sex-flick, you don't want this. whatever your life's goals, desires, or perspectives, you do not want to watch this movie. how they got rosanna arquette, natashia kinski, and ed begly to act in this stink bomb is puzzling in the extreme.
