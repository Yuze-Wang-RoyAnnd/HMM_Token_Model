whoo-boy, that was definitely one of the worst flicks i've seen all summer. granted, it was on sci fi, and i don't watch much sci fi, but man, talk about a razor thin plot and two dimensional characters to the max.<br /><br />the characters were stereotypical and overdone, the plot and setting were unbelievable, the vampires were less intimidating, more funny-looking, the gore was unnecessary, the special effects were down-right horrible, and the ending? well, the only thing unpredictable about the ending was when suddenly the tomboy becomes a lesbian and starts to do it with the female vampire, which, by the way, isn't really all that hot considering it occurs for about three seconds, in which you're closer to "what the hell?" then "man, that's hot." if this ever appears in reruns, god forbid, don't watch it.
