another american pie movie has been shoved down our throats and this one is the worst one of them all. it doesn't deserve the name american pie. they should have stopped at "the wedding".<br /><br />this movie feels like just a stupid porn movie which they slapped the title american pie on. when i was watching this i felt like i was watching a different series. it doesn't fell like american pie at all. it has different humor and it is much more rude and has many more sex scenes then the other american pie movies.<br /><br />i don't recommend it ever. actually i don't recommend any of the "american pie presents" movies. just stick with the nice original trilogy.<br /><br />2/10
