i wasn't entirely sure what to expect from a comedy, drama, fantasy, sci-fi genre, but, given the actors involved i thought i'd give it a spin. the tone of the film felt awkward, going through patches of each of the genres but never quite felt balanced, so eventually i gave up trying, and concentrated on the cinematography and individual performances, which i thought were good on the whole, considering each character had little depth because of the nature of the story (won't give anything away here). i have to say it felt a lot longer than its 96 minute runtime, and not in a good way. in the end i was looking for closure, some measure of satisfaction but it didn't turn out to be the clever or ingenious piece i had hoped it would be. i think tony mistakenly thought what he did do at the end of the film gave us that... but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with the ill-conceived conclusion. ultimately i feel cheated. imo it would have been better to let it stand without the "ending" as a piece of art... just. or... i may have missed the point completely :)
