it is obviously illegal. pedophiles pray on stuff like this. how did they get away with making such a movie? this movie is all summed up in one word, sick. where do people get off making, and watching these kinds of films. as i was watching the movie i didn't actually think they would allow this kid that is say maybe 12 if that actually sleep with this woman. sorry if this is a spoiler to you but i would have rater not seen this. where has the sanity of these people gone? maybe the makers of this movie are pedophiles? our society today is filled with all types of sexual predators that pray upon children, yet film makers make these types of movies that do nothing but provoke this type of behavior. i noticed that on a previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked. this is a kid here, and someone is asking something like this? what is wrong with this picture?
