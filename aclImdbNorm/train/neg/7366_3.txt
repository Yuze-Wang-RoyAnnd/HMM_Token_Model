what the f*@# was this i just watched? steven stop!! please! this movie is insatiably bad and silly. in a bizarre departure from action and adventure, mr. seagal is now fighting (obviously) wish-they-were-vampire 'like' creatures with super human strength.? ok? oh, and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way? wow! even still in this movie however, to quell seagals have-to-have-the-last-punch-and-no-one-can-kick-my-a$$ ego, he is somehow stronger than they are. however all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him. come on, i can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer, but these are super human strength people. oh and get this, seagal goes through a brief sting of identity issues, because apparently he and his cohorts in the film think he is wolverine! oh my go... and worst than all of that! yes, there is a worse than that. he has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face. they obviously sound nothing like him and i believe it may be one of the other actors in the film. it was pure madness. although i wanted to turn it off i always watch a movie to he end. this is an all time low even for your direct to video movies steven. awful! awful! awful! two thumbs down! redemeption qualities? well i guess so, i will be fair in that aspect. at least some of the special effects were ok, and i like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses. the women all were quite attractive imo. still, and i said still, it does not make up for the blatant x-men, underworld, (insert your favorite zombie, vampire movie here) rip off! the director, writer, producer, all should be bansihed & exile from the movie business. i think i feel the way that most people feel about blood rayne (and just about all other uwe boll pictures) about this film. that's my whole $1.00 on this film. view if you dare.
