tourists head to ireland for a school trip to learn about druids. what they encounter is a horrific tale of cannibalistic killers.<br /><br />if i had to sum up evil breed, it would be a low grade gore fest. the film mixes dead alive, evil dead, wrong turn all in one. it's just too bad that the film has so many inconsistencies to keep track of that it loses any "fun" one would have watching it. the film has lots of random "horror" nudity...although the film also stars four porn stars, yup four, so there could have been plenty more. breed also showcases a good amount of gore. <br /><br />evil breed has a horrible start, with laughable dialogue and horrible acting. that's a given in a straight to video horror film, but this takes the cake. i can't really figure out who the main character is, since the one female who "lives" at the end is not really in the movie all that much. speaking of the ending, that has to be one of the most random and bogus ending in the history of film. it has no purpose with the rest of the film and totally changes one's view of the film.<br /><br />you have to see this film to believe it, since there are some pretty great death scenes. there are two death scenes that come into my mind, one in which the inbred killer rips the intestines out of a naked woman through her chest....yea her chest, don't ask me. the other id when the guy gets his intestines, yet again, ripped out through his asshole. does that kill the guy? no, the killer continues to strangle the guy with his own intestines. these scenes remind me so much of dead-alive, with the right amount of humour in each. i also got the sense of evil dead, with the pointless mentions of horror films and sam raimi. along with halloween, when the female character is in a closet screaming for her life with the killer trying desperately;y to get in.<br /><br />although, the gore and nudity are not enough for the poor audio and visual quality of the film. when the teacher wakes up from her bed and walks down the stairs, her footsteps are so loud and hard that it seems like she was wearing boots. distracting indeed. as well as the continuity in the film, with only one inbred killer? as well as which character dies at which moment. i couldn't tell if the breast implant chick was jenny or gary's sister/cousin...i can't remember. as well as the random naked chick with a dead baby hanging out of her body, still attached with the umbilical cord.<br /><br />the horrible editing is distracting as well, the opening credits are too fast and disorienting. it did have a bad start and got better, but the ending just brings the film back down to a horrible level. if maybe there were better production values and more faith put into this film, then it wouldn't have been horribly butchered to death. stay away from this film, unless you are happy with the below budget horrible bad film with decent gore.
