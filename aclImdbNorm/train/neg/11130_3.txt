despite having known people who are either great fans of noam chomsky, or think he's a tired relic from the 1960s, i really had no opinion of the man, save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist, although i could not elucidate any of his theories, and that he was a liberal socialist with marxist leanings. so, stumbling across the dvd of the 2003 documentary noam chomsky: rebel without a pause, in a used video store, a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9-11, i decided to get it, just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person, pro or con, spoke of him. while glad i got the film, my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was, so what's all the fuss about?<br /><br />for a man with so many degrees, lauded as 'the most important intellectual alive', by the new york times, according to the dvd's case, there sure was not a lot there, intellectually speaking. i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate, and i wouldn't even want to watch what a william f. buckley could do to him. granted, the whole film was seemingly about chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere, and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he'd say, rather than being on linguistics, so maybe that's the reason he came off so badly. but, again, if he is a linguist, and tops in his field, why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise?
