do not waste your time with this movie. this is a total thrash in terms of acting, directing, sound editing, soundtrack... there was such a waste of performance by some of the very good actors. the movie does not do justice to paresh rawal who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in bollywood. akshay kumar who is also an emerging star did quite a poor job. john abraham, what is wrong with him? is that what you call acting? i mean he should thank god that he has a pretty face otherwise he'd be winning razzie awards in india if there were any such awards in bollywood. asrani a great talent, but overdoes his bit as before.<br /><br />screenplay which was not to mention a rip-off from the 1965's boeing boeing was quite badly framed. first of all, people in bollywood just can't make something original. on top of that they don't even know how to copy well. the jokes in the movie were so overdone, it was getting painful to sit through them. priyadarshan may be a star in the south, but he's just not fit to make a decent hindi movie. the sound editing is amazingly crappy. i can go on and on this matter, but the bottom-line is that bollywood should be shameful of making such a film.<br /><br />the worst part is that some people seemed to love this movie. what is wrong with you guys? this is the reason why bollywood is where it is. did you know that bollywood makes more movies than hollywood every year, however, most of the movies are unheard of abroad, because of movies like this one. i am an indian and i am utterly shameful of bollywood for producing this piece of thrash. movies like dil chahta hai and lagaan were just terrific. they are world class films which are timeless... among the best of this decade. garam masala, however, is perhaps one of the worst of this century. period.<br /><br />i give it a 1 out of 10.
