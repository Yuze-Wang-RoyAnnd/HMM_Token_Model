when i finally had the opportunity to watch zombie 3(zombie flesheaters 2 in europe)on an import region 2 japanese dvd,i was blown away by just how entertaining this zombie epic is.the transfer is just about immaculate,as good as it's ever going to look unless anchor bay gets a hold of it.the gore truly stands out like it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx.the sound is also terrific.it's only 2 channel dolby but if you have a receiver with dolby prologic 2,you can really appreciate the cheesy music(actually a very good score),and the effective although cheap sound effects.it never sounded so good,and the excellent transfer adds to the overall enjoyment.<br /><br />i never realized just how much blood flows in this film,it's extremely brutal with exploding head shots,exploding puss filled mega pimples,a cleaver to a zombies throat,a woman's burned off extremities(how come it did'nt burn the guy also),intestinal munching,zombie babies and so much more i lost track.<br /><br />this is no doubt for hardcore zombie action fans,especially of the italian kind.there is some excellent set pieces and cinematography to be found,i think people don't give it enough credit,if you see a clean print,and not some horrendous pirate copy,it's a whole other experience entirely.<br /><br />this film never lets up for a second,and i realize it's inconsistent plotwise,the dubbing is horrible,the acting is stiff,and it's sense of irreverence is celebrated in grand fashion,but that's part of it's charm.<br /><br />to me this is one of the best horror films ever made,you can't make a film this bad,so good,on purpose.it's accidental genius of the highest order.if they played it for laughs it would have been a disaster,but they played it straight as an arrow and the result is a terrific cult classic that thumbs it's nose at any and all traditional moviemaking standards.<br /><br />tons of action sequences,exotic locales,excellent set design,good,sometimes great cinematography,wonderfully cheesy acting,and inconsistent but still interesting plot,great makeup effects,beautiful women who can kick butt,excellent music,and sometimes hilarious,sometimes creepy,but always entertaining zombies.how can you go wrong with this film,it has it all,a cult classic that stands the test of time.
