stupid and just plain weird movie about some kid who becomes traumatized when he finds out santa isn't real (???). he grows up and becomes an adult (brandon maggart) who makes lists of people who are naughty or nice. one christmas he snaps and sets out to kill the naughty people--dressed as santa of course.<br /><br />boring and just plain bad killer santa movie. if you're looking for gore, it's not here. only a few of the murders are shown and they're not that gory with very fake effects. most of the movie just contains brandon maggart talking to himself and slowly going crazy. the script is trite, the acting is terrible and it leads to an ending which had me staring slack-jawed at the tv. seriously, i had to rewind the tape and watch it again to make sure i wasn't hallucinating! really really poor ending.<br /><br />if you want a scary christmas flick rent "black christmas" (the original 70s version---not the terrible remake). avoid this one at all costs.
