when watching little man , you'll spend its running time trying to figure out its many plot holes . and thats not a good sign because this film is supposed to be a comedy ! your supposed to be laughing at it !! but will you ? probably not. <br /><br />the main problem with little man is its concept- its far too ridiculous to accept (even as a cartoonish comedy ), so when the loud , laboured and over the top jokes kick in , they make the whole thing seem ten times stupider than it already is.<br /><br />"but its a comedy " some of you might be screaming. thats true but thats no excuse for such a dumb plot.i mean come on , think about it if you saw a baby with a grown mans face , wouldn't you be the least bit suspicious? and if calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly, why didn't he put it in a nearby shelf instead of a random womans hand bag? and how can a qualified doctor not recognise that calvin is a grown man ? i mean seriously...what ? <br /><br />"its not about the plot , its about the laughs" you might be screaming . well heres the thing see, there are hardly any laughs in little man and that just make the dumb ass plot stand out all the more. <br /><br />if you really want to watch a wayans brothers comedy with a belief suspending plot, stick to white chicks because at least that had a few decent laughs.what ever you do steer clear of little man.
