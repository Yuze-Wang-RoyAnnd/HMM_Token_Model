overlong drama that isn't capable of making any real point. so she became an actress - so what? she learned to love - big deal. there is a certain eccentricity among the characters and in the dialog and situations, but the kind which is bad for the movie, causing it to often seem absurd.<br /><br />summer phoenix, playing the lead, talks and behaves like a semi-retarded person, so there is no choice but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl that makes it in the world of theater - which was clearly not the intended point. we are told early on (in that "barry lyndon"-like narration) that she learned to hide her emotions, which certainly explains her autistic stone-face, but the movie suffers for it. she basically walks around like a zombie, and her success as an actress isn't quite credible given her lack of emotions. occasionally, the movie had that dull, sleepy feel of a dogma 95 movie. is it one? i wouldn't be at all surprised.<br /><br />summer phoenix is sister of joaquim phoenix and the late river phoenix. nepotism rarely works.<br /><br />if you'd like to see my hollywood nepotism list, with over 350 pictures/entries, contact me by e-mail.
