wow. what a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. here are just a few gripes. - the screenwriter eliminated two major characters from the book. - plot has been grotesquely altered. - voiceovers sound as if they were directly lifted from written passages (which may read well but are not the same when spoken, especially with chabon's writing style). - the acting is more wooden than a log cabin. (esp. bechstein) - this is supposed to be set in 1983??? feels more like 2003... <br /><br />to be fair i couldn't bring myself to finish watching this movie, so it's possible that it redeemed itself... (sarcasm). i truly hope that no one paid to see this, or at least anyone who read the book hoping for something decent (a la wonder boys). i like chabon as a writer but he should be ashamed of this adaptation.<br /><br />no stars.
