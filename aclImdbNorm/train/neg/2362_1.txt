the first in the series was brilliant, easily one of the best horror films of all time. this is the crappiest. when i sat down to watch this, i was actually thinking that how bad the fourth and fifth ones were, this would have to be good after the previous terrible ones. boy was i wrong. incredibly wrong.<br /><br />when i watched the first ten minutes of it, i was actually really tempted to turn it off, but i thought no, maybe it'll improve. it didn't.<br /><br />not only is this just a dire film by itself, it didn't need another sequel, because the last two (fourth and fifth) had already been terrible enough! also, how many times can you bring freddy back!? the acting in it was terrible, the story-line was predictable and crap and it also had flaws in it as well. the way they made springwood was just totally wrong. pays no respect to the first one at-all. to add to this, the whole thing seemed really over-the-top.<br /><br />some people are saying that this film was "funny". this film is not "funny" at all. since when is freddy krueger supposed to be "funny"? i would call it funnily crap. this film is supposed to be a horror film, not a comedy. if freddy had a daughter, wouldn't that information have surfaced like in the first one!? the ending was also just plain stupid and cheesy, exactly like the rest of it. this one completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first one. just shows itself up.<br /><br />such a shame that wes craven created something so good in the beginning, yet it has to be dragged down because of this trash that belongs in the bin. they shouldn't have even bothered making this film. nor any of the other sequels, except the third one. the third one's the only decent one out of all the sequels.<br /><br />if this was a dvd by itself and not part of the nightmare on elm street dvd set that i got, i would have chucked it out when i got it.<br /><br />summary: a pathetic and poor attempt at a sequel.<br /><br />- a complete mockery of the first film <br /><br />so please, don't waste your time on this worthless junk.
