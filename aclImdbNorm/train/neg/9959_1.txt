cheap and manipulative. this film has no heart.<br /><br />it's also got dire dialogue, unconvincing characters and a preposterous, or rather non-existent, story. it just lurches from bad to worse in a cynical effort to wrench some kind of emotion from an insincere and unengaging hysterion-afest!<br /><br />and the hedgehog!!!!how many cheap shots can a film take? the hedgehog, by the way, gave the most convincing and watchable performance in this ninety-minute cringe-athon.<br /><br />if you have considered watching this film, don't. i'm sorry but i cannot find a single redeeming feature to this movie. it scores a big, fat zero with me. strictly for sub-dogma knicker-wetters. yawneroony!<br /><br />still, if you liked dancing in the dark...<br /><br />
