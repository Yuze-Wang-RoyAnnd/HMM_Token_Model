i cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema. so after watching the trailer for "water lilies," i expected to like this film because i thought i'd stumbled on something unique: a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love - sort of a female version of "beautiful thing." <br /><br />the main characters are young french women 15 years old. marie is slender, reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way; floriane is outgoing, athletic and beautiful; and anne is loyal, pudgy and behaviorally immature. the erotic interrelationship between marie and floriane is always simmering in this movie, if not at the surface, then just below it. <br /><br />"water lilies," however, is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens; it is about sexual frustration, suffering, ennui, teens working at cross-purposes and - in at least two instances - joyless, mechanical sex. it also proves that screenwriters and film-makers mar their own creations when they become too manipulative.<br /><br />in the extra features on the "lord of the flies" dvd, director peter brook says, "french cynicism starts with the arousal of sex," meaning the french regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism. part of the downfall of this film is film-maker celine sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicism.<br /><br />"where is the joy?" i asked myself while watching this film. yes, first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh, life-affirming way. these positive aspects are missing from this movie; there is no balance.<br /><br />organically, this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love. but sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film. first, what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude? i know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in european cinema, as evidenced by films like "the slingshot; the rascals; the devil, probably; the little thief; murmur of the heart; friends; beau pere" and "europa, europa"; but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion - "see, audience, i can make a film where i show only the unattractive person nude." either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity would've been an honest way to go.<br /><br />there is a scene in a club where floriane and marie are dancing. what follows next is not just floriane cynically manipulating marie; it is film-maker sciamma cynically manipulating her audience.<br /><br />perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when floriane warns marie she's about to request something that is "not normal." marie understandably asks, "who cares about being normal?" then sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie, because floriane's request is a phony, derivative and substitute question - not the authentic, heartfelt question the movie, marie's character and the viewers who've invested their time deserve. <br /><br />here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewer's nerves: 1) since when do the french - of all people - take baths wearing bathing suits, and with a turtle to boot? 2) what teen - of any nationality - would chomp down on an apple core that's been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloved's mouth?<br /><br />the three main actresses are promising and, if they find better vehicles for their talents, may become excellent actors. louise blachere (anne) is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles. adele haenel (floriane) could become a leading lady, or a bombshell, or both. pauline acquart (marie) possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable. in the future, she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaim.<br /><br />all in all, "water lilies" was very disappointing. will an honest film-maker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love! no - not necessarily for the sake of this middle-aged guy - but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with. and yes, to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema.
