the next time you are at a party and someone asks, "the other day i heard the expression 'author's will'. does anyone know what it means?" tell them to sit through 'head above water'. the only way diaz could possibly have survived this movie was by means of this literary device commonly used by bad writers. there are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs. however the film does not stand up to the most minor logical analysis. why does keitel tie diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind? why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course. for me the best part of this movie was that i saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop.
