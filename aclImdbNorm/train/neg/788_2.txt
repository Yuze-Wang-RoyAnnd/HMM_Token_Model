a film with very little positive to say for it.<br /><br />firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama.<br /><br />besides being remarkably slow the empty acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again. i lost count of how many times i had seen "that" field at night or that bit of cracked earth.<br /><br />it also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience don't know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused. so with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it's fine. we find jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre. beth has a key to a warehouse of books? there are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie, much later, in fact too late.<br /><br />and on the point of the acre. horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary
