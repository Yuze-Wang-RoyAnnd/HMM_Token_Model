what else can you say about this movie,except that it's plain awful.tina louise and adam west are the reasons why to see this,but,that's it,but their talents are wasted in this junk.i think that they used a double in some of adam's scenes,like when he's running because you can't see his face.if adam was embarrassed in being in zombie nightmare,just think what he must've felt about appearing in this??? if it was before or after,i'm not sure,but,still,zombie nightmare is a classic(check out the mystery science theater 3000 version first and last)compared to this.the gang is very annoying and over-acting by some of the actors.a rip-off of the wild one starring marlon brando,of course.tina looks stunning though.i hope her and adam got a good paycheck!! pass!
