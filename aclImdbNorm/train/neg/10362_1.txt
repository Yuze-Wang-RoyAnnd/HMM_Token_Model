disney? what happened? i really wish the movie had been set in the 60's ;like the book was. and i really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption..... i'm glad that, maybe, someone might be influenced to read the books..... but, the man with red eyes interchangeable as it? and what's up with the volcanic upheaval? where was that in the book? peter jackson! save us!!!! a long time ago (1978) i heard that there was european version of this film. i sure wish i could id it. i can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption. this movie needs to be x'd.
