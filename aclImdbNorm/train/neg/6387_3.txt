when i first picked this film up i was intrigued at the basic idea and eager to see what would happen. i'm a fan of animation and love it when it's successfully merged with live action footage. however, the animation in this film was about all i enjoyed. although it must be said that the actors' performances were excellent. the visual look - including the animation - gave a wonderfully unnerving air to the piece. however this was quality of unease was lost amongst the overblown imagery, both visual and in the script, that you were practically hammered over the head with. most annoying about this was the relative lack of importance to the plot. it seemed that the plot was shoe horned in at irregular intervals giving a stuttering effect that detracted massively from the flow of the piece. the voice overs from felisberto - especially the one at the end - very much felt like a desperate attempt to fill in gaping holes in the plot which had been ignored in favour of side issues such as the whole ant thing (and even that wasn't properly addressed). i'm afraid the whole piece came across as, at best, a 'reasonable first attempt', by a teenager who has spent far too much time reading dh lawrence. not what you expect from seasoned film makers at all.
