i have to agree with most everyone's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written.the acting was not much more above the lower production values however i feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it. in keeping with this thought i feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer.i am referring to laura harris a canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the hbo hit "dead like me" where she plays the role of daisy adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner.i remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader.i felt as though if anyone might "make it" from this series it surely would be laura harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique nordic blond allure. if you ever do have the opportunity to view this series i recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the 'godfather' or perhaps 'beaches' in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a low-budget reminder of what laura harris can simply state about her time on the show and i bet she would quote many a young actors words of defense by saying "it's a start!"
