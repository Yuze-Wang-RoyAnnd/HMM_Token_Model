... and being let down bigger than ever before. i won't make any direct references or anything here, but to say the least, this film is pathetic. if you're military trained, don't bother watching. i put it on the dvd with 2 friends wanting to watch a somewhat interesting action / war flick. why couldn't i just have read the reviews first.<br /><br />already at the first "bomb" scene the film has huge glitches, and they continue to show and become bigger and bigger. my 2 friends, not connected to the military in any way spotted a couple of the filmmaker's mistakes almost as fast as i myself did and asked me if some of the things going on we're realistic. well, as you might have guessed, they're not - at all.<br /><br />avoid this movie unless you're able to overlook these completely idiotic and re-occurring mistakes being made. 2/10 for catching my interest at first.
