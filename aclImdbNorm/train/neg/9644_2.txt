first thing first . in this genre movie the first thing you need is a good music , and thats where mr. shankar and his party fails.<br /><br />music is completely pale and uneffective. on other hand there is ajay devgan , who has removed a letter 'a' from his spelling , done good job but was of no use to a bad casted movies like this.<br /><br />asin is like a doll which is used to amuse public, even though she is good to look at but her role in movie is to dance, actually she is dancing member of a rock band and i don't think any rock band have there dancer as a member of band.<br /><br />in nut shell this movie is a piece of crap a piece of ***t. watch it if you wanna get fooled.
