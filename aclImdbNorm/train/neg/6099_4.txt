this was a less than exciting short film i saw between features on turner classic movies recently. while the film popped out due to its very intense technicolor, the film itself just wasn't that moving and at times the plot looked pretty cheesy--like this was made for classroom use and capturing the attention of a wider audience wasn't even a consideration. in particular, i really hated how many times in the film things were reiterated--such as when the characters talked to her, they usually said "clara barton" instead of "ma'am", "miss barton" or "clara". plus, one sickly confederate soldier said that he was a "johnny reb, a confederate a rebel,..."--almost like he was the cartoon character mojo jojo from the powerpuff girls. this was just sloppy writing--period.<br /><br />it was interesting to see john hamilton (later, "perry white" on the superman tv show) in a beard as president garfield. yep--it's him under that beard.
