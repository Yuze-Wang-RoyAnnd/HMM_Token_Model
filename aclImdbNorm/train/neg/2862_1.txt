somebody needs to send this uli lommel guy back to movie school. who ever told him he knew how to make a movie? can just anybody make movies these days? in the past, it always required talent before someone could make a movie. after watching this lame btk movie and the others he's made, it seems blatantly obvious that the poor guy has about as much business making movies as i do. actually i think even i could make better movies than uli lame-all. this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the btk killer, other than the names of the victims and the killer. that's it. where did this guy get the big idea that btk killed people with rodents and all the other preposterous crap that's in the movie? this is a classic example of someone trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term "btk" because of the fame it has achieved. absolutely pitiful. the only serial killer movie i would consider worse is that lame "dahmer" movie. that kid smoked so many cigarettes it made me nauseous. whoever made that one needs to be shot.
