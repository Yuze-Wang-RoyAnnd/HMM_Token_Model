why would anyone want to see this?! if this was a film posted on youtube by a teenager, i might have applauded the teen in doing so much with his mommy's video camera. i might have also congratulated his family and friends for doing a good job acting. sadly, it was made by a very experienced film maker and these were, apparently, professional actors--making this a very, very sad film. sad...and very pathetic, actually. as i said, it has a definite made directly to video look about it. it also has narration and acting that just scream "unprofessionals"--how could this be?! the film is filled with lots of corpses and blood. normally this would turn me off completely, as i hate ultra-violent films and don't like seeing all that gore. however, given that none of it is that realistic, it's bearable. however, i should warn you that there are a few scenes that are still pretty disturbing. for example, the scene with the kid throwing a radio into a lady's tub and watching her naked and frying is pretty bad. there are also scenes where you can hear the thought of psychos as they fantasize about killing women. with a level of misogyny that is pretty awful. the people who wrote this are pretty sick--like killing women is meant to be for our entertainment.<br /><br />after a bunch of senseless murders, the film goes to a dining room table--around which are a bunch of goof-balls wearing black hoods without eye holes! they are talking, with pride, about all the murders they have committed and chant. it's all very funny, though i am not sure that was the scene's purpose.<br /><br />then, the film talks about various sex crimes and killings and even vampirism and cannibalism. why, i don't know--perhaps because they people made this got off on this sort of crap. and, once again, you see and hear the thoughts and actions of a creepy german-looking man as he tracks down people and kills them.<br /><br />by the way, considering the film used what i must assume are professional actors, i wondered why so many people were chosen who were clearly germans. while they tried to act like americans and the film was supposed to be in california, the accents are strong. perhaps german audiences watched this and marveled at how "realistic" the acting was, but to any american it's obvious these folks ain't their fellow americans! considering that there really was a zodiac killer (who was never captured), i do wonder why anyone would want to make a "fan film" of sorts for the sick menace?! i mean...was this film meant as a snuff film for pervs? i just can't see anyone else wanting to see this or enjoying it. in fact, i wonder what would motivate anyone to make such a stupid and offensive film?! worthless and deserving to be in imdb's bottom 100 list.
