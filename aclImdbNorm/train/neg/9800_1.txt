mighty morphin power rangers came out in 1993, supposedly based on the japanese sentai television show that started back in the 1970s. now as a fan of japanese action films and series, you would think i would get a kick out of this show.<br /><br />you could not be more wrong. what worked in the japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with mighty morphin power rangers.<br /><br />mmpr is based on five teenagers who get powers to becomes costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs who form an even bigger robot.<br /><br />now this premise is more far fetched and more laughable than anything in either transformers movie, yet, the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked.<br /><br />it was followed by two really bad, and i do mean, really bad movie knock offs, and the actors starring in this series, completely disappeared from the scene.<br /><br />if you must choose, try watching japan's zyuranger series instead.<br /><br />also, what's up with the awful long 1990s haircuts and all the earrings on the guys? it makes them all look feminine!
