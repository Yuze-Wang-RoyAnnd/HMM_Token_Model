as a hammer completist i was dreading the time when i would have to raise the courage to watch this film and the one following it, holiday on the buses. i had seen one the buses the film and thought it one of the worst films i have ever seen. it was full of all the awful comedy that plagued british tv screens around the early 70's.<br /><br />i am ashamed to say that there were actually parts of this film that i laughed at. i don't know if it was because i was now familiar with the characters and enjoyed some of the situations, knowing how they would react. i found blakey particularly funny, although i could swear at no point in the trilogy does he say his catchphrase, "i'll get you butler".<br /><br />having watched holiday on the buses the jokes were starting to wear thin and these three films could be compared to an early hammer trilogy, dick barton, in that the second film made is the best (although this is probably the only way they could be compared).<br /><br />the only people who would want to watch this film are probably fans of the tv series, who will no doubt enjoy this, and hammer completists like myself. to the completists i would say that this film isn't that bad and i can certainly think of worse hammer comedies.
