this could have been a very good film, if i had been able to watch it. the hand held camera was very bouncy. from the opening credits i was worried. several of us watching it felt very nauseous by the end. but we did stay until the end because it was such a charming and interesting film, giving some insight to the young pop culture in south africa. the black and white film did enhance the artful feeling of it. the acting seemed very authentic. some of the dialog was a little hard to understand, but a theater full of non-south africans seemed to find most of it funny. if you get motion sickness at all though, you may seriously consider skipping this film. it's quaint, but not worth the nausea.
