the thing about calling "house of the dead" the worst movie of all time is that it's really not. there are worse movies out there. i watch alot of hong kong ninja movies that are basically the result of an unfinished japanese police drama having footage of ninjas inserted at the end to create something that could technically be called "a movie."<br /><br />house of the dead is however one of the worst films i've ever seen at the theatres. walking out half way through, i actually felt i was somewhat dumber for having set through 45 minutes of this piece of garbage.
