others have already commented on the "decline" of director tobe hooper, but what about brad dourif? he was perfectly capable of selecting good projects (as he proved by starring in the same year's "exorcist iii"), so why did he agree to appear in this? sure, he gives a suitably demented performance, and the film is not outright bad; it's just uninvolving, uninteresting and unappealing. that's three "un-"s too many.
