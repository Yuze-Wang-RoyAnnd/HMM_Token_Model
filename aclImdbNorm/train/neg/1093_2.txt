kitten natividad, of russ meyer film fame, plays chastity knott, a woman who has found she has breast cancer, so she goes to south america to get some special fruit (crockazilla?) that is supposed to have healing powers. after going down on some of this fruit (which appears to be plastic bananas on stalks) chastity is endowed with some mystical magical powers that makes her a super-hero, specifically, the double d avenger. note that she's also wearing a pair of panties as a mask. in writing, that all sounds pretty good. in execution, well, it leaves more than a little to be desired. it seems that chastity owns a pub and a local strip joint is upset because she's taking away their business so some of the strippers (including haji, also of russ meyer film fame) go after her to ruin her. of course, chastity fights back in the guise of the double d avenger. watch her do a "wonder woman" type spin to change into her outfit and also lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force. bad jokes and lame double entendres fly like there was no tomorrow. with the inane theme song playing over and over this comes off like a twisted 70's "live action" kid's show with adult content, although while this is unrated it could probably get away with pg-13 at the worst. and it's probably a blessing that the faded stars kept well covered. this makes doris wishman's chesty morgan films look positively wonderful in comparison. special appearance by forest j. ackerman but so what. very stupid, and i'm never buying another film with joe bob briggs on the cover. 2 out of 10.
