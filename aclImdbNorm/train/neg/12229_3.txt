this movie started out good, i felt like i was watching an adult version of seinfeld. much to quickly i started questioning the situations and actions of the main characters, and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing. all the acting was superb but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were actually funny. dan cortese was amazing. i loved him in this role. his agent should show this movie to casting agents. watch the first few scenes and then find something better, or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess. i found this in a bin at a video store. it cost me two dollars and due to the rareness of this movie i feel like it was a good price.
