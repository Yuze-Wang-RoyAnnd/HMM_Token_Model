i found a dvd of "i dream of jeanie" in the $1.00 bin at wal-mart. when i saw that it was the "story of stephen foster", being a musician and music educator, i had to see it. i had no idea what year it was made for it did not say on the cover, just that it was a remake of 1939's "sewanee river". bill shirley's portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful, sometimes laughable. the man has no testosterone and is a wimp all the way through! i have a difficult time believing stephen foster thought music publishers were doing him a favor by publishing his songs...without paying him for them! in addition to that ridiculous notion, there is a nearly 20 minute segment of ray middleton and his black-faced "christy minstrels" performing stephen foster's songs that was difficult to watch, to say the least. i can hardly believe anyone would consider this movie appropriate to resurrect in our current time. it is an embarrassment and should remain forgotten. fortunately, stephen foster's songs will never be forgotten....also, eileen christy's portrayal of jeanie was certainly the highest point in this lowest point of hollywood history.
