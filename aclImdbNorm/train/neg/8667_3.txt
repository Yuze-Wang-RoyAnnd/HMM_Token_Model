this sports a nice, deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk. the first third of this movie was nothing but talk, and more talk. most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other. <br /><br />the first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it's really a "chick flick" and little else. this probably plays on the lifetime network.<br /><br />there was a quick murder scene and then more talk. by halfway through, they had lost me. <br /><br />by the way, sally field looked about 15 years old in here.
