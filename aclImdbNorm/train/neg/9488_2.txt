i've seen some very terrible horror movies in my time, and while this isn't the worst of the bunch, it's certainly in the lower half. the script starts off ok. a young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern, hoping it will vault him to a better job for him and his future wife. cute huh? the movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients. turns out that there's a demon on the basement that's harvesting people's souls. it's the job of the 1 doctor, 1 nurse, and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs, do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out, and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects. at this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid, i was begging for it to be over. there was still an hour to go. it looked like a half an hour "tales from the crypt" episode that somehow got stretched into an hour and a half crap-fest. from tiny lister doing his best john coffey (the green mile) impersonation to tracy scoggins playing the stereotypical frigid nurse ratchet, this movie fails in every possible level. i gave this 2 stars for only two reason. 1) his fianc'e is pretty hot, she eased the pain a little towards the end and 2) the movie actually looks ok, a lot better than the current trend of horror movies being made with wal-mart quality home cameras.<br /><br />in the end, avoid this turd even if you have the blockbuster movie pass (which i do, and i still felt cheated). as a bonus drinking game, you and your buddies take a shot every time matt stasi (dr. james bishop) shakes his head while talking. you'll be drunk 15 minutes into the movie.
