bad plot, bad dialogue, bad acting, idiotic directing, the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the overacted script, and a crappy copy of the vhs cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor. trust me, because i stuck this turkey out to the end. it was so pathetically bad all over that i had to figure it was a fourth-rate spoof of springtime for hitler.<br /><br />the girl who played janis joplin was the only faint spark of interest, and that was only because she could sing better than the original.<br /><br />if you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better, then watch beyond the valley of the dolls.
