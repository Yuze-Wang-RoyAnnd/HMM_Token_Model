i am a big fan of ludlum's work, and of the covert-one books, and i had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film. imagine my excitement, then, on learning that such a movie actually existed! the 'hades factor' being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to start.<br /><br />from the outset the film was disappointing. simple elements from the film such as griffin's first meeting with smith are needlessly different from the book, and much less exhilarating. several characters are poorly cast, too. for starters dorff is woeful as smith. not a bad actor, just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft, and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of john smith.<br /><br />re-naming, re-assignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film. for example the removal of victor tremont and the entire back-story of the virus, including the involvement of vaxham makes the entire point to the film somewhat hazy. marty zellerbach is a very large part of the book, and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat (not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book) is another big mistake.<br /><br />rachel russel is presumably supposed to be randi russel from the book. not only is she supposed to be the sister of sophie amsden (should be called sophia russel) but she is also supposed to work from the cia, not "covert-one". which brings me to my final point, and i think one of the most important. covert-one doesn't even exist at this point! not until the second book of the series is covert-one devised by the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorism.<br /><br />to be honest i could go on all day. in short - if you like the books and want to see a good adaptation, i'm afraid you'll be bitterly disappointed. even as an action movie it is thoroughly average, mainly due to very lack-luster editing and poor effects. the bumbled story line and dull-as-ditch-water script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film.
