it's the early 80s. there's a group of suspiciously old-looking teens. and there's a maniac stalking around. yes, this is slasherville.<br /><br />this movie is called pranks. why is it called pranks? i haven't the faintest idea. unless your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someone's dinner with a baseball bat - on balance, not a great prank; in fact quite a rubbish prank if truth be told. but there you go.<br /><br />the film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory. they become aware that a psychopath is on the loose. to combat this development, they split up and wander about in the dark. it ends in tears for most of them.<br /><br />pranks is a badly made slasher movie. the dvd release i viewed was the vipco one. it appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence. this makes the dvd even more pointless because, let's face it, a slasher movie shorn of violence is a waste of time. for slasher-film and video nasty completists only.
