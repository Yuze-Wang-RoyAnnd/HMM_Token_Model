american pie has gone a long distance from the first. at first i believe the actors don't have a clue what their doing and instead it's just a remake of a college party gone nuts. story sets out as two freshman college guys (featuring the young stifler) setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties, sex and of course the booze. the plot is stupid and comes along way away from the original pie. in fact they didn't once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the film.<br /><br />luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free. but please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking. i'm a teen myself and i believe even evan almighty would've been a better choice instead.
