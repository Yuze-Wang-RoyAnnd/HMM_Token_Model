jason lee does his best to bring fun to a silly situation, but the movie just fails to make a connect. <br /><br />perhaps because julia stiles character seems awkward as the conniving and sexy soon to be cousin-in-law. <br /><br />maybe it is because she and selma blair's characters should have been cast the opposite way. (selma blair seems more conniving than julia would be).<br /><br />either way this movie is yet another hollywood trivialization of a possibly real world situation (that being getting caught with your pants out at your bachelor party not stooping your cousin), which while having promise fails to deliver.<br /><br />there are some laughs to be sure and the cast (even if miscast) do their best with sub grade material which doesn't transcend its raunchy topic. so instead of getting a successful raunch fest (ie animal house or american pie) we are left with a middle ground of part humor and part stupidity (ala meatballs 2 or something).
