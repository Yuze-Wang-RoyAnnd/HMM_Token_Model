i too was intrigued by the high (8.5) rating for this film, and was very disappointed. i had just seen a couple of good foreign films and was looking forward to making it three in a row, but it was not to be. i went with a spanish speaking friend who felt the same way. there is not much of a plot, if any. i don't necessarily need that in a movie, but it needs to somehow entertain or bring me in. the best i could say would be that it aspires to be an altman-esque film, albeit with an extremely small ensemble. sure, there are moments, but a few moments easily get thinned out by 97 slow minutes of nothing. i do not understand the high rating for this film. i give it a 3.<br /><br />
