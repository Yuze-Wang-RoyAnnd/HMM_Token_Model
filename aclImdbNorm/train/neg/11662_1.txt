i don't often go out of my way to write comments, but for this i had to, just to warn anyone that might think that by watching this they will see a comedy. this doesn't come close. while the premise (change in colour/gender/whatever) is bad enough (and has been done, better, many times before)the actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen. it would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to white chicks. however the wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women. as you will have guessed by now, they fail completely. i have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and make-up people that hollywood can provide. its appalling. add to the mix a basketball player built like a building, terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this film hits a new personal low. and i like bad movies! avoid like the plague.
