i didn't even knew this movie existed until shortly after seeing blade: trinity, i was messing around on the trinity board when i saw some user mention how the wes craven series is a lot better then the 'crap' that's blade, so i did my quick research: checked the scores on imdb & rottentomatoes for dracula: ascension, and somewhere along the search i found out that this is a sequel to dracula 2000. i also noticed that within the wes craven dracula boards there was a real strong following for this movie which is a big contradiction to the scores i was seeing.<br /><br />now let's take a quick personal recap here. i remember seeing dracula 2000, and i remember not liking it at all, and then seeing the scores of dracula: ascension just lowered my expectations even more, but then again, i'm the type of person that truly needs to watch the movie myself (any movie) so that i can form my own opinion.<br /><br />a couple of things i went in knowing when i started watching this movie was that it's low budget, so because of that, i'm going to have to ignore a lot of the v/fx and just figure it's going to compensated by story & acting, i was also slightly impressed by some of the casting in this movie (jason london, roy schieder & jason scott lee)<br /><br />oh geez
