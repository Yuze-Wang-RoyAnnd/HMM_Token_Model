when i saw this film on fearnet, i thought it would be a scary movie. apparently, it wasn't. i have no clue how this movie was allowed to be featured on that site. fearnet is a site that shows scary horror movies.<br /><br />the acting is wonderful from all the actors. i hated the story. the story was stupid. the movie starts out with a man with a scroll with a signia stamped onto it. he breaks the seal and certain disasters happen. the water turns to blood, the oceans die out, the moon turns red, etc. <br /><br />the female character was annoying as well. a lot of the stuff she did didn't make sense. like when she sees a piece of paper with a date on it. coincidentally, it's the date she's expected to give birth to her baby and she starts freaking out about it and starts researching it and asking religious people what it all means.<br /><br />*spoiler alert* <br /><br />the two worst things happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that god told him to murder his parents and the end where demi moore dies after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul into it.<br /><br />here's what happens. the mentally retarded person gets shot and killed and the apocalypse begins. demi moore gets into a hospital in the middle of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child. she touches her child's head, transferring her soul into the child and then dies. then, the apocalypse stops.<br /><br />why does god all of a sudden have a change of heart? he gets furious when the governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man then he's all about forgiveness once a lone woman transfers her soul into her baby? <br /><br />*end spoiler* <br /><br />the movie is pretty stupid. it's another religious end of the world propaganda piece. the acting from demi moore and michael biehn and everybody else is excellent. that's about all there is.<br /><br />i give this movie 2 stars out of 10. good acting with a lot of nonsense!
