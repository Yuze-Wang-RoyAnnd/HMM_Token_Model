i'm surprised about the many female voters who even give this film better marks. my thought about this film was that the target audience is adult and male. whipped and tortured women, merciless revenge and a high body count are typical ingredients, introduced into film history by the spaghetti subgenre. the opening and the hand-smashing are django rip-offs. the shooter however lacks the style of e.g. django. score, acting and cinematography are mediocre at best but if you look for the above mentioned ingredients you are in the right place here. and the actors don't have an italian accent.<br /><br />4 / 10.
