can only be described as awful. it is bad to start with and then gets even more bad. when you start you really have to watch it through because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse - but fear not because it does. another poorly written script for a donkey director for no-talent offspring of past movie stars. it's hard to decide if the script is worse than the acting or whether the directing is worse than both. as for the hero - well he belts up everyone including one scene where he beats the living daylights out of the tough by swinging open the wardrobe door and smashing him against the window with it. and in another scene he gets thrown through a window and crashes 20ft onto concrete - doesn't even blink - then gets up immediately and gets stuck into the baddies. this is a really ridiculous movie. lucky it only cost me $1 to hire.
