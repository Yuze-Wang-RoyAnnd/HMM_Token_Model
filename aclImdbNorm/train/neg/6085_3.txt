in this paranoia-driven potboiler, our reporter hero battles hindersome authorities, duplicitous co-workers, renegade ufo debunkers, and silent, skulking aliens. (though capable of mind control and zapping objects from afar, it takes three of them to operate a control panel of about two dozen buttons.) the script clomps from event to event,leaving puzzlers aplenty. why did the aliens blind the dog? why do they fry the soldiers with radiation when they're only patrolling an empty landing site? and what space dudes worth their moon cheese abduct the ugly photographer first instead of his model? inquiring minds want to know! writer-director mario gariazzo apparently researched his subject by skimming a stack of ufo-themed tabloids as he took in a sunn classics double feature. (the closing screen crawl boasts that it's based on actual events...just like "plan 9!") some may feel burned by the abrupt finale, but it should still appeal to conspiracy cranks.
