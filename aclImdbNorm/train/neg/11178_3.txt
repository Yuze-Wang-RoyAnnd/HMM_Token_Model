firstly,i must admit that it isn't a good movie. and,i would never watch this movie if pacino wasn't in it.<br /><br />the movie is about a publicist's strange 24 hours.and he is overworked,dizzy,sick and sometimes regretful.i don't like the character at all.it's really boring,after 20 minutes you may fall asleep.and i don't understand why pacino wanted to be a part of this horrible movie.just because of money or what?<br /><br />since i'm an avid pacino fan,i bought this 2002 movie people i know.if you haven't bought it yet,don't even think about it,it's just a waste of time.
