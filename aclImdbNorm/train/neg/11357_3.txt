1st the good news. the 3-d is spectacularly well done, and they don't go for the gotcha gimmicks. the film is based on the true story of the high point in human history, and even features one of the actual participants in that story: buzz aldrin.<br /><br />and now the meat of the matter: it's about flies, for krissakes! flies with big, googy human eyes, true, but flies nonetheless. remember when i likened the "underworld" movies to rats vs. cockroaches? that wasn't intended as praise, and i never dreamed anyone would take it literally. this one's got even less empathy going for it. baby maggots? ugh. in one of those odd confluences of hollywood groupthink, this flik was evidently on the drawing boards at the same time as "space chimps", also about critters in space.<br /><br />go rent "apollo 13" and see a 9-rated movie about the real space program (rip).
