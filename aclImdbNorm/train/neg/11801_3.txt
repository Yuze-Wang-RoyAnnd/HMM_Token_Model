as a big fan of the original film, it's hard to watch this show. the garish set decor and harshly lighted sets rob any style from this remake. the mood is never there. instead, it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the seventies. crenna is not a bad choice as walter neff, but his snappy wardrobe and "swank" apartment don't fit the mood of the original, or make him an interesting character.he does his best to make it work but samantha egger is a really bad choice. the english accent and california looks can't hold a candle to barbara stanwick's velvet voice and sex appeal. lee j.cobb tries mightily to fashion barton keyes,but even his performance is just gruff, without style.<br /><br />it feels like the tv movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is.
