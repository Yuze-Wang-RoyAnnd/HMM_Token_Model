i remember my parents not understanding saturday night live when i was 15. they also did not understand rock n roll and many other things. now that i am approaching their age, i still remember, and find i understand many of the things my kids love. but this is pathetic. i cannot say i have seen any by sarah except for a few appearances here and there. they were reasonable. i do not see her as anything special. but this show is just so far below what i expected from her. the imdb write up made it sound like potential. so, just for that, i started watching the first episode. i turned it off half way through. anything else is better that that. jokes that are meant for a 5 year old presented on a supposed adult program. well, sarah, this adult is inly moved to turn you off. i just cant believe that someone actually financed this insult to comedy. only good thing i can say is that there are sooooo many bad jokes deposited here, saving other shows from such an embarrassment.
