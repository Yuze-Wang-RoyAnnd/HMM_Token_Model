jack black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing, but in this movie...<br /><br />besides the direction, writing, lack of plot, constant mugging (aided and abetted by constant straight-on camera shots), and a .050 joke batting average, it was still an utter waste of time. the idea sounds promising, but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction i've seen this side of you-tube.<br /><br />i kept hearing that this film portrayed mexicans very negatively. while that's no doubt true, i really don't think this movie is meant to be racist. i think that's it's more a result of a "creative" team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess. you can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera: "hey look, it's an ugly mexican! laugh, people! please, for the love of all things tenacious, laugh!"<br /><br />but put the racism charges aside. when you get down to it, it's anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended, imo.
