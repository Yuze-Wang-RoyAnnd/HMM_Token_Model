i've just visited russian forum of our tv-channel that had showed this film. well... 99 per cent of active russian audience is disappointed. we wanted to see more true facts of our space achievements in this film. but authors had in mind something else... :( we are big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here. we are proud of all our space dreams, real achievements on the one hand in this field and in science on the other hand. so i'd like to ask authors: where is our lunohod? and where, the hell our mir station? ah? i'm quite sure, that lunohod events took place much earlier armstrong's "walk on moon". and to comment numerous technical and science mistakes - i really have no time and enough space here! se our constructive critics in russian forum on www.1tv.ru
