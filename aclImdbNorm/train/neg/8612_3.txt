this was a watchable movie, but plot was a little weak and most of the jokes were from some of rodney's earlier movies. with that said, it was worth the time to watch. i gave this a 5 out of 10. so basically, its one of those movies that you do not go out of your way to see, but if you find it on the tube, take a chance.
