below average movie with poor music considering a movie based on music??? ordinary script & direction with full of blunders. salman khan was at his usual acting. ajay's performance deteriorating with time as his looks,especially his styles as a rock star were pathetic. asin was just a showpiece only. overall i felt like wasting my money in cinema. salman khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to aamir khan. there were many songs in the movie all boring except "man ko ati". the most important song to impress the uk music sponsor was most unimpressive. "khanabadosh" can be very easily understood by an english music sponsor. the other movie i saw last week was "wake up sid" which was simple slow love story with good direction & acting despite average music
