there are so many comments on this film, yet i found them to be misleading. this a corner-cutting, over-used scenario where a normal human being becomes a partner in crime to someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. boy meets girl. girl holds boy up at gunpoint for something ridiculous. boy is intrigued. <br /><br />you know the drill: the antagonist turns out to be a wild, free spirit instead of a sociopath... toss in a few words of wisdom from alice drummond and you have a recipe for love. sheedy's 'is she crazy or does she just need a hug?' role from the breakfast club simply reeks as a lead character. and all that is left is a truly ghastly turkey of a movie.
