first of all, i saw this movie when i was 7 years old at a christian scholl i attended. needless to say that i was scared out of mind. not because it was scary but because the content.cmon...i was 7. anyway, the cinematography was pretty bad and the acting was cheesy. that's very bad considering that i was only 7 and i remember that. the one thing that still haunts me is that dreadful song "i wish we all were ready" where the chorus ends with "...you were left behind". i wouldn't suggest seeing this one. i probably will, just for nostalgic reason. besides, i'm sure the remake is much better. the best part of this movie though, has to be when everyone "dissapears"; vacant cars crashing, lawnmowers running on their own...pretty hilarious.
