first of all, jon bon jovi doesn't seem to be in place in a vampire movie. together with the other not so interesting characters and the poor storyline the whole movie becomes predictable. if you keep that in mind and you're a total vampire movie fan, you can have some fun with a few of the scenes. don't expect any tarantino-style chapters here and neither an anne rice storyline. (i expect to have have forgotten the whole movie by tomorrow ;)
