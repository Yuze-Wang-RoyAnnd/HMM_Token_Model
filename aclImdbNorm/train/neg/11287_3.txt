this is a film that had a lot to live down to . on the year of its release legendary film critic barry norman considered it the worst film of the year and i'd heard nothing but bad things about it especially a plot that was criticised for being too complicated <br /><br />to be honest the plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word " plot " is used because as far as i can see there is no plot as such . there's something involving russian gangsters , a character called pete thompson who's trying to get his wife sarah pregnant , and an irish bloke called sean . how they all fit into something called a " plot " i'm not sure . it's difficult to explain the plots of guy ritchie films but if you watch any of his films i'm sure we can all agree that they all posses one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing . likewise a james bond film though the plots are stretched out with action scenes . you will have a serious problem believing rancid aluminium has any type of central plot that can be cogently explained <br /><br />taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning bells as to what sort of film you'll be watching . sadie frost has appeared in some of the worst british films made in the last 15 years and she's doing nothing to become inconsistent . steven berkoff gives acting a bad name ( and he plays a character called kant which sums up the wit of this movie ) while one of the supporting characters is played by a tv presenter presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this <br /><br />the only good thing i can say about this movie is that it's utterly forgettable . i saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching i was going to write a very long a critical review warning people what they are letting themselves in for by watching , but by now i've mainly forgotten why . but this doesn't alter the fact that i remember disliking this piece of crap immensely
