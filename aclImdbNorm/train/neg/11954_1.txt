this movie was terrible. throughout the whole movie, i was puzzled and did not see any point to it. i had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about. this movie is not worth watching at all. not only is it sick and revolting but totally stupid! please don't watch unless you are one of those that likes to watch bad movies. if this movie questions japanese society and their values and roles, than this is a country that i would not like to visit or bother to know. this is a totally sick movie!!!!!!!! i did not enjoy it because it made no sense. my boyfriend and i sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under. it was total disappointment.
