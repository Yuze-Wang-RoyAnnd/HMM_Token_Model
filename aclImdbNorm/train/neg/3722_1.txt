i remember being forced (yes--literally forced) to see this film by a southern baptist preacher when i was a kid, and even then i loved its awfulness. it's designed to scare poor suckers into being "saved." the only thing that "saved" me was the fact that it finally ended and i could go out and have a real life.<br /><br />check out the chapter on this film in sarah diamond's book "the politics of the christian right." fascinating. and certainly more interesting than the movie!
