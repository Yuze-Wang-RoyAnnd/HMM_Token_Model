there are exactly 2 good things to be said about "fantasies" (both mentioned by a previous reviewer as well): <br /><br />a) bo derek's extraordinary, poetry-inspiring beauty. she has shots in this movie where she gives even catherine zeta-jones a run for her money, and that's a high compliment indeed. her nudity is brief and discreet, but just looking at her face is enough.<br /><br />b) the greek island setting, with its sun and crystal-clear blue waters.<br /><br />other than that, there is no story, the dialogue is abysmal and at times unintentionally funny ("he touched you where you're a woman!"), and peter hooten's character is a slimy jerk. bo overplays the naivete of her character, but then again when you have to work with dialogue this bad it's unfair to blame the actors (the fact that she kept saying the name "damir" in almost every sentence is a major irritation). oh, and although the film is set on a greek island, there is hardly a greek word to be heard - apparently everyone there, from kids to old people, speaks english the whole time.
