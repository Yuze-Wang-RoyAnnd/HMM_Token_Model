1 out of 10.<br /><br />this is the kind of movie that you cant believe you just wasted 2 hours of your life as you see the credits role. i honestly think i could make a better vampire movie.... and i know nothing. the only thing that does not just suck (harder than a vampire) is jason scott lee.... his character is at least a little bit cool, has some mystery, and kicks a little butt.
