"nacho libre" (2006) <br /><br />directed by: jared hess <br /><br />starring: jack black, ana de la reguera, h'ector jim'enez, & darius rose <br /><br />mpaa rating: "pg-13" (for some rough action, and crude humor including dialog) <br /><br />say what you will about it (i know some people who despise it to no end), but i have always thought that "napoleon dynamite" was a funny movie--not the brightest brick on the wall, but a funny movie, nonetheless. jack black is also a very funny man--irritating at times, yes, and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him, but funny. there has rarely been a jack black comedy that i did not enjoy to some degree. so, i was very happy to hear that jared hess, the writer and director of "napoleon dynamite", and jack black would be teaming up for a movie about a spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage. my only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin. unfortunately, my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie. this plot, had it been done as a skit on some such show as "saturday night live" or possibly even "mad tv", would have worked flawlessly. unfortunately, the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one-joke comedy falls flat.<br /><br />nacho was raised in a mexican monastery and became a devout man of the lord. feeling shunned by the entire monastery, nacho (black), now the monastery's cook, decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler. as the monastery's finances hit an all-time low, nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery's orphanage. this plot sounds so sweet and caring. it seems like the perfect movie for jack black. look what he did with "school of rock" after all. well, to my displeasure, this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie. it is again hollywood's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humor
