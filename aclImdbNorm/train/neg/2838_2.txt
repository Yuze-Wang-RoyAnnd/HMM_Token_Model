skip mission: galactica and watch the original living legend episodes instead. the network took parts 1 & 2 of living legend and jammed them into one plot with the awful fire in space episode. although galactica suffered from network-controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production, living legend is the best of the 1978 tv series. fire in space, on its own, is one of the worst episodes. as a historical note, watch galactica, the original star trek, and then the revival trek series, and you'll see the difference in quality between network-produced sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi.
