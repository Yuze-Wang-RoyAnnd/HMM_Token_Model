when this was released, i thought this was one of the most profane films ever made. however, thanks to martin scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him, there have been mainline films worse, language-wise, than this....but this is a pretty brutal assault on one's ears. hey, i can take a lot of it, but this got ridiculous. in the first six minutes alone, i heard a half-dozen usage's of the lord's name in vain plus an untold number of f-words. i wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990? i couldn't have been the only one.<br /><br />not surprisingly, some of the feature actors included jennifer jason-leigh, burt young, jerry orbach and rikki lake. since this film, stephen lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing the godly "stonewall" jackson in "gods and generals." lang's role here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film.<br /><br />depressing, gloomy, semi-pornographic, repulsive: these are just a few of the adjectives people used - even some liberal critics - in describing this story, which is painted even worse in the novel. of course, some of the better-known critics, all extreme libs, praised the movie. however, they were the only ones. most critics were disgusted, as well almost all of the paying public. it's unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like this.<br /><br />trust me on this: there are no good, likable characters in this entire movie. this is a mean, sick film: one of the worst of the "modern era." that is, unless you enjoy seeing child abuse, drug abuse, teen prostitutes, on and on - two straight hours of nothing but atrocities and just plain evil people. no thanks.
