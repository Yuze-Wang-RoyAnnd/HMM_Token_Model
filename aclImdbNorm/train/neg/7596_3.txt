a film starring salma hayek and colin farrell, two respected and talented actors, sounds like a great idea. an independent film sounds even better. the studios will control less of the content allowing the actors and writers and director more creativity.<br /><br />but then why is this movie so bland? ask the dust.<br /><br />this film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters. no one is given a proper back story, so we don't ever know why the characters act the way they do.<br /><br />explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination, if you still have one left at the end of this movie.<br /><br />i told a friend that i went to see this film, and that i thought it was awful.<br /><br />her question: "not even colin farrell could save it?" my response: "not even colin farrell's ass could save it."
