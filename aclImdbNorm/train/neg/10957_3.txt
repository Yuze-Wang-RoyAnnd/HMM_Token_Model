i am a student of film, and have been for several years. and the concept of a cyber, kung-fu, satirical chimpanzee had me wondering, "is this the film that's going to break the mold?" let's face it, america has never been let down by any piece of cinema that features a simian costar. after such great classics as "monkey trouble" and "dunston checks in", i thought that the best ideas were already taken. but then comes "funky monkey". i laughed, i cried, i contemplated suicide.<br /><br />now i've read about demon possession in the bible, but that still doesn't explain why someone would create such a product of evil. first off, having at least a shred of intelligence, i realized that a chimpanzee was in fact an ape, not a monkey at all. however, i was sure that the filmmakers would clear this problem up further into the film. they didn't. let me sum up this work of art: a company by the name of z.i.t. has decided to train chimpanzees as soldiers. why? i think they mention something about the soldiers working for bananas, but when it would cost about an estimated 13 million dollars of government money to train one chimp, this doesn't seem cost-effective. well anyways, z.i.t. brings in a cia specialist (matthew modine) to train clemens (the chimp). clemens is everything z.i.t. hoped for. he can take out an entire shift of guards, who all appear to have gotten their training skills at the local mall, and yet still manage to remind us that we're watching a kid's movie. as you may have guessed, modine finds out that z.i.t.'s intentions may be evil (gasp!) and decides to break clemens out. being a cia agent and all, modine knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city, rent a guest room, regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime, and using checks to pay for everything.<br /><br />z.i.t. finds out where modine is staying, and sends two of their finest to retrieve him. these guards are possibly the greatest comedy team up since martin and lewis, or was it turner and hooch? it doesn't matter anyways, because in the end, for a heck of a twist ending, the good guys win!!! yay! hooray for predictability! throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself, a lonely mom who needs a date, and music montages that feature songs that would even be blackballed by radio disney and you get "funky monkey". the climax to the movie? a football game! played by thugs, bumblers, a chimp, and the nerd boy. no one seems to care about such substitutions at a high school football game.<br /><br />funky monkey never lets up! it's edge of your seat entertainment. some might even call this the "american beauty" of monkey-filled features. after finishing this epic, i recalled hearing a story about a railroad worker who lost much of his brain functions when a metal rod pierced his temporal lobe. funky monkey is a metal rod among movies.
