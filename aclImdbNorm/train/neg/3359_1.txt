they screwed up this story! in the end nell is all heroic and taking on for the team to save all their asses from hill house and a bunch of nonsense like that! they added heads getting chopped, wires cutting peoples faces, and the ceiling turning into a giant hand! what the hell is that about??? i own and love the original movie, i read the book and i love it! the reason why the original movie and the book are so great is because it scares you so much without even showing the ghost. there is no gore. there is no ceiling hand. it is only the ghost ad how ghosts can truly kill a person. they cannot kill us, they cannot throw us about the room or fly a knife into our head. no. they can only drive us mad. taking away all our senses of security. nell was a selfish woman. she only wanted good things for herself. yes, she cared a little for the others, but not too much. david self and jan de bont have taken a crap on this great story! i hate this damn remake!
