when i was a kid in the 50's and 60's anything connected with disney was by definition great. what happened? they are able to get any actors and actresses they want, the best of their time. but somehow disney manages to screw things up in spite of their abundant resources.<br /><br />disney can afford the best writers, the best producers and directors, but still...they screw things up! this movie is crap. the sad thing is that i suspect disney in their arrogance does not even know when a movie is good or bad.<br /><br />it is only due to the talent of the actors that i can even give it a 3 of 10.
