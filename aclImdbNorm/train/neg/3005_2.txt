slaughter high is intrinsically your emblematic 80s slasher flick. a prank goes out of hand leaving a geeky guy horribly burnt. a few years later the geeky guy returns and starts killing the people who hurt him. now the story might sound intriguing and very entertaining, but what makes this horrible film so different from the rest of the 80s slasher flicks is that it has some humorless flaws and continuation errors.<br /><br />the acting is horrendous, however, actually not as bad as one would suspect. though it doesn't help that every character in the film are so grody and unlikable. the lead, carol manning (caroline munro) is the easily the biggest tormentor of them all and she's the one that we are ostensibly supposed to share compassion and root for. not to mention, the geeky guy is almost too geeky and i think that even stereotypical geeks themselves would be rudely maddened and just downright antagonized by how geeky he his, so when he gets mauled, does anyone really care? <br /><br />there is much unintentional laughter potential. munro's lack of acting talent is quite apparent, which puts her down at the same level as the rest of the awful cast. however, the most amusement is easily when the film poorly attempts to pose munro, who is in her mid 30s at the time, as a teenager amongst a cast of teenagers. and then when it comes to later life and munro is playing around her real age, the rest of the cast do not pass as adults. this all goes well with a theme song that is a hilariously pose of heavy metal thrash accompanied by maniacal laughter and a voice shrieking "i'll get you." with that being said, slaughter high really isn't a very good slasher flick, but it does have a bad cheesy entertainment value to it. perhaps an essential for hardcore slasher fans, but don't expect dilemma, suspense, or any credibility from it. horrible!!!
