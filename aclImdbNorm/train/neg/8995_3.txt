i missed the beginning but i did see most of it. a friend got it on dvd in the cheap room at fye.<br /><br />the skits are all very short, and yet most of them are still too long. the majority of them, they seem to have forgotten to have something funny! quite a lot of racist/sexist/"homophobic" humor in it, skits based on stereotypes, or skits which use racist terms for people.<br /><br />i'm trying to remember anything i thought was funny in it, and i'm having trouble.... the logo for the tunnel vision network is a lipsticked mouth with an eyeball in it. the mouth opens and closes over the eye like eyelids. kind of creepy.<br /><br />what a disappointment. most of the actors went on to better things, and it's lucky this bomb didn't hold them back.
