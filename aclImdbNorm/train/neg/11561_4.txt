alan (anthony steffen), an english multi-millionaire with a few screws loose (thanks to his first wife's infidelity and untimely death during childbirth), entices sexy, red-headed women to his castle, offering them bundles of cash to stay the weekend. once back at his ancestral pile, he gets them nekkid, proceeds to flog them with a bull-whip, and then kills them.<br /><br />but when he meets blonde hottie gladys (marina malfatti) and falls for her ample charms, he decides to give up his murderous ways and get married. their wedded bliss is short-lived, however, thanks to alan's iffy mental state, which becomes increasingly fragile when his dead wife evelyn starts to appear outside his window and a spate of gruesome murders occur within the castle grounds.<br /><br />so let's recap: a groovy 70s euro-horror with loads of tasty women in various states of undress; spooky gothic retreats and misty graveyards; a sadistic rich psycho with a penchant for drop-dead gorgeous babes with cracking bods; several vicious murders (including a great bit where one victim has her head bashed in with a rock and her entrails eaten by foxes). normally, a checklist like that would guarantee me a good time
