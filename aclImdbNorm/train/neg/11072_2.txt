saw in on tv late last night. yeah, i can hear what y'all say about this one. it is likely to be categorized as one of those stereo- typical tv soap series. in all fairness, the story line does have a fine twist to it, and you might nod saying, "well, that's not what i expected." but, as a film, well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element. casting, acting, camera work, cars, costume, setting, script, no, there's nothing to congratulate. rated r?? oh, that scene. did we need it? this is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched. and what was the title again?
