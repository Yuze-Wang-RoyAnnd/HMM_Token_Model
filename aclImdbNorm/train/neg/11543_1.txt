although i use this site quite frequently to see how other people rated what i think are challenging or just plain enjoyable films, after watching this "movie" on film four last night i felt compelled to write something down, even if it just helps cleanse me once again.<br /><br />the film was possibly the shallowest experience i've ever had - the main characters played by danny dyer (23? you sure?) and gillian anderson (who will always be scully as leonard nimoy will always be spock) had no real substance about them - i'm not sure if the first half-hour of the film didn't make the final cut but surely in a revenge movie you would like some empathy with the victims... here i couldn't care less. in fact, the only character i did seem to care about was the dog, with the stag coming a close second. and both animals out-acted dire (sic) and scully, who were quite frankly terrible. i guess though you're only as good as the script you are given, and i'd like to warmly thank the writers, the producers, the director and all of the cast for wasting 90 minutes of my life and some perfectly good electricity.
