what i think i'll probably like best about the new star wars film, "phantom menace", is that it will likely blow "titanic" out of the water, if you'll pardon the pun, when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts, and thereby knock it out of the number one spot. every time i hear someone declare "titanic" is the greatest film they've ever seen, i think to myself, "you don't see a lot of movies, do you?" what a travesty. you could make 50 good films that are a lot better than "titanic", and for the same price tag.<br /><br />"well, it won lots of academy awards, lots of people really loved it," as someone might say in its defence. well, lots of people like the spice girls and billions and billions of people eat at mcdonald's, but that doesn't mean it's high quality. yes, millions of elvis fans can be wrong.<br /><br />i'll be the first to admit, that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype over the film. i waited a month or so to see it and ultimately, it didn't live up to the expectations set upon it, which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story. it's true, "phantom menace" will likely suffer a similar fate. but.<br /><br />james cameron's "titanic" is. a) a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece. b) a three-hour epic that has it's finest moments given away in the trailer. c) a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment. d) something left better to documentarians, which i would've enjoyed much more. e) a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship. f) a robbery of 3 hours that i will never get back, therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine i can think of. when i meet someone who hasn't seen it yet, i say, "i wish i could trade places with you." g) a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia. how long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences? h) thankfully a film that wasn't recognized for any acting achievements at the oscars. i) a technological achievement in filmmaking, and little else.<br /><br />the only reason i post this as a anonymous comment is i do not welcome the rebuttal of 10,000 thirteen year old leonardo dicaprio fans who'll no doubt come to his defense, and i am not really interested in hearing a defense of titanic's story, acting or length.
