the first question that springs to mind after watching this rubbish is who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the omen name on this movie? it is a shambolic , embarrassing, pathetic atempt to carry on the omen franchise. when the film starts the backing music sounds like it has been lifted straight from a bugs bunny cartoon and from then on the film gets worse! i dont know who wrote the script but i bet they got a e - for it when they took it back to show their teacher! it is difficult after a while to tell if this is a comedy because what happens is so funny and so un true to the original omen it beggers belief. the acting is laughable , especially from the leading lady faye grant. she keeps pulling silly faces or is she finding it difficult not to laugh? it's hard to tell. the worst sequal i have ever had the misfortune to witness. 1 out of 10.
