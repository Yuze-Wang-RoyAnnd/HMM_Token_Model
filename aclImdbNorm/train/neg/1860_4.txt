the 1998 michael keaton kiddie comedy of the same title was roundly condemned for it's, um, shoddy special effects, but compared to what screaming mad george cooked up for this horror comedy they're positively mind-boggling. the killer snowman seems to be made out of styrofoam and his arms look like oversized oven mitts. which they probably were. the cast lays it on thick in this parody of dozens of other (much worse) movies and paul keith as the town doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role.
