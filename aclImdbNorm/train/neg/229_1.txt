caught this on ifc yesterday, and can't believe the positive reviews! am i the only one who thought these "ladies" were anything but? kate tells jed she could get fired because she's supposed to be a pillar of the community, but puts out for him! then they suddenly decide they're in love? and she's so devastated over his death, she doesn't go to his funeral, much less, tell his family the "good news"! by the way, how did an american get to be the headmistress of a very proper british school? janine should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power, but nothing happens! and she winds up boffing a con she brought in for questioning! and the less said about molly, the better!<br /><br />as for the guilt janine and molly feel over jed, please! it's the punk's own damn fault he got turned into roadkill! where's the guilt over poor gerald, who gets puked on? if only i could do the same to the bozos behind this "movie"!
