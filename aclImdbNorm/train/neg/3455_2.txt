geez! this is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you didn't. i mean, you didn't give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mind.<br /><br />to be honest and brief; this is one of the worst, boring, and stupid slashers ever made. i can't say anything good about this piece of crap because there are barely decent sequences that could tell it's made by professional film makers.<br /><br />the death scenes are horrible, bloodless, stupid. the plot is somehow good taking in account that it copied "popcorn" from 1991.<br /><br />to make things even worse, this isn't a movie so bad that it's good. it's just plain bad.<br /><br />molly ringwald tried to do her best but it wasn't enough.
