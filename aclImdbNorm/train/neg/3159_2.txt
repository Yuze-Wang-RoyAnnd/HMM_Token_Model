sorry guys, i've already written my opinion of this movie but today was the first day i looked at some of the other reviews. there are a quite a lot of people who agree with me but what's scary is that there are some people who seem to really like this movie. i don't like to write nasty reviews or criticise other people's opinions but i think it's only fair to warn anybody out there who may be debating whether or not to see this movie. this is not a good movie. i really like movies and i'll watch just about anything but this movie made it onto the incredibly short list of movies i watched and was happy to leave halfway through. if you really are incredibly tempted, watch the trailer...that's the mistake i made because the entire movie is essentially in the trailer...after that there are no surprises, just some shockingly bad dialogue to waste time. i love michael vartan in alias and would hate to criticise him but i think it's my duty to stop other people wasting hours of their life on a movie like this!!
