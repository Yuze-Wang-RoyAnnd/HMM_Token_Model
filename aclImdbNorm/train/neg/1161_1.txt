as a member of the cast, i was a member of the band at all the basketball games, i would like to let the world know after being in the movie, that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in oregon. this was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the university of oregon where it was shot. seems that the u of o sign was shown. while we were shooting, we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff. mr nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill-mannered men i have ever met. quite a time for a young 20 year old. but certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60's and early 70's despite what hollywood may think. trombone player from oregon
