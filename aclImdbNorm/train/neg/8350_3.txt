i just came back from "el otro" playing here in buenos aires and i have to say i was very disappointed. the film is very slow moving (don't get me wrong, i enjoy slow moving films!), slow to the point of driving you crazy. all you hear is julio chavez breathing heavily throughout the whole film. this is a poorly made film, but more importantly, it is a film without a lick of inspiration, i felt nothing for the story or its characters.<br /><br />"el otro" was made only for the sake of making a film... making it forgetful. i would advise you to pass on this one, if you want to see good argentinian films, look for films by sorin.
