this was a terrible film. there was no story line whatsoever. to top it all off, when they couldn't explain the blood and gore (the only good part) ... they threw in a few aliens! i hate when directors (or whatever) run out of ideas and then blame the aliens! watch this film if you like. but don't say i didn't warn you. two things: how could vinny say "welcome" when he didn't have a tongue? its a pity mr jones didn't have a bigger role. second thing that bugged me, why were we shown vinny jones' boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid, then these have no further role. why not? i don't like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever. in short. bad story. i wouldn't waste my time - wish i'd have watched mirrors instead.
