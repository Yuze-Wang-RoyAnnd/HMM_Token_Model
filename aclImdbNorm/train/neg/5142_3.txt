after chaplin made one of his best films: dough & dynamite, he made one of his worst: gentlemen of nerve. during this first year in films, chaplin made about a third of all his films. many of them were experimental in terms of ad-libbing, editing, gags, location shooting, etc. this one takes place at a racetrack where chaplin and his friend try to get in without paying. mabel normand is there with her friend also, and chaplin manages to rid himself of both his and mabel's friends. he then woos mabel in the grandstand with no apparent repercussions from his behavior. lots of slapstick in here, but there is very little else to recommend this film for other then watching chaplin develop. the print i saw was badly deteriorated, which may have affected its enjoyment. charley chase can be glimpsed. * of 4 stars.
