ok, honestly i dont see why everybody thinks this is so great. its really not. there were two good things that came out of this movie 1. jack's performance, he was very good i can tip my hat for him. 2. danny's performance, he was good. no other then that it got pretty stupid. and, what was stanley kubrick thinking drafting shelly as the wendy? she was so bad. she looked the same every time she got scared. the problem with this movie was the ending. i would have had more respect for it if kubrick would have ended it differently. and, the over all movie was just stupid. the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off. 3/10.
