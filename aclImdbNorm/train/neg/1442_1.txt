this is the worst imaginable crap. the novel by h. rider haggard is very entertaining and dramatic. the makers of this worthless movie don't follow it closely. well, old novels aren't sacred and making free versions of them is fine with me if one has ideas of one's own. if all one can do is changing things and replace them with uninteresting and watered-down clich'es one should stick to the original. if they had done that this film would have been at least twice as good even with worse actors and if filmed inside a studio with huts made of cardboard. but there's no imagination at all only tiredness. this should be bought or watched only by collectors of victorian novels made into movies.<br /><br />just a hint, and not a spoiler i think, to make those of you who have read the novel understand what has taken place and what you may expect if you decide to watch this on tv or - god forbid - waste money on buying this. gagool an old baddie witch in the book and some precursor to gollum has been turned into a nice gal!
