normally i would have given this movie a 6. it tackles a very important topic and it does it relatively well - despite katie wright which is an accomplishment in and of itself.<br /><br />i have no idea if she was actually instructed to play the character like this or is naturally irritating, but she did an awesome job at making it impossible for me to care for lexi. there's no dimension to her other than how confused, helpless and clueless she is, and how good she is at whimpering. i can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorder has spiraled out of control would be distraught, scared and in pain. however, wright's entire performance is based on incessant wailing and sniveling, the rest being whining. i couldn't help but feel this particular girl's problem was caused not by the demon that is bulimia, but by her not having a backbone. i very much doubt that's the point the movie meant to make.
