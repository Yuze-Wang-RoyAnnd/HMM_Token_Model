how many times do we have to see bad horror movies with a killer in a scream-ripoff mask? the plot of bleed is kinda original but the movie itself is a complete failure. for one thing the dialogue is poorly developed, it's boring and wastes too much time on trivial details, the acting is bad, et cetera. i want my money back, this rental stinks worse than a skunk.
