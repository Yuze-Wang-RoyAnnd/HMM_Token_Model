let me confess. i found this video used and bought it because guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket. but inside was another story. besides the fact that the movie was basically a parody of "invisible-man" genre special effects (highly visible strings and other such paraphernalia), the script wasted no chance -- in fact it went out of its way -- in insulting all non-wasp races and real-or-imagined homosexuals. every insult aimed at a person in the script was either homophobic or racist or both. it starts to grate on your nerves, along with the shaky sound, candid- camera style photography and melodramatic story. however, the end is somewhat of a surprise. but by the time you get there, you hardly care less. too bad, it could been a reasonably good movie.
