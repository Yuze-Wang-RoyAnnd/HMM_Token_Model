i wish i had my rental money back from this piece of trash so i could donate it to the home for aged actors. total rubbish!! five people watched this movie at the same time and there wasn't one single laugh to be heard, lots of yawning though. paltrow's a beautiful woman and she was the best thing to look at in the entire so-called comedic movie..
