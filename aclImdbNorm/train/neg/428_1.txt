wow, a movie about nyc politics seemingly written by someone who has never set foot in nyc. you know there's a problem when at one moment you expect the credits to roll and the movie continues on for another half hour. the characters are boring, john cusack's accent is laughable, and the plotline teeters between boring and laughable. a horrible movie.
