beyond dirt cheap, this shot-on-video exercise in ineptitude was difficult to get through. it's got the typical gore that you'd expect in a zombie movie, but none of the required atmosphere to make it worth while.<br /><br />what's strange is that this is an amateur german video, and the version i saw is english-dubbed! the dubbers seem to be american fans (penpals of the germans?!) who can't decide whether they want to play it straight or turn it into a comedy. one character (a white german, of course) is dubbed by a black guy apparently, who speaks with thick ebonics! 'kno wahm sayin', comrad?
