well, where to begin? i guess i can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed. call me ignorant for not knowing of schneebaum's book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that i have been living under some kind of a rock, but don't blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this "documentary" is actually a companion to said book. yeah, i felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why i sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a "modern cannibal tale." i mean, am i a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes? i certainly didn't expect an hour and forty-five minutes of one old geezer kissing his own ass by whining about every little detail of his dull and worn out life. i certainly didn't expect the insipid directing and i most notably did not foresee myself laughing so hard at tobias schneebaum and all of his off-putting glory.<br /><br />schneebaum is indeed unlikable. the old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of his even though he isn't even that interesting a character to fill a story. oh really? he was a cannibal? ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding schneebaum's dirty past. the only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when tobias finally breaks his little silent treatment about what happened to him in peru and say that he had "a small piece." that's it, folks. ninety minutes of bull later and tobias schneebaum is a cannibal by three inches. it's like calling a movie "the life of a true don juan" only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when he once played "just the tip." unbelievable.<br /><br />the directing is, indeed, superbly ghastly as there is no flow or rhythm to the story that is being told. alright, i understand that i didn't read schneebaum's volume before watching his celluloid tale of it, but i can still recognize some bad pacing and even worse editing. one minute schneebaum is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next he's going on and on about how he can't drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative or some failed and miserable saga in his life. i mean, jesus, can you at least slam his back story to the first part; follow up with some stuff covering his homosexuality and then end it off with a hearty look into his visit to peru? also: i don't particularly care much for schneebaum's insipid little quips on life and living, but i at least implore the old man to keep consistent with his ramblings. if i hear a guy talking about how he prefers life in the jungle i don't expect him to suddenly bitch and moan about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later. absurd.<br /><br />another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which our hero has appeared. while some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story, the director has overused the gimmick and broken his entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reels.<br /><br />the bottom line, here, is that tobias schneebaum is a fraud. pure and simple. i know that i haven't read the book, but i'm still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own. this documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an avid fan of schneebaum's work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a dvd. schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy, striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that his story is remarkably un-riveting. if you're looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism, turn away because "keep the river to your right" is an embarrassingly hilarious self-serving rant over a man who is long overdue for a straight-jacket and a gag.
