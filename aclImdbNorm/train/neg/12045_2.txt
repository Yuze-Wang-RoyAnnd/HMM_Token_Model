hello there,<br /><br />this is my first post in imdb even though i use it as a reference for quite a while. i would therefore like to salute you all. the fact that i am a greek is inevitably going to affect my judgement i hope not to your annoyance.<br /><br />i spent 2 years of my life, (all we greeks did actually), analysing omirus epos (and not homers as you see everywhere), rhyme by rhyme. if i recall well it was iliada (iliad) on 8th grade and odysseia (odyssey) on 9th grade. warner's troy, was a big disappointment to me and my fellow greeks around the campus (i study in the uk).<br /><br />iliad epos is one of the very best literature works ever made. it was composed by a greek poet omirus a whole 400 years after the actual war. historians put trojan war around 1200 bc, and the actual reason of the war not being helen's beauty but the strategically crucial position of troy. that said one may now understand that omirus epos is not presenting the actual events (as it's not accurate historically) but this was never the purpose of this work. <br /><br />reading this huge poem, one can find himself wondering for the very definitions of honour, love, anger, hate, heroism, discipline, loyalty and so on. the best part and the most educational as well were these prolonged talks between the warriors before the battle. none of these though were revealed in 'troy'<br /><br />warner's troy was really cheap to my eyes, and to other intellectual people english finnish and german colleagues of me as well. it is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. by the way perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster (computers graphics did the whole work), and yet it is wolfgang petersen's best work. <br /><br />i conclude saying that you'd better watch something else instead. i would give troy 2 out of 10. it is a really expensive b movie.<br /><br />cheers <br /><br />alex
