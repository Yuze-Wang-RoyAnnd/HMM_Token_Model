this movie had more holes than a piece of swiss cheese. ben affleck was seriously not trying to act in any way, shape, or form. he outright sucked. nothing about the movie was believable. the first problems were in the intro- where the man gives everything of value to the salvation army santa claus but it doesn't show why. and then the granny sticks her head in the oven- really beautiful, and has absolutely nothing to do with the movie- it's not even in the same tone as the movie. there was no explanation of the motivation for ben affleck to choose the house he chose; there was not any believable reactions by the family he chose; and people are swayed here and there without any cause to be swayed (example: christina applegate and ben affleck's characters go tobogganing down a steep slope- this is the incident that makes her suddenly fall in love with him. riiiight...) anyway, there was a funny moment or two- but they were a rarity in the movie. it seriously needed another rewrite (or 4). hope you enjoy!
