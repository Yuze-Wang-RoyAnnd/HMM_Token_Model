even in a bad film, there is usually some redeeming feature, something that you can say yes it was terrible, but there was that performance, or that part of the script, or that special effect, this was just simply terrible all over. the acting was laughable, the script terrible, complete with many inexplicable breakfast at tiffany's references, and even the special effects were shoddy at best. this was a very bad film and one that even drew barrymore wishes was expunged from history. watch it if you want to: a) suffer harsh self inflicted pain. b) see just how bad a film can be. this is one film where i can use the clich'e "there's ninety minutes of my life i will never get back" with some justification!
