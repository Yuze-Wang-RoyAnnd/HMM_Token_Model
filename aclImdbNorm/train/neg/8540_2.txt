as someone else mentioned, it begins with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat. then the main story: a photographer (gaffari) and a writer (shepard) meet by chance and take a trip into the mountains. first they spend the night at an inn where the slightly deaf landlord gets hollered at, with increasing irritation to the audience, by gaffari. once in the mountains they seek shelter again and are invited in by a kindly old lady who seems overly hospitable to strangers (hansel and gretel, anyone?) what happens next i will leave for the bold viewer to sort out because i most assuredly couldn't. now, i like eurohorror, and this woulda been better if only artigot (writer and director) had made some attempt at logical story telling. the backdrop (pyrenees?) makes an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult occurrences. the verdant peaks could easily obscure supernatural forces and those who command them. the photography is nice. just wish the whole thing made sense. you can view this film at archive.org.
