a movie about vixen (erica gavin) who has a mountie husband who she loves...but she loves sex too! in the course of the movie she gets multiple men in bed--including her husband and brother! also there's a (tame) lesbian sequence.<br /><br />this film put russ meyer on the map and was (i believe) the first critically acclaimed x rated film ever. it was a big hit when it came out. unfortunately, it doesn't date well.<br /><br />it is well-directed and erica gavin is just great (whatever happened to her), and it was very colorful...but by today's standards it's extremely tame. i'm surprised it has an nc-17 rating now--there's no hardcore sex and it only has topless females and no male nudity at all. also it's (sadly) pretty dull and the addition of politics at the end was confusing (and pretty silly). it is worth catching though to see what was considered very shocking in 1968. purportedly i saw the cut version (which has an r rating) but i've heard only a few seconds here and there are missing. <br /><br />meyer's next film "beyond the valley of the dolls" is much better and dates very well. catch that instead.
