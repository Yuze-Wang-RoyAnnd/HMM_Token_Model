well i'm blowed, a woody allen film that i walked out of after half an hour (i'm aware of the moral fragility of commenting on a film of which i've seen less than half, but i hope you'll understand why). basically, it became apparent very early on that we were going to be patronised from the screen with: a script that set out its conceit as if with bullet points; a cast that were all trying to be characters from hannah and her sisters (with the exception of chloe sevigny), and were badly directed into doing so; and a camera that sat around portentously, only for there to be nothing to film but chat and the actor delivering it. drama? none; it's partially pre-narrated, but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation.<br /><br />maybe i did leave too early in this case, but by then i'd decided against another hour and a half of one-liner-allen clones. the script has its funny moments
