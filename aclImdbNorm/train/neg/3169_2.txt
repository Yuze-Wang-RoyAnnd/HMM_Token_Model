this movie is one of the worst ones of the year. the main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible. paul rudd is the only one that has any talent, and the only one that is not annoying. i have never watched desparte housewives, so i don't know how eva longoria is on that show, but in this movie she was horrible. it's like she knows nothing about acting. all her character does is whine throughout the film, and she can't pull off being a b**** and still be entertaining. and the other girl, lake bell, displays little emotion and it's like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them.<br /><br />as for the story, it is so cookie cutter. it goes from point a to b with little surprise. so much more could have been used with kate as a ghost. the plot should have revolved more around her and the things she does as a spirit.<br /><br />final verdict: it's not worth watching.
