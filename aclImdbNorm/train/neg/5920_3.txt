unusual? yes!<br /><br />unusual setting for an american wartime movie, new zealand.<br /><br />unusual subject matter, four sisters and their relationships with american soldiers, from one bearing the illegitimate child of the dead son of a senator, to another living with seven marines (one at a time) before being murdered by her returning pow new zealander husband.<br /><br />unusual to see paul newman deliver such a poor performance so soon after his unforgettable role as rocky graziano in the brilliant "somebody up there loves me".<br /><br />unusual for two fine "stars" joan fontaine and jean simmons, to leave so little of themselves on a movie.<br /><br />unusual that i could be bothered to write a review of such a poor film, give it a miss!
