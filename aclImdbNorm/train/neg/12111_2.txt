written by a woman, and directed by another. whoppie. are we in for a feminist ride or what. fasten your seat-belts, ladies, for we are about to enter a world of mean men and innocent, well-intentioned women.<br /><br />in this soaper trish comes across a guy in the employment agency who behaves, looks, and dresses like a pimp(!) and gives her a job with the hope of nailing her some time later. in his office he even touches her chin the way a megalomaniacal heavy in a bond movie would a touch a girl just after he's captured her and just before he is ready to kill her alongside with bond. some time later the pimp/employment guy stalks trish in a ladies' dressing-room, harasses her, and even comes close to raping her. oh, these evil, evil men. they are all bad, don't you know. you can't even look for a job nowadays without getting raped, right ladies? well, we'll show 'em! in this film there is some kind of a divorced women's club or something, headed by a janet leigh who speaks for all women involved in this film when she says that "men are all s**t". she moans about how terrible men are; she has been divorced five times. now, seriously: any woman who marries twenty times and then uses that statistic as an argument that men are all "bad" must have realized eventually that the explanation might lie elsewhere, or? it must occur to her that: a) she is a bad judge of male character, or - much more likely - b) she is the one impossible to live with - her ex-husbands were probably the victims, or if they were indeed a**holes then she probably got what she deserved. (don't the likes of zsa-zsa gabor and liz taylor prove this point? show me a likable woman who got married this often and i'll show you a way to reach the planet mars using only roller-skates and a ladder.) trish eventually meets a computer guy who restores her faith in men - but hold your horses; this guy turns out to be married, therefore proving without a doubt that men are indeed all "bad". were it not, of course, for a kindly old vegetable seller around the corner who loves his wife even though she's still dead - proving that all men are "bad" except for kindly old men whose penises don't work and they "can't get none" anyway so they are forced to abandon a life of a**holocolism and finally give women the respect they deserve. even the supporting male characters are all "bad"; the black guy in the employment agency is unfriendly, and the guy in the mortuary is out-right rude - and insensitive (the bastard, *sob*...*sniffle*
