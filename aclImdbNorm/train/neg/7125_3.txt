villa rides (1968) turns out to be something of a big disappointment! and even though sam peckinpah had a hand in the screenplay, along with robert towne, it still emerges as a leadenly written movie dryly directed by the undistinguished buzz kulik. firstly, top billed yul brynner as pancho villa is wrong for the part! he's not charismatic enough to play the great mexican revolutionary! his one note performance lacks the fire and gusto anthony quinn or gilbert roland could have brought to the role. brynner simply looks like a russian aristocrat dressed up like a mexican bandit who is in the middle of the mexican revolution instead of the russian one. also, second billed robert mitchum is totally wasted in the picture! his part as a biplane flying ace lobbing home-made bombs from the air in the cause of the revolution is a poorly written meager role that could have been played by any minor star. mitch hasn't a decent line in the entire movie and brings to one's mind his other mexican revolution picture the far superior "bandido" (1956) which unfortunately nobody seems to have any interest in releasing on dvd. besides lacking any kind of style "villa rides" also suffers badly without the presence of a female star! there is starlet grazia buccella as a young mexican girl who gives mitchum the glad eye but her casting is merely perfunctory. someone like claudia cardinale or jean peters could have perhaps added a couple of badly needed notches to the faltering story line.<br /><br />there are a couple of good action scenes in the movie but a couple of good action scenes do not a movie make and the less than perfect panavision picture quality plus the over repetitive maurice jarre theme tune doesn't help matters.<br /><br />as is paramount's wont there are no extras - not even a trailer! yup, a disappointing movie and dvd presentation that could have been and should have been a whole lot better.
