i've seen some crappy movies in my life, but this one must be among the very worst. definately bottom 100 material (imo, that is).<br /><br />we follow two couples, the dodds (billy bob thornton as lonnie earl and natasha richardson as darlene) and the kirkendalls (patrick swayze as roy and charlize theron as candy) in one car on a roadtrip to reno.<br /><br />apparently, lonnie isn't too happy with his sex-life, so he cheats on his wife with candy, who's despirately trying to have a baby. roy, meanwhile, isn't too sure if his sperm is ok so he's getting it checked by a doctor.<br /><br />now, i had read the back of the dvd, but my girlfriend didn't, and she blurted out after about 20 minutes: 'oh yeah, she's gonna end up pregnant but her husband can't have any baby's'. spot on, as this movie is soooo predictable. as well as boring. and annoying. meaningless. offensive. terrible.<br /><br />an example of how much this movie stinks. the two couples set out in their big car towards nevada, when they are stopped by 2 police-officers, as they didn't stop at a stop-sign. the guys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a case of beer. not only is this scene pointless and not important (or even relevant) for the movie, it takes about 5 minutes! it's just talk and talk and talk, without ever going somewhere.<br /><br />i still have to puke thinking about the ending though. apparently, roy isn't having problems down there so he is the father of the child. how many times does that happen in the movies... try something new! the cheated wife ultimately forgives her husband and best friend for having the affair and they all live happily ever after. yuck.<br /><br />best scene of the movie is right at the end, with a couple of shots of the grand canyon. why couldn't they just keep the camera on that for 90 minutes?<br /><br />one would expect more from this cast (although thornton really tries), but you can't really blame them. writers, shame on you!<br /><br />1/10.
