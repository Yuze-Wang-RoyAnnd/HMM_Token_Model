with the exception of about 10 sublime minutes with hb warner on the celestial train, this was 94 minutes of jaw-dropping horribleness! the acting was atrocious, but the story is what i really found appalling. the acting was wooden and stilted, even by early talkies standards (the exceptions being lee tracy and hb warner, neither of whom can do wrong). rose hobart was absolutely horrid and lifeless as julie (as she likewise was in 1932's dr jekyll and mr hyde, an otherwise excellent flick). and the rest of the cast was worse, there being no words to describe their awfulness. <br /><br />worse than the acting, however, was the story. for some unknown reason, julie loves liliom, a cad and user of women with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. he marries julie but doesn't support her, instead lying in bed all day or hanging out with his low-life criminal pal (lee tracy). and, oh yeah, he never has a kind word to say to julie and he regularly beats her. julie loves him nonetheless and continually makes excuses for him, which only seems to make him more abusive. what's even sicker is that this movie presents this story to us as a love story. somehow we are supposed to see julie as a noble character whose pure love redeems liliom. wtf? <br /><br />the last 1/3 of this movie takes place after liliom has killed himself (a robbery plot goes awry and liliom plunges a knife into himself rather than being taken in by the police). as he lay dying, he tells julie "i beat you all the time, but i'm not sorry for it." when he at last dies, she finally tells him she loves him. (neither character ever said "i love you" to the other while they were alive.) after his death, god's chief magistrate gives liliom one more day on earth so that he can "do something good" for his unborn daughter. the price for this is 10 years in hell. after 10 years, liliom is allowed one day on earth to see his now 10-yr-old daughter. he approaches her in the front yard of her home and tries to cajole her into letting him "do something good" for her; he tries to get her to play cards, he tries to give her gabriel's horn, but she's not interested and rebuffs him. so he slaps her. he. slaps. her. and then he disappears back to the afterlife. looking on, we see his daughter tell julie about this. the girl says the slap didn't hurt, that it felt like a kiss. this is supposed to be the movie's magical moment. the girl asks her mother if such a thing is possible, and julie replies that "someone can be beat you and beat you and beat you and not hurt you at all." then the music swells and liliom rides up to heaven in the celestial train. blech! <br /><br />there was one saving grace to this film, and that is the interview between the chief magistrate (hb warner was truly magnificent here) and liliom on the celestial train. the magistrate had some very profound things to say to liliom about life and second chances and death. this scene alone made me bump this rating from 1 to 2 stars. regarding liliom's suicide as a means for escaping his problems, the magistrate says "people suppose that when they die, their difficulties are ended for them. you thought that by killing yourself that you would cancel all your responsibilities. it is not as simple as that. on earth your name is still spoken; your face is still remembered. as long as one is left who remembers you, so long is the matter unended. until you have been completely forgotten, you will not be finished with the earth, even though you are dead." some great sublime transcendental stuff amongst some of the most horrible trash i've ever seen. <br /><br />by the way, this story has apparently been filmed many times both as "liliom" and as the musical "carousel."
