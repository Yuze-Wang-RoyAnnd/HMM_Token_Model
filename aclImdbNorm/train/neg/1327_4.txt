this dreadful film assembles every asian stereotype you can imagine into one hideous package. money grubbing, devious japanese business men send goofy but loveable policeman pat morita to recover industrial secrets in detroit. here he encounters a down at heel jay leno, who promptly refers to a murder victim as a jap and calls morita tojo. it's all downhill from there.
