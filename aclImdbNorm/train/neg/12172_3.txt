after the debacle of the first sleepaway camp, who thought that a franchise could be born. sc ii is superior in aspect. more inspired killings and just whole lot more fun. while that might not be saying much (compared to the first movie), sleepaway camp ii is worth the rental.<br /><br />pros: entertaining, doesn't take itself too seriously like sc i. inspired killings. cons: crappy acting and mullets abound.<br /><br />bottom line: 5/10<br /><br />
