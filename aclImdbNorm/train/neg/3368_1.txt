for movie fans who have never heard of the book (shirley jackson's "the haunting of hill house") and have never seen the 1963 robert wise production with julie harris, this remake will seem pretty darn bad.<br /><br />for those of us who have, it is just plain awful.<br /><br />bad acting (what was neeson thinking?), goofy computer enhancements, and a further move away from jackson's story doom this remake.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and rent the original movie. it still effectively scares without hokey special effects. the acting is professional and believable.<br /><br />for readers of the book, the from 1963 follows the it much closer.
