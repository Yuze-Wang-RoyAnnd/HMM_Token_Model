i despise horror movies, that is no secret. no plot, bad acting and gallons of blood are staples of these mistakes of cinema, and this "movie" is no exception. i cannot believe some cable stations actually run this garbage. (this particular garbage was released straight-to-video, as i recall.) as mentioning any other movie would be a great insult to that other movie, i say this: all of the phantasm movies, all of the jason movies, freddy movies, chucky movies, and most of the michael myers movies can be summed up in one word: terrible!!!<br /><br />rating (phantasm iii): 0.5/10
