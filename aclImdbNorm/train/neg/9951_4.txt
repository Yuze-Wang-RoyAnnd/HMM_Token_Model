johnny and jeremy are vampires of sorts. minus the fangs, of course. they're dark, bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery. through their charms (namely a sharp tongue and a fat wallet, respectively) they seduce desperate souls, who they proceed to torment and victimize. that's more or less the basis of this black comedy, as i understand it.<br /><br />it's not a blend of black humor that i can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience rooting for the sleazy, main character. i did enjoy, however, the sound and the melody of the rapid-fire (and supposedly very witty) remarks. i was very impressed by the cast's strong acting, particularly david thelis's; only the character of jeremy seemed too bi-dimensional. the photography and the music, both dramatic and somber, work very well together. <br /><br />what really turns me off about "naked" (and the main reason i'd never recommend it to anyone) is the way it repeatedly seems to present misogyny as a valid way to vent one's angst. in other words, in a world that sucks so bad, what difference does it make if one inflicts some pain on girls, right? to suggest (as some have on this website) that johnny is not so unkind a person because he's not as rough on girls as jeremy, seems completely absurd to me. they're both terrible, nasty people. and they're particularly keen on hurting women every single time they get a chance. one could argue that johnny eventually gets what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly swung straight back and bit him in the ass. but still, his and jeremy's sadistic behavior are treated to a certain degree as a laughing matter. and i could be wrong, but i'm guessing that most people who absolutely love this movie also find that aspect of the film darkly comical.
