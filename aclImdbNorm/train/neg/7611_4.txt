1st watched 2/28/2006 - 4 out of 10(dir-sydney pollack):-dvd version i watched titled "3 days of the condor"- so so cia drama full of laid-back performances making for a very laid-back movie. the premise of the story revolves around 7 out of 8 members of a cia research group being killed with robert redford's character, codename = condor, being the one that was left. who killed them and why? that's what redford tries to find out while trying to not be the 8th victim at the same time. along the way, he gets faye dunaway's character involved involved, originally because he needs a place to hide, and then she eventually helps him out after a little lovey-dovey time. this is one of a handful of innocent guy on the run stories but this one doesn't have a lot of suspense. the flat performances don't help and the finish doesn't seal the deal for the audience enough either. despite having a good director in sydney pollack and a group of classic performers, the story and the performances are not what they should be and therefore the movie is not what it should be.
