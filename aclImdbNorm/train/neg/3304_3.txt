greenthumb grace is left penniless after her husbands death so she turns to ganja-growing in order to pay the bills. it sounds promising and the ever-reliable brenda blethyn doesn't disappoint but the material is sitcom-thin. there's actually a scene where grace asks her young gardener to "give me one" (a toke) and he thinks she's asking for sex and acts all awkward. yes, it's humour so twee a nun would be bored. saving grace doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of ryan's daughter whilst the light-hearted whimsy of the country townsfolk could be lifted from any episode of antiques roadshow. it does speed up after the first hour but by then it's too clich'ed to care. the climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless deux ex machina i've ever seen.
