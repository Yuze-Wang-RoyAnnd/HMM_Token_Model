elizabeth taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying, untalented self in this film. this was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy. rock hudson was ok as bick benedict but clearly an actor with more range like william holden would have been better. james dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie. the whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long. the actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make-up. hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and dean and carroll baker were obviously the same age.<br /><br />0/10.
