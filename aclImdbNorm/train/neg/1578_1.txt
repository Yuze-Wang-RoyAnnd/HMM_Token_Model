imagine, its, say 12-1am - your at home, your bored, your not tired. this scenario occurred about, say 4 or so years back..i turned on the tv and flicked over a few channels and found that this film was on. oh my word this is the worst film i have ever seen! a runaway car that cant be stopped (cos the brakes have been cut or something) in caning it down the freeway - whats gonna happen?! this film was so bad its actually funny - i think the stunts cost about $2 to make, there was one instance where a baby/small child is being winched from the car by a helicopter - in an attempt to excite the viewer - a conveniently placed bridge is nearing ahead...this is the best bad bit of a film ever - it shows the child narrowly missing the bridge but it looks so bad - you can almost see the make of the dummy that they used - total low budget classic! cant remember the end of the film, though but i bet it was great<br /><br />i doubt they will ever show this film again so i'm glad i got to see this piece of trash!
