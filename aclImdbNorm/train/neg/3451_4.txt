frank sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns. he was a great actor, from here to eternity and the man with the golden arm are a proof of that, but he did not have the physique of a western hero, you identified him as an urban guy. but he tried to do his job well in johnny concho, the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault. i blame it on two factors: a) the story was too unusual, specially in the fact that sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie. in a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern, to break away from it the film has to be very good. b) the story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother. also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible, why all the gunfighters have not adopted it? i think that this film should not have been withdrawn, because any film with sinatra is worth seeing, and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable
