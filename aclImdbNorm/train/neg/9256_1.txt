pointless short about a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other. that's it. for about 5 minutes we see this. it's shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men running around slapping each other to the tune of dreadful music. it looks interesting but there's no plot and really--the violence inherent in this got disturbing. also the homo eroticism in this is played up but mixing it with violence was not a good idea. some people who like avant garde material might like this but i found it incomprehensible, boring, stupid and (ocassionally) disturbing. really--what is the point in all this? i saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in stunned silence. i really wish i could go lower than 1.
