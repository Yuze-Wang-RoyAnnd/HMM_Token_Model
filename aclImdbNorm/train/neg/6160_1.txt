i wouldn't say this is a *bad* movie. unfortunately for me, i get the feeling that the more you know about fencing, the worse it gets simply due to the fact that it becomes totally unrealistic. i've been fencing since i was 14 years old, and this movie portrays it very poorly. f. murray abraham is good (and appears to have some fencing background), but most of the other actors--especially the students--just seem to be lost.
