exceedingly complicated and drab. i'm a bright guy, but this was just too much for a tired brain. it would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing. probably better for the us market. gc himself hinted that this alone did not supply his oscar and you can see why.<br /><br />still the sand dunes are pretty. the nail pulling is nasty. the attorneys drunk dad is a mystery. the cricket is good to see.<br /><br />very difficult to write the required ten lines on this, despite it being over 2 hours long. thank heavens they shortened it. admittedly we don't get to the pictures much, but the last film we saw, walk the line, was 10 times better and i don't really like johnny cash. my wife says george still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so there's that.....am i nearly there yet ?<br /><br />how about now
