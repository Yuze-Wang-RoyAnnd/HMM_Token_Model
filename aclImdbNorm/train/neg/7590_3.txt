gorgeous bodies, gorgeous colors and camera work, pretentious dialog, banal plot. the name of the prima donna, camilla, and the eponymous flowers that appear frequently, are enough to remind us of the plot similarities from dumas' novel la dame aux camelias, the movie camille starring garbo and (i think) robert taylor, and last but not least verdi's opera la traviata. beautiful, not-too-virtuous young ladies, social outcasts for one reason or another, loved, split up, reunited just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene... one forgives banal plots and stupid unrealistic dialog in opera, but why waste hayak, don sutherland, a beautiful rendition of la in the 30s, a deus ex machina earthquake that conveniently kills the other woman, and all that beauty on this mediocre turkey where there isn't even any beautiful singing?
