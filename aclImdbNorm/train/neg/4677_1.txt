what a load of leftist hollywood bilge. this movie glorifies mutiny as brave and noble if it be for pacifist principles. the fairytale ends with the pacifist character, played by danzel washington, actually getting promoted for his treason. what is it with these hollywood tools? is this still payback for mccarthyism?<br /><br />if i sound cynical it's because i am fed up with movies hawking a political agenda. the military brass in this movie are portrayed as, what else? gung-ho war mongers. sound familiar? ever see a movie where the cia or any government agency is not evil? think about it. yet again, crimson tide stresses the point. the hackman character, u-boat captain ramsey, comes across like a raving lunatic, until the very end when, of course he comes to his senses, does a complete 360, renounces his blood lust, suggests a promotion for the treasonous ron hunter, and repents by retiring from the service. a guy mutinies, takes command of your boat, puts the u.s at grave risk of receiving a nuclear first-strike, and you promote him???? what hogwash!
