this movie should not be viewed unless you are trying to kill yourself. i think this movie could actually cause severe brain damage. the main characters are the whiny non-hero kevin, amy, his bratty, ungodly conservative girlfriend, kyle, a dork in red shorts who enjoys phone sex, daphne, a scrawny, horny girl who is supposed to be "cool" and has no sense of how to dress, and her oversexed boyfriend nick, an army recruit who can make an innuendo out of anything. no, i'm not a pervert, that's really how the movie goes. the movie itself is an over-sexed rip-off of 1986's gremlins, only you'll never find a trace of gizmo anywhere. no, these hobgoblins, unleashed by wimpy man (i'm sorry, kevin), make someone's wildest dreams come true, and then kill the victims. yes, you guessed it-eventually, they wind up in a strip club, where the nerdy amy's greatest dream is revealed-she wants to be a stripper! look, i watched this flick via mst3k, and even with mike nelson, tom servo, and crow t. robot making a laughing-stock out of this cinematic trainwreck and it still made me bleed from both eyes. not really, but i wish i had. i'm not giving you anymore plot, because reliving it gives me this great urge to drive a pitchfork through my brain. besides, it's not like there's a plot worth mentioning. they should put a surgeon's general warning on this film.
