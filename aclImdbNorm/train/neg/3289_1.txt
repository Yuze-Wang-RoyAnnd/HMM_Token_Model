i'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows that was on tv. did we really need a big screen re-make? did they ask the fans? i wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of "rocky horror picture show" with actors like ashton krutcher, steve martin, britney spears, and kiefer southerland, took out all the music, and made it a drama. do you think they would like that! this movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had. sure the original was a bit corny at times, but bo and luke were always nice, they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble, and their main objective was to help people that passed through town. none of that mattered to the people that made this film, they might have never even seen the original show all the way through. my big question is, what will they ruin next?
