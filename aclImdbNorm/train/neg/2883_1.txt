this movie is just so awful. so bad that i can't bear to expend anything other than just a few words. avoid this movie at all costs, it is terrible.<br /><br />none of the details of the crimes are re-enacted correctly. lots of slaughterhouse footage. weird cuts and edits. no continuity to the plot. the acting is absolutely the most amateur i have ever seen.<br /><br />this bomb of a movie was obviously made to make some money without any regard to the accuracy of it's content. the camera work is out of focus at times and always shaky. it looks as if it was shot on video.<br /><br />in fact, now that they've got dennis rader with life in prison, i wish they would put the guys that made this horrible movie into prison as well.<br /><br />seriously, don't even think about watching this one. i'd give it a negative star if i could.
