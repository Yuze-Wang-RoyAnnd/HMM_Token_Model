the alarmist is so abysmally scripted that you have think to yourself why on earth did an up and coming actor like david arquette agree to be in it. it has to be one of the weakest plots i have ever seen and without any humour at all, it borders on the brink of tedious. it staggers along to a dreadful conclusion which appears to only happen because the director got bored and just wanted to wrap up quickly in order to get home for his dinner. stay away!.
