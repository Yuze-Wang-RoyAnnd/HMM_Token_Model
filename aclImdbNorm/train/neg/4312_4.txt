this one acts as a satire during the women's rights movement era. of course, that doesn't mean coach (the movie) is a wonderful experience to behold. it runs into the same vein as fastbreak (which was better, but still tame), and is basically standard fare fluff. what i mean for this movie being uninteresting is simple to recognize. anybody who serves time away from a normal job by training a bunch of lunatics earning their way to sudden victory makes waste. it's the same feeling you may get after watching this. a nice attempt at casting the opposite sex for a man's duty, but i expected better things.
