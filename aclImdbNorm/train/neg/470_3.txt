i used to love this movie as a kid but, seeing it again 20+ years later, it actually sucks. up the academy might have been ahead of it's time back in 1980, but it has almost nothing to offer today! movies like caddyshack and stripes hold-up much better today than this steaming dogpile. no t&a. no great jokes except for the one-liners we've all heard a million times by now.<br /><br />i recently bought the dvd in hopes that it would be the gem i remembered it being. well, i was way off! the soundtrack had only 2-3 widely-recognizable hits (not the smash compilation others had mentioned) and the frequent voice-overs were terrible. the only thing that was interesting, to me, was predicting what the character's lines were before they said them. yep, i watched this movie that much back then! <br /><br />the only reason i am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten, sorry to say. :(
