wow. simply awful. i was a fan of the original movie, and begrudgingly sat through part 2, 3 was and improvement. 4,5 and freddy's dead were pretty bad. but nothing is as bad as freddy's nightmares. freddy acts as a rod serlingesq host of this anthology series.<br /><br />i can accept how freddy became one punchline after another, but at least in the movies the appeal of freddy carried the movies, but here these were so poorly made, they looked like high school productions of a horror series. the poor actors, if you really want to call yourself that after doing this show were obviously exactly what they paid for. i'm nearly certain this was a stopping point for two types of actors. ones just starting on the hollywood ladder, brand new willing to take any part that would put off their having to take that porn job they were offered last week, or seasoned actors on their way down the hollywood ladder willing to take any part that would put off their having to take that porn job they were offered last week.<br /><br />i half expected dana plato to guest star, but she was already dead by the time this was in production.<br /><br />to paraphrase nancy's line in the original elm st,"what ever you do try not to fall asleep watching this."
