kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness! the plot is so contrived and unbelievable. . . starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain! then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people(including clergy) involved in what is a crime everywhere. next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces. a very unpleasant and coo coo mother, aided, abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends! moving the setting from an island off the coast of south carolina, did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget. the very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service. kim basinger whom i do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade. also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads. i thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all. the movie i kept surfing back and forth to, had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much. unless you like an unbelievable story, wooden acting, a contorted mixture of religious/mythological/allegory my advice is to skip this one. oh and maybe a small carping criticism, but wouldn't a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat? the best part of this movie is the scenery
