of the many problems with this film, the worst is continuity; and re-editing it on vhs for a college cable channel many years ago, i tried to figure out what exactly went wrong. what seems to have happened is that they actually constructed a much longer film and then chopped it down for standard theatrical viewing. how much longer? to fill in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require about three more hours of narrative and character development - especially given the fact that the film we do have is just so slow and takes itself just so seriously.<br /><br />that's staggering; what could the halperins have possibly been trying to accomplish here? their previous film, "white zombie", was a successful low budget attempt to duplicate the early universal studios monster films (the mummy, dracula, etc.), and as such stuck pretty close to the zombie mythology that those in north america would know from popular magazines.<br /><br />revolt of the zombies, to the contrary, appears to have been intended as some allegory for the politics of modern war. this would not only explain the opening, and the change of dean jagger's character into a megalomaniac, but it also explains why the zombies don't actually do much in the film, besides stand around, look frightening, and wait for orders - they're just allegorical soldiers, not the undead cannibals we've all come to love and loathe in zombie films.<br /><br />i am the equal to any in my dislike for modern war and its politics - but i think a film ought to be entertaining first, and only later, maybe, educational. and definitely - a film about zombies ought to be about zombies.<br /><br />truly one of the most bizarre films in hollywood history, but not one i can recommend, even for historic value.
