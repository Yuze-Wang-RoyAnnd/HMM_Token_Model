full marks for the content of this film, as a brit i was not aware that there was segregation in the us navy during wwii. a very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world. however, the movie is pathetic, direction is non existent, the acting is wooden and the script is just one clich'e after another. i can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together. this could have been a great movie, the story for many of us outside of the us was new, unique and also interesting. the sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together. it is unfortunate that a true story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, has been squandered on a low budget, badly directed movie. i only hope that some time in the future, one of the major studios will take this theme and do it justice.
