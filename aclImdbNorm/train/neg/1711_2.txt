well, i bought the zombie bloodbath trilogy thinking it would be mindless gory fun. that's what it is, without the fun. this film truly is mindless, it is absent of any plot or character development, or any sort of storyline. the basic problem with this movie is the kills and gore. basically, every kill looks exactly the same. zombies ripping someone apart. yeah, that's okay, but you need some original kills too. i mean it got really lame, every kill looked exactly the same, filmed exactly the same way. thats what killed me. i love gore, and the gore in this film did nothing for me. it was just boring. no storyline, just the same lame scene over and over again with a different person. i wanted to like this movie, too. i love shot on video gore movies...like redneck zombies. but i couldn't kid myself. this film has it's good points, but none of those are in the film. i understand that many of the "zombies" helped out with the flood and there were like over 100 zombies, which is pretty cool how they got so many people involved and helped out in the world. but overall, this is a terrible film.
