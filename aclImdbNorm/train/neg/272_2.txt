when i was younger i really enjoyed watching bad television. we've all been guilty of it at some time or another, but my excuse for watching things like "buck rogers in the 25th century" and "silver spoons" is this: i was young and naive; ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhile.<br /><br />thankfully, i now appreciate the good stuff. stargate sg-1 is not good. the 12 year-old me would love every hackneyed bit of it, every line of stilted dialogue, every bit of needless technobabble. the writing is beyond insipid; so bland and uninspired it makes one miss star trek: voyager. if your show makes me long for the worst trek show ever, you're in trouble.<br /><br />the film stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure, anchored by two solid performances by james spader and kurt russell, full of fascinating egyptian architecture and culture, a wonderful musical score, and cool sci-fi ideas. with the exception of a little of the original music, none of what made the film fun appears in this show. even richard dean anderson, who made macgyver watchable and legend interesting, seems like he's half asleep most episodes.<br /><br />the budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebody's basement. the cinematography isn't much better, as vanilla and dull as the scripts. it amazes me that shows with a lot more style (like farscape) and substance (like the reimagined battlestar galactica) have smaller, less rabid fanbases than this pap. it just doesn't deserve it.
