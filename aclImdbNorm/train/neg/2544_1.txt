gung ho was a good idea, however it is to much to ask americans viewers to understand the dynamics of american jobs and foreign competition.in this movie the main character hunt stevenson(michael keaton) goes to japan and convinces a japanese auto company to come to america and help his dying pennslyvania town. two things come at you.first why would a japanese company come to america to make cars when they do so ,and so well at that? secondly can anyone understand that american companies of all types go to third world nations to have their products made to escape american labor costs? it makes the film's premise then that the number one maker of cars in the world would go to one of its' top competitors(aside from germany)and put a plant there as unrealistic. keaton was still in his comedy mode by this time. but he gives a credible performance all the same as he could prove that he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not embarrass himself but director ron howard can't keep this from becoming a tv movie which it ends up being anyway because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending the politics and problems of japanese and american relations not withstanding. gung ho has a happy days and laverne and shirley feel to it as the producers of both tv shows made the film and then made the tv version of this movie as well which gives the film its' lightweight feel.the japanese manager gets to love his american workers and feels he and other japanese people can learnfrom americans.his no.2 man saito who supposedly doesn't like americans all that much doesn't think so.i would have prefered all the japanese characters been like saito than the soft goofball characters they made the japanese out to be.it would have made the film more interesting.
