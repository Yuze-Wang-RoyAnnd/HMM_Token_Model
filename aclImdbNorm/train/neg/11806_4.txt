it was hard to watch this film and be totally fair and objective since i am a big fan the original 1944 movie. that, to me and many others, is one of the greatest film noirs ever made. realizing this is simply a shortened made-for-tv film and that most people had trashed it, i didn't expect much, but you can't help but compare this with the '44 film. scene after scene, i found myself comparing what i was looking at it, and remembering how it played out with fred macmurray, barbara stanwyck, edward g. robinson and others. now i was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by richard crenna, samantha eggar and lee j. cobb.<br /><br />when it was all over, i found it wasn't as bad as i had expected but it's no match for the 1944 original. the two main areas in which this made-for-tv film wasn't as good were (1) the electricity between the two leads was missing and (2) being only 90 minutes, they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot, characters and chemistry between those leads. crenna and eggar were flat, and simply no match for macmurray and stanwyck as "walter neff" and "phyllis dietrichson," respectively.<br /><br />where this re-make held its own was in the other characters, such as "barton keyes" and "edward norton." cobb was terrific as keyes and robert webber as norton, head of the insurance company. it also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed, so the houses, cars, telephones, dictating machines, etc., were all early '70s instead of mid '40s. otherwise, the storyline was very similar, just rushed.<br /><br />however, one viewing was enough and i will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story and film.
