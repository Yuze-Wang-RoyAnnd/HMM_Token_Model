last night i decided to watch the prequel or shall i say the so called prequel to carlito's way - "carlito's way: rise to power (2005)" which went straight to dvd...no wonder .....it completely ...and i mean completely s%&ks !!! waist of time watching it and i think it would be a pure waist of time writing about it.... i don't understand how de palma agreed on producing this sh#t-fest of a movie....except for only one fact that i tip my hat to... jay hernandez who plays the young brigante.... reminded me how de niro got into the shoes of brando to portray the young don corleone in godfather ii ...but the difference de niro was amazing and even got an oscar for it !!! jay hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young pacino.... too bad for him i don't think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after i watched this sh#$%ty movie, i sat down and watched the original carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth.
