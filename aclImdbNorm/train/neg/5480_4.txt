it was 1 a.m. in the morning and i had nothing else to do. don't judge me... please.<br /><br />we're back in time during the spanish settlements. a group have made their way onto an island. it doesn't take too long before they encounter a large "reptile", which gobbles up their horse. soon they're captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the "reptile gods." the cg sucks; it reminds me of the cg of early console video games. the encounters were lame. the only positive thing i have to say about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit. otherwise it's just a middling effort.
