i found this a good movie to pass your time, but not by any chance of any historical value. the portrayal of cleopatra reminded me a cheap soap opera.<br /><br />the twist of the facts is... funny! she gave birth while feeding her people!?!? o please... a pregnant queen of egypt (especially this one) would not bother to go from one room to the other for that reason! they tried to make her appear a saint for god's sake! and the way they tried to justify her murdering her own sister... beyond description.<br /><br />cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time. her decisions were based anything but her feelings and morals. she did everything for only two reasons: power and self-preservation! she was borne in a family where she had to straggle for survival, something she did very well. anything that stood on her way was either murdered (her brothers and sister) or seduced (ceasar and mark anthony).<br /><br />unfortunately octavian was too powerful to kill and too... gay to be seduced. so, he was her end...
