for a film about a killer this is surprisingly dull.<br /><br />nothing much happens and even when things do happen they don't generate any real excitement or interest.<br /><br />the acting is good from the two leads, cassetti in particular delivers a great performance combining the certainty and stupidity of succo but the rest of the cast also do what they need to.<br /><br />the problem is that there is poor writing and direction and the fact that as a true story it isn't interesting, succo is not a unique character, he isn't interesting or exciting.<br /><br />films of this sort normally try to generate tension or empathy or outrage and this generates nothing except a feeling of regret that you wasted your time watching it.
