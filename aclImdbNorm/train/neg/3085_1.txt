description: corny, utterly stupid and worthless. it's so cheap and lame, it'll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted 2 months or so to spend a budget (i'm guessing this...) probably no more than 700 dollars to make this movie. it was just hysterical to watch with or without mystery science theater. i am giving you the best advice in the world:<br /><br />spare yourself, spare your time, life, and money, by not--i repeat, not even ponder about whether you should see this movie. this movie is so corny, it'll make your face turn purple of outraged boredom. if you have a one-digit iq, then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie. you might actually admire it. (like i said before, if you have a one-digit iq)<br /><br />with about 12 actors of your own, a few puppets you bought at a garage sale, and of course cameras and music, i gaurentee you'll make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap.
