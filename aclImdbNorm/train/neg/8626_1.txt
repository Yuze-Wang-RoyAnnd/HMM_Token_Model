looking through the other comments, i'm amazed that there aren't any warnings to potential viewers of what they have to look forward to when renting this garbage. first off, i rented this thing with the understanding that it was a competently rendered indiana jones knock-off. what i got was one of the most offensive movies i can remember trying to sit through, made all the more shocking by the movie's comparatively high production values.<br /><br />i don't think this is a spoiler, but if it is, be warned...<br /><br />if your idea of entertainment is watching bimbo getting raped from behind by fearsome tribal chief, while she is staring into the dead eyes of her significant other's severed head, by all means, rent this flick. if not, i'd advise you to look elsewhere for entertainment.<br /><br />come to think of it, that scene so succinctly sums up the movie that there's nothing else i really need to say about it.
