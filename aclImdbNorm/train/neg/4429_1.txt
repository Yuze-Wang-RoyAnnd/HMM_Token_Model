what a piece of stupid tripe.<br /><br />i won't even waste time evaluating any of the points of this show. it's not worth the time. the one comment i will make is - why get such a dumb, inarticulate doofus to be the star?!?<br /><br />there aren't many more dismal testimonials to the deteriorating mental condition of the networks than the fact that fox has stated it will not bring back john doe (a decent series) but will bring back brain-dead drivel like joe millionaire for yet another round of killing the brain cells of the american public.<br /><br />fox has lost it, imho.
