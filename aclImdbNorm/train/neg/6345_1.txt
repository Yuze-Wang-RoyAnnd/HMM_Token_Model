this movie is just an excuse for the writer to make a film out of 2 failed scripts.<br /><br />its characters are just an assembly of characters with clich'e tragic or comic attributes the sum total of which is neurotic dialog like only woody allen could write. woman love this because its like looking in the mirror so they will enjoy this film probably<br /><br />this movies was not enjoyed by me however because there was no car chase and also the film didn't have any fights. there was also no drug lords or gang bangers. not to mention a lack of snakes. this film had no snakes. not my cup of tea and maybe not yours ether so think about what i have said before you find yourself watching this film.<br /><br />unless of course you resemble a female have weight issues man issues enjoy sex and the city and ally mcbeal then this is meaningful for you.
