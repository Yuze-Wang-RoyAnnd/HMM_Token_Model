i rented this film to see what might be a bloody, non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action-drama that makes kickboxer look like die hard. lou and reb are in vietnam and as lou saves reb from the gooks, he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever. the vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard, i swear! lou is now brain damaged and reb and him live together and own a bar. super homoerotic. lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and reb goes on a killing spree to get him back. there is no good fight scenes at all, the punches are two inches away from a person. characters personalities change in matter of seconds. one guy is a bad and in the next scene he's good. the acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental frank stallone sounding song that would make you sick. i hated this film.
