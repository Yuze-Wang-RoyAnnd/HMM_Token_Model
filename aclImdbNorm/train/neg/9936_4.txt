picked this up for 50 cents at the flea market, was pretty excited.<br /><br />i found it fascinating for about 15 min, then just repetitive and dull.<br /><br />it is neat seeing mick and the gang in their prime, i wish there was not so much over dubbing of dialog so i could hear what there are saying and playing.<br /><br />the skits are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple, sort of poorly written monty python on acid. i spent more time looking at the late 60's england back drops rather then what was actually happening in the silly skits.<br /><br />this movie is a good reminder that times really change,and what was important quickly becomes just plain silly. good song, but it has now been played to death by this dvd.
