what do you call a horror story without horror and story? <br /><br />this is the most irritating thing about the film: i get the feeling the writers never really decided what's actually going on in the film! it's a different thing to know it, give hints for the audience and not completely reveal it, but here, you get the feeling the screenwriters don't know it, characters in the film do not know it and audience sees that no one knows! (remember "cube"? even that film knew more about itself.) <br /><br />i've consumed a lot of 80's horror / gore films and this movie certainly has its roots deep in those films. but a lot of important things are missing. we really know nothing about the characters. they keep repeating empty lines over and over again. the story isn't really developing - it never goes anywhere. b-acting is ok in this type of horror films, but there's not much to act in the script. we don't care about the characters. there's nothing to remember about them. there's not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex. and most importantly - no thrills, no chills.<br /><br />you only get some commonly used elements of the horror film genre. they show the lordi monsters one by one but their characters don't really contribute anything for the story.<br /><br />i honestly believe that this amount of story, character development and atmosphere could be achieved with minimal amount of crew and equipment. oh yeah, film makers used to do that - and more - some 20 years ago! i felt the shared embarrassment of the audience as the film ended. too bad really.
