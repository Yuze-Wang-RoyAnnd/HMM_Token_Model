i remember i saw this cartoon when i was 6 or 7. my grandfather picked up the video of it for free at the mall. i remember that it really sucked. the plot had no sense. i hated the fox that became casper's friend. he was so stupid! casper cried his head off if he couldn't find a friend. so what? get over it! the only good part and i don't want to sound mean-spirited was when the fox got shot and died at the end. i laughed my head off in payback because this cartoon sucked so much. the bad news is the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost. i wish he had stayed dead. i think i even gave the video of this to somebody because i hated it. no wonder they were offering it for free at the mall. if you have a child don't let them watch this. they will probably agree with me that it sucks.
