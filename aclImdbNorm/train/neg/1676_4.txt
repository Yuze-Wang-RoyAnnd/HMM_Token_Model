val kilmer, solid performance. dylan mcdermott, solid performance. josh lucas, solid performance. three very engaging actors giving decent performances. the problem is, who cares about the plot? john holmes. infamous for his well-endowments, a drug addict, and a guy who, despite contracting aids, continued to make adult films, just does not make an intriguing character.<br /><br />the story surrounds the events leading up to and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder that occurred in the late 80's in los angelos to which holmes was linked, arrested and charged with murder, and who ultimately was acquitted. just like in the case of o.j., the guilt factor, regardless of the outcome, ranged quite high in the "he did it" zone.<br /><br />there is no one to sympathize with in this film, as everyone is a self-serving criminal. there is just nothing remotely interesting here.
