any film with a title as ridiculous as "the bagman" should automatically attract the attention of any bad movie lover, but the plot is far different than what one may expect after viewing the dvd cover. the bagman is by no means a good movie. it falls into the category of films that seem to have been (and probably were) filmed on a home video camera. the acting is awful. i haven't heard and seen such wooden acting since troll 2. there are plenty of scenes with nudity and sex, but they are clearly jumped into too fast. the characters are morons and entirely forgettable. the ending (which i will not spoil) can be easily anticipated after watching the very first scene. due to the cheesy nature of the film, nothing aside from the awful production values is truly scary (awful attempts at realistic gore, a driving scene where the car is clearly stationary, etc). recommended for bad movie aficionados only.
