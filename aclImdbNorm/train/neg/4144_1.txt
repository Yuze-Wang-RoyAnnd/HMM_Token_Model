vampires vs. zombies starts with the breaking news that the unidentified disease that is spreading across america leaves the sufferer with homicidal & cannibalistic tendencies... travis fontaine (c.s. munro) & his teenage daughter jenna (bonny giroux) listen to the radio as they drive along the isolated backwoods roads to try & escape the disease when travis runs over a guy who i assume is meant to be a zombie. slightly further down the road he stops to help julia (brinke stevens) & her teenage daughter carmilla (maratama carlson) who are waving at the side of the road, at this point there is also a third teenage girl named tessa (melanie crystal) sitting in the back of julia's car bound & gagged. to me this situation would seem strange but travis, like the trooper he is, takes it all in his stride & agrees to 'take' carmilla off julia's hands &, well i don't know actually. so, with a complete stranger, travis drives off leaving julia & tessa. carmilla seems like a nice girl but she turns out to be a vampire & she likes to bite people & turn them into vampires, oh & she's partial to a bit of lesbianism too. travis, carmilla & jenna continue to travel while some guy who calls himself the general (peter ruginis) who appears to be some sort of vampire killer & probably has something to do with it all but the film is such a mess it doesn't really matter & i really don't know how to carry on this plot outline as my head hurts just thinking about it...<br /><br />co-edited, co-executive produced, written & directed by the supremely untalented vince d'amato vampires vs. zombies is one of the worst horror films ever & therefore one of the worst films ever period. the script by d'amato was apparently based on a classic story entitled 'carmilla' by sheridan le fanu (he should sue) & is an absolute mess, the holes in the plot & logic are so big you could drive a tank through them! what is the disease that turns people into zombies? why is carmilla a vampire? who is julia to her? who the hell is the general? what does he want? where are travis & jenna going? how can travis run a man over & yet not have the slightest bit of human emotion over it? what's with the mental ward at the end? there are also some confusing & unnecessary dream sequences just to annoy the viewer even more. there are just so many things wrong with this film, the narrative doesn't make a blind bit of sense, the concept is terrible & never really explained properly plus it's incredibly boring. i have not one positive thing to say about vampire vs. zombies, not one. forget about any vampires fighting zombies because it just doesn't happen, tell me again why is this film called vampires vs. zombies?<br /><br />director d'amato has served up one of the most incompetent, rubbishy, badly made, poorly thought out & excruciatingly painful viewing experiences ever made. vampires vs. zombies really has no redeeming qualities at all, there is not one single aspect that i can praise. the gore is really fake looking, there are some blood splats which look like red water, some really cheap staking effects & a half decent climax where the zombies feast on carmilla's & jenna's intestines, this fairly gory scene is probably the best part of the whole wretched film but it only lasts for a couple of minutes & in no way makes up for the other turgid 85.<br /><br />the budget on vampires vs. zombies must have been small, in fact did it even have a budget because most of it is set on a road in a couple of cars. this is one of the most badly made horror films it's been my misfortune to watch, the entire thing just sucks. the acting is predictably awful, & i mean awful.<br /><br />there isn't much else left to say, vampires vs. zombies is easily one of the worst films ever made. the (v) next to the title on the imdb's main page for vampires vs. zoimbies indicates that it went straight to video, well that's far too good for this pile of crap as it deserves to go straight on the nearest fire.
