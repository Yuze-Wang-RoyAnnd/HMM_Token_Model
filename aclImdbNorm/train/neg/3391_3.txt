i wonder who, how and more importantly why the decision to call richard attenborough to direct the most singular sensation to hit broadway in many many years? he's an academy award winning director. yes, he won for ghandi you moron! jeremy irons is an academy winning actor do you want to see him play rocky balboa? he has experience with musicals. really? "oh what a lovely war" have you forgotten? to answer your question, yes! the film is a disappointment, clear and simple. not an ounce of the live energy survived the heavy handedness of the proceedings. every character danced beautifully they were charming but their projection was theatrical. i felt nothing. but when i saw it on stage i felt everything. the film should have been cast with stars, unknown, newcomers but stars with compelling unforgettable faces even the most invisible of the group. great actors who could dance beautifully. well michael douglas was in it. true i forgot i'm absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right. nothing like a richard attenborough michael douglas musical.
