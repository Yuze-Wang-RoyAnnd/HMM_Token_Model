the movie has one nude scene: a man sitting on the edge of the bed, with his exposed genitals smack dab in the middle of the screen. it is quite a long scene. what was the point? i almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it wasn't funny to have that staring at us for what seemed like a full minute.<br /><br />the movie is cold. none of the characters are even likeable. audrey tatou is cute, of course, but her character is an unhappy girl.<br /><br />i really would not recommend this movie. i had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing. i wondered if the director was from a very upper crust, educated french family and he looks down on these characters.<br /><br />
