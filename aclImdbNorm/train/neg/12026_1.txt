i really wish that when making a comedy, the people actually tried to make it funny. this is a film that you can sit through, but nothing is special about it. after watching it, you will say that it was alright. it was not boring to watch, but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at. entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k. story. this movie wanted to be "tootsie", but instead it failed.<br /><br />i gave it a 1 out of 10.
