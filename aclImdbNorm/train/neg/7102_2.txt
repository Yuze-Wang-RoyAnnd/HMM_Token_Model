ok, i admit i watched this movie on mystery science theater 3000 (which i am a huge fan of), but i am not one of those people who automatically gives an mst3k movie a 1/10 rating. although i hate many of the movies they play, and some are among of the worst movies i've ever seen, i have actually been able to enjoy some mst3k movies. that being said, this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. (it is no wonder, in fact, that the mst3k writers themselves commented that this one was one of the worst. don't believe me? check out their site.)<br /><br />to me, this movie is a good example of what not to do in filmmaking. the dialogue is very bad, the acting is worse, the cinematography is pathetic the direction (while perhaps being the best thing in this movie) is bad.<br /><br />the pacing is the worst part in this movie. a few times in this movie, the viewer had to wait literally minutes for something to happen. while minutes may not sound like a very long amount of time, it can be in a movie, particularly in this one. i'm sure it was meant to create a mood, but i was just very bored. it truly felt like ten minutes.<br /><br />if "suspension of disbelief" means "almost falling asleep during a movie", then this has plenty of that. but the screaming skull is just so horrible, there is no way i could have possibly even gotten interested in anything that was actually going on in the film, and thus the "suspension of disbelief" was indeed non-existant.<br /><br />one of the worst, and probably the most boring movie i've ever seen.<br /><br />1/10
