i watched the movie "the flock" because of the casting of gere and danes and because the story synopsis sounded interesting. this was one of the worst movies i've seen in a long while (and i've seen some turkeys.) i've never posted online before but this movie was so awful i had to do so. i suppose the problems begin begin with the script which was so amateurish it's unbelievable. the story makes zero sense and the dialogue is so trite it's nauseating. poor gere, he deserves so much better. as for the gere/danes on screen matchup, because of the horrible writing, one doesn't believe either character for a single minute. i'll bet gere wishes he could buy back the negative, were such a thing possible. it's a shame to see talent wasted so badly, not to mention i wish i could get my 2 hours back. (i know what you're thinking. how do i really feel?)
