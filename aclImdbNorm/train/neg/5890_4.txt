this romantic comedy isn't too bad. there are some funny things happening here and there, and there are some rather memorable characters in it.<br /><br />the acting, however, is amateurish (with the exception of the banker). while some scenes are great fun, others are simply embarrassing. in particular, i found the "romantic" part of the story poor. <br /><br />all in all, i guess it's worth seeing if you like football and romantic comedies. it's not really a bad movie, and the ending did feel quite good. just don't expect anything out of the ordinary. fair enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
