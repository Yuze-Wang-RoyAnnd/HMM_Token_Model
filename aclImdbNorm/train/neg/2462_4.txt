well, i do like the gore in this movie - it is genuingly unsetteling. anyone that's been to the dentist will know why. the story really isn't that bad, corbin bersen's character's motivations do make a lot more sense than in most horror movies.<br /><br />i've seen worse acting, directing, script, etc. but at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie. so it comes down to if you enjoy that type of thing or not. i tried to watch the sequel, but it was exactly, exactly the same thing as this movie. just keep in mind if you enjoy people getting tortured at the dentist, then this is the movie for you!
