i just rented (yes! i paid money to see!) this film. omg. it is one of the very worst films i have ever seen. as another reviewer put it, ms. colagrande, get out of films, please! please never make or appear in another film! the lady has the charisma of a cantaloupe. no, that's not fair to the cantaloupe, which probably has more going for it. she does not know how to act; she affects a disgusted look all the time (reminded me very much of my always-disgusted young sisters-in-law from europe). she is not charming; she is not pretty. there is no real story. and the editing! there wasn't any, that i could see! it's pretty bad when you are watching a film and, just to get through it, you press "forward forward" on your remote, and still nothing happens! i mean!..... i kept involuntarily screaming, "cut! cut!" what were they thinking? well, obviously, they thought they would make a film together and get paid to make love on screen! pretty good deal for them; pretty raw deal for the viewer! i think i'm going to throw up now....
