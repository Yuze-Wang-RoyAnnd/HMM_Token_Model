the crater lake monster is easily one of the most awful, amateurish film i've ever seen - ranking right up there with manos, the hands of fate in terms of poor acting, useless direction, and kindergarten-level production values. in this movie a silly-looking claymation/stop-motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in bumblebum, ca, and begins dining on the local hayseeds. in the thrilling climax, the creature, described by one local as "a giant alligator with flippers", drags it's ponderous bulk over the ground to chase its would-be lunch, before a bulldozer bumps it a couple of times & it dies from boredom. every character in this moovie is a complete moron. one pointless subplot shows a hick go into a liquor store to purchase a $4.75 pint of ripple; instead of simply buying the bottle, the idiot shoots the cashier and another bystander, shoots at a cop, gets chased towards the lake, all so that he can eaten by the monster. unfortunate close-ups of the monster reveal it to be nothing more than a piece of styrofoam. there's a fake magician struggling with a phony british accent (to make him seem more legit), two overly-bumbling redneck boat renters, some cheesy "pre-historic cave art" done in crayon, and annoying banjo-pickin' background moosic. in one painful scene, the fake magician and his dopey wife/girlfriend/accomplice manage to pad the movie an extra 4 minutes by cowmenting on how may stars they can see in the night sky, even though it is clearly day time still. even on constant fast-forward, this moovie hurts, and hurts bad. moocow says call the fumigators, 'cause this cow pie really stinks! :=8p
