i never thought i see a movie worse than "lisa picard is famous", but this came pretty close. as repeated often throughout the comments, it was predictable; five minutes into the movie you know it will be a stranded at the alter outcome. this movie painfully references/rips off everything from "something about mary" to "revenge of the pink panther". writer greg glienna (meet the parents) needs some new material.<br /><br />the only twist is the deranged boyfriend/police officer pursued by internal affairs, but even that opportunity is wasted. lots of setting shots of the seattle space needle necessary to disguise the obvious canadian shooting locale. some of the worst driving in the car scenes with almost no effort to disguise the fact that the car is being pulled through town on a trailer. geez, at least turn the wheel or put the brakes on once in a while. selma blair is inert and the short haircut a crime. $3m to jason lee, for what? guess it beats skateboarding!<br /><br />so here's who should see this movie: bee gees fans who want to hear two actors sing 'islands in the stream' badly; people who can't get enough of julia stiles. 1/10
