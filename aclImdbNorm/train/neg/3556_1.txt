you know you're in trouble when john cassavetes is operating at half-speed instead of full-throttle in a movie, and "the incubus" is a dreadful, worst-case scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills. actually, observing the hammy script and john hough's 'baroque' art direction, one can hardly blame him. the movie has something to do with a series of rape-murders going on in a small town, with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in. somehow, the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene, and cassavetes seems visibly p.o.'ed at times. the incubus itself, which doesn't show up until the last scene, is a well-done creation, but it's not worth waiting for.<br /><br />1/10
