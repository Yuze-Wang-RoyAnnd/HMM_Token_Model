this is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clips/commercials trying to do their first full feature length movie. on one hand the imagery, camera, lighting, cgi and even the sound are highly polished and have a truly "expensive" look and feel. even the actors show a certain amount of potential - unto the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad plot.<br /><br />in this case it is not a bad plot but hardly a plot at all.<br /><br />so 50% of the dialog consists of "what the hell was that ?", "what was that ?" and "what the hell was that ?". in none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though. in most of the other dialogues one gets the feeling that there never was any form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that wasn't ever explained to them.<br /><br />the only reason why skye bennet's performance could be so good is that her character as an autistic girl didn't allow giving her these tragically horrible dialogue lines the other actors had to deal with. that way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast couldn't even get close to. i mean there's not one actor in the world that could make up for a dialogue like this:<br /><br />ben: is this real, huh ? emily: stop it. ben: a mass psychosis, huh ? jon: somebody has to take control of this situation. ben: this situation can't be controlled. not by you, not by anybody. emily: not by you either. ben: no<br /><br />got me goosebumps. but not for horror, more for the horrible attempt. in some moments i felt ashamed for the actors to have added this to their vita.<br /><br />2 stars for the excellent technical work.
