this is crap....utter crap. i cannot believe any company could even get people to work on a film like this. full moon has a number of awful films, but this has got to be the worst. first off, the plot doesn't exist. it's odd. it's like, they took an idea for the story, and kind of never really got around to developing it. they seemed to have just wasted a lot of time filming outside shots while the two "heroes" drove around in the desert, and bradbury talks nonsense for about 10 minutes. there were two scenes in the movie (when dez and dazzy are driving, and when dez and bradbury are driving) where it just went on and on and on...it was almost like 2 music videos in the place where there should have been some dialog or action. they just drove for about 5 minutes, with nothing but music and shots of the surrounding landscape.<br /><br />next, we come to the acting, which is simply horrible. first off, the girl who plays dazzy is just a beast. she is so scary looking, i wanted to look away when she was on screen! horrible casting. then, you have the guy who played dez, who couldn't act if his life depended on it. his "crying" is actually funny, and his madman antics are even funnier. the guy who plays the desk clerk at the hotel is just as bad, as is the guy who plays bradbury. there was no acting that deserves any recognition in this movie whatsoever.<br /><br />the makeup effects...hmmm, can anyone say pathetic? the "effects" were so fake, they were laughable. the crazy little robot looking catepillar thing grabs onto someone, they cut away, and when they come back, the guy has a completely fake looking flesh wound. nice. did they run out of money on the makeup budget or what?! i must say the druggie chick who is in the one girl's apartment...nice makeup there too. i think they were going for a drugged look, and i think she was supposed to have a black guy, but it looked more like cheap zombie makeup for halloween.<br /><br />this movie is just horrible from the start. the story is stupid and very, very unoriginal, the direction looks as tho it was performed by a 10 year old, the acting is the lowest of the low, and so on. stay away from this movie at all costs. it's only 70 minutes long in the first place, and atleast 20 minutes of that is taken up by either music and no dialog or the character sitting around in the hotel. do not waste your time on this piece of garbage.
