i tried as hard as i could to sit all the way through this irritating mess, but i just couldn't do it. brad dourif absolutely sucked as the lead and all the supporting cast were only marginally worse. <br /><br />the whole thing is just ludicrous, from the awful acting to the laughable fx to the stupid plot.<br /><br />complete waste of time; don't bother. root canal therapy would be more enjoyable. bamboo slivers under the fingernails would be a lot more pleasant. <br /><br />watching a uwe boll movie would be only a little worse than this. get the idea?
