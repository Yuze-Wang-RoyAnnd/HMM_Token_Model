if you are one of the people who finds "according to jim" great television comedy, this is going to rock your world. and might i add, kudos for proving that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than abc, which prefers to air crap like jim belushi's show year after year.<br /><br />"k-911" is a big, steaming, brown, german shepherd-sized "thank you" for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie. it's exactly what fans of that film and the lesser belushi deserve. jim's comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standard. look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo chimpanzee.<br /><br />if you enjoy jim's work, this movie is your reward.
