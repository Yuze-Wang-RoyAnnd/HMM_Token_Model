the first 30min of the flick was choppy and hard to know just what was going on (unless you read the book - which i had not).<br /><br />if you can stick with the first half, the second half is sweet - predictable, yes, but sweet none-the-less.<br /><br />the way it was shot one would think it was produced in the early 80's, not 2005.<br /><br />no stand-out moments, bland, but it moved along without boring me.<br /><br />i would like to know why keaton selected this role, her part would have been better cast with a player more at the level of the other actors to keep the balance.
