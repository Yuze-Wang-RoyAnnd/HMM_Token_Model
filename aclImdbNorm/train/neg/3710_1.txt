the king is dead long live the king! the triad of caddie shack two, the family underneath the stairs, and troop beverly hills had been tied for worst movie ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right. but there is a new king.....yep.....all hail the new king...."down to earth". but some things, like tiny tim for example, are so bad they are good. some day this could take out the inimitable "rocky horror picture show" as a cult film. so go see this ....this....well just take my word for it. go see it. all hail the new king!
