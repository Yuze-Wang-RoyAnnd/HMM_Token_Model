one scene demonstrates the mentality of "terminator woman" pretty well: karen sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain's camp. karen runs across an armed guard, who points his gun at her, but after a few seconds throws it away and challenges her to a fight. karen kicks him in the balls, picks up the gun and runs away! then again, when a film is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another member of his family, you know you shouldn't expect too much. karen sheperd and jerry trimble do get some amusing banter going early on, and the film might have turned out better if it had focused more on their love-hate relationship. but after about 20 minutes they get separated, and the film slows to a crawl, and even with the occasional fight scene to liven things up, it lacks excitement. the finale has trimble fighting qissi inside a cave and sheperd going womano-a-womano against the beautiful ashley hayden on a speedboat, but the fights are intercut in a way that breaks their flow and diminishes their value. on the positive side, kudos to the costuming department for giving karen the chance to show spectacular cleavage throughout the film!
