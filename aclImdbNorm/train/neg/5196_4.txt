though a bit more polished technically than the previous film in the series, bulldog drummond escapes, this is a weaker escapade in both a plot that's less thrilling and a leading man who simply doesn't have the charisma of ray milland.<br /><br />that said, several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying. also john barrymore is present, popping up all through the film in a variety of outlandish disguises.<br /><br />anyway it's another endless night for bd as he and his cohorts chase around trying to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry. the clues are stupid but again the supporting actors often make them entertaining.
