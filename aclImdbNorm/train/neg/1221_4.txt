i remember the days in which kim basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb blondie,romantic interest or damsel in danger.but,everything changed when she won an academy award as best supporting actress for her role in the excellent movie l.a. confidential,and i think i was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance.however,after that moment,her career did not follow the ideal path.sure,the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies (like people i know or the door in the floor),but we have never seen her again on a substantial character.the movie while she was out does nothing to put her on that situation; and it is not only that her character is not too tasty,but also that the movie is really crappy.the screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basic.however,basinger brings some conviction to her character,and that makes this poor movie to win a few points.this movie is full of clich'es and generic villains.the work of director susan montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly,because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone.the ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous.i do not recommend while she was out at all.this film commits the capital sin of being boring.
