peter sellers (one of my favorite actors) is mildly amusing in this 1970 turkey, but the script is so lame and insulting that even goldie hawn's youth (just after her oscar win) cannot begin to pull this one out of the mud. as a skirt-chasing celeb in his 40's, sellers mostly embarrasses himself to the nth degree.<br /><br />a 3 out of 10. best performance = ? nicky henson plays a young study type.<br /><br />i hope hawn and sellers were paid well, because i see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 (a very good year for films - catch-22, m.a.s.h., husbands, joe, wusa, five easy pieces and many others). you can't win them all!
