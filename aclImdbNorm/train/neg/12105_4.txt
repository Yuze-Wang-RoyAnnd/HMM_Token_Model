this was a disappointing film. the people seem to have no substance, the lead protagonist martin cahil has zero redemptive values, in fact everyone in it including jon voight epitomizes sleeze. i would not recommend this film to anyone. the violence is distasteful, though artfully done. the filming is to black, at least the print i saw fit this category. a disappointment.
