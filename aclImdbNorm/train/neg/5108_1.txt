i can't help but laugh at the people who praise this show as heartwarming and tear-jerking. for one, it's entirely unrealistic that these people will have perfect lives after their new homes.<br /><br />how can these families afford to maintain these new mega-houses? and what about their poor neighbors? property taxes must surely increase after this happens. plus, the noise would annoy me.<br /><br />second, how excessive can a reality television show become? it's practically the same repetitive junk week after week. we're introduced to a suffering family, they renovate the home, then surprise the family and everyone breaks out the kleenex boxes.<br /><br />not to mention how boring the renovation part is. the only interesting part of the show is to see what the house looks like, but even that segment is destroyed by the phony confessionals and constant sobbing.<br /><br />"extreme makeover: home edition" is a show pretending to be heartfelt but it falls flat. skip this one. if you like reality television, "survivor" is far superior and moving.
