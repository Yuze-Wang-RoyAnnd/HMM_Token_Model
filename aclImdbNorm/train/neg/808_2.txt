extremely disappointing film based on the james michener novel.<br /><br />what was even worse was marlon brando's performance. his southern drawl was ridiculous. i found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to roost. brando, so great in previous films, was reduced here to a laughing stock. tyrone power, in "witness for the prosecution," should have been nominated for best actor instead of brando here.<br /><br />the film, dealing with racism, dealt with the u.s. government's attempt to avoid marriages between u.s. soldiers and japanese women.<br /><br />brando was stone-faced throughout the movie. his moving from anti-these relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an asian woman. his emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could espouse such new views.<br /><br />only the lord knows why red buttons and miyoshi umeki received supporting oscars for their performances. nothing about either performance was equally impressive. umeki's appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part. a better performance in this film was done by miiko taka, who did nicely as brando's love interest. she showed great emotion as the anti-american who found love with the brando character. her face was etched with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother in world war 11. she realized that her dancing was not her way out of this existence that she was living.<br /><br />martha scott went from the hebrew mother yochobel in "the ten commandments" to the bigoted mother of brando's love interest at first. her performance together with the one of ricardo montalban was wasted. patricia owens, as brando's first love, showed depth and conviction in her performance.
