student seduction finds saved by the bell alumni elizabeth berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of young and hunky corey sevier. speaking for myself i can truthfully say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me hormonally back when i was a student. that was a ms. diaz who was a music teacher in junior high school. even as a young gay kid, i could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. she was the only teacher i had who in any way could have been played by elizabeth berkley.<br /><br />corey being the hotty he is, is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not. the fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief. he's flunking chemistry which is what berkley teaches and to keep his gpa up she agrees to tutor, but believe no more. <br /><br />so when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it's damaging to his ego. when berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police, the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of pamela smart and mary kay letourneau just don't believe here. sevier's parents have the wherewithal to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy.<br /><br />student seduction which is a misnomer of a title if there ever was one is trash all the way. after the beating that berkley took for showgirls this tv film was not an upward career move.
