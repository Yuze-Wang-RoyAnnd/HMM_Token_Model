oh, it's the movie - i thought i waited too long to take out the dog... i can't believe i watched the whole thing. i guess i was optimistically anticipating that it was going to get better. horribly disjointed dialog, pathetic acting, and totally improbable events. like toby's mom hanging herself in the time it takes col to walk upstairs and back down in a room with a 24' ceiling and no chairs, counters or anything around her motionlessly suspended body that she could have possibly used to climb on to do herself in. the little girl that played the daughter of the last family was the best actor in the whole movie, and the puppy of the first couple was a close second. the basic storyline has potential and with a good script and director could be a seriously creepy flick, but this version sadly is not it. i get more scared when i open my electric bill every month.
