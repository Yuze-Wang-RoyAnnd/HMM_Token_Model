if it smells like garbage and if it looks like garbage, it must be garbage. this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life. tony scott's poor directing style puts shame to an already uninteresting and slightly untrue story of domino harvey's life as a bounty hunter. the story is completely discontinuous and confusing to watch. certain aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally unbelievable. it seems that all of the action scenes were loosely strung together by poor plot points and horrible acting. keira knightley does get totally naked in this one though. that is the one and only upside to this film. if you want to see her naked just fast forward the movie until about an hour and a half into it and you'll catch a whole lot of nipple. i strongly suggest that no one see this movie ever!</3
