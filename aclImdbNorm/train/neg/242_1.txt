from a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer, bad acting (even peter falk can't find his way) "finding john christmas" is better left lost. ms. bertinelli's performance is without depth or emotion as are her co-stars, william russ as brother hank and david cubitt as love interest noah. jennifer pisana as soccoro, the daughter of single dad noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing. but who can blame them with material like this. michael j. murray's script is juvenile at best. <br /><br />each year at this time i search the tv guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen. films like "miracle on 34th street", ernst lubitsch's delightful "the shop around the corner" and, of course the 1951 version of "scrooge". there's frank capra's classics "it's a wonderful life" and "meet john doe". hey, forget the classics. what about "home alone" or " home for the holidays" with holly hunter and a great performance by robert downey jr.? <br /><br />my present to you is by way of advice. your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding "finding john christmas". merry christmas!
