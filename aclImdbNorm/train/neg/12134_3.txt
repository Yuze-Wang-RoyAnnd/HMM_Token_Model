on the face of it, this should be a great film, a great cast, a plot with many possibilities and one of hollywood's finest behind the camera for the first time.<br /><br />however, its clear why it was another 8 years before spacey decided to try directing a movie again. this movie fails on so many levels. in a film where there is not much action and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of locations, it is imperative that suspense and continuity are provided by the director. not so here, the great cast is horribly under-used, none more so than the great, late john spencer, the plot is so run of the mill and nothing you haven't seen in a hundred other tv movies. there is so little character development you end up not caring for any of the protagonists. at least we know spacey has a lot of mates and clout in hollywood studios to get away with a poor flick like this
