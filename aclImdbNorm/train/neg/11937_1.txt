superhero movies pretty much always suck, and this is no exception. its only redeeming quality is the fact the movie could have been even worse. i would put 'batman & robin' and 'steel' above this movie, so yes it is that bad...<br /><br />if your looking for a black superhero, check out 'blankman' its not a "serious" superhero movie but at least its entertaining.
