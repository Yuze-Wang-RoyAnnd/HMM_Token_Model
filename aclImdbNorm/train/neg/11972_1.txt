the first ten minutes of "just looking" really dictates the direction most of this movie takes. lenny (ryan merriman) is a 14 year old boy living in new york in the '50s. he has a burning desire to see two people have sex. who are the best people he has in mind? well, his own mom and stepfather of course! how pleasant. unfortunately for lenny, he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle's wife.<br /><br />lenny's next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex. however, the wife is quite pregnant and they aren't currently sleeping together. then lenny makes a new friend. him and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls. they have a little club where all they do is sit around and talk about sex. the problem is...it's not done in an innocent, charming 1950's sort of way. i am no prude by any means, but i found it rather disturbing listening to these kids talk about masturbation, blowjobs and anal sex. that kind of rawness may work in a movie like "kids" (1995) but in this film it just seems perverted.<br /><br />gretchen mol is utterly wasted here as hedy, a former bra model who becomes the object of lenny's carnal desires. jason alexander needs to stay as far away from the director's chair as possible. "for better or worse" (1996) was awful and now this. what a waste. 1/10
