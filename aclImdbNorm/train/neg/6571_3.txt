while i totally disagree with one reviewer who described charley chase as unfunny, in this film he certainly is. it's a shame, as i suspect the other reviewer must have only seen a few charley chase duds and assumed the guy wasn't funny. films like mighty like a moose and what price goofy? are very good chase films, so he could be really funny given good material. unfortunately, in this film he's given absolutely nothing. even the inclusion of the usually good oliver hardy as a foil isn't any help because the basic premise (boy wants to marry girl but girl's father thinks the boy is a wuss) and the gags are so poor. it's a shame, as i really wanted to love this film but couldn't.<br /><br />by the way, for those used to the look for charley from the mid-1920s on, you'll be pretty surprised as chase sports no glasses or mustache--and looks very little like you'd expect.
