can it ever be said that there are some movies that have no redeeming features whatsoever? answer: yes, and this is one of them. after helming the appalling 'house of the dead' director uwe boll has now cast his less-than-talented eye towards yet another video game adaptation. don't these guys get it? to anyone who can't understand, here it is in block capitals for you: video games do not make for good movies! the acting here is, at best, sub-standard. the set design and special effects are poor. unlike the video game (which did have its scary moments) the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom, no sense of danger or menace. pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is printed on would have been better used as toilet paper. the main culprit is the director. uwe boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush. hackneyed zooms, swoops and pans are spliced into the whole dreary affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience disorientated and bored. why this guy was ever let near a movie set in the first place must stand as one of modern cinemas greatest secrets. avoid at all costs.
