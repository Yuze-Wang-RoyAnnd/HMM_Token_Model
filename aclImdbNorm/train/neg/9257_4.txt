if you are hoping for anything new, you have chosen the wrong movie. who can think that a movie that is a virtual replay of it's predeccesors can be good. maybe the producer and maybe the director but hopefully they were not serious when they made this thing. this whole movie is like making a greatest hits dvd of the 1st 3 films, but changing the actors. bhhaaaad.
