bad plot (though good for a b-movie), good fast-paced fight scenes, at most a 5 out of 10. but something has always bothered me about this film: how come mariska hargitay never speaks? in the tv version, she shares several intimate moments with jeff speakman, even a kiss in a garden. yet in the regular (video) version, most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all. this bothers me because it not only takes out a female (though cliched) point-of-view to the film, it also makes the final shot seem creepy. this film would have been better had they kept her scenes in, because in those scenes at least she has a personality, one that undercuts whatever speakman says.
