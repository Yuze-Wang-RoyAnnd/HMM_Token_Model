as soon as i began to see posters and hear talk about this movie, i was immediately excited. the matrix was an incredible to behold and i couldn't wait to see the second one, especially after beginning to see the trailers for it at other movies. however, when i saw it, i left the theater extremely disappointed, as did many other movie-goers at the theater with me. while the action scenes in the movie were amazing as always, there simply were too few of them. in the first movie, there was constant fighting going on it seemed, but the second took a much more (and much unfortunate) preachy point of view. to sum up the plot, there wasn't much to it that wasn't expected. the machines were digging toward zion with intent of destroying it (that's not a spoiler, everyone saw it in the commercials). the dialogue of the movie was absolutely horrendous. unless you're a psychology major, you most likely will not understand most of what is said in the movie, and because of that simply won't care. it became somewhat of a romantic movie with the showing of events happening in the lives and relationship of neo and trinity. agent smith, for as bad-ass as he was in the first movie, seemed to get all religious and preachy. personally, i don't need to hear about that or pay money to listen to it. the movie was a serious waste of my time, and i don't think i can watch the first one anymore. the dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologues from basically every character made me lose interest in the film quickly, and the small amount of good fighting scenes pushed me nearer the edge, and the ending of the movie shoved me right off. what movie ends with "to be concluded"? how original is that folks. i wonder if the wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to come up with that one. in conclusion, the movie was bad and that's the end of it.
