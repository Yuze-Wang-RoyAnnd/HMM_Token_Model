i was not impressed about this film especially for the fact that i went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a film which was certificate rated 12a here in the uk. to my dismay, this film was full of embarrassing sexual jokes. (which is not a problem to me as an adult, but not good for watching with children). this film at times was very crude at times with fart jokes, getting hit in the groin etc... and for the most part of the film not very funny.<br /><br />the premise of the film is that calvin sims who is a 2inch midget, gets out of jail and steals a giant sized diamond but is then forced to put it in a womens handbag. so the rest of the movie sees him passing himself off as an abandoned baby, getting into this womens house so he can get this diamond back.<br /><br />up until now, i have enjoyed most of the output from the wayans brothers - but this film is certainly taking the biscuit.<br /><br />a bit of good advice - wait till it comes on tv or cable
