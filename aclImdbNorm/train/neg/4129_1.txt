after watching about half of this i was ready to give up and turn it off, but i endured to the end. this is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. the acting is poor---much worse than the acting in 80s t&a movies.<br /><br />there are several attempts at humour that fail miserably and the movie is 100% predictable. perhaps if you are a teenager this movie will hold some appeal, but for those that have seen many movies, you will know how the film turns out after the first 10 minutes. the rest of your time will be spent in agony waiting for the ending credits to roll.<br /><br />don't waste your time watching this.
