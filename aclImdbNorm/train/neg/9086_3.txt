i was aware of rohmer's admiration for the late works of the ones he considered like great cineasts, and that normal spectators generally considered as artistic failures (as renoir's or chaplin's very last movies ; yes, the "politique des auteurs" also has its dark side). but with "les amours d'astr'ee et de c'eladon", it's as if rohmer himself wanted, for what may be his last movie, to perpetuate this tradition of great directors, who made a last senile movie, by adapting urf'e's "l'astr'ee", with ridiculous aesthetic codes, witch just look like a parody of rosselini's last movies (the ones he made for tv from descartes or marx's lives).<br /><br />in his version of "perceval", rohmer refused to film real landscapes in order to give a re-transcription of what may have been a middle age classical representation of things. the director apparently changed his mind when the xvii century is involved, and films actors, dressed like 1600's peasants reciting their antic text surrounded by contemporary trees and landscapes. but the all thing looks even more ridiculous than luchini and its fake trees. it's not that the story itself is stupid, but the way rohmer mixes naturalism with artifices seems so childish and amateurism that it rapidly becomes involuntarily funny (and i'm not even talking about the irritating pronunciation of the actors, the annoying and sad humorist tries by rodolphe pauly, the ridiculous soft-erotic tone, the poor musical tentatives, or the strange fascination for trasvestisment!).<br /><br />the radical aesthetic of the film ultimately makes it looks like a joke, which mixes a soft-erotic movie made for tv with theological scholastic discussions (sic !). at the beginning of the movie, rohmer teaches us that the original french region of the story is now disfigured by modernity, and that's why he had to film "l'astr'ee" in other parts of the country. however, i'm sure the movie would have look more modern and interesting, if rohmer would have actually still filmed the same story in a modern area with same narrative codes and artistically decisions. this film may interest a few historians, but most of the cinephiles may laugh at this last and sad rohmer's movie.
