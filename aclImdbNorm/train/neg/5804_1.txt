what's in here ?! let me tell you. it's the presence of (alec baldwin). he's not a great actor but maybe a nice star with some good movies which this is not one of them. he did nothing here more than anything he did before or after. so not to mention (literally !) the matter of (steve mcqueen) being at the same role in the original because i don't want to make that comparison in the first place. i'm not a big fan or even a fan of (kim basinger), she got a lot of bad movies on her and even at her best she looks average ! and it gets on my nerve indeed whenever they talk about her seductive rare beauty !!?? well, if being a blond would make anyone captivating then i'll dye my hair in yellow as soon as possible ! and what is it with all the craziness over miss basinger's legs ??!! it's surely insanity or bad tasting ? as i don't see them both as not sexy only, but ugly too ! and if you hate that so shoot me down but you know what ?! i've just watched this movie so i'm dead already !. yet, what would make you really suffer in unbearable way is that nothing of the credits goes to the one she deserves the most
