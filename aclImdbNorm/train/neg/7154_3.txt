this film has all the earmarks of too many cooks spoiling the stew. based on shielah graham's autobiography, it seems like the powers that be couldn't leave well enough alone. they couldn't decide if this was to be graham's story or fitzgerald's story, and also how much they should soft-pedal whoever's story it turned out to be. so a film that could have been a story about two fascinating (fitzgerald) and notorious (ms. graham)personalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either. added to this there is absolutely no period feel other than for 1959. clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing. however - and this saved the film for me - kerr has never looked lovelier, and peck is as always a very handsome man. they truly make a beautiful, mature couple, and i only wish they had better material to work with. there is one scene that does work - scott goes after shielah while in a drunken state, and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs. other than that, the movie is a wasted opportunity and achieves nowhere near the classic stature of other wald produced soaps of the 1950 (peyton place, the best of everything).
