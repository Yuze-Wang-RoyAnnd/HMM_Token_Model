it's difficult to precisely put into words the sheer awfulness of this film. an entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as 'humor' or even 'entertainment' in "rabbit test." so, as a small contribution to this future effort, i'd like to suggest this word: <br /><br />"hubiriffic" (adj.) a combination of 'hubristic' and 'terrific'; used to describe overly ambitious debacles like the film "rabbit test."<br /><br />joan rivers and "hollywood squares" producer jay redack have severely over-reached their meager abilities to amuse in this 82-minute festival of wretchedness. trying to put together an airplane! style comedy with a moldy collection of gags, (note to joan: german doctors haven't been funny since vaudeville) disinterred from their graves in the catskills - that's is bad enough. but compounding this cinematic crime is river's directorial style, which can best be described as 'ugly', and a cast of once-and-future has-beens so eager to please they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gags.<br /><br />adrift in this sargasso sea of sap is a hapless billy crystal in his film debut role as the film's hapless protagonist lionel. watching crystal in this pic is much like watching a blind person take a stroll in a minefield; eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his face.<br /><br />i can only speculate about the sort of audience who might actually like rabbit test. cabbages, mollusks and mildly retarded lizards are all likely candidates. but for self-aware, thinking humans - i'd enthusiastically recommend pouring bleach in your eyes before i'd recommend "rabbit test."
