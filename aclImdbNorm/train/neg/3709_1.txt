first off, i would like to say that i am a fan of chris rock. i like his other movies, but this movie is just like my summary. the biggest sack of crap ever. in the beginning, chris rock plays an aspiring comedian who get stage fright at a comedy building called the apollo. on his way home from a gig, while riding his bike he sees this woman he likes and is hit by a truck. a little while later, he chooses the body of an old, white, and selfish millionaire. then, he dresses up like the music group outkast while trying to replay the scene from the original where he comes out as a jockey. second, he goes back to the apollo, and tries to be the comedian he tried to be in his previous body and starts dissing the white population and tries to be black. do you get my drift? this movie is awful it tries too hard to be like the original and in the process comes out looking like a sack of crap. just take my advice, don't even watch this movie.
