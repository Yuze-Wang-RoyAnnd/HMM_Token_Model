i think this movie was supposed to be shocking. but the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it's been made ...and simply is. it's one-and-a-half hour of torment. even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls).<br /><br />sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way, which is basically fine, since it's a horror-movie. and i (usually) like horror-movies. i've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se. however all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever. it's no spectacle other than that it's simply grotesque. it's so lame it even gets boring, and really quick too.<br /><br />the worst thing (if the above wasn't bad enough for ya) about this movie is that they've tried to copy the blair whitch project, by filming with cheap hand-held-cameras. but (again, this too) serves no end whatsoever. in the "blair which", sure enough, there's an explanation, namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch. in this film, there's no other explanation than: "hey ya'll we wanted this to look like the blair whitch!!" the sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about. the girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can't make out what they're saying. also, no effort has been made to make anything any better, sound-wise or other wise.<br /><br />than finally, there's the soundtrack, which is just as bad as the rest, and varies from cheap euro-house to the worst grungy hard-rock...<br /><br />my advise: don't watch this under any circumstances.
