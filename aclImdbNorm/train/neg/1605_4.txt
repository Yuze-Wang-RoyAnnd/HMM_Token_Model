recently, i saw the documentary "the revolution will not be televised", also know as "ch'avez: inside the coup". at first i thought it showed a genuine inside view of events during the venezuela coup of april 2002. what bothered me though was the fact that the tone of the narration and the accompanying music were suggestive, and that at no point any criticism was expressed about hugo ch'avez. this is peculiar because if a documentary is giving an non-biased account of what happened, there should have been some of that too. after all, ch'avez certainly is not a saint. fortunately, since the documentary is several years old, a lot of additional information is available on the internet nowadays, and it was not difficult to find for instance "urgent investigation about chavez-the coup by the 5 european tv corporations who financed the film which presents blatant falsehoods about venezuela." it lists the many errors and intended or unintended falsifications in the documentary. (just use the title as a search string in google, you will find it). another interesting document was the video registration of a presentation of the findings of the many errors in this documentary, "x-ray of a lie". to me it seems to be a good counterweight to "ch'avez: inside the coup" it's available at video.google. i strongly advice you after watching "ch'avez: inside the coup" to look at "x-ray of a lie" and then form your opinion. my conclusion is that kim bartley and donnacha o'brian were (knowingly or not) part in ch'avez-propaganda.
