movies have put me to sleep before, but no movie has ever done that twice, so it took me three sittings actually to finish it. the dialog was bad. women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures. and two of the supposedly japanese women looked chinese, had chinese names and spoke with clearly chinese accents. i'm still trying to figure out why the emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 equals a tough choice: do i give this movie a rating of one? or two?<br /><br />movies have put me to sleep before, but no movie has ever done that twice, so it took me three sittings actually to finish it. the dialog was bad. women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures. and two of the supposedly japanese women looked chinese, had chinese names and spoke with clearly chinese accents. i'm still trying to figure out why the emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 equals a tough choice: do i give this movie a rating of one? or two?
