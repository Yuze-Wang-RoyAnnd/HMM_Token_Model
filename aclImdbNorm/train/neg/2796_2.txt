for the most part, on demand delivers some pretty horrible horror movies, and only offers other horror movies everyone has already seen, and already have an opinion on. it was either this, or invinicible (i like mark wahlberg movies), which i haven't seen, and i was actually in a movie watching mood, which doesn't happen often anymore because i've already watched all the movies i own a million times, and that's a lot of movies, and i don't have much interest in new movies, and boy, this movie made me regret it. i'm not going to put in any spoilers, i'm just going to tell you that only a few of the very few actors in this movie ,are half way decent. i think the main girl, the dead one who kills everyone, is very annoying looking, but convincing; i'd take her for psycho bitch anyday, so she fits her roll well, though it is lame. the blood isn't that great, only a few of the kills, or may i say "woundings" are alright, but you don't see much and there are no body part props in the movie to make the injuries look more convincing. towards the end of the movie i was begging my girlfriend to turn it off, and being a band member, the 'recording' parts weren't very interesting either, though what happened would truly happen when going about recording. i'm done, if you want to watch this, suit yourself.
