the second half of steven soderbergh's revolutionary bio on che guevara deals with his last campaign to export revolution to bolivia. in order to maintain his saintly visage of che soderbergh conveniently leap frogs the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in cuba and the folly of his congo adventure ("this is the history of a failure" he writes in the preface of his congo journal) to concentrate fully on che's attempt to rally support to rise up against the government in bolivia. it would turn out to be a disaster and guevara's final act.<br /><br />what plagued the first chapter follows suit here as soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the beatific countenance of the contemplative guevara once again being played like james dean in east of eden by bernicio del toro. the problem is guevara has little success in gaining converts and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades being swallowed up in the heart of darkness bolivian jungle. unlike werner herzog in the magnificent, aguirre, the wrath of god soderbergh fails to utilize the jungle's metaphorical possibilities to heighten the desperation of the guerrillas. he seems more concerned with keeping che's nimbus above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead enders. there is one herzogian moment where che sits astride an obstinate horse kicking and screaming to get it moving but overall soderbergh's mise en scene remains flat, sloppy and uninteresting. <br /><br />in both of his films soderbergh shows he is clearly a che groupie and because of it his focus remains myopic and narrow. he spends too much time building his monument to che and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his saga, especially fidel castro. making matters worse he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never catches fire. one would think he was steeped in enough eisenstein and vertov to realize that sweeping change is showcased a lot better with sweeping style.
