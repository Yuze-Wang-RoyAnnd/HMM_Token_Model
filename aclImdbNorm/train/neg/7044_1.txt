how sad to see the beautiful and talented tina louise reduced to making this horrible excuse for a film. tina still looked fit and attractive, but for some reason seems truly frightened. i can understand her fear; fearing that this 3rd rate stinker would somehow be released to the general public. also, i'm a fan of the likable adam west. again, as with tina, adam looks good and in great shape for a man his age. his acting here is passable, but the script is so bad, that it's difficult to even listen to the dialog.<br /><br />the movie is a rip-off of the classic brando biker flick, the wild ones; out-law biker gang is out-of-control in a small hick-town. the bikers here look like a motley group and i sure wouldn't want them to date my sister. the acting is stiff and wooden, and the story-plot is as old as sand. hellriders is hell to watch!
