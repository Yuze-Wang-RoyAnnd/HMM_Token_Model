yeah, stupidity! i just finish watching and i still have bad taste in my mouth. too much colors, too much unnecessary "addons" to a story, too much stupid characters (i presume they wanted to achieve comic relief, but i only wanted to cry)... too much of everything. shame to spoil one of divine stories from "arabian nights" like this. childish, naive (both on a bad way) and with lot of magic-breaking mistakes, i don't think this could keep a child of five for more then ten minutes. princess is lovely, but should be tongueless, cause actress don't know how to carry a role. rest of the cast is even worse...our "bad guy" is really bad. shame that the "good guy" is not better. only light in this dark is, of course, david carradine, who goes unfortunately deeply down under his level with this, but at least keep his actor/"fighter" skills at top. i'm still sorry to see him in a thing like this, but glad that i had something to watch in whole charade, so thank you david. only, only, for him, i give this 2 stars to this fiasco...i would give more for him, but that would rise final score to entire movie. the rest is so bad, that i would, maybe, like to grade it, but there is no grade lover then 1 here, and i think that would be too much.
