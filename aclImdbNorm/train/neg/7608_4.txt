i'll admit that i don't expect much from a roger corman film. generally, i expect a lot of walking and bad scripts. yet in this case, i am pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />the gunslinger is a story of a woman (played by the spunky beverly garland) who takes over as sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered. ms. garland is a pretty good shot herself, killing one of the murderers the next day at her husband's funeral. her first task is to shut down the local bar that is violating the town curfew. the bar's owner is trying to buy land in anticipation of being bought out by the (hoped-for) railroad. however, ms. garland is a thorn in her plans, and the bar matron hires a man to kill ms. garland.<br /><br />because of ms. garland's plays her role honestly and realistically, there is absolutely no temptation to go to suzanne somers "she's the sheriff" jokes. with the exception of a couple of faux pas (the apartment door that opens out from the inside, jeep tracks, and the two horsemen waiting on screen for their cue to ride around a corner), the movie becomes quite passable as movie fare. however, corman could not resist padding his film with horse riding scenes, much like he does walking in other films.<br /><br />sterno says the gunslinger is a horse opera worth your time.
