::potential spoilers::<br /><br />man, this movie was awful. a catholic/superstitious/suspense thriller it goes over already well tread ground from previous movies.<br /><br />the doubting priest. sex and the priesthood. politics and religion. church hypocrisy. conspiracy involving the church. the dawn of a new evil age. all kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evil.<br /><br />pretty stupid and lame with a weak storyline to suffice. the story revolves around two concepts: absolution, better known as the sacrament of anointing the sick - the last rights a person can ask for to cleanse one's sins while on the brink of death; and excommunication, the act of cutting a person off from the church. basically, an excommunicated person can't receive absolution. thus comes in the sin eater, and i'll leave it at that. throw in all the dopy things i already listed and you have "the order".<br /><br />i found the sex scene with the priest interlaced with shots of a picture of the virgin mary rather insulting to catholics. it also ends with heath ledger saying (i paraphrase) "i am the redeemer and damner of sins, i live on without love blah blah blah" /cue him walking in dark alley with long trench coat alla "the matrix".<br /><br />i gave this movie a 1 for not only being crappy and unoriginal but also because it managed to insult an entire faith in the process. if you want to see something better i suggest "the prophecy" with christopher walken.
