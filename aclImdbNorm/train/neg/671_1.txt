poor acting, no script, no plot, no convincing killer, no suspense, no original setups, it uses the same closet/under the bed/person-behind-you-in-the-mirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring, and not in a foreshadowing way either, and the fact that nobody ever "really" gets killed (at least not on screen) , which in turn zaps any suspense it may invoke right out of it and makes everyone feel eve more cheated for spending money on their admission ticket....its a horror film w/o any horror lmao. the most you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheet.<br /><br />you have to be a teen who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this, or you were high/drunk at the time.<br /><br />honestly, i have a life and don't bother writing reviews that often unless i really really hated something, or enjoyed it tremendously.<br /><br />but this film is awful and i feel i have a duty of sorts to warn you not to give your money to hollywood and encourage this kind of filmaking ever again! <br /><br />it is one thing to rent a "bad" movie at blockbuster from the weinsteins, its another when you have to sit through it in a theater.<br /><br />also, in case you want some remake nostalgia, forget it! this is not a remake, nor is it a re-imagining. it is not scary, nor engaging, nor is it satisfying enough to be "funny" like others on imdb have claimed...it is just stale and booooring.<br /><br />here is what you will take away from this film: remembering the scar on brittany snow's head that stands out more than the plot, the fact that jonathan schaech must be having some sexual affair with j.s. cardone of "the forsaken" to have gotten another role as a killer(because he is as frightening as my poodle, and too cute to kill just about anyone) and that for some reason (duh) everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back. what kind of person would not get worried at the prom when they decide to announce the candidates for prom king and queen and the fiercely competitive girl just somehow doesn't show up? this is my warning to you. do not waste you're money like i did. the "original" sucks too but is more of a guilty pleasure for jamie lee curtis fans, though no way near as bad as this piece of crap (sorry to sound vulgar or rude, but once you see this, you will understand why i say what i say).
