i'll start with what i liked.<br /><br />i really liked the songs, everything about them was great, the costumes, music, lyrics (as long as the translation was good :) ), choreography, everything.<br /><br />i loved the crab scene and the cooking scene.<br /><br />but that's about it.<br /><br />i get it, arty cinema, blablabla, but too much is too much. too much silence (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours of hearing steps and moaning from time to time, really...), too much boredom (no movie should ever be boring, no matter how deep it was to be!), too much porn-like scenes (i do get it really, i get that they were filming a porn movie there, but really, really, really that is too much) i truly think, that cinema should be for watching and this one is definitely not watchable in no way.<br /><br />3 stars for the songs.
