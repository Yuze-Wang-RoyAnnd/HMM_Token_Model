this movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy. it is an extreme tragedy. it left me sick to my stomach. i hated it. i think if they want to make a movie like this than they should be man enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. i would not have seen this movie if i would have known. i think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie. i am tired of it. i really wanted to have a fun comedy and i am extremely disappointed. it has been several days now and i still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie. i have never been more disappointed in a movie, nor have i ever written a comment on a bad movie. i really think that true deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intention of the movie, no one would have seen it.
