"the second coming of suzanne" is yet another one of those surrealistic films that tries to come across as extremely sophisticated, yet all it does is put the viewer to sleep. like other movies of this type, there is limited dialogue. everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetic of the shot. however, the cinematography stinks so there is nothing at all to keep your attention.<br /><br />the video box states that this film is "one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on film." yeah...sure. it's right up there with watching such stimulating events as a bucket of ice melting or a turtle walking for a mile. 1/10
