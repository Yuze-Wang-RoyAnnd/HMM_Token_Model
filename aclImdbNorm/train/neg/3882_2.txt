why do i constantly do this to myself? i mean, really, it's right there in the title - "the incredible melting man". what else would i expect? i have to admit, i'm a sucker for just about anything i come across on the monster hd channel, but the only redeeming feature of this picture would be that truly grotesque makeup job by the legendary rick baker. as for creepy, i'll give the nod to that horny old geezer couple sucking on lemons just before lights out. now they were truly scary.<br /><br />something i could never figure out in horror flicks was why a monster's victims wouldn't simply just run away when faced with virtual annihilation. like the chick in the cabin. you know, there was a door completely visible right there in the kitchen that she could have run right out of at any time. incredible steve-o couldn't muster much more than a brisk walk, so why not just blow right by him? i don't know, maybe i'm missing something. <br /><br />this flick had some of the feel of a 'tales from the crypt' episode, but 'tales' usually had a cool or grotesque twist which often times you didn't see coming. this was one picture that you couldn't quite get a handle on coming or going. for example, in an early scene, you can clearly make out that melting man's eyeball fell out of his head, so how did he manage to get around for the rest of the story? i guess we're not supposed to ask.<br /><br />at eighty four minutes, this picture was about an hour and a half too long. when it was all over, i was ready to take up general perry on his earlier suggestion - "i could really use a drink about now".
