this has to be the worst, and i mean worst biker movie ever made! and that's saying a lot because the line of stinkers is long and smelly!<br /><br />now at least we know what happened to ginger after she was rescued from gilligan's island! a frightened looking tina louise(she was probably afraid someone would see this mess!)is a stranded motorist who is tormented by the most repulsive motorcycle gang in film history. but, don't worry fans! batman, i mean adam west as a hick-town doctor comes to the rescue! pow! crush! boom! holy toledo batman! <br /><br />the only good points of this "bomb" are some cute women, some laughable fight scenes, and the still "sexy" tina louise!
