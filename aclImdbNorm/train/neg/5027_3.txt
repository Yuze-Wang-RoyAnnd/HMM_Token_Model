we now travel to a parallel universe where the appearance of giant prehistoric monsters flattening cities are part of the daily routine. it's the world of godzilla, rodan, mothra ghidrah and their kind - a strange world, and one made even stranger by the appearance of an unidentified flying turtle called gamera.<br /><br />forever in the shadow of the monolithic toho studios, second rung daiei studios were more famous for samurai sagas than monster movies. in the mid 60s they decided to join the giant reptile race and designed a rival monster series to toho's mammothly successful godzilla. they wisely chose gamera as their flagship - a giant turtle that shoots flames from between its snaggle-teeth, and spins through the air by shooting flames through its shell's feet-holes (and at one point you almost see the paper mache shell catch fire!).<br /><br />the first gamera film "gamera the invincible" (as it was sold to the us) is a virtual mirror of the first godzilla film, only 10 years behind. american fighters chase an unmarked plane over the arctic to its fiery demise - the nuclear bomb on board ignites and awakens the giant gamera from its icy slumber. feeding off atomic energy, it immediately goes on a rampage, and the world wants to destroy gamera once and for all, but a little japanese boy named kenny, who has a psychic connection with the giant turtle and even keeps a miniature version in an aquarium by his bedside, believes gamera is essentially kind and benevolent. he's like a little jewish kid with a pinup of hitler. "gamera is a good turtle," he pleads, then sulks, and puts on a face like someone's pooped in his coco pops. miraculously the world's leaders listen to him, and so begins z-plan to save the world and gamera from complete destruction.<br /><br />released in 1965, gamera was a surprising hit. the annoying infantile anthropomorphism actually worked on kiddie audiences in both japan and the us, and the sight of gamera on two feet stomping miniatures of tokyo and the north pole is gloriously chintzy. most surprising of all is the longevity of the series: eight original gamera films, plus a slew of recent remakes. not bad for a mutant reptile whose only friend is mewing eight year old milquetoast - and if i hear "gamera is friends to all children" one more time i'm going to crush tokyo. which appears to be an easy task in the parallel universe where children are smart and turtles are bigger than a seiko billboard in the 1965 turtle-fest gamera.
