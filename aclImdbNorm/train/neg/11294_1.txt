ok, i have been a huge fan of the black for a long time and was disgusted after seeing this film. let's name the problems...first this film has much of the same crew that the first two had. it has also been called the prequel to the original black stallion. why is it that they can't get shetan's dam's name correct or her color?? in the black stallion returns, we learn the sagr was the black's chestnut mother and in this film she is a gray mare name jenny?!?!?!?!? wtf? and it's set in africa in 1946 and 1947...i could be wrong but the first one was set in the 1940's as well when the ship wrecks. time line doesn't sound quite right to me. also, as a goof, there is a friesian in the beginning of the movie that is supposed to be shetan's father...upon further notice it appears to be a gelding. ben ishaak is the only character that remained to even make this film appear to be related to the previous two in any way. might be a cute family film to some but it's my biggest movie disappointment of the year.
