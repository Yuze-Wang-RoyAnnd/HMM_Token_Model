saw it at the philadelphia gay and lesbian film fest.<br /><br />what can i say? against my better judgment, i liked it, but it seemed to me that that acting was a little...weak (mostly i noticed this from the family of the teen boy). i mean, the script wasn't stellar to begin with, but the actors didn't make me believe the relationships.<br /><br />the plot is also predictable.<br /><br />nonethelss, i liked it. the characters are likable, and the plot is not challenging or upsetting. it's sweet, the characters care about each other, and i don't count it as fifty minutes ill-spent. <br /><br />but i don't recommend it.
