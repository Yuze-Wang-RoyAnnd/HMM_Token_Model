most of the french films i've seen - and enjoyed - were more talk than action, but that's okay. i found them interesting, well-photographed and with intriguing actors. (however, i did at one point wonder if gerald depardieu was in every french film ever made! it seemed that way.)<br /><br />this movie has the same interesting visuals and had a good opening. but then it became talk, talk and more talk....which is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery. after awhile, i almost fell asleep watching this.<br /><br />actually, the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes played out in one room. thus, if you love plays, you should like this...but i want a little more bang for a murder story.
