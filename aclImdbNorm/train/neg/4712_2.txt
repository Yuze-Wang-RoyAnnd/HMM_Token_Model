this show is possibly the biggest, ugliest, most generic steam pile i've seen in children's programming that's actually become successful. the lead character, johnny, while i understand he's supposed to represent an ordinary kid, isn't likable or even tolerable. the jokes are lame, overdone (i.e. the "whoa! didn't see that coming" gag. come on, that wasn't even funny the first time. it's not even cute) and lack any form of primitive wit or inspiration. and lastly... it's just plain ugly to look at. while kids aren't especially critical of artistic talent, they still prefer eye candy. i can't stand watching the show, because in a way, the art style is just...gross. hideous, in fact. just plain crummy. <br /><br />i just can't stand that this is getting so much airtime. while i understand that nostalgia can be a little irrational and i shouldn't be getting my hopes up on it coming back... i really miss the old cartoons. bring back dexter's laboratory, the powerpuff girls... anything but this crap. i guess it's just wishful thinking though.<br /><br />simply put, i advise you don't waste your time on this show. i believe that truly good cartoons are able to be enjoyed by the big kids, too. and this doesn't cut it.
