i'll bet none of you knew that the famous conquistador hernando cortes made a preliminary scouting expedition to mexico before taking on the aztecs. good thing he did because he would never have known about those t rexs that inhabited one particular valley where the locals revered them as gods.<br /><br />that was understandable. what wasn't was the casting of blue eyed ian ziering as cortes. even with the blond hair made famous in beverly hills 90210 dyed black, ian looked positively ridiculous. at least he made no attempt at a spanish accent.<br /><br />the real hero of tyrannosaurus azteca is marco sanchez also late of a television series with a semi-recurring role in walker texas ranger as detective sandoval of the dallas pd. he finds true love with an aztec princess and life would be just perfect if it wasn't for those pesky prehistoric beasts the natives worship.<br /><br />tyrannosaurus azteca looks like they used some outtakes from the famous sid&marty krofft series the land of the lost. all that was needed was some sleestak to appear.<br /><br />if you're interested in finding out about this reconnoitering expedition that didn't quite make the history books by all means check out tyrannosaurus azteca. then try and sit through it with a straight face.
