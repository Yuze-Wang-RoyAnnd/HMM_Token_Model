not one of keaton's best efforts, this was perhaps a veiled attempt to revenge himself on the family he married into - the talmadges. a polish/english language barrier and a series of coincidences leads buster into a marriage with a large irish woman, who (along with her father and brothers) treat him shabbily until they think he may be an heir to a fortune. mistaken identities abound here - gags are set up and but for the main fail to pay off.<br /><br />this metro short does have at least two real laughs - buster's cleverly turning around his lack of dinner by using the calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adopted family to literally bring the meat to his plate. the other is a family photo, with the entire group slowly collapsing to the floor as the tripod of the camera loses its stability.<br /><br />the yeast beer overflow could have been the catalyst for a massive series of gags built upon gags, but stops short (for all the buildup) of development.<br /><br />kino's print is crisp and clear and the score is one for player piano, drums and sound effects. not one of buster's best efforts, but worth a few laughs.
