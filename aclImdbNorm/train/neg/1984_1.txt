an absolute steaming pile of cow dung. it's mind-blowing to me that this film was even made. hip-hop and old westerns just don't seem to mix. what target audience were these people thinking of when planning this trainwreck.<br /><br />not only is the concept and plot a joke, but the acting is atrocious and the fact that some decent actors were even in this nightmare of a film makes their entire careers a laughing stock. the chick from clueless should never be forgiven and she is stripped of any remaining dignity she had. after reading the first ten pages of dialogue she should have been asking which one of her friends was playing this sick joke. after some research, i actually found a list of some other actors who passed on this film: jada pinkett-smith, denzel washington, brandy, monique, kim kardasian, jenna jameson, oprah, and finally marge simpson.<br /><br />simply put, i would rather stare at a blank tv than watch this movie again.
