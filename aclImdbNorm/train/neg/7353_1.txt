watching it now it's still as skanky and sexist as i remember. comes from a time when girls were "dolly birds" and basically men's playthings. it's hard to take in that it is from the hammer studios and the fact it's available on dvd when good films are not. our nations shame where the working class are portrayed as work shy layabouts or worse! trouble is you can't help feeling nostalgic for a clippie on a bus. try to hold your stomach contents when you see olive in a fluffy? blue "saucy" nightie or something similar like shirley bassey used to wear for a concert in 1972. warning this film shows the illegal practice of towing a motorcycle combo by a red double decker bus, which i've been informed is not a routemaster but a bristol.<br /><br />look just don't bother watch something decent instead like porridge or dad's army...or a fly crawling up a wall.
