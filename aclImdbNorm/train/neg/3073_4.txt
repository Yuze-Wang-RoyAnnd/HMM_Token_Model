the back of the dvd box says ellen page co-stars in this movie. she does not even appear until two thirds of the movie is over and then its in minor role. i don't consider it a supporting role either, but rather a "bit" part. also the plot has many unexplained elements. some examples are: why does the main character reject her oldest son? why does her youngest son drive head on into the train? he says its for a "sucker" bet which doesn't explain anything. obviously the screenwriter doesn't know the definition of a sucker bet. this film is not worthy of the rental price in my opinion. save your money and view it for free on tv if you think it needs to be seen.
