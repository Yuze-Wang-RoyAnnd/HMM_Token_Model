it seems like this is the only film that john saxon ever directed, and that he had the good sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera. this movie is a dog, from start to finish, and it's dull and wooden with nothing much going for it. a viet nam war hero takes a job working for a mob boss, gets a bit too friendly with the wife and then the wife is killed by the mob boss himself & the war hero framed and sent to prison, death row, specifically. now, this particular prison has been experimenting on inmates and is testing some formula that will turn men into the ultimate killing machine (a zombie). of course, everything goes wrong and then there's all these infected people trapped in the prison, some of whom are turning into zombies and the rest who suddenly just don't want to be there anymore. this just goes on and on and on with nothing particularly much to show or say for itself, and i stopped it before the end, which seemed like it was coming a few times but no, it was apparently only getting set to take off on a different and equally dull path. if one watched to the end they may well become a zombie themselves, so don't risk it. 2 out of 10.
