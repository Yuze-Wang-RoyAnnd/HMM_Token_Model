well, first off, if you're checking out revolt of the zombies as some very early night of the living dead (1968)-type film, forget it. this is about "zombies" in a more psychological sense, where that term merely denotes someone who is not in control of their will, but who must instead follow the will of another. the "zombies" here, as little as they are in the film, are largely metaphors for subservience to the state or authority in general, as in wartime. it is quite a stretch to call this a horror film.<br /><br />the film is set during world war i. a "french cambodian" contingent had heard strange stories about zombification--supposedly angkor wat was built by utilizing zombies--and there are tales of zombie armies easily overcoming foes. armand louque (dean jagger) brings back a priest who supposedly knows the secret of zombification, but he won't talk. so louque and an international military contingent head to angkor wat on an archaeological expedition designed to discover the secret of zombification and destroy the information before zombies have a chance to "wipe out the white race".<br /><br />one of the odd things about revolt of the zombies is that it seems like maybe writer/director victor halperin decided to change his game plan while shooting the script. the film begins as if it will explore the zombie/military metaphor, and maybe even have adventure elements, but after about 15 minutes, it changes gears and becomes more of a love triangle story.<br /><br />halperin does stick with a subtext about will and power (and a nietzschean "will to power"). the film is interesting on that level, but the script and the editing are very choppy. this is yet another older film for which i wouldn't be surprised if there is missing footage, especially since some scenes even fade or cut while a character is uttering dialogue.<br /><br />amidst the contrived romance story, halperin tries to keep referring to the zombie thread, but little of the zombie material makes much sense. louque discovers the secret of zombification, but it doesn't mean much to the viewer. the mechanics of the zombie material are vague and confusing
