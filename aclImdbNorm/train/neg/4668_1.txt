the potential movie extravaganza, set during the 19th century, failed to produce. with big-name actors like maggie smith, albert finney, and many others, there was no reason for the movie to fail. however, the movie lacked an ending, had a sorry excuse for a plot line, and fell to pieces with its continuity. a typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy, brought together by love and destroyed by beauty (or lack thereof) and disapproval, has a touching side of a mother's early death and an absentee father. the father, played by finney, is a disturbed man, tormenting his daughter in life as well as death. he believes his daughter's lack of good looks would ruin his fortune by marrying beneath their social status. the actors vainly attempted to salvage what was left of the storyline. washington square is a black hole of ruin and destruction, wasting precious time of those who sorrowfully watch. i give this movie a 1 instead of a 0, purely for the actors' attempts. save yourself, stay clear of washington square.
