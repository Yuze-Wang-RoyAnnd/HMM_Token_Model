channel surfing and caught this on logo. it was one of those "i have to watch this because it's so horribly bad" moments, like roadhouse without the joy. the writing is atrocious; completely inane and the acting is throw-up-in-your-mouth bad.<br /><br />there's low budget and then there is the abyss which is where this epic should be tossed and never seen from again. i mean, the main characters go to a ski retreat in some rented house and the house is, well, ordinary which is no big deal, but they choose to show all the houseguests pouring over it like it was the sistine chapel. i'm sorry but watching 6 guys stare into every 10'x10' boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame. i guess they didn't learn anything from the bad news bears in breaking training (see hotel room check scene)...wow a toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! i don't buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine. if it smells like...and it looks like...well, you know the rest.<br /><br />avoid like the plague.<br /><br />edit: apparently other more close minded reviewers believe that since i disliked this movie, i am an "obvious hater" which i can only assume means i am phobic, which of course is not true. i decided to do this wacky, crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the film and not by its mere presence (i.e. its refreshing to see...)<br /><br />sure, it may be refreshing to see but that doesn't equate into a great movie, just give them some better material to work with and tighter direction. in fact, i applaud the effort. frankly, i'd rather go listen to my kitchens of distinction catalogue than watch this again.
