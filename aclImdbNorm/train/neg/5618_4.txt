i'm actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this anti-christian pseudo-documentary got. now, i respect the guy's opinion and faith, i myself am not, at this state, believer of the taught christian doctrine. however, anti-christian propaganda is somewhat of a different issue.<br /><br />this film has valid points, but they are very few and represented in a very biased context. i'm not recommending against seeing it. in fact, i think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not. and this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to christian teachings. rather than an inquiring approach on the subject, it looks like a personal vendetta on the christian school that affected his childhood. it also misrepresents the christians most of the times as either incredibly naive or fundamentalists, no moderation in between.<br /><br />the director uses movie scenes from passion of christ without permission, sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents almost solely anti-christian historians and writers. i actually found the headmaster to be the most down-to-earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified. i also strongly doubt that any of the christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords or even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry.<br /><br />with this being said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of christianity. but the way in which this whole think is produced is often offensive, highly unprofessional and dreadfully biased.
