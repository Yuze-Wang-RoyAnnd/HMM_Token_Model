if i hadn't been forced to watch this for work reasons i never would have made it past the first 10 minutes. and even then i admit i fast forwarded through parts. the '63 film version was vastly superior in all regards. yes, i've read this one is more faithful to the original play, but what a wise thing it was for the writer to change the script in '63! it's overlong, it drags, the songs that are in this version and not in the film version are boring and unimaginative. the version of "kids" in the '63 version was very funny and a true classic of sarcastic parent humor. in this version the kim is way too old, the conrad is *absolutely horrible* to behold (when someone ripped his shirt off him i shuttered in disgust...the director of this version has no idea what sexy is.). this conrad can't dance, can't sing (he can't even stay in tune) and is simply repulsive. if elvis presley had really been like that his career would have been over before it began. as for the other actors, well i kept waiting for alexander's toupee to fall off as he danced and daly was totally over acting as momma. see stapleton's performance in the film version to see the same role properly executed by someone who understands comic timing. this tv version is nothing but a total waste of anyone's time.
