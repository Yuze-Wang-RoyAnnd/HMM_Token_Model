my first review of 2010 is "into the blue 2: the reef". the story is about two divers played by chris carmack and laura vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasures at a bottom of a local reef. one day after a day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by david anders and marsha thomason. they tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about columbus' hidden treasure that is reported at the bottom of the reef.<br /><br />next day the four dive to the bottom of the reef and of coarse after a whole day of diving they find nothing. a few more days past and the two hired divers found out that they a part of a major deadly plot in which they can't escape otherwise they will be killed. they were hired to find two big containers. one contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a core.<br /><br />the movie also has a back story about another person (brother of the lead character) trying to patch things up with his girlfriend, i reckon this part of the story was a waste of time, this also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and wasn't needed to be shown.<br /><br />however apart from that, this movie does have some good underwater photography and the colors blend in well which is why it receives 4 stars. into the blue 2 is a sequel only by name. none of the original actors or characters return, it has a dumb plot, stupid characters and a boring climax.
