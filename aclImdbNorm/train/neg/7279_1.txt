i just saw this movie on a local tv station (tv8's "big chuck and little john" in cleveland, ohio) i had never heard of this movie and decided to watch it.<br /><br />i know of no thesaurus that can even come close to aiding me in describing how bad this movie really is. the script is awful. the acting, well other than one of two exceptions, is pointless since there is nothing in this material that merits any real effort.<br /><br />it looks like a bunch of little ideas, leftover from various writing sessions, that where thrown into a blender. it's not just funny. the "parody" aspect is strained at best. some references where almost out of date (even for the time of it's release). no wonder i had never heard of it, it's really bad, worse than anything saturday night live, mad tv or even in living color put out in their worst days.<br /><br />if you see it on tv, it is a great example of how not to make a movie. whatever you do don't waste a cent.<br /><br />adam
