i found myself very caught up in this movie, at least at the beginning, and any credit i give to this movie, is lacey chabert, she was fantastic!! but thats where it ends. i seem to be very good at figuring out who the killer is, and i like it when a movie is able to completely baffel me, but i felt out and out lied to, they whole time they lead you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction at the end, they gave no hit to it at all, thats not misleading that very bad writing and planning, someone did not think at all!<br /><br />i felt the movie would have been much better if they had stuck to the plot that the lead you on, they also seemed to not answer anything, why did jane(maria) burn down the professor's house.<br /><br />its a great pity as i felt it started out as a relatively good movie.
