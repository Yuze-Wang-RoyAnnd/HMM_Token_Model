i loved this movie, i'll admit it. this has to be the best (straight to?) video movie i've seen. well... me and my friend decided just for shits n' giggles that we'd rent this movie. we knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected, plus more. when that red neck gets slammed up against the tree by the sasquatch, we literally watched that part about three to four times, it was that amazing (hysterically, of course). and why? oh why does the main character have to roll that much? like honestly, we know that you're in danger, rolling that much isn't gonna help all that much. but really, if this movie is in you're local video store rent it. it is worth the money and it's not even that bad, like it's bad, but not incredibly bad. overall, complete amazing will be in store for you if you rent this movie.
