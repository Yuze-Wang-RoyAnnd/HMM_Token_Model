a 1957 (yes, that's the correct date) j. arthur rank production with james robertson justice, margaret rutherford, wilfred hyde white; it has to be a smash comedy, right? oh, it's just awful. it's a one gag film: watching people be shocked at the sight of a little alligator. music is thrown in, most inappropriately and forgettably. jeannie carson is a lively dancer and competent singer. but what was she doing in this film? diana dors is here too, providing oh-so-daring shots for use in the previews. her acting level is not bad, but she's in the film to provide someone to leer at. well, one must do something beside groan during this film. the movie is being sold on vhs now by people on e-bay. spare yourself the expense and the waste of time. a comedy without a laugh. a musical without a memorable song or dance.
