you can't imagine how i looked forward to king of the ants. as a massive gordon fan, i awaited the european premiere with wicked anticipation.especially since i loved dagon - gordon's last achievement - so much. king of the ants premiered here in my country and it was gordon himself who came to present it. unfortunately, i couldn't go and congratulate him for it afterwards. king of the ants is his most uninspired and mediocre film to date. really, the quality level never surpassed ordinary tv-thriller standards. the plot outline is terribly routine and with the exception of a few poor scenes, the typical gordon-touch is never recognized. on top of that, the already weak script has more holes than a swiss bowl of cheese! it involves a young wannabe-crook who's hired to commit a murder. so he does.and of course they're not paying him.and of course he falls in love with the victim's wife.and of course he avenges himself.. only the sequences in which the guy descents in a spiral of madness are worth a mention and they're the only ones reminding you of the fact you're still watching a stuart gordon film. the acting performances are below average with mccenna as the heroic lowlife, george `norm peterson' wendt as the chubby bastard and kari wuhrer as the good-hearted sex bomb. extremely illogical things happen constantly and the dullness of the story becomes irritating very quickly, while the make-up effects aren't enough to even satisfy amateur-horror fans. i read a few other comments on king of the ants, claiming it's gordon's best since it finally is a thought-provoking and mature film.well, if that's the case.i rather stay immature and give re-animator another viewing, thank you very much. oh well, i guess every good director runs out of steam and inspiration eventually.too bad it also overcame stuart gordon.
