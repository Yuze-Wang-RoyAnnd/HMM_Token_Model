i sometimes enjoy really lousy movies....those that occasionally result when people (even talented people) get together with good intentions to produce a movie and for whatever reason it turns out to be a disaster. movies like "attack of the killer tomatoes", "plan 9 from outer space", "manos-hands of fate", and "heavens gate", etc.<br /><br />so, when i heard that this movie, "rachel's attic", was considered by many people to be the single worst film of the decade, naturally i just had to see it.<br /><br />boy, do i regret that decision. this movie is beyond bad....it is so bad that it is not even as enjoyable as the usual bad movie. the acting, filming, script, etc. are even worse than a low budget porno film: the sound is utterly horrible, the "plot" is completely incomprehensible, the "acting" is laughable....it is a complete waste of everyone's time and money. at least the porno film has porno to break up the monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy squeezing a rotten apple, and a "mad hatter's" tea party.<br /><br />the lighting is non-existent...many "scenes" take place in semi or complete darkness, which is probably just as well. the "writer-director" (i use the terms loosely), david tybor, tries to get kinky with bondage scenes...but the results would be laughable, if they weren't so pathetic. there is some nudity, but it is of such abysmal quality that it actually acts as a sexual suppressant. i could go on forever and not do justice to all the flaws and shortcomings of this truly awful waste of film.<br /><br />for the love of god, avoid this train wreck. i know that despite (or perhaps because of) my negative comments, you may still be tempted to see if this piece of trash is really as bad as i claim it to be....but trust me on this....it's even worse than i have said, and you will absolutely, positively regret the experience (and expense, if you waste your money on a purchase or rental).
