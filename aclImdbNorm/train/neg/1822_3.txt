greetings again from the darkness. what ever happened to the great barry levinson? he directed two of my all-time favorites in "avalon" and "diner". he had some fine movies as well ("rainman"), but always provided something of interest ... until now. i believe the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it is boring. "envy" is the definition of boring. never of big fan of pure slap stick ("dumb and dumber"), i was just stunned at how god-awful this movie is. there are maybe 2 chuckles in the whole thing - if you can pay attention that long. the best part of the film is the running gag of the title song by a redbone sound-alike. if the film had been written as well as the song, it would have been tolerable. rachel weisz is a wonderful actress and i realize they all want to do comedy (even julianne moore), but the real world exposes one weaknesses. snl cast member amy poehler is her usual over the top in her role as trailer park trash turned princess. the disaster of the film is jack black and ben stiller. the first work commute together flashes some promise, but after that their chemistry disappears due to the poor script. this script is like most of jack black's character's ideas - not a bad thought, but no hope for success.
