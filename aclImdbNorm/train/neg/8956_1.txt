pretty disappointing prequel to the first two films, it's got none of the suspense of the first nor the interest of the second. by concentrating on the guys who 'run' the cube, it basically takes away any of the sense of tension inside the cube, as we simply don't care about the characters inside. much of the film is simply boring, and it only becomes truly terrible with the introduction of the glass-eyed superior and the green-eyed crazy marine. after that, though, it just descends into over-the-top unintentional hilarity. the ending is fitting though, tying it back into the first one in an indirect way. the script is terrible, the acting mediocre at best, and the direction unimpressive. a much lesser follow-up.
