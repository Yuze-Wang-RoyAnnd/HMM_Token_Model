if you hit your head with a shovel, write the script with your feet, you may come close to the intelligence level of this movie. there is nothing in this movie that hasn't been done a thousand times in other gangster flicks and done much better. those who think "scarface" was some kind of hero to be looked up to or saw "goodfellas", "menace ii society" or "dead presidents" and thought mmm "that's the life for me!" will like this movie. i thought i'd give the movie a chance, since the premise was perfect for a prequel. i should have known better after seeing mario van peebles and sean combs were involved. anyone above a 4th grade education, see the original with pacino, a real actor, and be satisfied.
