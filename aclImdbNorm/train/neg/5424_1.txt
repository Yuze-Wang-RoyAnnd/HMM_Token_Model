mirror. mirror (1990) is a flat out lame movie. why did i watch movies like this when i was younger? who knows? maybe i was one for punishing myself by watching one terrible movie after another. i don't know, i guess i needed a hobby during my teen years. a teenage outcast (rainbow harvest) seeks solace in an old mirror. soon she learns about the horrific power this antique mirror has and uses it to strike out against those who have wronged her. movies like these, the power giver has a nasty side effect. this one changes her inside and out if she likes it or not.<br /><br />a mess of a movie that for some reason was restored on d.v.d. a few years back. i don't know why. they should have left it on the shelf and collect dust. people love this movie foe some reason. if you do i would like to know why. until then i dislike this movie and i have no reason to ever watch it again.<br /><br />not recommended at all.
