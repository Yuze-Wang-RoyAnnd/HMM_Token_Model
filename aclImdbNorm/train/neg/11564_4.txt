italian horror/suspense film about a wealthy english lord who cruises pubs and taverns for girls with red hair just like his recently deceased wife evelyn. you know he must have really loved his wife, because he brings them to his home - a huge, rotting castle - and makes them disrobe and then tortures them, whips them, and kills them. the most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the film's end, we see this guy played by antonio de teffe as the hero of the film. anyway, soon, under the advice of his playboy uncle roberto maldera, de teffe settles down with a girl he meets at his uncle's party. she moves in and strange things begin to happen to de teffe's fragile state of mind. he begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally, well, just look at the title if you are still curious. also, family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions. poor aunt agatha(she looks like she might even be younger than de teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old) meets her fate in a foxy fashion. another man is injected and then buried alive. and of course, there is a whole explanation as to why/how evelyn did what she did. director emilio miraglia does do some things fairly well: the settings in the film are well-suited for this film though trying to make us believe it is england is ludicrous at best. none of the actors look english. many having dark black hair and mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an englishman wouldn't be caught dead in. the cars drive on their wrong side of the road. but all that notwithstanding, the crypt scene was effectively shot and i liked the cheesy resolution too. and of course any film with the sultry, red-headed erika blanc is always a plus. there is a streak of sexual perversion; however, which i found somewhat appalling with the idea that torturing women was quite alright and healthy in order to relieve one of his mental demons. c'mon.
