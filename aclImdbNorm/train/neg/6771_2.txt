there are few uplifting things to say about this, but i can mention matt dillon doing his best to make something out of nothing and the many split screens and graphics that are worthwhile. as most race movies suffer from the premise that car lovers are not that intelligent, we end up with movies like this.<br /><br />lindsay lohan who surprised so much in mean girls has to make better decisions which roles to take. here she can only fail.<br /><br />children will only be mildly entertained because it tries to appeal more to adults than children (although still pretty dumb). the ones in the theater i saw it with showed no real interest after a couple of minutes. and as a family sports movie this is horrible. the better moments are in the beginning at the scrapyard creating some sentiment and later in the car-bash fest creating some tension. if you develop a car as a central character you have to develop it better than here. after a few obligatory race scenes you are in for the best part: being able to leave the multiplex in your own car.
