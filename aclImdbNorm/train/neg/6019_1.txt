this movie is one reason imdb should allow a vote of 0/10. the acting is awful, even what some here have lauded, the carpathia character! the script looks like it was written in haste. in one scene, the black preacher who was left behind, when asked by buck what "dan7" in the computer graphic meant, said, "daniel 7, *chapter* 24." he probably meant verse 24, but the film makers missed this slip up. perhaps the worst part is that the film's eschatological position is biblically unsound. while many christians have espoused the film's interpretation of end-time events, such interpretation, in *my opinion*, is faulty. to understand these flaws, read "christians will go through the tribulation" by jim mckeever and "the blessed hope, a biblical study of the second advent and the rapture" by george e. ladd.
