this woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling. so she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer. this movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope. the problem i had with this movie is that every ten seconds, someone is snorting heroin. if they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin, then this would be a pretty good movie. every time i thought that a scene was going somewhere, someone inhaled the white powder. it was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie. it pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer. the lesbian stuff didn't bother me. i was looking for a movie about art. i found a movie about drug use.
