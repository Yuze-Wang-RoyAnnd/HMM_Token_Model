when i noticed that "hamish macbeth" was being broadcast in the united states, i was thrilled. i then had the misfortune to watch the darn thing. i adore m. c. beaton's books about the wonderful scottish constable. the characters in the book are entertaining and very well-written. the powers that be who are responsible for this mish-mash apparently have never have read one of beaton's books. only the name "hamish macbeth" has anything to do with the series. besides the lack of familiar characters, i find the whole show offensively loud. it seems that the actors feel they must shout their lines and scream at each other. if you love m. c. beaton's adorable hamish macbeth don't waste your time on this rubbish.
