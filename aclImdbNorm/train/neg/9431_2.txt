basic slasher movie premise, 3 young ladies wreck their car and end up staying with a creepy family. yawn.<br /><br />watching 36 minutes of a premonition of oj's car chase with a white sedan instead of a bronco. yawn.<br /><br />old lady with hot and cold dementia controlling her daughter... yawn<br /><br />23 minutes of watching the actors eat - yawn trying to identify what the heck they are eating ... ok there might be a drinking game here ... nope - yawn <br /><br />complimentary shower scenes ... ok got my interest for a couple of seconds.<br /><br />completely random and uninspired killings ... yawn <br /><br />the ending ... dude! that psycho is deranged - why couldn't the rest of the movie be like the last 5 minutes... unfortunately that is it - my advice - fast forward to the last five minutes and watch that and then put something good in the player - for me i am going back to sleep.
