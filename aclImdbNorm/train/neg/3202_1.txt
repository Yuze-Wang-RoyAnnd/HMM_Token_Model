if you ever hear these three words uttered to you..."joe don baker", be afraid...<br /><br />final justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a texas town named geronimo (pronounced as heronimo). he's an ugly, slimy, rude character who is on the hunt for a criminal in malta who killed his partner in texas. his partner actually slumps down twice in the movie. very bad editing. joe don baker (geronimo) ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie, making the plot go nowhere fast. plus, he shoots everybody like he's in the wild west. i guess nobody told him it was the 20th century. a woman cop is assigned to show him around malta (who looks like elaine from seinfeld) and she is the only one who can put up with the redneck. she must be insane!<br /><br />the strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie. their dancing is shown throughout the film and i began to bond with the sleazy women. well, at least it was better than watching geronimo try to dumb his way out of something. the ending is flawed and somewhat predictable, and i was happy it was finally over. you'll never forget that last line of joe don baker from the movie.<br /><br />it's so hard to imagine how he was in three bond movies...very weird! anyway, if you're up for a laugh, then see this one on mst3k sometime. also, i've heard his other bad movie (among many), "mitchell" mst3k version is being released on dvd by rhino. i can't wait to see that!
