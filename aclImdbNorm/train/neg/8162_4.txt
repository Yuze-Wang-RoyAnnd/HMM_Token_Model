your attitude going into prom night ii will determine how much joy you take away from the film. if you're expecting a horror masterpiece, look elsewhere. if you like campy movies that are rather fun to watch unfold, you'll like this. lisa schrage has the time of her life playing an over the top mary lou and wendy loyd channels schrage's rage perfectly during her time "possessed".<br /><br />not classic cinema but a fun way to kill a couple of hours with a wicked ending.<br /><br />
