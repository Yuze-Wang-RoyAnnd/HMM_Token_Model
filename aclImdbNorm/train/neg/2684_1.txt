i've found the movie offensive for americans which lost somebody in the towers, for american people in general. pretending to be an homage to horrible facts happened last years, each director takes the opportunity to polemize with old facts (which have none to do with a terrorist attack), or criticize american's political behaviour, or compare different political situation as they have in own country having this nothing to do or to share with the atrocity of september 11. shame on them.
