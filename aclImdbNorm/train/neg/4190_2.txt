i saw this movie a few months ago in the town which appeared as greendale in the movie, which is the only reason i went to see it. another local who was there just forwarded to me an email announcement of a repeat showing because the first had sold out and people were turned away. his editorial comment in his forward is a good summary:<br /><br />"yuk."<br /><br />unless you're a neil young fan or live in/near "greendale" (if the latter you know the real name), skip this movie. it's mostly an ego trip for the filmmaker. it has no discernible plot, the music is merely ok, and too much of the lyrics are unintelligible making it impossible to follow what little shreds of plot there may be.<br /><br />i don't need to put in a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give away.<br /><br />i'd give this a 1.5/10, but that's just for the amusement value of seeing the locales made into a movie. it wasn't worth the $6. i could rent a video camera and drive around "greendale" and make a better movie myself.<br /><br />if you want to see a *good* environmental-message movie with no plot, go rent koyaanisqatsi.
