i want to say the acting is bad, but i think it was the directing that made it so. i never thought much of highlander (same director) but that one could be blamed on the 80s.<br /><br />this one however, has no excuses. people get shot while exiting trenches with a man in front of him!? those kind of mistakes, along with an unclear time line, weird battle tactics, sub-par cutting and poor visual effects, makes this one a sub-par film over all.<br /><br />then like so many other have commented, all this american bullshit. the german general being practically scared of his captured american private. be prepared to swallow a lot of it, although in small doses.<br /><br />to sum it up, a not horrible but still definitely sub-par war movie in all aspects.
