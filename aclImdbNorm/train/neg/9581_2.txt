that is the only thing i can positive to say about this movie. cleveland is the star, i've been there and never saw the city look this good. beautiful river and cityscapes.<br /><br />this movie moves ahead at such a pace they hope you won't notice the lack of real world relevance. people running around and shooting guns without any consequence. for example, there is a shoot out at rob lowe's character's house- two cars are stolen, and yet the cops don't show up there till much later in the movie. murder for hire never looked so implausible.<br /><br />whoever wrote this movie should be on the receiving end of one the movies countless stray bullets. many of the actors in this movie are so much better than this. i check the date of the movie just to make sure it wasn't written during the writers strike but alas this was not the case. this movie is currently in rotation on universal's hd channel- unless you want to drool of over lowe there is no reason to watch it.
