how can you take her hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with *that* accent? it's absurd. apart from that, the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky, the plot is a shallow, boring, confused gangster-movie rehash and the acting is unconvincing. the film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and confused. the film ever shows you things that don't really happen and then later says "that didn't really happen, this happened" - see the (apparent) killing of the (fake) 'first ladies'. what have we seen the first, wrong, sequence of events for then?<br /><br />terrible choice in casting, a convoluted, messy plot and a headache-inducing directorial style. 1/5.
