i do not recommend this movie , because it's inaccurate and misleading, this story was supposed to be in algerian berber territory, this one was shot in the southern tunisian desert, (completetly different culture, i know i am from both tunisia and algeria), the other shocking element was the character of her companion aunt, speaks in the movie with a very eloquent french, university level academic french while the character she plays was supposed to be of a disturbed never left her mountain kind of personage, so living as a bedouin with that kind of education i that context is impossible, the most disgraceful scene and disrespectful especially for the people of the region is the "femme repudiee" segment which is s pure invention from the writer/director, things like that will never happen in a algerian society ever!!!
