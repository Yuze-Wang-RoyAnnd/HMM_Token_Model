the film is based on a genuine 1950s novel.<br /><br />journalist colin mcinnes wrote a set of three "london novels": "absolute beginners", "city of spades" and "mr love and justice". i have read all three. the first two are excellent. the last, perhaps an experiment that did not come off. but mcinnes's work is highly acclaimed; and rightly so. this musical is the novelist's ultimate nightmare - to see the fruits of one's mind being turned into a glitzy, badly-acted, soporific one-dimensional apology of a film that says it captures the spirit of 1950s london, and does nothing of the sort.<br /><br />thank goodness colin mcinnes wasn't alive to witness it.
