seriously - avoid this movie at any cost. i just saw it in my first "sneak preview" ever and although i paid non-refundable money for it, i walked out of the cinema after a mere 15 minutes. which already includes 2 minutes of discussion among my friends whether or not to leave. first time ever i walked out of a movie. and i lived through some pretty bad ones.<br /><br />it's one of those films that is dubbed (and badly so) even though it is shown in its original language. it relies on the oldest, simplest and cheapest jokes in the book. on the military ("what do we do once we reach the fighting zone?" - "you get out of the car and die"; actually, it's much funnier to read here that the way it was delivered in the film), on drugs (a guy eats some "space cookies", behaves really silly and misses his wedding or has to live through it while high - all badly written and acted), on women in the army ("why do we only get trumpets? we were promised guns!" - "that's the way it is, that's the way it'll stay")... argh. okay, you might actually find these genuinely funny, but in that case you seriously scare me.<br /><br />additionally, i have seen better acting in the kind of soft porn films you get on european late night tv. so it had lame jokes (delivered badly), beyond lower average acting, lacked pace, was badly dubbed and edited
