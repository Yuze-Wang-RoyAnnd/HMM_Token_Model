dont let the mpaa fool you with their "rated r for extreme violence" there is definatly no extreme violence in this boring peice of s*t. i expected some cheap rambo 3 type action that the trailer promised, however its just boring boring nonsense with tons of lame slow mo flashbacks that make no sense. avoid!
