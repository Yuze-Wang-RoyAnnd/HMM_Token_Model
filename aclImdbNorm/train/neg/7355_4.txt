don't get me wrong - i love david suchet as poirot. i love the series as well as the movies but enough already re: death on the nile. everyone has done this one! we know who dies. we know why they die. we know who the killer is. we know how it was done. so i say enough already! mr. suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha christie's novels. i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb. the sets were terrific and very realistic. i especially liked david soul but i was surprised at how 'awful' he looked. i hope he doesn't look that way in 'real' life! i honestly can't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same. somehow i don't think so. i thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not ms. christie wrote it that way. i would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison!
