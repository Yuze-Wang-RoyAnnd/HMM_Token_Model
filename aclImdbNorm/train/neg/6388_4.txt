the brothers quay are directors, judging by conventional thought, should have stuck to making short films. i myself actually really liked their first feature, institute benjamenta, but judging by their sophomore effort, the piano tuner of earthquakes, i'm willing to agree they don't come close to equaling their past genius at feature length. piano tuner is, without a doubt, a gorgeous film to look at, and often to listen to. unfortunately, it's borderline painful to sit through with its convoluted narrative and glacial pace. reading the plot synopsis, it sounds like a pretty good story. but the brothers fail miserably to bring it to life. one thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future: dialogue. my god, it's awful here. a huge bust.
