this is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sit around drinking beers, eating pizza, and laugh at. unfortunately for me i found myself watching this one alone. my friends and i rented a big block of movies and never got around to seeing this one. it was due back and i figured that it was a waste not to watch it. so i did, and i was impressed at how absolutely terrible this movie is.<br /><br />now, i love bad movies quite a bit, and i probably would have liked this one if the "hero" wasn't so utterly loathsome. the entire movie i was hoping that he'd put that stupid sword down and let someone kill him! he does very little heroic things in the movie. he's a beefy, disgusting, stupid thing. he has less redeeming qualities than the villains do. and what was it with all the naked chicks? i mean, i love naked chicks just as much as the next guy, but this movie went a tad overboard in that department.<br /><br />well, anyway, if you love bad movies and can stand a disgusting "hero" then i'm sure you'll like this schlock of a film.
