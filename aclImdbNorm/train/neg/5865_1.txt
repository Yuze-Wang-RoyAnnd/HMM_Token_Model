i cannot say enough bad things about this train wreck. it is one of the few movies i've ever been tempted to walk out of. it was a bad premise to begin with, first pregnant male, but then they tried to make it a spoof. what were they spoofing all those real pregnant males??? this was the worst movie i have ever seen. if it had enough votes it would be on the imdb bottom 100. if it was possible to give it a zero i would, and i would still feel i had given it too much credit.
