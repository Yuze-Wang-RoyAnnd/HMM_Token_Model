i have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit thru...not one laugh in it. ok, maybe one little chuckle for the michael clarke duncan bit as the big, black, bald gay virgin. but the rest of it was shockingly un-funny. on top of being void of any laughs the "skits" go on forever! steer clear of this one if you value your time and money. dreadful!!! the worst!!!
