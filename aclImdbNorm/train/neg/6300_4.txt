this seemed an odd combination of withnail and i with a room with a view.. sometimes it worked, other times it did not. tragedy that they changed the name for the us release though.. keep the apidistra flying is much better than the nothing title a merry war. acting was okay, script was okay.. overall it was a mediocre film..
