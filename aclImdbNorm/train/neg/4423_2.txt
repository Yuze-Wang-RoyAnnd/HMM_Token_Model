another of many nearly forgotten movies cranked out by poverty row in the 1930's, resurrected by the magic of dvd.<br /><br />starring stock universal player lionel atwill (often a supporting actor in numerous frankenstein movies) as a pair of twins involved in a murder racket. one kills the victims (stockbrokers involved in a scam) and asks witnesses for the exact time, while the other is deaf and is proved "innocent" because he could not have spoken to witnesses.<br /><br />of course, where it falls apart is if it was a congenital deafness, wouldn't they both be deaf? oh, well.<br /><br />atwill does a pretty good job here, faking being deaf and mute. unfortunately, no one else here can really act worth a darn.
