when i first popped in happy birthday to me, i checked the timer to see how long the film was. i was amazed at the length. both animated and horror films share a common ground: attention span of the selected audience and that should be at or right around 90 minutes. anything more, and you'll lose the bulk of your audience.<br /><br />this 110 minutes, or 20 minutes past its prime was a huge problem for me. i'd like to say half of this movie could've been edited out, but i would be too generous to say that. go ahead and watch it and tell me how many scenes could've been edited, even without being a film major.<br /><br />regardless of the overstayed visit, the movie was below mediocre. it spent all of its time trying to be this huge mystery on which of the "elite 10" is killing off the remaining friends. for the most part, they not only over-do it, but they zoom in on a face and pretty much say "it's this guy! no! it's this gal!" you'll spend more time with the camera misleading you than actually enjoying the movie. and don't get me started on the acting.<br /><br />okay, that got me started. i had to laugh in the beginning trying to remember if melissa sue anderson played the character that went blind on little house on the prairie (later, research proved my suspicions correct) because all the way through this movie, she genuinely looked blind. strange, as an established actress, she should've been the best of the group, but turned out the worst. the rest of the staff, aside from ann (bregman) was pretty damn bad, too, but she, uh, took the cake.<br /><br />the movie begins with a group of ten friends, and one's immediately killed off. barely anyone thinks twice of this "dear" friend's disappearance, so they continue on their merry way. slowly, then more rapidly, there are revelations about virginia's (anderson), the main character, past and her psychologist, who's a tad bit more personal (and on call 24/7, apparently) than most shrinks. all the while, more and more deaths occur.<br /><br />what's funny is, just as the first "disappearance," the more "best buds" vanish, the less the rest care. sure, they give a few seconds of air time to say "wow, (that person) just wouldn't run off" etc, but then they're back to their sexual ways. and speaking of which, it's probably due to the horrid script, or maybe it was i who was losing interest at minute 30, but it was really hard to keep up with who liked who of the group as they all seemed to be sexual partners of the next or someone would either be freaked out to the max by another and best friends the next scene. see: the creepy guy that kept a mouse/rat in his pocket
