with a tendency to repeat himself, wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with 'paris texas'.<br /><br />'land of plenty' is no exception. taking into the fact that i anticipated an average-mediocre film even before i went in, wenders' ambitions seem to always get the better of him. it's taken for grated now his films are heavy-handed and bombastic.<br /><br />i weren't sure if i was watching a comedy that mocks middle america or some thriller. the outcome of diehl's character is wholly predicable. wender's insistence on layering many many scenes with some rock song is also intensely annoying. he was covering up the holes in his script and direction by jazzing up the scenes.<br /><br />i am certain that many people will find this film important and resonant but in all honestly, this clumsy and didactic effort only speaks of poor direction.<br /><br />interesting that wenders professed that while making 'paris texas', he had great help from sam sheppard with the script. yes, that was wenders' best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter. his films from the past 15 years+ were a total mess.
