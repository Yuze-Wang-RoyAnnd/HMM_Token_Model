medellin is a fabulous place to live, work, and study. i've been there twice, and never did i hear anything about guerrilla activities, paramilitaries taking tourists hostage, or anything of the sort. there are "invisible police," but it is *not* a big brother system. there are just enough police so that they are visible in everyday life, but they do not hassle someone without good reasons.<br /><br />la sierra is an interesting documentary in that the youths it depicts in the movie essentially become its characters. the directors of the movie carefully carve out plot lines among the daily actions of the inhabitants of la sierra, and when a "character" dies, there is genuine pathos. it is difficult to imagine, however, that the three youths are all members of the bloque metro, a gang that used to terrorize la sierra before the colombian government began to restructure the country.<br /><br />la sierra is not an accurate depiction of life in colombia; there are, of course, things to be wary of such as petty crime, but when one considers pickpocketing happens in "modern" cities such as london, new york, or tokyo, colombia doesn't seem that different after all. colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show to the world that the once war-torn country is now prospering more than ever.
