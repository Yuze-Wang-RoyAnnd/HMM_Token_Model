seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie, i figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasn't quite meant to be. i watched the first two fight scenes, listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by lungren, and all of the other thrown-in oriental actors, and i found the movie so awful that it was funny. then brandon lee enters the story and the one-liners start flying, the plot falls apart, the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out it's welcome, as it turns into the worst action movie ever.<br /><br />lungren beats out his previous efforts in "the punisher" and others, as well as all of van damme's movies, seagal's movies, and stallone's non-rocky movies, for this distinct honor. this movie has the absolute worst acting (check out tia carrere's face when she is in any scene with dolph, that's worth a laugh), with the worst dialogue ever (brandon lee's comment about little dolph is the worst line ever in a film), and the worst outfit in a film (dolph in full japanese attire). picture "tango and cash" with worse acting, meets "commando," meets "friday the 13th" (because of the senseless nudity and lungren's performance is very jason voorhees-like), in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a movie.<br /><br />the good (how about not awful) performances go to the bad guy (who still looks constipated through his entire performance) and carrere (who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing). brandon lee is just there being lungren's sidekick, and doing a really awful job at that.<br /><br />an awful, awful movie. fear it and avoid it. if you do watch it though, ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non-underwater shots. speaking of the underwater shots, check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fight-scene-ending ever. this movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fill-in between the flashes of nudity.<br /><br />a bad bad movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
