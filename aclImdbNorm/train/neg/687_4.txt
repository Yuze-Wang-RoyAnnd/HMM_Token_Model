i am a big fan of fred macmurray and carole lombard. and, in addition to them, charles butterworth (a very enjoyable supporting actor) was in this film,...so why didn't i particularly enjoy it?! well, despite a good cast, this is one of the poorest written and most clich'ed "a pictures" i have ever seen. given the talent and money spent to make this film, it is shocking how slip-shod the writing was. i knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film i found myself predicting exactly what would happen next--and i was always right! and this isn't because i am some sort of "movie savant", but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it. in fact, it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clich'es all strung together! also, i found it a bit irritating that fred mistreated carole so bad throughout the film and yet, true to convention, she came running to him in the end. uggh! there is more suspense in a lassie film ("will he bring people to rescue timmy or will the rope he is dangling from break?").<br /><br />despite the very, very tired and clich'ed script, there were a few positives about the film. it was pretty cool seeing fred look like a broken lush at the end of the film--it was pretty believable and he looked like he hadn't eaten, shaved or slept in days. also, charles butterworth's "prattle" did provide a few mildly humorous moments. but all this just wasn't enough to make this film look any different than a "b movie". it's a shame,...it could have been so much better.
