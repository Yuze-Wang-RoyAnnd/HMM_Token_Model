i began watching this movie with my girl-friend. and after 5 minutes i was alone.<br /><br />i succeed to stay until the end. it has been a painful experience.<br /><br />i liked jean hugues anglade, but i think that he needed to eat, as us, and thus he accepted to play in this movie. <br /><br />there are only 5 characters, and the rest could be called 'art' or something that i couldn't express, but that i didn't understand at all.<br /><br />the only worst movie i saw was crash, but i'm pretty sure now that i have enough experience to watch it successfully again.<br /><br />good luck!! ;o)
