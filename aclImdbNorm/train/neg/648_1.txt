the night of the prom: the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic. and so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some head-peckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule lives.<br /><br />there really is no excuse for prom night. there is less than nothing original about it and i truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on imdb. the only part of my viewing that i enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of 'ghosts'. it was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them.<br /><br />the plot was basically some guy going on a rampage. and the thing was, it wasn't even a slightly exciting rampage. maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame robbie williams lookalike with a baseball cap, i might have sat there feeling slightly anxious. the fact that i cared less about the characters than i did about the colour of the cinema carpet didn't really add to the effect, either. and to make matters worse, the rest of the characters were equally one-dimensional and oblivious. the hotel staff didn't seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave. i was incredibly surprised that the bitchy, stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was. she realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs, entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets. nice one.<br /><br />the worst thing was, i hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest. he really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening. shocking! and the music, don't even get me started. it was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral.<br /><br />i really wish that prom night was a joke. it was terrible and stupidly predictable. no one, in their right mind or otherwise, has any reason to see this film. mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation. if you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film, hear my plea. don't do it. there are better things to spend six pounds on. like a sheet to play ghosts with.
