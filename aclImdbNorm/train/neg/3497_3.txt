unfortunately for sarah silverman this show doesn't compliment her at all.the character isn't even remotely likable and it's not a situation where you think "oh she's such i b*tch i love her" just "she's such a b*tch".this character is just a plain old self righteous, mean, b*tch.sarah seems to struggle to have to carry this show because she's the only semi funny one in it.the mood, the dialogue it's all so damn boring and dry it's like listening to your grandpa go on and on about the marbles he collected as a kid.<br /><br />the sarah silverman program is so unbelievably boring that i was thinking of changing the channel to watch old repeats of married with children something that is funny because the characters are so "immoral" and "rude".i'm sorry but i don't find a show packed with dry humour and corny off the wall story lines about some angry, bitter, loser's angry, bitter life with her annoying as hell sister and gay friends who sound like keanu reeves with a cold anywhere close to funny.i can't stand this show even though generally i find sarah silverman to be that "i love her cause she's such a b*tch character" like in school of rock, and most of her stand up.i think this show is boring with characters who think being mean and saying and doing things for shock value eg. the constant pube, diarrhea and $hit in general for laughs.the sarah silverman program attempts to be funny and fails it either needs a laugh track or better writers.someone compared it to south park but it's not even close.i've expressed my opinions on the sarah silverman program and won't become an annoying troll meaning you won't see me being a b*tch and constantly posting stuff like "this show sucks" and "why isn't this cancelled yet".i don't like the sarah silverman program if you do enjoy.
