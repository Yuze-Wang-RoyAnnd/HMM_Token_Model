you'd think the first landing on the moon would be dramatic enough without needing to make up stuff about it. however, this documentary seems to need to cast everything in the scariest possible light. it talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions armstrong's nearly fatal accident with the training vehicle, as if the trainer and the spacecraft had anything to do with each other. it makes the computer overload problem (the 1202 and 1201 alarms) encountered during the final landing sequence sound like a near-catastrophe when it was just an annoyance and not a risk to the crew at all. and it takes the "thirty seconds" call to mean thirty seconds of fuel left before running out, when it's actually thirty seconds before an abort is mandatory.<br /><br />if you want to see a documentary or dramatization of apollo 11, go for "from the earth to the moon" or one of the pbs documentaries, but skip this one.
