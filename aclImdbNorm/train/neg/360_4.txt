i read the book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end. however, when i saw the movie i was very disappointed. first of all, no disrespect to deborah raffin but she was too mature to play a woman of 24/25. the late christopher reeve was also miscast-same reason. will, according to the book,was around 30. i would have love to see a little more exploration of his military life, his friend red, elly's trip to see him as that was an important part of the characters' storyline development. also miss beasley was miscast as the book mentioned her being a plus size lady. i know the movie didn't have the budget of the "bridges of madison county" which i believe was released around the same time. <br /><br />but to me this was a very poorly made, low budget, miscast movie. as someone mentioned, i wish that miss spenser would come out of retirement and write screenplays for her books as they ought to be. she knows her characters better than anyone, i hope that she would consider doing the casting too. the movie let me down!
