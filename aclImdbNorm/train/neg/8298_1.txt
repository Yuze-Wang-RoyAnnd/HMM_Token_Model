this movie was not very entertaining, certainly no where as original or as good as a christmas story. the characters (except the youngest) try to emulate the preceding actors, and they fail. the hillbilly neighbors come out of nowhere as they weren't a part of the first movie. this really sucked, might have been good with the original cast, then again maybe not because the story is so weak. skip it.
