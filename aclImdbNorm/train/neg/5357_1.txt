i don't know where to begin. this movie feels a lot like one of those cheap saturday morning kids shows that they used to make back in the late eighties early nineties. sort of like captain power or the power rangers. it's full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy sounding "secret agencies" and villains.<br /><br />the acting is so bad that it's not even funny. the direction is terrible and there is little to now continuity. it seems as if someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a plot.<br /><br />perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early on, when several villains plant an explosive device in an agents car. for some reason, even though the device is clearly stated as being "remote detonated" the bad guys decide to chase her down on their motorcycles as she drives away. this chase carries on. all the while with the bad guys doing ludicrous and completely pointless bike stunts. standing up on the bikes, doing wheelies and so on. at one point, a crash happens and one of the attackers is thrown from his bike, we see the bike (clearly cgi) thrown over the agents car but the rider has vanished. then, a few seconds later the rider and bike return...apparently unscathed by the crash. at this point even though the car has an explosive device planted in it, the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving past, then blow up her car. which was also clearly done with cgi. sound confusing? it is, and so is the rest of the movie.<br /><br />i might point out that when i say cgi, we aren't talking about lord of the rings type cgi here. we're talking the cheap cheesy power rangers type cgi, actually i think it would have been done better on power rangers.<br /><br />why savini and todd did this movie i will never know, i can only assume they did for money, as a favor to someone or because they were blackmailed into it...probably the last one.
