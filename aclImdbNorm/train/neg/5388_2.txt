there's a good movie lurking here, but this isn't it. the basic idea is good: to explore the moral issues that would face a group of young survivors of the apocalypse. but the logic is so muddled that it's impossible to get involved.<br /><br />for example, our four heroes are (understandably) paranoid about catching the mysterious airborne contagion that's wiped out virtually all of mankind. yet they wear surgical masks some times, not others. some times they're fanatical about wiping down with bleach any area touched by an infected person. other times, they seem completely unconcerned.<br /><br />worse, after apparently surviving some weeks or months in this new kill-or-be-killed world, these people constantly behave like total newbs. they don't bother accumulating proper equipment, or food. they're forever running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere. they don't take elementary precautions when meeting strangers. and after wading through the rotting corpses of the entire human race, they're as squeamish as sheltered debutantes. you have to constantly wonder how they could have survived this long... and even if they did, why anyone would want to make a movie about them.<br /><br />so when these dweebs stop to agonize over the moral dimensions of their actions, it's impossible to take their soul-searching seriously. their actions would first have to make some kind of minimal sense.<br /><br />on top of all this, we must contend with the dubious acting abilities of chris pine. his portrayal of an arrogant young james t kirk might have seemed shrewd, when viewed in isolation. but in carriers he plays on exactly that same note: arrogant and boneheaded. it's impossible not to suspect that this constitutes his entire dramatic range.<br /><br />on the positive side, the film *looks* excellent. it's got an over-sharp, saturated look that really suits the southwestern us locale. but that can't save the truly feeble writing nor the paper-thin (and annoying) characters. even if you're a fan of the end-of-the-world genre, you should save yourself the agony of watching carriers.
