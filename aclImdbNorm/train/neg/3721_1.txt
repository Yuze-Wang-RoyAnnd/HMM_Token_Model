two films are useful for scaring people to god, this and 'event horizon'. one has a significant and poignant message, the other is as one-dimensional as a religious movie can get. too bad paul anderson went on to the accursed resident evil movies, he really had something going.<br /><br />thief in the night is hampered by many obvious independent film attributes (acting, storytelling, dialog, and persuasion) and it's obvious what the film's intentions are from the start. the christian film industry hasn't learned from the failures of this, so we are stuck with the omega code, left behind, and the other tribulation movies. their underlying element is that they are so concerned with selling their message: "get saved, folks!" that everything else becomes second to whacking the audience over the head with a bible.<br /><br />overall, i can't believe i'm even writing this much about a movie this ineffective. skip it entirely and go back to sam neil gouging out his eyeballs. 1 out of 5.
