please do not let the cover of this movie fool you. and if you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at: this isn't it. usually i will go for stupid if it's funny, but this stupid was so stupid it almost (or possibly did) make me stupid.<br /><br />the film quality is better than a handheld, but not by much, and it's quite possible the music was created by pressing the samba 2 key on a casio keyboard. these problems should never really be a deterent from seeing a horror movie but add this amazing (weep) cast, and you have a real humdinger.<br /><br />the story is about a guy who invites his friends up to his family cabin in texas for the weekend. he also extends the invitation to his lady crush in his office. on the way there they meet a female in distress, who is then invited to come along by the other girls.<br /><br />the stay at the cabin includes sex and nudity and soon everyone's panties are in a bunch when one girl disappears and odd items turn up in the house.<br /><br />from there you (the audience) and the morons, um, actors, try to figure out what's going on and they soon begin to distrust one another. overall i think i have made it sound better than it is. the main struggle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped, the plot contrived, the acting bad and the motivations clueless. once more this could be forgiveable it it was the least bit funny but alas, it is not.<br /><br />the twist ending is only a twist in that no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back through the movie it would not have made sense anyway. please don't let this review stop you from seeing the shear wonderment of this movie. (woah, my nose just grew eight inches.)
