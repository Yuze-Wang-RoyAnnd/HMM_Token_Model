i have to admit that over her dead body actually wasn't as bad as i was expecting, my mom wanted to see it, so i rented it. i figured just to go ahead and see the horror before my eyes, but actually this wasn't too bad. i was just expecting this horrific movie, but it seems like the writers meant no harm, but the casting of eva longoria(parker, sorry), she seems a little off set for the movie. i think i may have found it to be a little better without her, just she does annoy me. but paul rudd and lake bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat likable. but you have to admit, there was no point to this movie, it was one of those quick paychecks for the actor type of thing. the movie could've been funnier if someone had really paid attention to it and had a better cast.<br /><br />henry just lost his bride to be, kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day. but when his sister takes him to a psychic, ashley, henry falls for her, but kate is haunting her from beyond the grave. kate is jealous and doesn't want henry to move on so quickly and she will make sure that ashley doesn't get him by torturing her day and night with her rambles, believe me, with kate's voice, that's scary.<br /><br />over her dead body is an alright movie, not sure if it's worth the money, but i'd give it a rental for you if you want to see it or are curious. eva longoria just doesn't have enough star power to make the film work, no offense to those who love her, she just belongs on the small screen over the silver screen. not to mention the character of ashley, she seems still not too likable with everything she pulls, or her "gay" friend, dan, just again, not really likable. just with some re-writing and proper attention, this film could have been better, but instead we get the average predictable romantic comedy that will leave with with an empty feeling.<br /><br />4/10
