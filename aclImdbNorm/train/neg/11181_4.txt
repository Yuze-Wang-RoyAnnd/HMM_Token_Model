the movie is about two stories: one is a political murder of a call-girl, the other an upper-class political party. the crossing point is the public relation character played by al paccino, as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening.<br /><br />if the script is terrible without any decent dialogs and the directing void of any sense of drama, the performance of al is memorable: how many fellows can be as much convincing as a powerful and feared man (as "the godfather") as here as a little servant (see also "donnie brasco").<br /><br />actually, the big young lion has become a tired old one. this passing of ages is very moving, because it makes the audience ponders about getting old too.<br /><br />but his slowness is only a make-up because he can get back his energy in church scene.<br /><br />maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the starlight on al's talent!
