this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. robin williams fit into the part like a rhino would fit into a tutu, even so his performance was still pitiful. kurt russell was more believable but still was awful. the plot left much to be desired and the rest of the acting was also terrible. the only thing this movie had going for it was the trailer, which suckered me in to wasting 90 minutes of my life which could have been better spent trying to lick the back of my head.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you have it. if not, just be happy you don't.
