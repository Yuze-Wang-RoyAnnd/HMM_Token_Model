this is one of those "so bad it is good" films that you always hear about but never see! unlike troma films which are deliberately bad and campy (and i am not amused) this one is 100% pure serious.<br /><br />however with features such as a supposedly super-lethal killer robot that prances about like one of the solid gold dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate that calls down lightning and transforms into the good witch of the east the fact that it takes itself seriously pushes it so far over the edge of bad that makes it full circle around back to entertaining.<br /><br />watcheable enough because of that.
