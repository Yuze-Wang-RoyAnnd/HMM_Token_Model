sugar &spice is one of the worst movies of 2001. the film tries to cross heathers and bring it on and fails . when i saw last january i was so disgusted by the film that i walked and talked on my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie. i've heard that the dvd has a director's cut maybe i'll check it out, but this pg-13 trash movie is s*** and the worst kind of s***. maybe if the film had some t&a that would've have made it okay. but the gags are lame and the acting is horrible. worse than a troma film.
