the point of the vastly extended preparatory phase of this star is born story seems to be to make ultimate success all the more sublime. summer phoenix is very effective as an inarticulate young woman imprisoned within herself but never convincing as the stage actress of growing fame who both overcomes and profits from this detachment. even in the lengthy scenes of esther's acting lessons, we never see her carry out the teacher's instructions. after suffering through esther's (largely self-inflicted) pain in excruciating detail, we are given no persuasive sense of her triumph.<br /><br />the obsessive presence of the heroine's pain seems to be meant as a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence. yet the causes of this pain (poverty, quasi-autism, judaism, sexual betrayal) never come together in a coherent whole. a 163-minute film with a simple plot should be able to knit up its loose ends. esther kahn is still not ready to go before an audience.
