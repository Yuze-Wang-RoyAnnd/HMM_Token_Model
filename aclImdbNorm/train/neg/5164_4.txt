the basic plot in this movie isn't bad. a lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored. but, despite good acting by robert young and eve arden, the movie is a mess. the blame for this i place on either joan crawford or the director or both, as her performance is just awful. instead of being a real person, she does a wonderful impersonation of a deer caught in the headlights. in other words, she stares off into space and has a "golly i am soooo stunned" expression. after just a few minutes it really became annoying for me. now this is certainly not the only crawford film i dislike for her performance, as she had done more than her share of overacting--in films such as johnny guitar or many of her later films, such as berserk! my advice is to try a different crawford film--there certainly were better.
