i was interested in the topic, and only fans of drew barrymore's dancing on david letterman's desk will find anything remotely interesting in it. ok, she shows some breast (or maybe a body double does). the plot is slashed to bits and the acting is horrible. neither lead has any material to work with, as the direction of the film leads nowhere. don't waste your time. see donnie darko instead if you want a creepy drew barrymore film, and if you want to see another, skip this and see darko again.<br /><br />the treatment of the doppelganger legend is absolutely criminal as well. refer to charles williams' novel "descent into hell" for something worth considering instead. this is just an excuse to make a b film to go straight to video and suck some life out of people at blockbuster.<br /><br />what makes any of these people think the acting here was praiseworthy? give me a break.
