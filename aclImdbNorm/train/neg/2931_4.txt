the sitcom "the league of gentlemen" follows the lives of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village "royston vasey". the different scenes are linked together by their common setting.<br /><br />in the first series, a sketch show, the main plot deals with a new road which is going to be built through royston vasey. consequently, more foreigners visit the small town. but edward and tubbs, the owners of a "local" shop, which is actually far away from the town, do not like foreigners. whenever a visitor enters their shop, they kill him. in my opinion some scenes are kind of tasteless and not funny at all, for example, when the couple absorb two engineers who want to build the new road. edward drums, while tubbs is dancing half naked around the victims. <br /><br />moreover pauline lives in royston vasey. she works at the local job centre. although pauline hates the people she has to work with, the woman does not want to loose her job. so when an unemployed man gets an interview as fireman, she does not allow him to go because he is not ready for the job yet.<br /><br />then there is barbara dixton, a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about "her" sexual conversion.<br /><br />furthermore the vet, mr. chinnery, always kills animals instead of curing them. in one case, he comes to a farm and is leaded into the sitting room, where a dog lays in his basket. the farmer goes outside. on the assumption that the dog is the sick animal, mr. chinnery euthanizes him. a second later, the farmer opens the door, holding the "real" sick animal, a sheep, in his hand.<br /><br />some more inhabitants are a husband and his wife who are visited by their nephew (his friend is killed by the shop owners, by the way). the couple is very tidy. they have, for example, towels in different colours. each colour stands for one part of the body. besides, they have thousands of keys, marked with different colours and precisely classified.<br /><br />in my opinion, the actors play very well. by playing women, the scenes become comical. the costumes are suited to the actors, too. tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters, for example edward, have unappetizing black teeth. the show has a great deal of dark humour, typical british. the set design reflects the mood of the series. the village and all the houses look grey and are decayed. around the local shop there is often fog which strengthens the threatening effect. even the village sign is ominous: "welcome to royston vasey. you will never leave."<br /><br />although i think that the actors do a great job, this type of series is not my taste.
