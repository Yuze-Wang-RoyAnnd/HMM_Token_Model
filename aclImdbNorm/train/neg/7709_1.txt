never see this movie.<br /><br />it tries to be a spoof on scifi/thriller films of the 1950s and 1960s but all it succedes at is making you wish really badly that you were watching one of them and not it.<br /><br />it is very lame. a spoof has to have some aspect which has some above par quality to it. this movie does not have any such aspect.<br /><br />save yourself. it's too late for me but... just don't watch it.
