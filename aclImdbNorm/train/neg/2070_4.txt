after too many bad memories, i took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the season 2 sequence. i recently watched it again just to remind me why. i've always considered this the worst st:tng episode (with the exception of "shades of gray," which barely counts as an episode at all).<br /><br />i keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red-penciled by the author's writing 101 teacher: "show, don't tell!" from deanna troi's pronouncement, and everyone else's constant elbowing reminders about what a charming, dangerous rogue okona is, to guinan's explanation about how funny her droid joke is (it isn't), to the who-cares resolution to the conflict, there isn't a plot point that isn't highlighted and triple-underlined for our edification, and there ain't a believable moment in any of it. unfortunately, bill campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is too puppy-dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot. on the other hand, it could be that no one short of john barrowman (jack harkness from "doctor who") could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role.<br /><br />(zero points, by the way, to the data subplot. while i think joe piscopo stopped being funny decades ago, he and brent spiner had nothing to work with here. although the jerry lewis bit was funny in a stupid way.)<br /><br />on a good day, you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser original series episode. me, i'd rather skip ahead to "time squared" or "q who."
