i went to see this film at the cinemas and i was shocked when i got in the room. there was only me and my girlfriend! this shouted to me that this film is not very good. <br /><br />not to my surprise, the film was dire. ben affleck plays a guy who buys a family for christmas. it is a very predictable narrative with him falling in love with the girl that hates him. his acting is okish but for the comedy aspect of the film he is not very good. the plot line is poor and the comedy almost non-existent.<br /><br />however, there are some good points. for example, the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny.<br /><br />i hope this review stops other people wasting their money. i was very embarrassed when i came out of the room!!!
