had the original casting idea been kept (hunting rutger, not ice-t), this movie might have worked. sadly, racism had to come into the picture (literally) and mess it up. the predominantly black production staff couldn't allow the antagonist be black, so they swapped rutger's and ice-t's roles. this was only the start of the downward spiral of this film. ernest dickerson's news-room approach to 'directing' only verified that this was another affirmative-action job assignment. master shot, close up, close up. gads, 'who's line is it anyway' even uses more creative camera work. eric's rewrite of 'the most dangerous game' is at least an attempt at modernizing the classic tale, but fails to give us any motivations for why the characters are doing this. we are never given the reasons, other than "no one will miss these people", why the leader (re-written as rutger) does these things. aside from a heart-felt performance by john mcginley, and a fair job by charles dutton, do not bother with this one. one small bit of trivia, there was a real drunk-driving accident during filming that injured f.murray abraham, and resulted in the death of the intoxicated young driver that caused the accident.
