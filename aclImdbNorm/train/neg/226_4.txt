andie mcdowell is beautiful as the 40-ish woman whose late start at a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequenet falling-out with 2 long-time best girldfriends.<br /><br />seeing a gigolo/gold-digger in the sincere young man, the "girl-friends", dead-set on terminating this "silly relationship", go over and beyond the call of duty in "helping out" their friend (who obviously is blinded by this gigolo's tricky game".<br /><br />a short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous. far fetched no longer covers it. without these unbelievable scenes, there may have been hope for a sweet love story. instead, all the viewer is left with is an involuntary shaking of head -- these things just don't happen! without giving away cliff-hanger details, i warn the viewer of having high expectations for this film; most (like me) will be very disappointed. on a scale of 1 to 10, this one ranks a weak 4 with me. there is much better material out there. this one isn't worth your time.
