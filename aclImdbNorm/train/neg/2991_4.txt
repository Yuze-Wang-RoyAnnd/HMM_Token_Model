i am an avid fan of lucio fulci, and yet i must say that "zombi 3" (aka. "zombie flesh eaters 2") of 1988, which he made with two other directors, bruno mattei and claudi fragasso, was quite a disappointment. especially compared to its great predecessor, fulci's very own gore classic "zombi 2" (aka. "zombie felsh eaters"/"zombie") of 1979, this is vastly disappointing. sure, the low rating of 4.5 already suggests that it's not a good film, but, these low ratings usually come from people who are not into italian zombie flicks, and as enthusiastic fan of italian horror films and low-budget exploitation cinema, i love many films that have only been rewarded with much lower ratings. also, many of my fellow italian horror buffs seem to think of this film as underrated, which i sadly cannot agree with. not that the film was a complete disaster. it has some redeeming qualities, above all fulci's nauseating gore effects, that are always a pleasure to watch for an italian horror/gore buff. the basic idea behind the film is also not bad (allthough far from original) and i liked the ruthless portrayal of the military. sadly, that's about it. while the great predecessor "zombi 2" was extremely gory, but beyond that also genuinely creepy, this is not creepy or scary for a minute, and the nauseating and often grotesque gore is the only true reason to watch "zombi 3". the film is sometimes fun to watch, but only for the gore, and as an unintentional comedy. i guess that it was mainly the gore that came from fulci, and the disappointing rest that came from mattei and fragasso, the first of which was involved in a bunch of nasty cult-flicks (such as d'amato's "porno holocaust"), and the second of which is responsible for one of the worst movies ever made, the god-awful "troll 2". overall, this is definitely watchable for the gore, but, out of all fulci films i've seen so far, this is definitely the worst, and i've seen the majority of this great filmmaker's repertoire. i am a fulci fan, and i always will be, but this sure isn't his magic moment. it may be fun for the gore, but i recommend to watch any other fulci film before this!
