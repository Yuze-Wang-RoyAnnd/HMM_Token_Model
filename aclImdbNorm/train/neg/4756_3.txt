a remake of the superb 1972 movie of the stage play, nicely casting caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie. but doing nothing else nicely at all.<br /><br />a under-parr performance from the actors, law and caine, diluted further by weak self-indulgent direction.<br /><br />the warmth of the setting in the original is forsaken for a super-modern homesetting. the subtle interplay between oliver and caine which made the first movie so watchable, is replaced with a horrid, brash arrogance that instantly breeds disdain in the viewer. but this is not the clever, to-ing and froing of liking one then the other character the original fostered so well, this is an obvious ott character assassination of both character from the word go.<br /><br />this version of sleuth is not really worth seeing, watch the original film and be dazzled from the opening act.
