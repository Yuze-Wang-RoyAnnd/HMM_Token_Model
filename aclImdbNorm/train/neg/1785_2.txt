.... and after seeing this pile of crap you won't be surprised that it wasn't published <br /><br />!!!! spoilers !!!!<br /><br />this is a terrible movie by any standards but when i point out that it's one of the worst movies that has the name stephen king in the credits you can start to imagine how bad it is . the movie starts of with two characters staring open mouthed at a scene of horror : <br /><br />" my god . what happened here ? " <br /><br />" i don't know but they sure hate cats " *<br /><br />the camera pans to the outside of a house where hundreds of cats are strung up dead and mutilated . boy this guy is right , someone does hate cats and with a deduction like that he should be a policeman . oh wait a minute , he is a policeman and when a movie starts with a cop making an oh so obvious observation you just know you're going to be watching a bad movie <br /><br />the reason sleepwalkers is bad is that it's very illogical and confused . we eventually find out the monsters of the title need the blood of virgins to survive . would they not be better looking for a virgin in the mid west bible belt rather than an american coastal town ? having said that at least we know of the monsters motives - that's the only thing we learn . we never learn how they're able to change shape or are able to make cars become invisible and this jars with the ending that seems to have been stolen from the terminator . monster mother walks around killing several cops with her bare hands or blowing them up via a police issue hand gun ( ! ) but if her monster breed is immune from police fire power then why do the creatures need the ability to change shape or become invisible ? the demise of the creatures is equally ill thought out as there killed by a mass attack of household cats . if they can be killed by cats then why did the monsters not kill all the cats that were lying around the garden ? there was a whole horde of moggies sitting around but the monsters never thought about killing them . i guess that's so the production team can come up with an ending . it was that they started the movie my complaint lies <br /><br />we're treated to several scenes where famous horror movie directors like john landis , clive barker and even stephen king make cameos . i think the reason for this is because whenever a struggling unknown actor read the script they instantly decided that no matter what , they weren't going to appear in a movie this bad so stephen king had to phone up his horror buddies in order to fill out the cast . that's how bad sleepwalkers is<br /><br />* unbelievable as it seems that wasn't the worst line in the movie . the worst line is - " that cat saved my life "
