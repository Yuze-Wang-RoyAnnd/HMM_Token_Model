ok this movie was made for one reason and one reason only to make money!!the producers obviously didn't care about killing a classic horror movie. i knew this movie would suck as soon as it was going to be a pg-13 how many pg-13 slashers movies have turned out to be good? thats like asking how many women have been on the moon? the answer is none!! prom night 1980 was of cource no masterpiece but it certainly deserves to be recognised as a movie that stays true to its genre and deosnt try to be anything more than that.<br /><br />my problem with prom night 2008 is the way that it handles the killer and i have 3 major problems with him.....................<br /><br />1)the way he escapes, he was locked up in a mental institute and he escapes through a air conditioning vent!! what the hell? why would they have an air conditioning vent in the patients room? do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something? 2)his intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer want all of the main victims family and friends dead so he can have her all to his self, he says he loves her but the next minute he trys to kill her, so does he want to kill her, love her or just plain rape her?? 3) the killer is too good, how did he develop all of his skills? he used to be a teacher, so in this one scene where he kills the main victims boyfriend while hes basically on top of her asleep and she doesn't notice, it all silly 2 stars out of 10 terrible,silly,stupid attempt at a horror movie
