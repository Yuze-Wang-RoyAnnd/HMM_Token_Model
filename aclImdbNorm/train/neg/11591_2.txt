this film is so incredibly bad, that i almost felt sick watching it. up until this point, the other installments had at least one good thing about it. part 1 was suspenseful and gory. part 2 was off beat and entertaining. part 3 was interesting with great effects. part 4 had great music, good special effects, and a new entertaining freddy krueger. part 5 is more boring than anything i've ever seen before. alice, a much prettier blond, from part 4 is back with her boyfriend dan. at parts, this supposed elm street installment turns into a daytime soap. the newer characters seem harsh, and even that sweet alice has a chip on her shoulder. freddy seems to be completely out of this one. he looks tired, and doesn't seem to be as gruesome. his one-liners seem out of place and different, where as in part 4 they could be pretty funny. leslie bohem's story never gets off the ground and stephen hopkins' direction is so bad, that it makes my grandmother look good! the whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic. it's also confusing and pretty stupid. avoid part 5 at all costs!
