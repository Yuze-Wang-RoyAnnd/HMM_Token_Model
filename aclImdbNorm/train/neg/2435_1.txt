i will warn you here: i chose to believe those reviewers who said that this wasn't an action film in the usual sense, rather a psychological drama so you should appreciate it on that basis and you will be alright.<br /><br />i am here to tell you that they were wrong. completely wrong.<br /><br />well, no, not completely; it is very disappointing if you are looking for an action flick, they were right about that. but it is also very unsatisfying on all other levels as well.<br /><br />tom beringer wasn't too bad, i suppose, no worse than usual; but what possessed them to cast billy zane in this? was it some sort of death wish on the part of the producers? a way to made their film a guaranteed flop? in that case, it worked.<br /><br />if they were actually aiming for success, then why not cast somebody who can act? oh, and might as well go for a screenwriter who knows how to write. ah, yes, and a director who knows how to direct.<br /><br />as someone who sat through this mess, actually believing it would shortly redeem itself, i can assure you it never did. pity, it could've been a good film.
