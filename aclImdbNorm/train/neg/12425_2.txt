i don't know what you guys are inhaling, but please stop. this movie was complete trash.<br /><br />macaulay culkin as kevin mccallister was lovable, cute, sweet, loving, and extremely fun to watch. he had that innocence but at the same time, he was strong as well.<br /><br />this new kid, alex? annoying as all hell! just a blatant ripoff at trying to match culkin's charm and grace, failing miserably at that.<br /><br />the villains, complete crap. harry and marv, they were such an entertaining on screen team. they were comedic, they were humorous, and just made you really want to root for culkin even more, which is what a good villain is suppose to do. these guys joe pesci and daniel stern, absolutely perfect for those roles. on the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots that just bicker and again, try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains. not saying they were horrible, but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining. more on the corny side actually.<br /><br />then we got the actual movies. part 1 and 2, classics. memorable. perfect to watch around christmas and brings a wonderful christmas feeling and brings out so many emotions. it makes you fall in love with the story, and care about the characters. simply, memorable and close to being masterpieces. part 3? masterpiece of crap. enough said.<br /><br />all and all, i don't know why people like this. i think people really don't know what a good movie is anymore. its a crappy sequel rip-off with more unrealistic traps and a stupid new main character kid that i wish the robbers would of at least beat the crap out of.<br /><br />run, run away from this garbage. and lets not even start with part 4!
