songwriter robert taylor (as terry) is "dizzy, slap-happy" and can't see straight over otherworldly norma shearer (as consuelo). "she makes the sun shine, even when it's raining," mr. taylor explains. but, mr. taylor gets a lump in his throat whenever he gets near ms. shearer. finally, at the palm beach casino shearer frequents, taylor proclaims "i love you!" shearer brushes him off, as she is engaged to george sanders (as tony). however, to settle a gambling debt, shearer hires taylor to pose as "her cardboard lover", to make mr. sanders jealous.<br /><br />this film's title invites the obvious and appropriate three-word review: "her cardboard movie". it is most notable as the last film appearance for shearer, one of the biggest stars in the world from "he who gets slapped" (1924, playing another consuelo) to "the women" (1939). to be fair, this was likely the kind of shearer film mgm believed audiences wanted to see. however, the part is unflattering.<br /><br />plucked and powered, taylor and shearer were better off in "the escape" (1940). if shearer had continued, she might have become a better actress than "leading lady"; apparently, she was no longer interested, and certainly didn't need the money. taylor has a great scene, reciting christina rossetti's "when i am dead, my dearest" while threatening to jump from shearer's balcony, as directed by george cukor.<br /><br />**** her cardboard lover (6/42) george cukor ~ norma shearer, robert taylor, george sanders
