i haven't read a single imdb comment for this movie that mentions how the jewish character in this movie jumped up and down like a little baby as a gun is pointed in his face by a racist skinhead while the movie's lead black character looked in sternness down the barrel of a gun.<br /><br />i don't know how anyone could perceive this as a balanced account of university life. i agree universities are not bastions of tolerance like they are supposed to be and the title would be fitting if singleton didn't make his characters such broad caricatures.<br /><br />on the surface he tries to portray ice cube's character as a bad guy, provoking remy to become a racist skinhead. but who graduates at the end in the movie's redeeming epilogue? it seems singleton points at white as either unable to empathize (i didn't say sympathize!) with his fellow black student or only able to take the path of a racist skinhead. many people who have been bullied by people of another race do not turn to extreme bigotry.<br /><br />nor do women who have been raped immediately turn to lesbianism, which is portrayed more as a cult than a lifestyle. quite honestly what was the point?
