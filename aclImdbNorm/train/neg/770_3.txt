the stranger jack (matthew lillard) arrives in the studio of the crook collector of antiques max (vincent d'onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in poisons jamie (valeria golino) that he is jack's brother. jamie does not buy his story, dominates jack and ties him up to a chair. when max arrives, jack proposes us$ 100,000.00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiques "spanish judges" with a wealthy and dangerous collector. max invites his stupid acquaintance piece (mark boone junior), who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from mars, to compose the backup team. however, jack double-crosses the collector and then he intrigues jack, jamie and piece.<br /><br />the low budget "spanish judges" is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast. valeria golino is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor vincent d'onofrio, they are not able to save the stupid story. further, the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work, and actually they are silly and not funny. my vote is three.<br /><br />title (brazil): "tudo por dinheiro" ("all for money")
