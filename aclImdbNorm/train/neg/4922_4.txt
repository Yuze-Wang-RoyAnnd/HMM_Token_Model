dracula 2000 is a horror film that was continually shown on sky movies in britain and considering it seemed to be screened about three times a week for a whole year i have absolutely no idea how i managed to miss it until it`s first broadcast on network television tonight . actually seeing as i`m not much of a fan of horror movies the reason was probably down to my theory that this was going to be tripe . my theory was proved right for the most part <br /><br />!!!!! minor spoilers !!!!!<br /><br />what makes dracula 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of dumb scripting involved . for example early in the film the bad guys are flying dracula`s coffin from london to america ( in a twin engine turbo prop plane ! ) and one of the bad guys is left alone in the cargo hold where dracula comes to life . a fight breaks out , there`s lots of noise but the bad guys in the cockpit don`t hear a sound until the script demands it . it also appears in this segment`s climax that dracula can control the weather but this seems forgotten about as the film progresses . sloppy scripting , and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where there`s numerous scenes of characters being at the new orleans mardi gras then the characters being at a different location such as police station in the following scene then they`re back at the mardi gras the scene after that which means the lack of credibilty in the plot is enhanced <br /><br />there`s something else that yanked my chain - product placement . there`s umpteen scenes where the logo for a certain record label/retailer chain is in full view . i won`t dare publicise the company brand ( except to say they also run a train company which is a national joke in britain ) but i was under the impression this type of advertising was against british broadcasting guidlines and i`m surprised the bbc showed this movie if that`s the case <br /><br />there are some positives in dracula 2000 like the visuals for example . this is actually a good looking movie with a good looking cast and boy were those vampire chicks hot , but it`s something we should expect from hollywood over the last few years - a very good looking movie that`s very dumb
