meanwhile, all the real action is happening inside.<br /><br />someone whips out a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation off-screen and there's one more casualty that happens that's... well, kinda sad. but...<br /><br />faye dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach, improving on her new orleans accent. skeet ullrich is fine in a smaller part.<br /><br />a cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look. and so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield. <br /><br />the dialouge is obviously trying to go for a david mamet approach and it's as profane, but never as realistic or as insightful.<br /><br />the movie feels like too much of what it really is... a really low-budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that's "not bad, but needs a few more re-writes." spacey shows he's not a terrible director, but he lacks a sort of feel for "shaping a movie" and it feels like he's just filming actors act.<br /><br />these actors are all talented and could work with the material, but they all feel out of place. as i said before, the movie really suffers from miscasting. <br /><br />i don't mean that the wrong actors were cast. i think they found just the right cast, but placed them in all the wrong roles. i think switching some of the roles would've helped immensely.<br /><br />having veteran mob actor joe mantagna play the leader of the pack, gary sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops, keeping fischter in his "bloodthirsty goon" part and matt dillion as the sacrificial lamb. that would have been a big improvement.<br /><br />when some actors direct, it works. they can even win oscars for it. but a lot of the time, when actors direct, they have a tendency to just focus on the performances. just shoot the actors acting.<br /><br />sometimes it works... but they need a good showcase for it. an excuse for it.<br /><br />hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like coming-of-age stories so it's only natural that movies about them will go from point a to point b as well.<br /><br />there are a few really great entries into this genre.' spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations: "the negotiator."<br /><br />this certainly won't become a cult classic, let alone one of afi's 100. still, it does have a few nice moments and personal touches, but in the end, it's instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular tv. it's just not worth going out of your way to see.<br /><br />i give a 3 out of 10. <br /><br />spacey's other directorial credit, "beyond the sea" was reportedly a better effort. hmmm... maybe it's true. you need to fail before you succeed.<br /><br />by dane youssef
