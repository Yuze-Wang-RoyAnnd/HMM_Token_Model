oh my god. the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old. the plot, the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace.<br /><br />i am not usually this critical about any movie, cause every person has his/her style. but this movie, however, was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008. i can honestly believe that this movie is unknown, and i think it should stay like this, for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke.<br /><br />i advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies, or even simply movies to stay far away from this one.
