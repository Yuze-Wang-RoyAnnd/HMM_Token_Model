i had high hopes for this film, because i thought clean, shaven (kerrigan's first feature) was absolutely terrific, the most assuredly cinematic low budget film i'd ever seen.<br /><br />but much of claire dolan is utterly pointless and flat. scene after scene seems randomly tossed into the mix, without much thought for narrative or character.<br /><br />is claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not? hard to tell. why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life? why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in seattle? why do we have to see her dye her hair to what is virtually the exact same color? why does claire accept some johns and not others? the filmmaker doesn't seem to know.<br /><br />it feels as if everything is improvised (though i understand this wasn't the case) and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a verite documentary.<br /><br />after the screening i saw, kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narrative as politically conservative. it sounded like learned rhetoric. i think it was a cop-out.<br /><br />i am saddened that the maker of a film as exciting as clean, shaven would go on to make such a lame film as this one and then defend it with tired old "political" cliches.
