i don't remember seeing another murder/mystery movie as bad as this. this movie, about a medical examiner who investigates his friend's mysterious death in a car accident, has the complete receipt for a bad movie: bad acting, boring story, lack of suspense, poor humor and no drama. i remembered seeing this movie on pax, a tv station notable for dishing out low-budgeted and campy made-for-tv movies such as this one. tv movies, of course, do not have the edge factor or the suspense as movies from the big screen. but, this movie sure hit all sour tastes. the makers of this movie have missed out on an opportunity to making "receipe for murder" a great tv movie; the title does offer some suspense.<br /><br />so, if you want a good recipe, don't watch this movie. this movie alone can kill your tv appetite.<br /><br />grade f
