don't see this. this was one of the dumbest movies i have ever seen. its hard to be mormon sometimes when there are movies like this out there. what a sad view of mormon life. i can tell you if you did see this movie that it is not all like this at all in a singles ward. if it was i don't think i would have made it through it. its too bad that most mormon movies are made by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do. the acting was so bad that my wife and i barely made it through. i guess you could say that it had all the signs of a b movie. or are there c movies? anyway...i just thought this movie sucked and was full of cheese. i wish some mormons would start making some quality movies.
