this is, without a doubt, the single worst movie ever created. there's no arguing here. this is it. end of story. the story is juvenile and sub-moronic, looking like it was created by a three-year-old fascinated with dinosaurs. the entire concept is just plain dumb. it's inconceivable how someone could possibly come up with something so stupid and think it was entertaining. the jokes are also completely lame. if you haven't seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. if your morbidly curious as to how bad this movie is, please don't make me describe it. words can't express how completely awful this movie is. this isn't just bad as in being a bad movie. even those have cohesion, if not entertainment value. this. . . this is. . . ugh! think of the worst story ever told and multiply its badness level by 5,000, and you still haven't come close to how awful this movie is. after giving pokemon the movie one point, giving this movie one point seems like nothing short of charity. that's how bad it is. did the producers and directors even take film classes? because this is a perfect example of how not to make a film. it looks like some amateur high on paint thinner made this film. if you rented this, please take it back and ask for a refund. and don't even think about renting it again.
