"mad dog time"..."trigger happy" whatever you wanna call it...simply doesn't hit the mark. maybe its just me, maybe i just don't like gangster comedies ( as i thought oscar , johney dangerously and mafia also sucked ) it's probably more "witty sharp wordplay" than all out comedy, only its not as witty and sharp as it ( or the other reviewers )make it out to be. <br /><br />the rick , mick , vic thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch. <br /><br />there wasn't enough changes of location or feel for the period they were supposed to be in. the majority of the film was either set in "dreyfus's club" or a variety of offices /dim rooms... ( what was with that sit down gun stand off thing goldblum kept winning ?) <br /><br />the supporting cast was... on paper excellent ( great to see silva & drago)but characters were killed off before they had time to develop. and richard pryors cameo was a joke ! the romance and love element of the film also bogged it down.<br /><br />4/10 i don't think i'll return to it anytime soon.
