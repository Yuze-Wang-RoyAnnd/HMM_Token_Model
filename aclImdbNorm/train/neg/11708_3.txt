blows my mind how this movie got made. i watched it while i worked at home writing emails and answering the phone -- i only watched it because i hoped the "revenge" part would be good. needless to say, the revenge and the forced plot twists were not worth the emails during which they were watched. in fact, i'm not even sure what happened at the end any more. the acting was as bad as re-enactment scenarios on the "fbi files" show -- by far, the worst re-enactments (really only "arrest and trial" can possibly be as bad at re-enactments). i didn't even know that the leading man was in third eye blind until i looked the movie up here on imdb, but its obvious why he hasn't made any movies since. i hope he is a good singer.
