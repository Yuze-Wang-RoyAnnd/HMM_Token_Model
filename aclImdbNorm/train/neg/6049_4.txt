first off, anyone who thinks this sequel to william friedkin's "the french connection", is superior is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both. the problem with reviewing this film is that, a.) it's a sequel to a brilliant movie, which always makes watching it objectively difficult, and b.) it's directed by john frankenhimer, one of the best american directors ever, so i wanted to like it. william friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film about drug traffic in decaying new york city, because of his documentary-like approach to the action and story, frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish directors ever, i.e. "the manchurian candidate" and "seconds", and with his "french connection 2" it feels like someone trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off. that fact that frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel by gene hackman himself really tells a lot about hackman's understanding about the original film too. it's well known hackman hated friedkin on the set and vowed to never work with him again, it's also known he envisioned the character to be more one dimensional, loosing weight and trying to play him like a straight character. it shows you hackman, despite being a great actor, had no idea who to make the movie and the story great. the plot point of doyle becoming an addict is interesting, but doesn't warrant the rest of the film. an unfortunate low point in frankenhimer's filmography.
