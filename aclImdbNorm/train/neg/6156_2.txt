this is a bad, bad movie. i'm an actual fencer: trust me when i say that this film's pretension of accuracy is just that. this is especially true during that vile little scene when the fencers are combining footwork with 80's pop. the ending is predictable, and the movie is a bore from start to finish. horrible.
