i don't remember "barnaby jones" being no more than a very bland, standard detective show in which, as per any quinn martin show, act i was the murder, act ii was the lead character figuring out the murder, act iii was the plot twist (another character murdered), act iv was the resolution and the epilogue was betty (lee meriwether) asking her father-in-law barnaby jones (buddy ebsen) how he figured out the crime and then someone saying something witty at the end of the show.<br /><br />one thing i do remember was the late, great composer jerry goldsmith's excellent theme song. strangely, the opening credit sequence made me want to see the show off and on for the seven seasons the show was on the air. i will also admit that it was nice to see ebsen in a role other than jed clampett despite ebsen being badly miscast. i just wished the show was more entertaining than when i first remembered it.<br /><br />update (1/11/2009): i watched an interview with composer jerry goldsmith on youtube through their archive of american television channel. let's just say that i was more kind than goldsmith about the show "barnaby jones."
