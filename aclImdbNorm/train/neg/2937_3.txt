an attempt at crossover to appeal to those who don't appreciate opera, exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time, it fails badly. all that is desirable in this movie is the opera, and one can best find a recording of pavarotti doing what he does best. the plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his throat which has suddenly become troublesome. <br /><br />only because it came out so long ago is it largely forgotten. like most opera stars, pavarotti is a decent actor and has stage presence aside from his singing talent, and nothing that he does in this movie negates that opinion. his culpability lies in not rejecting the horrid script. perhaps because great operas can have silly stories he tolerated this one.<br /><br />who knows, except those involved? do we need to know? <br /><br />the plot is weak and trite. this movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick off a few juicy tidbits (the opera music) hanging above the mud. we have other ways in which to appreciate the great pavarotti, and this one isn't one of them. just get one of his many superb opera or vocal-concert recordings and recognize the master tenor where he is most suited.<br /><br />it would be one of imdb's 100 worst films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes; it would fit neatly in a list including several efforts of singers, actors, models, and athletes to exploit their popularity through film. very often it all goes badly wrong due to incompetent acting or a horrible script. pavarotti would have been a decent actor had he not shown such a superb voice. however effective he is as an actor (opera requires it), not even jimmy stewart could have rescued this turkey of a script.<br /><br />i give it a polite 3 of 10 because someone may have become a fan of pavarotti's singing and of opera because of this movie.
