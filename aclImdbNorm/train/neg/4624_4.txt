this beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons. 1) perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking, but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android. 2) it wasn't an android at all, but a woman, the beautiful jean marsh.<br /><br />the popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins back to this episode if they'd done it properly. in fact, the modernization of sex-bots are in the news as i speak.<br /><br />robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made, so they could have at least had her act like one. her fleshiness would then have added a creepy element. instead, it becomes a nice little love story about two humans on faraway star.<br /><br />the twilight zone always stretched the imagination and credulity. normally no one cared. but this episode seemed hamstrung by a calvinist morality eschewing what would have amounted to masturbation with a machine, or downright carelessness.
