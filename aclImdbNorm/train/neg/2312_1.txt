this is one of those movies where i wish i had just stayed in the bar.<br /><br />the film is quite frankly boring. what story there is is very flimsy and you pretty much have to guess at it. the film indulges itself with pretentious camera techniques that seem intent on causing migraines and makes it look like a student film. did i say it was boring already? if all the characters had suddenly died at the end of the movie i would not have cared less as i had no emotional attachment to any of them.<br /><br />there are about 4 good minutes in this movie, but that was about it. this is the first time i have ever considered walking out of a cinema during a performance, but i held on believing that it had to get better. i was wrong.<br /><br />the sort of film you could threaten naughty children with.
