- a small time hood tricks the local mob boss out of a lot of money. of course the mob boss wants his money back and doesn't care who he has to kill to get it. the punk enlists his friend and an old mobster to help him save his life.<br /><br />- if this sounds ridiculous, it is. the whole idea that this izod-wearing, dune buggy-driving punk could hold off one of the most powerful mobs in rome is just plain silly. his friend may be good with a gun, but he's up against a group of trained killers. the old mobster is little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to the face off with the mob. there's also a sub-plot about how the friend's father was killed years ago by the mob boss, but there's little made of it and it doesn't help the movie any at all.<br /><br />- the mob boss, mister scarface, is played by jack palance. i suppose he got the name because he has what looks like a shaving nick on his cheek. palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast, doing what he must to get a paycheck.<br /><br />- i've seen some pretty good italian crime/cop flicks recently, but mister scarface isn't one of them. check out syndicate sadists or revolver instead.
