the "documentary", and we use that term loosely apparently, summarizes that muslims are trying to violently take over the world. then states that any muslim that doesn't admit this is either ignorant of their own faith or lying to your face! also every person that is interviewed in the film has found a market for their ludicrous take on reality by selling claptrap to conservatives willing to let others do the thinking for them. what the west needs to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental midgets. if you are looking for an actual documentary on islam and the current state of the middle-east i would look elsewhere. try something that provides multiple points of view from qualified sources.
