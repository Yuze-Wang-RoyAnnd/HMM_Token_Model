the truth is that a film based on a harold robbins novel is not going to win any awards. this is no exception. "the lonely lady" is a pure b picture in budget, cast and execution. technically, it looks like a made-for-tv film. the acting is very uneven. joseph cali is especially terrible. anthony holland is an embarrassment. as one reviewer said of a certain katherine hepburn performance, her range goes from a to b. ms zedora manages to get to g. the rest of the cast is solid (and wasted in their respective roles). lloyd bochner and bibi besch deserved better. still, the whole thing can be a great deal of fun in a trashy sort of way. as befits robbins, everything revolves around sex and nudity. if you're looking for some fun...and you're not too sober...this could be for you.
