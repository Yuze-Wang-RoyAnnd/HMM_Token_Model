this movie lacked... everything: story, acting, surprise, ingenuity and a soul. fifteen minutes in, i was staring at the screen saying, "how could all of these guys get together and consider themselves friends (even without the girl)?" another fifteen minutes in, i was praying for as much amanda peet as possible. when a bad movie quietly rears it's ugly head, eye candy is a nice consolation. but there wasn't much of that! cheated on all fronts!
