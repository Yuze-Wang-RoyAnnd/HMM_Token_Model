why else would he do this to me?<br /><br />not that i expect dean cain to produce hit movies. or even decent movies. i saw lois and clark, i am aware of just how... "good" dean cain is.<br /><br />obviously this is gonna be a cheesey flick, and each cheesey flick has its own special way to make you scratch your head. i will not call these spoilers as you can't really spoil this movie any more than it already is.<br /><br />to begin with... why is that a fake helicopter? i mean... why?<br /><br />how come that one scientist is from chicago and that other scientist is from la and neither one could be any more eastern european if they tried? how hard would it have been to get either an american actor, or just change that lame state sheet the movie provides us with to say those people aren't american?<br /><br />why are there 2 occasions when the movie gives us a slug line? we get helipad-day and then mess hall-day later on. and then that's it, who cares about the timeline. to be honest, who cared about it even when they mentioned it, but i guess that's beside the point.<br /><br />does a movie really get better if you are able to view it through multiple split screens? the answer is no.<br /><br />that dragon sure can walk down that hall..over..and over...and over....and over...<br /><br />who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings in film history? it was straight out of scooby doo. oh, the dragon's dead now...say, wanna get dinner? sure, but not at some chinese place....with dragon in the name!! ah ha ha ha!! ha ha ha!! haha ha! i used to be superman! aha ha ha! ha ha!<br /><br />fade to black<br /><br />my god, it made me cringe it was so stupid.<br /><br />but never fear..even though the whole building exploded...and no one was left alive..for some reason there's a second untouched, unmanned lab that survived pretty well, so they can make a sequel. hurray for us all.<br /><br />
