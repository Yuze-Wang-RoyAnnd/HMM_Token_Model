i can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film. i was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. on the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. ben g fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. dorothy s fans should stick to galaxina. peter b fans should stick to last picture show and target. fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to peter b's amazingly awful book, killing of the unicorn.
