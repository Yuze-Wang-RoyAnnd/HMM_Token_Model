a group of friends come face-to-face with a family of hideous cannibals whilst camping in the beautiful german countryside.<br /><br />the 'mutant cannibal family' concept is almost as old as the hills that the inbred freaks often call home, so any director attempting to breath new life into the genre needs to come up with something pretty darn special in order to impress. with barricade, timo rose tries to give the well-worn routine a teutonic twist, by transplanting the action to the black forest and giving it the german low-budget splatter treatment. the result is a very bloody, but totally unoriginal effort that is made almost unwatchable thanks to some dreadful directorial decisions
