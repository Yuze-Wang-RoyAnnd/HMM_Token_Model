just cause showcases sean connery as a harvard law prof, kate capshaw (does she still get work?) as his wife (slight age difference) and lawrence fishburne as a racist southern cop (!) and ed harris in a totally over the top rendition of a fundamentalist southern serial killer.<br /><br />weird casting, but the movie plays serious mindf** with the audience. (don't read if you ever intend to seriously watch this film or to ever watch this film seriously due to the spoilers) first of all, i felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the liberal stereotypes: the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no evidence. the coroner, witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him (he is accused of the rape and murder of a young girl) because he is black.<br /><br />connery is a harvard law prof who gives impassioned speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbarous death penalty. he is approached by the convicted man's grandmother to defend him and re-open the trial.<br /><br />connery is stonewalled (yawn...) by the small town officials and the good il' boys club but finds that the case against blair, the alleged killer, now on death row, was all fabricated. the main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of him.<br /><br />the beating was administered by a black cop (!) who even played russian roulette to get the confession out of him. connery finds out that another inmate on death row actually did the murder and after a few tete a tetes with a seriously overacting, hannibal lecter-like ed harris, he finds out where harris hid the murder weapon.<br /><br />he gets a re-trial and blair is freed.<br /><br />i think... film over....<br /><br />then suddenly! it turns out that blair is a psychotic psycho and that he used "white guilt" to enlist connery. he concocted the story with ed harris in return for blair carrying out a few murders for harris.<br /><br />now blair is on the loose again, thanks to connery's deluded pc principles! the final 30 min. are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama, connery and fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts (yes, you read that right) in the everglades.<br /><br />that was one weird film.<br /><br />so the whole system is corrupt and inefficient, the cops are all just bullies and abu graib type torturers, but the criminals are really psychotics and deserve to fry.<br /><br />truly depressing on every level! the system is completely rotten and the pc white guilt types who challenge it are seriously deluded too.<br /><br />two thumbs down. connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something.
