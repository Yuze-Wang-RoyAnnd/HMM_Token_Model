and a few more "no"s on top of that. voodoo academy is, without a doubt, the least ambitious film of all time. what exactly is it trying to do? tell a story? obviously not; as has been pointed out, most of it's just barely-legal guys rubbing themselves. could it, then, be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism? well, maybe, if not for the fact it never ever ever goes beyond the most innocuous and nonthreatening forms of male contact. (which is, to the delight of none, repeated about eighty thousand times.) well, it is sort of a horror movie; is it trying to scare us? not unless the director meant to do so through the utter tedium and vacuousness of his "work."<br /><br />never in my life have i enjoyed a movie less. this is the most boring and unnecessary thing i've ever seen. it's like voodoo academy takes the genres of horror, zombie, and gay movies, puts them in a grinder, then runs them through a coffee filter--only instead of it being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans, it's the kind that takes out everything vital, edgy, or in any way interesting. the result is 74 minutes of film every bit as exciting as a glass of warm water--only without the ability to rehydrate you after the 10-day gin binge that will inevitably befall you if you watch this abomination of human effort.
