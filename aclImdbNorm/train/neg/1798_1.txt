how can a movie have ozzy osbourne and still suck? i just don't get it. trick or treat managed to do it. this sucks and likes it.<br /><br />trick or treat is one of those movies i have to warn people about. it is a vomit-inducing vile atrocity just begging to be viewed so you can feel that much worse about yourself. trick or treat has no redeeming factors.<br /><br />for a movie about heavy metal, it sure doesn't seem to grasp what heavy metal is or what it represents. this movie manages to make heavy metal look lame and this was in 1986, probably one of heavy metal's strongest hours. that is quite a feat, however negative.<br /><br />trick or treat = so bad you will be angry at yourself for having watched it. that simple equation will hopefully keep you away from this brainless and gutless film.
