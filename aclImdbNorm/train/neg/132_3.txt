"in 1955, tobias schneerbaum disappeared in the peruvian amazon. one year later he walked out of the jungle...naked. it took him 45 years to go back." supposedly, "keep the river on your right" is "a modern cannibal tale". in reality, anyone looking for some insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed. the first half of the movie is more like a travel log of new ginuea, mostly touting the native art. the second half relies on still photos of a peruvian cannibal tribe, but really that's about it. unless of course, you are interested in home movies of a jewish wedding, or schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers. i give up. big disappointment and not really "a modern cannibal tale." - merk
