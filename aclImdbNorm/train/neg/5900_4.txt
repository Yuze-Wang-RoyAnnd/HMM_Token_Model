young and attractive japanese people are getting on the wrong side of some curse again, this time it involves mobile phones. various people die until the disgruntled spirit behind it all is unearthed, so essentially if you've seen more than 2 recent japanese horror films you can plot this film in the dark with your hands tied.<br /><br />the main attraction here is the fact that takashi miike is behind the camera. so far i've been more impressed with his low key works like city of lost souls, however as one missed call plodded along i was yearning for his more renowned envelope pushing of dead or alive or the overly pseudo-cronenberg style of audition. despite a lot of his films being essentially empty, at least they do have merits such as these, or at least something to keep your attention like tadanobu asano prancing about in shiny suits impersonating johnny depp. there's none of that in one missed call; there's just very little of credit: the acting is bland and average, there is very little (nothing, in all honesty) in the way of scares or suspense, and in places it's just downright boring.<br /><br />however, there are moments where miike's glacier-like sense of humour seeps through the bland commercialism; most notably with the instance of the tv show intent on filming the demise of one of the cursed subjects, and the tv programmer more concerned about his ratings than the girls' life. but aside from this there is nothing to suggest it is miike behind the camera; most notably his usual visual flair has vanished without a trace (and that includes his famous gore), although it's more likely he just didn't have any enthusiasm for the project, and i can understand why. one missed call isn't offensively bad. it's just frustratingly average.<br /><br />miike obviously loves directing. with his huge yearly output it's obvious he isn't going to be 100% concerned about all his projects. but even with this in mind, one missed call felt like he was just paying the bills.
