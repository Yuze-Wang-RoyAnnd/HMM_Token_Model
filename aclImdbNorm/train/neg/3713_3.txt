down to earth / (2001) * (out of four)<br /><br />by blake french:<br /><br />"down to earth" is such a mislead and desperate comedy it makes sitting home on the couch watching a chris rock standup-comedy act on tv look like heaven. speaking of heaven, the film is based on the 1978 movie "heaven can wait." that was a good movie, and this is good-to demonstrate how a group of aspiring screenwriters can take decent material and turn it into garbage. directors chris and paul weitz miss nearly every target. from concept to storytelling, "down to earth" fails miserably; this is one incredibly bad production.<br /><br />chris rock is a lousy standup comedian, both in his role in this movie and in the real life. he plays lance barton, whose manager, (frankie faison) even feels sorry for him when he is booed off stage during amateur night at a local theatre. soon after the script establishes his lack of talent, the character is killed by a speeding truck. death, played by eugene levy, has made a mistake, taking lance before his number was up. god's assistant (chazz palminteri) is very angry and decides to let lance make up the remainder of his time on earth, as long as he takes the only available body of a 60 year old white millionaire.<br /><br />the old man's name is mr. wellington, whose life has problems of its own. his wife (jennifer coolidge) is having an affair with his assistant (greg germann), who is robbing him of his money. but that's all right because lance, inside mr. wellington, has fallen in love with a young black woman named sontee (regina king.) meanwhile, there are plots to kill wellington, lance attempting to get a better body, and sontee's confused feelings dealing with a hospital situation involving mr. wellington's finances.<br /><br />"down to earth" has some good ideas, but they are in a pointless and unconvincing love story filled with contrivances and recycled material. the biggest problem it runs into is how we perceive lance as mr. wellington. chris rock is the actor with popularity and publicity, so he is not going to be absent from most of this movie; all of the characters see the new lance as mr. wellington, but we see him as chris rock. this is convenient for the love story; we believe a young woman would fall for lance, but in reality, he is actually an old, gray-haired geezer. that is not so convincing.<br /><br />the one-joke comic situation is supposed to be watching an old man doing funny things that are really done by a young black man. but what inspires laughter is when characters run into conflicts without their knowledge. just look at "there's something about mary." in the funny scenes the characters are exposed to awkward experiences, and not at their will. here, lance knows he is in an old man's body, and does things old men would not normally do. if lance did not know the body he was in then that may have had potential.<br /><br />another problem with the concept: we never knew mr. wellington in the first place, so how can we compare lance in his body when we do not know what he was like originally. to top everything off, chris rock needs to be the center of attention here, and makes the character too much like rock. he recites simple standup routine jokes that are tedious and painful; his dialogue is so obvious, wooden and straightforward. i hated the film's sense of humor. there are so many unfunny jokes and horrible comic situations. it is like watching chris rock being chris rock, not a character in a movie.<br /><br />let's emphasize the positives in "down to earth." mark addy does not do any worse here than he did in "the flintstones in viva rock vegas." eugene levy and chazz palmentari are well cast, but they are at the mercy of a scalped script. those are all the good qualities i can mention at this time, and if you give me another week to recollect, it is not likely that i will come up with any more.
