while watching the film, i'm not sure what direstion it was to take. there's a reason a writer shouldn't direct his work and even act in it as well, you can't do it all. i felt the story really suffered in this film due to the director wearing so many hats. ms. mcteer is the film. to add to her amazing talents, her portrayal of this woman was why i was engaged. here is a british actress who can do anything. in my view, conflict is what makes drama and a great story. i felt this film didn't have that. everything was somewhat easy for the characters, there were no real obstacles preventing the chahracters from getting what they wanted. watch the film for the sweetness, but most of all for ms. mcteer's brilliant performance.
