i watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest laugh i've had in a long while. the plot of the film is pretty dumb and convoluted in a badly crafted way. the only plus to be found anywhere in the film are corey savier's impressive abs. alexandra paul (i think that's her name) is horrendous as the preacher's wife who has a history of depression. ted mckenzie is gross and his character's a twit on top of it all. and as if the fact that you think she's having sex with her son isn't enough, they throw in needless sax solos at every opportunity! the end and climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughable. i mean who the hell wants to carry the child of a con who tried to make you think he was your son and that you were having an incestuous relationship with him!
