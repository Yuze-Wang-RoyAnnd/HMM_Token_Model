a broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent (tom wood and arye gross) are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (ron perlman) whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is terrorizing the city, the "costume killer" (so named because, after injecting his victims with windex, he dresses them in silly costumes). they convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of misfit wannabe film makers (john considine, joe pantoliano, kristy swanson) and discover that the art of movie making can be murder.<br /><br />there is more to this movie but it was unfortunately left on the editing room floor and it shows (rumor is the studio wanted a "lighter" dark comedy). our loss (and the actors, who all do fine jobs and deserve better) as this has the makings of an exceptional black comedy but only rises to mediocre cute.<br /><br />if you're a ron perlman fan this is absolutely worth getting just for his performance. his comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to do some really great impressions (he wasn't kidding when he said on the hellboy movie commentary that he needed an intervention when he gets into jerry lewis mode). he's just simply fun to watch in this one. <br /><br />david dukes also shines in a two-scener (but pivotal) role.
