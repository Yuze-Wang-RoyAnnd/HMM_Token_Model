never cast models and playboy bunnies in your films! bob fosse's "star 80" about dorothy stratten, of whom bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her sister after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than dorothy herself on the silver screen. patty hansen is no actress either..i expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la orson welles but instead got audrey hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful "poodlesque" hair-do....very disappointing...."paper moon" and "the last picture show" i could watch again and again. this clunker i could barely sit through once. this movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding ms. stratten's tawdry death; i think the real reason was because it was so bad!
