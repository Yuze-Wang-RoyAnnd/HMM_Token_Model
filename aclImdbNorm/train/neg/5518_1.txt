i haven't seen this, & don't plan to see this movie or any other that includes lindsay......unless & until "poor little rich girl" straightens out her life for a 2 year period beginning with her most recent arrest in july 2007.<br /><br />in fact, i don't know anyone that has gone to see any of lindsay's recent movies. i rather imagine 2007 will be the high water mark in her movie making career, until she cleans up her act. all of the recent publicity has only hindered her movie making career, if she has any further aspirations to make any more movies <br /><br />up to this time, movie producers have actively sought lindsay for roles in their upcoming production. now, lindsay will probably have to go to auditions & actually compete for any role. her reputation is currently "poison" & quite possible could have a negative effect on box office ticket sales on any movie she is in.<br /><br />sooooo....now lindsay is going to have to deal with "not being wanted".....is she going to be able to handle this?<br /><br />i wonder if even jay leno will want to have lindsay back on his tv show?<br /><br />all of the foregoing is merely my opinion. i have no inside information.
