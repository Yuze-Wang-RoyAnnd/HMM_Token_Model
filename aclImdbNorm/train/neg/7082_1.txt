ok, i wrote a scathing review b/c the movie is awful. as i was waiting another review (for derrida) of mine to pop up, i decided to check out old reviews of this awful movie. look at all the positive reviews. they all, i say all, come from contributors have have not rated any other movie other than this one. crimminy! and wait till you to the "rosebud" [sic] review.<br /><br />checkout the other movies rosebud reviewed and had glowing recommendations for. oh, shoot!, they happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director. holy window-wipers batman.<br /><br />joe, tony, you suck as writers, and tony, you couldn't direct out of a bad script. no jobs for you!<br /><br />always check positive reviews for a low rated movie!
