this might be unbelievable, but this movie has grossed $878,138 in russia! it's shown in almost all cinema theaters and still running! well, i have no idea why distributors put their eye on this particular uh "movie", which had almost no screening around the world. that's some kind of enigma! haha! maybe it was based on the fact that another movie, "pledge this" with paris hilton, which was as well released only dvd almost everywhere, had major screenings in russia and grossed more than 1mln$. besides, both movies had a lot of promotion, like there were the banners all over the city, tv commercials and etc. speaking about movie, i'd say it's dull and absolutely boring. it could be better, really. even if it has jessica simpson.
