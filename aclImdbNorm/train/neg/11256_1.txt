what a waste of time! i've tried to sit through 'sky captain.." about 6 times, and every time, within about 3 minutes, i start doing something else - anything else! it's a downright boring movie, the acting is terrible, the writing dull, and obviously a first-time director, because it's stiff. and i wanted to love it. i love sci-fi, the old cliffhangers, and i can appreciate the attempt at nods to flash gordon, and metropolis, but my god, what a waste of money. i used to work for paramount pictures, and i had written sherry lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests. she told me they'd never have an interest or need to do it. 10 years later, paramount releases this piece of crap. sherry was right in 1993, but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog. blue screen an effect shot, but not an entire movie. let's not forget, neither jude nor jolie are terrific actors (but easy on the eyes). paltrow's performance reminds me of a high school effort. too bad - it could've worked, but only under a skilled director. the funny thing is, sky captain's director will keep getting work, even after this dreck. it's commerce, not art!
