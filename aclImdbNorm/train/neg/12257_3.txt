"it's not like that big mechanical toy", says a character early on, commenting on "jaws". well, "blood surf" would only wish to have a beast as convincing as the shark of the "jaws" series. in other words, the digital special effects of this movie are terrible. acting and directing are not much better, either; they seem more suited to a deodorant or a bubble-gum commercial than to a horror movie. the attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre, but for the audience too. saying you "liked" this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this crap, further destroying the poor horror genre.
