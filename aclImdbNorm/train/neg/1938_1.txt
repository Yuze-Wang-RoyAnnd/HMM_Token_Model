where to begin? <br /><br />#1 amitabh's son, played by akshaye khanna, is 30.<br /><br />amitabh's been in prison for 33+ years... he<br /><br />a) telepathically transmitted the sperm home?<br /><br />b) asked a nice pakistani guard to mail it for him?<br /><br />c) they allow conjugal visits in secret pakistani jails<br /><br />d) all of the above<br /><br />e) the producers were having a little too much bhang at<br /><br />the time they approved the script?<br /><br />#2) amrita rao (yummm!) wants khanna - he's yum, yum, yummy... and apparently he wants her - who wouldn't, right?!... but, when her dad gets ratted out, and then killed (i hardly think this is a 'spoiler' as you'd have to be brain-dead and blind not to see this coming in the film) he's pretty emotionless towards this catastrophe and with the tip (metaphorically) of his hat, leaves her behind to save his dad, never mind her loss, and says (paraphrasing) "if god wills it, we'll meet again"... basically meaning, "i'm gonna get my dad and my job done, sorry for your loss - cya! buh bye!" - callus beyond even low-life hollywood standards...<br /><br />#3) there are so many holes in this horrible waste of time called a movie, that you can drive all the jeeps, trucks camels and any extra stuff through it. pass - really, complete and total waste of time - oh! there is a great dance sequence (yes, only one - as in dance sequence - regardless of quality) great belly dancing - but not worth watching just for this.<br /><br />rent veer-zaara or lakshya (will hrithik roshan ever take acting lessons?) for better indo-pak conflict movies... in fact, veer-zaara is pretty damned good - 7.5/8 i'd say!
