this is an installment in the notorious guinea pig series. a short lived japanese tv-show, that got cancelled after a psychopath admitted to being inspired in the killing of a young schoolgirl by the show. this short in the series is, like all the other films in the series, practically without any story. a group of guys have captured a young woman. they tie her down and proceeds to torturing her to death while videofilming her. they beat her, pour boiling oil over her, use pliers on her and finally, in "loving" closeup, push a needle through her eye. this is the most straightforward of all the guinea pig movies, and one of the first. it was probably this film, more than any of the others, that gave guinea pig the rumour of being snuff. they certainly gave inspiration to nicolas cage's movie "8 mm.". these movies have gotten quite popular in horror circles. they have progressed to more polished, but equally graphic movies like "naked blood". they probably fill the void left by the mondo movies, that got slightly cleaned up and became reality tv. not recommended, but will probably allure those who will see anything once, and wonder why afterwards, i know i did.
