plot synopsis: hong kong, 1966. paul wagner, the man who built the victoria tunnel, is murdered along with his wife by his associates. his twin sons, chad & alex, are split apart. 25 years later, chad, a karate instructor in los angeles, & alex, a smuggler living in hong kong, join forces to avenge their parents' murder & rightfully claim the tunnel.<br /><br />this is the second time that jean-claude van damme & sheldon lettich have worked together, having previously done "lionheart". this is also the first of three films to feature van damme playing dual roles ("maximum risk" & "replicant" are the others). the plot is a very simplistic take on the revenge story, the film's sole redeeming feature being van damme's performance as two very different people
