even if 99,99% of people that has seen this movie is brazilian, i'll keep up with the english since it is the language of this website.<br /><br />this movie is a piece of cr*p. worst acting i have seen for a loooong time. the kids are terrible. specially the boy. this was the first time i saw someone with less facial expression than arnold schwarzenegger, and one single voice tone, like a 5 years-old kid reading in front of the class. how can someone so bad be the main actor of a movie ? the storyline is so shallow my daughter could have done better (she is 3 yrs old). it is so simple it could be written in a napkin and told in 3 minutes.<br /><br />there are only three possibilities for someone enjoy this movie: 1) you are a pre-teen; 2) you have been so brainwashed by globo's stupidities that you think that anything that has the globo's seal is awesome; 3) you have a serious brain damage.<br /><br />avoid at all costs ! a shame to the brazilian movie scene.
