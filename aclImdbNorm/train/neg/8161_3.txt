mary lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957.<br /><br />well, the movie mainly takes place in 1986. the movie falls into the 80's trap of weird/stupid special effects, including some weird demented looking rocking horse.<br /><br />anyway, mary lou's spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person's body. whether or not she succeeds, you'll have to watch to find out.<br /><br />anyway, the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters. this also isn't really a sequel, the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school. it has the avg. horror flick fall backs, gore, pointless nudity, knocks against the catholic church. basic stuff, boring movie.<br /><br />the acting is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10. you can waste your time doing something else.
