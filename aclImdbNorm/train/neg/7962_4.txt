sequels have a nasty habit of being disappointing, and the best credit i can give this is that it maintains that old tradition. these three tales aren't anything as good as any from the original creepshow.<br /><br />by far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol which comes to life to take revenge on the thugs who killed its owners. the second story is about a lake monster which seems to be nothing more than a lot of floating slop, makes you wonder how anybody could possibly be scared of it. the third story includes a cameo from stephen king as a truck driver, but other than that is a pretty unmemorable tale concerning the victim of a road traffic accident who comes back from the dead for the person who knocked him down.<br /><br />watch the original creepshow instead, or if you already have done then be happy with that.
