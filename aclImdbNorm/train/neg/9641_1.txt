if you're watching this movie, you're either a fred olen ray fan, you found it on the $4.99 shelf at suncoast and thought "what do i have to lose?", or you spun around the video store with your eyes closed and rented the first movie your finger touched.<br /><br />this movie is hysterically bad. it's got everything a terrible movie needs: a screenplay featuring jaw-dropping dialogue and baffling detours in the plot, wacky science involving psychics and other dimensions, continuity that seems to travel through wormholes in time and space, actors that are not only wooden, but seems to border on befuddled, gratuitous nudity (not all of it is what you necessarily would ask for), and of course, a 5' monster played by what i assume is fred olen ray's kid.<br /><br />underneath it all, however, there is something resembling heart -- as if mickey & judy decided to get together all the kids in the neighborhood and make a monster movie (hey! my dad can direct it! yeah! we can use red paint from my johnny's dad's hardware store, and i know this ex-stripper who can act in it!).<br /><br />watch for the blooper reel over the credits -- you get to find out why the final cut of the movie was so crappy.<br /><br />incidentally, biohazard ii...the alien force is also worth a look, but doesn't have the same enjoyably crappy veneer this one does.
