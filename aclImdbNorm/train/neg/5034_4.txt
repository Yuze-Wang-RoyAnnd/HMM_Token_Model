i am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film, and of the few reviews that there are to be positive. i saw the movie and was pretty dissapointed. i didn't find it very enjoyable at all. it was slow, and lacks the entertainment value. even the murder scenes are lackluster, with real close-up shots of generic stabbings that don't look good at all. and the supposed great twist ending is really not much, i did see it coming, and then the ending just seemed cliche. this movie may not get much mention, but by the little that it does get, it is overrated. i would not recommend this movie.
