i was skimming over the list of films of richard burton when i came to this title that i recall vividly from when i first saw it on cable in 1982. i remember dialogue from tatum o'neal that was just amazingly bad. i remember richard burton's character looking so hopelessly lost, and then remembering how his motivations didn't translate to me. in short, i remember "circle of two" because it was so phenomenally awful.<br /><br />this movie came out at a time when america was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality. recall "the blue lagoon" (and other brooke shields annoyances), "lipstick", "little darlings", "beau pere" and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex, particularly with adults. as a teenager during this time, i found the obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the 70's and 80's, made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out, so to speak.<br /><br />"circle of two" is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient, like "blue lagoon". in fact, it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave, if totally failed, way. but honestly, it is one of those films you will *never* see if you didn't see it on its first run because it was so truly awful. no one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again.
