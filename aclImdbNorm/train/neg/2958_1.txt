this movie was astonishing. it is beyond atrocious. i often get together with a group of friends and go to the movie store to find awful movies to watch for their comedic value. my friend suggested this one, but as we watched it, people began to leave. i really wanted to finish it, just so that i could say that i had, but i was unable to. it's that bad. horrible running gags, lame acting. the main characters are an annoying dinosaur klutz and whoopi goldberg. i would rather watch costener's the postman twelve times in a row than see a fraction of this movie again. i think they try to deal with some dinosaur discrimination issues, but the part of the movie that really stands out is the dinosaur constantly knocking things over with his tail, and then guffawing about it. it hurts. watch it if you're an aspiring masochist, otherwise, leave this one alone.
