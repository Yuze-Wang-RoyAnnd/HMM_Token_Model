here is one of those movies spoiled by the studio's insistence on a happy ending. conflicts which have stretched out for years are settled in a few minutes. it would have been far more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity. the talented barbara stanwyck is undone by a sudden metamorphosis from independent and assertive woman to a compliant female of the kind she has put down all her life. brent, as usual, is well over his head and then there is the ludicrous situation of gig young playing a character named gig young. someone mentions "gig young" and then who appears but gig young, the actor! worth seeing though far below what it could have been.
