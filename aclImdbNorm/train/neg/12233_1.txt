i just don't see how a concorde-new horizons film directed by jim wynorski and featuring the acting talents of andrew stevens and a puppet could be bad. it just boggles the mind, doesn't it?<br /><br />well, let's make no mistake about it. "munchie strikes back" is indeed a bad film. munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries. for reasons not fully explained until the end of the film, he is sent to earth to help a single mother and her son. the mom's problem (her main problem at least) is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks...to the not-so-tiny tune of $20,000. ouch. she can't come up with the money because she just got fired. ok...just is the key word in that sentence. what the...? was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck? maybe it would've been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it...ya think?<br /><br />munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess...but there isn't a limit on the number of wishes you can make! munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall munchie was "borrowing" it from. the annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating. a baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the earth several times. sadly, those dumb parents watching the game don't think it's at all strange. hmm.<br /><br />anyway, i'd like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is. you'll be truly moved by the scene where leslie-anne down, playing the mother, kicks a dog which is yapping at her. your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer. "munchie strikes back"'s credits promised another film to follow entitled, i believe, "munchie hangs ten". to date, the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force. heh. 1/10
