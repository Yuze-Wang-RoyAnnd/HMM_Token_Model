a teenager who seems to have it all commits suicide. it leaves his family and his best friend (keanu reeves) asking a lot of questions...and blaming themselves.<br /><br />good idea, badly handled. for starters this has been done before 1988--mostly in tv movies and after school specials. aside from some swearing and dialogue (hence the pg-13 rating) this added nothing new. the outcome is predictable and reeve's attempts at acting were truly painful to watch. he's good now but not in 1988. aside from that his character was dressed like a slob and always looked so dirty is was hard to build up sympathy.<br /><br />that aside the movie is dull. i saw every scene coming and every "surprise" was telegraphed. i basically couldn't wait for this thing to get over.<br /><br />i have a vague recollection of seeing it in a theatre in 1988 and hating it (it bombed badly). it still looks lousy almost 20 years later. the subject is worth handling but it's been done better (with better acting) in countless other movies. "ordinary people" comes to mind. you can skip this one.
