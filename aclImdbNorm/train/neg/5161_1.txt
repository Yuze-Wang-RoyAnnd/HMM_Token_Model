my life is about saving animals. i do volunteer work with a cat rescue organization. i am a vegetarian because i couldn't kill an animal even to sustain my life. i can't even kill a spider, i put it outdoors. the scene where the children throw rocks at the bird until it dies, with sooner participating in an attempt to be accepted by the other children, made me sick and has haunted me ever since. it simply convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance. the ending - the foster parents adopt sooner - does not redeem the depiction of animal cruelty. why would anyone want their child to see this film?
