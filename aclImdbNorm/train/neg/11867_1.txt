i didnt think it was possible, but i have found film worse than 'body melt'. this film is really really bad! and what makes it worse is that its another australian film...<br /><br />shot on what looks like vhs, and with a terrible 80's rock soundtrack, it just keep getting worse and worse, which is hard to believe seeing how bad the beginning is (skinned male hanging up-side-down in a white tomato sauce sprayed room anyone?).<br /><br />and why do their accents keep changing? from bad new york drawl, to prissy english, then pure aussie! and it happens to the whole cast!<br /><br />this film also claims to have won some film festival on the cover (i believe it was the utah film festival). this has to be a lie because no-one in their right mind would nominate this for anything (perhaps the golden rasberries but i thinks its too bad for that aswell).<br /><br />come on guys! this film has to be number 1 on the bottom 100!!! it has to be ten times a bad as those films already on there.<br /><br />well done to the "film" makers of this trash, for proving there is a reason not to see films..... 0/10
