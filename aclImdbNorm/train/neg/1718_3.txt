i've read a few books about bonnie and clyde, and this is definitely more accurate than the beatty/dunaway version, in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang. particularly well done is the death of buck barrow, and the capture of his wife blanche. this actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of blanche grieving over her dying husband. however, this movie is still hollywood, and our anti-heroes stay pretty to the end, even after being shot full of holes (in life, bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush, and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death). the script is tedious, and the acting is poor, particularly the leads. very disappointing. stick with beatty and dunaway. their's may not be "the true story," but it's a great film.
