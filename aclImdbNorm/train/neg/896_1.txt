this film is awful. not offensive but extremely predictable. the movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid-60's. the father, the principal at the school, is going through a mid-life crisis. enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students' minds with some thought-provoking stuff, like think for yourself. the principal doesn't agree with her teaching but she is pretty. you can connect the dots. his teenage daughter (winona ryder wannabe tara frederick) is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live. she gets some bad advice, hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn't being taught at her school. shocking! seeing that director paul shapiro has mainly worked in tv, this movie plays like a more adult version of an after-school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms.
