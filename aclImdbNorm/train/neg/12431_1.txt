i would like to say that curiosity got the best of me. if only i saw a trailer, i'd be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie; i could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life, and about twenty dollars. this movie was a disaster waiting to happen, and it is an embarrassment to hollywood.<br /><br />the movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality. for example, this kid's remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood, and even enters this house. it's even covered with clothes. is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances? hollywood obviously did not believe so. common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite; i doubt the race car could even have reached the street, let alone a house across the street. another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess. why is it in all these movies, these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eight-year old? the kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? please, there's more reality in the matrix. also, the leader puts down his real pistol and "accidentally" picks up a plastic pistol; apparently, he could not tell the difference. even with a glove on, one should be able to do that. just because they look the same does not mean anything; there is other senses then sight. the traps are unrealistic as well; if any one of them actually worked, the criminals would be dead. but, hollywood intends for us to "laugh" at the "funny" results of the traps. i did not laugh; i sighed and rolled my eyes.<br /><br />but, i recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie; the movie they saw will seem like citizen kane compared to this one. otherwise, skip this one for the sake of your pride. home alone 3 also raises a question. we all know alex d. linz stars in the movie, but did he write it as well?
