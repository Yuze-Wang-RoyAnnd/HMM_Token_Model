somewhere inside this movie is a half-hour episode from the twilight zone trying to get out. whereas cube was taut, well-made, claustrophobic and mind-engaging, i'm afraid cypher is a bloated, tedious rehash of several well-worn themes which just don't add up to much, especially if you have seen almost any other half-way decent sci-fi film before.<br /><br />cypher manages to drag all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes right to the incompetent ending. none of the characters spark off each other, and for a film made in 2002 the technology is truly cheesy. it is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of cube. it's not a bad movie, but it is most definitely not a good one.<br /><br />when you've watched the grass grow and paint dry and are bored of your stick insects then by all means watch this film, but the other activities will probably prove more stimulating.
