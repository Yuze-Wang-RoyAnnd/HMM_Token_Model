this film ends with a speech in which the narrator tells us the fates of two of the lead characters and that the names of people and places have been changed...before telling us that relation to actual people and events are purely coincidental. this ending line actually sums up everything that has gone before it; as rino di silvestro's messy film completely lacks vision, and if there is any point to the plot; it wasn't put there on purpose. werewolf woman is often seen as a guilty pleasure or a 'so bad it's good' film, but i completely disagree. normally, i enjoy films like this; but werewolf woman is indeed a bad film, and despite all the sex and savagery on display; it doesn't even make for a fun watch, and that really is unforgivable. the film really doesn't have much plot, but the thin sliver we are given involves a young woman, who also happens to dream that she is a werewolf. she dreams of going out and finding men, having sex with them and eventually killing them. back in the real world, she falls in love, but her lover is killed and she goes out for revenge...<br /><br />the film is made up of scenes of sex and gore, which are padded out with extremely dull talking sequences in which various characters mull over the recent events. these scenes are probably there to forward the plot and build characters; but they really don't do that, and succeed only in turning what could have been a passable exploitation romp into an extremely underwhelming film. it would seem that the director was more interested in style and atmosphere than the plot, and this is shown by the fact that the film looks and sounds nice. the sex scenes are often overlong and not very erotic, but the gore works well. the premise is ripe for giving way to a very sexy slice of exploitation, as there's plenty of naked women, and the fact that the central character has a werewolf origin means that there could be plenty of erotica; but this isn't capitalised on, and while i can stomach huge doses of bad acting and poorly done plot lines, i really can't stand watching films and being bored. overall, i wouldn't even recommend this film to big exploitation fans. there's plenty of better stuff than this out there, and while the title may sound intriguing - the film isn't.
