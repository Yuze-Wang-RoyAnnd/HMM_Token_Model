this movie is even a big step down form the typical fare dished out by bollywood. the performances were horrible. even boman irani, who always manages to shine, goes completely ott as the villain. the soundtrack is not memorable either. and in spite trying hard, the female leads don't manage to be "sexy". vivek oberoi is capable of far better projects while fardeen khan seems to be stuck in similar fare for the time being. but this monstrosity is even beneath his limited capabilities as an actor. esha deol and amrita rao are horrible in badly written clich'e roles. it's high time for indra kumar to hang up his directorial hat. hope he never directs another eyesore like this. future of hindi movies are in better hands now. to sum it up, stay far away from waste of celluloid.
