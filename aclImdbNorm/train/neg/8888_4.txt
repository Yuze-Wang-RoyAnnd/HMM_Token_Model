i rated basic instinct 2 high, yet that movie got less than a 4 rating. this film only got a 4 from me, but it has 7.3 from over 600 people. i don't see a reason why they like this film so much.<br /><br />this film is boring, because it hardly ever leaves those rooms in that broken big house. and it only has a total of 5 people in this film. it is almost two hours long which is totally unnecessary. many of dialogues are slow and meaningless. the film tone is also dark blue which is depressing to watch. the film can just be shorten to a few sentences.<br /><br />this film reminds me of "three times" directed by hou hsiao hsien, that one is equally boring, the dialogues are also equally boring. it also has a high rating! i had to stop watching that one after the first story finished.<br /><br />this film lacks of passion or excitement.
