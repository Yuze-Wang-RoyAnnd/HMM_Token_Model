i put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home, because i had packed away all their toys. (toddlers don't like to watch "regis and kathie lee" or "the view.") my four year old found one scene funny, but told me the rest of it was "too silly." this is a four year old, folks. anyone over the age of, say, nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out.<br /><br />to say this movie is bad is like saying the holocaust was a little mistake. there are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this "film" truly is. the acting is bad, the plot is stupid, and the script is pathetically unfunny. since this is supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse. bronson "balki" pinchot is the worst with some weird fake accent (irish-pakistani-bronx-cockney-cajun as far as i could tell), but all the characters are awful. i haven't watched a real laurel and hardy film in ages, but i know that they had to be way better than this. what is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with... this?<br /><br />bottom line: derivative garbage. avoid at all costs unless you have some freaky bronson pinchot fetish. 2/10
