i watched this film for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullets. that's a mullet every 5 minutes. seriously though, this film is living proof that formula works. if it ain't broke, it don't need fixin. a streetwise-yet-vulnerable heroine, a hardened ex-cop martial arts master with a heart of gold and a serial killer with 'issues'. pure magic.
