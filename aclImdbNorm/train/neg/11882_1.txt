i passed this one on the shelf a few times, looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes (with tiny names) on the front and wondering if i was missing something. the other night it was on one of the movie channels, and i tuned in. i missed nothing.<br /><br />i must admit that i only watched the first 30 minutes. perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that. given the slow, plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30, i seriously doubt it.<br /><br />the lead character starts the movie in classic "i don't know how to start my movie" style, with a long, tiresome monologue about how he doesn't want to get sued. it's not funny. it's not even remotely funny. others have commented on the "san franclisco" bit; ok, a small chuckle the first time he says it. then he grinds it into the ground, smiling at the camera like it's the funniest thing ever written. get over yourself. in fact, i think the talking to the camera bit was the reason i instantly disliked the film. don't assume familiarity with your audience. familiarity is _earned_, much like respect.<br /><br />from there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp. i didn't realize he's jewish; it's a discredit to jewish comedians to call this "jewish humor". it's just unfunny humor. just because you're jewish doesn't mean you have a knack for the comedy. a wasp, spalding gray, does a better job of self-analytical humor than this guy, so obviously it's not about ethnicity.<br /><br />if one of the bits i had seen had worked, i might have stuck around. but some schlub going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with, then listing them for five long minutes, doesn't make a great movie.<br /><br />this is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of "office space". don't let yourself become a victim of target marketing. just say no to "haiku tunnel".
