the movie itself is so pathetic. it portrayed deaf people as cynical toward hearing people. true, some deaf people are wary of dating hearing people, but they are not necessarily angry like of marlee matlin's character was throughout the story. deaf people do not go to the bar and dance the way matlin did. all in all, the movie itself is more boring than pathetic. it is so boring that i'd like to believe that it is an insomnia-cured movie. if i have a problem sleeping, i can simply pop in children of a lesser god and watch. it will put me to sleep.<br /><br />keep in mind, this is a deaf guy talking.
