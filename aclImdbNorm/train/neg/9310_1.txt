ok - i adore this film...i will credit this movie - alone - for making me such a die-hard horror fanatic. i could never watch this movie alone. i've also heard many many stories of the effect it had in it's original release at the theatres , on its viewers. incredible masterpiece.... horrible , psychological stuff scares the pants off me .oh bless their hearts, whoever made this awesome film. i love it. i thought the whole film was decent and interesting. this movie is so scary - this is the scariest movie i have ever seen in my life! not that what happens in the film and the idea of the film are not scary enough , but what always got me - was brendan's fabulous acting. best horror film ever. nothing can ever be this scary again. halloween viewing at its evilest.
