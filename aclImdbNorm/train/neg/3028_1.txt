my flatmate rented out this film the other night, so we watched it together.<br /><br />the first impression is actually a positive one, because the whole movie is shot in this colorful, grainy, post-mtv texture. fast sequences, cool angles, sweeping camera moves - for the moment there you feel like you about to watch another "snatch", for the moment....<br /><br />when the plot actually starts unfolding, one starts to feel as if one over-dosed amphetamine. things just don't make sense anymore. i would hate to spoil the fun of watching it by giving out certain scenes, but then again, the film is so bad that you are actually better off not watching it.<br /><br />first you think it is a crime story recounted in a conversation between keira knightley and lucy liu. wrong. this conversation provides no coherent narrative whatsoever. rather on the contrary, domino's lesbian come on on lucy liu's character during the second part of the movie just throws the audience into further confusion.<br /><br />then i thought that maybe it is a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background who grew to be a tough bounty hunter. in any case, that is the message conveyed by the opening scenes. but after that the question of domino's character is entirely lost to the criminal plot. so in short, no this is not a movie about domino's character.<br /><br />then i thought, it's probably a story of one robbery. a pretty bloody robbery. 10 millions went missing, bounty hunters are chasing around suspected robbers, mafia kids are executed, hands are removed, domino tries to crack why this time they get no bounty certificates, etc. but soon this impression is dispelled by another u-turn of the plot.<br /><br />this time we are confronted with a sad story of an obese afro-american woman, who fakes driver's licenses at the local mvd and at the age of 28 happens to be a youngest grandmother. lateesha stars on jerry springer show, tries to publicize some new, wacky racial theory, and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick granddaughter.<br /><br />what does this have to do with the main plot? urgh, well, nobody knows. except that director had to explain the audiences where will bounty hunters put their collectors' fee of 300,000.<br /><br />then at some point you start to think: "oh, it is about our society and the way media distorts things". there is reality tv crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent footage. the bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of hollywood actors, who just whine all the time about having their noses broken and themselves dragged around too many crime scenes. but no, this is not a movie about media, they just appear sporadically throughout the movie.<br /><br />plus there are numerous other sub-plots: the crazy afghani guy bent on liberating afghanistan, the love story between domino and chocco, the mescaline episode, the fbi surveillance operation...<br /><br />can all of the things mentioned above be packed into 2 hrs movie? judge for yourself, but my conclusion is clear - it is a veritable mess!
