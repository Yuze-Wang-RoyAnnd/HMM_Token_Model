ok, plain and simple, if you are a fan of the other tomb raider games (yes, even aod) keep away from legend.<br /><br />it is, without doubt, the most disappointing tr game yet. it looks very nice, it sounds very nice, but it is totally unplayable and i've given up. i feel like i've been robbed by eidos.<br /><br />it's very simple. tr was a pc game before anything else. you control lara using the keyboard. in 6 tomb raider games the controls were standard. in aod they were 'tacky', but still the same general control sequences. in legend they have changed her movement and control methods completely and she is totally uncontrollable.<br /><br />i have seen comments elsewhere from people who say 'use the mouse'. no, why should i? others say 'use a gamepad'. no, why should i? others say 'but this has been the standard for 3rd person controls for years' well, i don't care, it is not the standard for any other tr game so why mess with it. oh, i know, because they couldn't care less about their original, loyal fan base, they want to cash in on the new kids who hadn't even heard of the series until the movies came out and make lots more money. pathetic.<br /><br />my advice to any serious tr fan is keep away from this game, and if you do buy it complain to eidos. i have seen masses of other posts, mainly on the eidos forums, from people telling them how rubbish it is, perhaps they will listen.
