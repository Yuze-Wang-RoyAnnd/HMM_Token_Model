*** this contains many, many spoilers, not that it matters, since everything is so patently obvious ***<br /><br />oh my god, where do i start? well, here - this is the first time i have ever come home from a movie and said "i have to get on imdb and write a review of this now. it is my civic duty." such is the badness of this flick. <br /><br />*begin digression* but let me just state one thing before i start. i'm not some harvard-art-major-film-noir-weenie (in fact, i went to the college at the other end of mass. ave in cambridge, the one where the actual smart people without rich daddies and trust funds go, which should put me squarely in the nerd-who-would-obsessively-love-comic-book-films census group, and still i hated this film...). my viewing preference is for the highbrow cinematic oeuvre that includes the die hards, bond flicks, clerks, and the grail. i wish the titanic had never sunk, not so much for the lives lost, but so we wouldn't have been subjected to that dung-heap of a film. and the single and only reason i will watch a snooty french art film is if there is a young and frequently disrobed emmanuelle beart in it. i even gave maximum overdrive one of its precious few 10s here on imdb, for god's sake. so i'm as shallow as they come, therefore i'm not criticizing this film because i'm looking for some standard of cinematic excellence - it's because elektra stinks like a three-week-old dead goat. *end digression*<br /><br />ok, there's so much badness here that i have to try to categorize it. here goes:<br /><br />ms. garner: one of the compelling reasons a male would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot jgar (i have no idea why my wife wanted to). i think that between this and "finding nemo", the latter was the sexier film. you know the red outfit she's advertised wearing in every freaking ad you see? you see her in it twice - once at the beginning, once at the end. bummer. in the rest, she basically looks like what morrissey would look like if he were a female - lots of pouting and black clothes. which brings me to the incredible range of expression jgar shows in her acting - ranging from "pouting" all the way to "pouting and crying". oh my god, you'd think she was being forced to date ben affleck or something horrible like that. um, wait...<br /><br />the bad guys/gal: they show about the same range of expression and acting ability that you'd expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit. at least next to jgar's performance, it doesn't stand out too badly. one guy's role is to stand there and be huge, another's is to stand there and have stuff come out of him, and the woman's role is to stand there and breathe on and/or kiss people. they manage to pull these incredible feats off. the main bad guy has the most difficult role of all - he has to simultaneously a) appear angry and b) appear asian. he does a fine job at this. i think there was a fifth bad guy/gal, but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out in self-defense.<br /><br />plot twists! this movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the democratic national convention. let's just put it this way - my wife, who has only been in the u.s. for half a year and speaks only a small amount of english - whispered this to me when the girl first appears in jg's pad, and i swear to god i am not making this up: "she go to house to kill girl. and father too." and this is before the father has even appeared on the screen. now my wife isn't stupid, but she isn't being courted by mensa for her gifts, either, and she's had zero exposure to daredevil or the comic book genre. and she figured this out in .00015 seconds with no prodding and no prior information. such is the blatant obviousness of this film. <br /><br />rarely-before-seen stupidity! ok, so there's this big dude in the film. he can take a chestful of shotgun blast and brush off the shot like it's lint, and he can take a vicious electra stab to the chest and just bend the metal (or melt it - or something - more defenses kicking in, thank god). but jg jumps on his head, and he explodes? an achilles noggin? ok! such is the mind-numbing stupidity of this film.<br /><br />ack. i'm starting to feel a cerebral hemorrhage coming on, so i have to stop. but you have been warned. if you have to intentionally slash your own tires to prevent yourself from going to see this movie, do it. and if armageddon is going to come, please let it be >before< this comes out on dvd.
