hilarious, laugh out loud moments ... and yet not a comedy. i particularly liked the planted gag of the ambulance soaking the "filthy bum" who then shouts after them in anger "you filthy bums", i mean wow, someone's online degree in literature is paying off! the worst script imaginable, with plot introductions in an instant, ridiculous movement in the story, zero character development (even between the characters who meet .. it's as if they all have known and trusted each other for years) dodgy voice over with added echo effects, and plot holes.. oh god are there plot holes!! to be honest i write this not even having watched the entire thing, but i certainly expect the last 30 mins or so to not exactly enhance the already pathetic attempt in cinema ... thank god we've got a good looking lead to somewhat make us forget that the film is a load of ... well ... use you imagination for the conclusion of that particular sentence!
