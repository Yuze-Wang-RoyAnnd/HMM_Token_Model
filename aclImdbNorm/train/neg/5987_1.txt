i really didn't like this film. the plot was very predictable. typical american plot, i'm sorry. guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end. and london has a monorail? bank of london??? bank of england is what it really is!! - i did however like the look of tracy island and the thunderbirds themselves. and the brits were baddies? (apart from parker and lady penelope) what was up with that? oh and they kept on saying stuff like "here come 'the thunderbirds'" - but it was never known as 'the thunderbirds' in the series, why do that?? i'd like to see this re-made in 20 years with more british cast. i preferred the original series. sorry!
