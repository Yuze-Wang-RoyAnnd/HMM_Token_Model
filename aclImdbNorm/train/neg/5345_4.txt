if you can make it thru "classic meyer" titles/intro, you can wade thru anything. but would you want to? i did not find a lot there to dig my teeth into. i suppose if you go into it with low enuff expectations you will be delighted (a la charlie's angels.) but for my money i'd like a little something more, more visual, more moving. more. i feel like i'm begging for gruel @ the foot of the master . the mans got the goods . but he just won't share.
