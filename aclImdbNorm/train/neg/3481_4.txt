may contain spoilers.<br /><br />i say that, but anyone savvy enough to be reading this can probably figure out every plot turn right from the start.<br /><br />this is not a movie that i liked. i didn't hate it in the way of some movies that insult your intelligence, but it all felt too predictable on its trudge to the requisite happy ending. there were funny bits along the way to be sure, but few were original. at least it didn't go for the gutter.<br /><br />christina applegate looks fresh, and ben affleck works hard. their scenes together are actually the only redeeming feature. everyone else is a cardboard cutout, including, surprisingly, james gandolfini, who must have made this as a favor to someone.<br /><br />all in all, it's a harmless, but not inspiring, 90 minutes.
