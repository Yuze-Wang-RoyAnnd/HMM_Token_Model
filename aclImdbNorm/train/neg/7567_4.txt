the story: young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. she ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg. in the institution she meets park il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her.<br /><br />if you're reading this you probably already know how talented chan-wook park is. but 'i'm a cyborg...' is a big departure from familiar, and (sadly) stronger territory. i'm a big fan of any film or story which is attempting to do something different. god knows, we all get subjected to enough crap at our local cinemas. the main point about the movie i need to say is, that it fails to say anything about mental illness, or create a characters that you care about.<br /><br />this story has to be one of the weirdest things i've seen in years...but weird isn't enough. there's no heart to the movie...just surrealism and confusion. confusion does seem to be the main theme of the movie. the characters all try to make sense of their own problems, but it's chan-wook park himself who proves to be the most confused of them all.
