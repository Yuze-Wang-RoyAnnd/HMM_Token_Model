left behind is an incredible waste of more than 17 million dollars. the acting is weak and uninspiring, the story even weaker. the audience is asked to believe the totally implausible and many times laughable plot line and given nothing in return for their good faith. not only is the film poorly acted and scripted it is severely lacking in all the technical areas of filmmaking. the production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action. the effects are wholly unoriginal and flat. the lighting and overall continuity are inexcusably awful; even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget. however none of this will matter in that millions of families will no doubt embrace the film for it's wholesomeness and it's religious leanings; and who can blame them. however it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept 3rd rate amatuer filmmaking.
