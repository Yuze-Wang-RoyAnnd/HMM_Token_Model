this movie's heart was in the right place, no matter where its brain was.<br /><br />"attack" is basically a spoof a la "airplane!" (two years before the fact - nice going.) of what happens when vegetables, or in this case fruits, attack.<br /><br />through all manner of film magic (stop motion, papier-mache tomatoes on skateboards, reverse filming, people watching off-screen tomatoes, people throwing basketball-sized tomatoes at the on-screen actors), the tomatoes do indeed attack everyone in their leafy grasp. <br /><br />then, it's up to mason dixon (miller) and a group of spies i wouldn't wish on any government's side to save the day. of course there's a meddling reporter (taylor) who pops in at the worst times, dancing and singing army soldiers, japanese scientists with dubbed-in voices, some guy dragging around a parachute and a samurai sword...and oh yeah, the san diego chicken before he made it big.<br /><br />the gags here aren't all that great. in fact, you could probably make up better yourself after watching these. some of the dialogue is inutterably bad ("please pass the ketchup" - not something to say in front of tomatoes.) and as far as "puberty love" goes...well, i can't blame the tomatoes for shriveling up on hearing it.<br /><br />what's good about it? well, i liked the theme song and the beginning credits, and there was a scene with four people on the phone at once that was pretty well executed. ...that's about it.<br /><br />three stars. not a "killer" comedy, but it tries.<br /><br />rock on, peace.
