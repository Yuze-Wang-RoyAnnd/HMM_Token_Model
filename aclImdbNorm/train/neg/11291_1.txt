sheesh! what a dreadful movie. dodgy camera work, a script with more corn than kellogg's, and acting so hammy you could open a pig farm with it. <br /><br />to cap it all, it doesn't know which audience to aim at - we have cornel wilde - or is that corny wilde? - getting on his soap box about the hazards of smoking any time someone lights a cigarette, dear oh dear, and in another awkward scene we have the baddie, lobo, forcing his, ahem, if you will, 'male friend' to do a striptease dressed in a bikini. try explaining that one to the kids...<br /><br />throw in an overly contrived treasure island-cum-jaws type storyline, and the result is a film so unintentionally funny, it's enjoyable - i shouldn't expect a special edition dvd any time soon, though.
