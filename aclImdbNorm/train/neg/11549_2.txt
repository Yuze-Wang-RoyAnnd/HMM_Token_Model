although there were some amusing moments, i thought the movie was pretty lame. the longer it ran, the worse it got. once the action entered monument valley, i found myself watching the magnificent outcroppings more than the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the characters.<br /><br />the character of the daughter was particularly incoherent. first she's in on the deal, then discovers the truth and she bails. then she's back again, then deserts them again. then she's back again. there's no apparent motivation for any of her decisions. there were interesting characters, some interesting scenes, and many missed possibilities. i would have to say the pictures was much less than the sum of its parts. apparently the people who liked repo man were inclined to like this one. searchers 2.0 is no match for the searchers.
