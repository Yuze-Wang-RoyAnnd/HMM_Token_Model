along with 2 days in the valley, i think this is one of worst movies i've ever seen. just another of the long line of tarantino rip-offs that have emerged since pulp fiction. the atmosphere the movie creates is amusing for the first five minutes, but then the film makers make the unforgivable mistake of allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to up the "hip" quotient. you're better off skipping this one.
