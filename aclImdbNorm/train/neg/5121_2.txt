i went into this movie thinking that it would be a neat football drama (in the same vein as remember the titans); however, i came away feeling like i had just attended a ted haggard sermon about the rapture. the only thing that was missing was the request for a tithe at the end of the movie. actually, one would probably get more out of a televangelist sermon than this poor excuse for entertainment. at least with the televangelist sermon, there are quotes from the scripture rather than quotes from popularist self-help pulp. the plot was entirely too predictable to the point that anyone with a long-enough attention span could have laid out the entire plot within the first 15 minutes of the movie.
