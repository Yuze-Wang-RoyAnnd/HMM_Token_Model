two kinds of movies we like are (1) westerns, and (2) movies from 30 or 40 years ago. we ought to have liked a man called sledge; but.....<br /><br />but... this picture is disagreeable, annoying and stupid from start to finish. since there is nobody in the story (good or bad) to warm up to, there is nobody to motivate the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested. no camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold, and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it. sledge has a pretty girl friend, but there's no reason why she slobbers all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this no-account pig.<br /><br />the film also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score, and from extremely bad writing and direction by vic morrow.<br /><br />of the last 30 older movies rented from netflix or video vault, this was the rock bottom, the only true dud in the bunch.
