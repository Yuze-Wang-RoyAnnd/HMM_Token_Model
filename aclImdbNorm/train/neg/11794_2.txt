a mediocre sci-fi channel original picture. a little squirmish, but not much. the nuclear powered submarine u.s.s. jimmy carter is on a mission deep below thick frigid ice near the north pole when it is attacked by giant super charged electric eels. a member of the crew (simmone jade mackinnon)thinks she has devised a way to communicate with the monsters, but is not given much chance for vague reasons. also among the crew are:david keith, mark sheppard and sean whalen. this movie could have been somewhat better if the eels/monsters were not so cartoonish.
