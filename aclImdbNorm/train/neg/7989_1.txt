i had high expectations following "my beautiful laundrette", "bend it like beckham" and (less so) "east is east". the histories of british asians fitting into their adopted home has had many good runs on the big screen, as well as a number of excellent tv and radio series (goodness gracious me, etc). this one falls flat. inspite of a good start it rapidly went down hill.<br /><br />ultimately this was a horribly typical bbc effort, complete with strong regional accents, whacky over-acting characters, a "those were the days" soundtrack, and lots of "issues" in an attempt to be worthy.<br /><br />i found myself cringing at many points during this film. the writing is predictable. every possible cliche was dragged out and aired. in fact, i have trouble thinking of any cross-cultural/cross-generational devices that could have been used that weren't. the characters were thin and cliched: the eccentric non-conformist minister; the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman; the over weight, overbearing aunt; the pushy indian parents; the working class neighbour; the 'wise' profound grandmother; the motorbike riding thug. the script was weak, with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimentional racist white characters taken. and why it had to be set in the 70's (apart from needing an excuse for a 70's soundtrack) is a mystery. possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979. i don't know.<br /><br />even these things aside, good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity. instead, the usual "bbc comedy" suspects were wheeled out to ham it up. "bend it like beckham" had far better comic acting (and serious acting, in fact) than this, with a virtually unknown cast.<br /><br />in summary, a lazy cliched script, over acted, in a dull predictable story. give it a miss.<br /><br />
