i remember i loved this movie when it came out. i was 12 years old, had a commodore 64 and loved to play rambo on it. i was therefore really thrilled when i got to buy this movie really cheap. i put it in my vcr and started up: man this movie is really bad! sylvester stallone says like 3 words in the entire movie (except for that awful sentimental speech at the end), and has the same expression on his face all the way. and that stupid love thing in the middle, it's just so amazingly predictable. i just ended up fast forwarding the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else.
