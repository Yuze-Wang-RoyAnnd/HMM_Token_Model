i actually liked this movie until the end. sure, it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. until the end, that is. for her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch-up to the other classically trained students, what does the main character do? wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition? no. she tortures and butchers the great sensuous habanera from carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable brittany spears-wannabe pop song. my ears bled! and, in the supreme moment of horror, her teachers gave her a standing ovation! any teacher not in a spears-induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot. save your time, save your ears - skip this movie!
