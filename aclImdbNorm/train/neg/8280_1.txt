watching this i mainly noticed the ad placements. dhl, aquawhite strips, rockstar and more. it's one product placement after another. it's quite obvious how this movie got its funding. jessica simpson's "acting" is laughable. any dick shouldn't ever get work because he plays the same lame character. the "story" is just a backdrop for this very long commercial. i can't believe this movie was even considered for theatrical release. the longer you watch this movie the more you're embarrassed for everyone involved. the only minor saving grace is larry miller and rachael lee cook, who gets almost no screen time as jessica's cousin. i'm embarrassed i watched the whole thing. i would recommend avoiding this one.
