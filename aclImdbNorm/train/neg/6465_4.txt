this charles outing is decent but this is a pretty low-key performance. marlon brando stands out. there's a subplot with mira sorvino and donald sutherland that forgets to develop and it hurts the film a little. i'm still trying to figure out why charlie want to change his name. every movie with "charles" has been pretty bad.
