terminus paradis was exceptional, but "niki ardelean" comes too late. we already have enough of this and we want something new.<br /><br />big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time, not behind. why people see romania only as a postrevolutionary country?<br /><br />we are just born not reincarnated, and nobody gives a s**t anymore about old times. most people dont remember or dont want to remember, and the new generation of movie consumers dont understand a bit. this should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song - priveghi! maybe younger directors should make the move.
