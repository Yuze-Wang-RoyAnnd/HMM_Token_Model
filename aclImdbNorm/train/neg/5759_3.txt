this is the third parody of the scary movies and hopefully the last. this time the spoof is mainly on the ring, signs and 8 mile for some weird reason. in my opinion this movie was very pointless and unnecessary and not even funny. i laughed maybe three times and that is not enough for a comedy. i really enjoyed the first two but this one was just plain dumb. if your jokes consist of corpses getting beat up and people constantly throwing stuff at each other then this movie is for you. in my opinion, if your smart enough stay at home and save your money and please stop making these kind of movies, they just keep getting worse 3/10.
