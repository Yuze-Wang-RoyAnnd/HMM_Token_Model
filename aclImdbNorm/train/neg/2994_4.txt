i've now seen this film twice, and i must say i enjoyed it both times. it's fast paced and fun, but ultimately daft. having said that it deserves to be trashed because of screwing up what could have been a good follow up to the seminal original. it is clear for those who have seen the awful 'zombie creeping flesh' that the films massive shortcomings can be owed to bruno mattei, and that the little that is commendable about it can be owed to fulci. this is not idle fulci sycophancy, the directors styles are starkly contrasted throughout, and you can tell who directed what, particularly in mattei's case.<br /><br />the film is centered around the outbreak of a virus (oddly referred to as 'top secret' by a scientist, it's secrecy apparently being more noteworthy than its potentially apocalyptic effect on mankind) somewhere in south east asia. the virus causes zombie like behaviour in those affected, and the virus quickly spreads across a seemingly arbitrary area of land. our protagonists unwittingly wander into the danger zone, and have to fight for their lives against hordes of infected asians.<br /><br />the film seems to be stuck half way between being a zombie gore flick, and an out and out action adventure, and this confusion is captured most clearly by the zombies themselves. they do not appear to have a set of characteristics common to all. some are of the regular soulless shuffling variety, so well rendered in the original, and probably fulci's creation here. the other main group consist of those who in being infected with the virus lost all sense of themselves, but incurred a savage aggression and a desire to earn a black belt in ninjitsu: indecisively leaping around unsure of whether to continue honing their upper roundhouse technique or engage with their brethren in what looks like a mass tickle fest on their hapless victims. martial arts skills aren't their only talents either, they are well versed in guerilla tactics, hiding on rafters and under bales of hay, and sometimes inexplicably falling from nowhere but the heavens themselves. this is all definitely the work of mattei.<br /><br />there is a third, more chatty, variety of zombie. this type apparently retain a sense of irony as well 'i'm really thirsty...for your blood'. the ridiculous twist at the end in which the dj turns zombie but continues to preach ad libbed gibberish about the fate of mankind, only serves to enhance the wtf factor and obliterate any hope of a serious resolution.<br /><br />then there's the infamous zombie head which slowly propels itself through the air, a jokerish skeletal grin wrought across its face, as if to say 'yeah we know how bad this looks'.<br /><br />the characters are all utterly one dimensional as you would expect. but its the pseudo comical dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from taking their plight seriously. having said that the first soldier to die does put up an impressively valiant display against an unstoppable zombie menace. indeed this is the first and perhaps only time we hit real zombie agro, and one of the only effective scenes in the film.<br /><br />the guy who played the chief scientist has heart, but no talent, utilising pauses in his lines entirely at random, so he ends up sounding like a confused asthmatic. the scientists' on screen attempts at finding an antidote are totally unconvincing 'now lets put these two molecules together!' <br /><br />there are a few moments that stick out as genuinely effective however. in an early scene a female protagonist explores an abandoned garage. upon entering a room we are confronted with a hazy view of a shifting figure in the corner and a squirming mass on the floor, all shot in an atmospheric diffused light. the silence is interrupted by the appearance of a speedy machete wielding zombie who trashes everything in his wake in his alarming desperation to have her. his sheer aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real horror in the film. the before and after theme conveyed through the hotel that plays host to the happenings of the earliest stage of the outbreak, and later as a refuge to our protagonists is imbued with an thick humid ambiance. there is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a boarded up room that clearly houses hordes of the undead, and this is quite tense. things become more dramatic when they board themselves in the hotel unknowing to what lurks upstairs. but this is sloppily handled and not nearly as effective as it could have been.<br /><br />all in all i would say this film may just about deserve to be called a royal screw up of a potentially effective tropical zombie fest, rather than simply a through and through bad film. if nothing else it has plenty of the unintentional laughs that i've come to expect from just about anything italian and gory from the eighties.
