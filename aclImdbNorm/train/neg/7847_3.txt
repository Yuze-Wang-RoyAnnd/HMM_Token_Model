just recently, i've been obsessing over and anticipating this movie so much that i almost had to see it. well, having just seen it today, the 5.8 rating is completely understandable. i think that if you anticipate something so much that it becomes a dire need, it turns out not to be worth it. <br /><br />sure, the hills have eyes 2 has its moments. it has a very cool and well-developed storyline that ties in well with the actual product itself, but the whole thing is so self-indulged that it becomes so hard to follow. and if it weren't for wes craven's production on this film, it wouldn't be anything to do with the original remake. <br /><br />but the whole thing makes you go "is this supposed to be horror or comedy?" because there are lots of ridiculous, randomly placed jump moments and stupid one liners (i.e. "there's a hand in the sh**er!" or "you motherfu**er! i'll kill you all damn sons of b**tches!") and the acting (god don't even remind me how bad it was.<br /><br />storyline: (this part contains spoilers, beware!) the movie begins with a woman giving birth to a mutant baby (ooh la la!), and then the screen fades to black with the movie's title appearing, and a monologue. then we go to this office where there are randomly placed war veteran mannequins. we find that this is for this one scientist keeping track of people looking for mutants. the box to keep track of audio feeds is gone, and everyone dies! after that tone-setting opening, you'd expect more.<br /><br />then, we go to this one team of military recruits training in baghdad. as the captain parades them "a good job at stupidity", their last day of training is in new mexico, the desert where the family in the last thhe had stayed because they were stuck. while in training, things go ultimately wrong, people die, and... do i need to tell you any more? because right now i have the attention span of a goldfish just forcing myself to sit here and type this.<br /><br />the thing that's wrong with thhe2 is that it just dosen't work. no flashbacks here, and the ending is pretty safe... but with a twist! a stupid one, that is. i'm pretty sure the ultra super director's cut with a holographic cover and a ticket to the hills have eyes 3 will showcase all of it's alternate endings, but at this point, i'm not sure if i care. <br /><br />so by all means, if you loved the first thhe so much it's almost a sin not to see this, then by all means, see it. but if else, then, avoid at all costs. it's for your own good.<br /><br />3/10
