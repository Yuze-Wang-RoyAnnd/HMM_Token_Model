five passengers at a bus depot tell each other their scary dreams while waiting to be picked up. but is there more to these nightmares than meets the eye?<br /><br />lucky me, five bad movies for the price of one! each segment features the very worst in acting, special effects, make up and music. and these were supposed to be scary? hmm.. i think i've been more freaked out during an episode of teletubbies. i swear, you'll sit there like i was, bored to tears waiting in vain for something interesting to happen. don't bother. it never does. in fact, i even stopped fast forwarding the commercials, as they were a good deal more entertaining than the main feature. and the ending is the ultimate cop-out. yep, none of this actually ever happened. if only the same could be said for the day i set my vcr to record this cobblers.. 2/10
