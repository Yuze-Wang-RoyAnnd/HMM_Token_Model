is there a book titled "how to make a movie with every 'man vs. nature' clich'e imaginable"? if not, ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects. ants doesn't have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime. i suppose the most surprising thing about ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes. the set-up, the characters, the various sub-plots, the death scenes, and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times
