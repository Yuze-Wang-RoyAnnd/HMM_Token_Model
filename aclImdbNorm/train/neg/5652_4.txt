this isn't a bad movie... but it's the type your girlfriend makes you watch. the story isn't bad .... it just makes the hour and a half seem so long. it's hard for me to trash this movie because i really do like the idea of it but it was just to long and thin on story... too bad. the main character never really seems to change all that much from beginning to end . i mean goes through something "life changing" and he can barely break a smile. i really thought mac was really good. his weird quirkiness kept the movie from being a complete disaster. maybe i just don't "get" this film. if anyone can explain it to me i'd love to be informed.
