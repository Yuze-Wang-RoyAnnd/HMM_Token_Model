seeing as i hate reading long essays hoping to find a point and being disappointed, i will first tell everyone that this movie was terrible. downright terrible. and not, surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review. i thought i might agree with him, seeing as he gave the movie the rank it deserved, but was sorrowfully rebuked upon reading what he said. i am quite ashamed to be taking the same side as someone who commented that the movie "definitely lacks good-looking females." let me be the first to say, "wow! that was definitely some serious in-depth reviewing there. my mind can hardly comprehend the philosophical musings about this movie." seriously though, a lack of "good-looking females" shouldn't be considered an essential to a movie. if you're desperate enough for "good-looking females" you should really watch other types of movies, not necessarily falling into the sci-fi category.
