this is by the far worst piece of cr4p i've ever seen in my life. it barely made sense. it wasn't scary at all (unless you class scary as loud noises and screaming?) sarah-michelle gellar needs to stop with these sh1tty horror films. i think everyone else in the cinema agreed with me when i shouted "shite" when the credits rolled up. <br /><br />on my list of the worst movies ever made this is how it would go:<br /><br />1. the return 2. cabin fever 3. silent hill<br /><br />the reason i made silent hill 3rd is because it showed some frightening scenes, but the rest was absolute cr4p. same with cabin fever, made no sense, but the return topped that list. its worse than silent hill and cabin fever put together
