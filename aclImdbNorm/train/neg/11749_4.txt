phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines.<br /><br />at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didn't find the jokes or oddness funny anymore.<br /><br />its a low budget film (thats never a problem in itself), there were some pretty interesting characters, but eventually i just lost interest.<br /><br />i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking.<br /><br />for something similar but better try "brother from another planet"
