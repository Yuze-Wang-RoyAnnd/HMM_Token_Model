i'm not usually one to slate a film . i try to see the good points and not focus on the bad ones, but in this case, there are almost no good points. in my opinion, if you're going to make something that bad, why bother? part of the film is take up with shots of anne's face while she breaths deeply, and violin music plays in the background. the other part is filled with poor and wooden acting. rupert penry jones is expressionless. jennifer higham plays anne's younger sister with modern mannerisms. anne is portrayed as being meek and self effacing, which is fine at the beginning, but she stays the same all through the film, and you see no reason for captain wentworth to fall in love with her. overall the production lacks any sense of period, with too many mistakes to be overlooked, such as running out of the concert, kissing in the street, running about in the streets with no hat on (why was this scene in the film at all? the scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written.). to sum it up, a terrible film, very disappointing.
