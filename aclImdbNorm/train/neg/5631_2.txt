the photography on the dvd is so dark i thought the screen had died. i think i missed seeing half of the movie. still, it was poorly crafted and not interesting. i did not find the story related to the title "the black widow". i was hoping for a mystery or a thriller but did not get involved enough to care after the first few frames. i rented the movie especially for willem dafoe and was sad it wasted his talent. i do not believe giada colagrande has studied movie making long enough to develop a major motion picture. she is attractive and might develop into an actor but she took on too many tasks in this movie. although they are married in real life, they lack chemistry on the screen. their relationships did not seem believable. i do not understand why the other characters were even introduced into the plot.
