despite its stereotypes, virtually 'no-name' cast and an obviously low budget i thought this film was alright; much better than i expected it to be. i was skeptical at first - the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me. but in the end, i thought the film handled the concept well (even if some scenes were a little clich'ed).<br /><br />the cast was quite good, and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously. i couldn't help thinking, though, that janine turner is a bit of a geena davis look-a-like. maybe it's just her face or the make-up, hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time.<br /><br />while it's not a 'must see' or a great film by any standard, 'fatal error' is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end.
