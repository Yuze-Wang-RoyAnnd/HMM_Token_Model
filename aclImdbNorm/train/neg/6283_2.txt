what an incredible fall for sean ellis.<br /><br />you gather a bunch of your friends at home, all hyped about the follow up work of sean ellis. you have an vague idea of the plot, no spoilers that could kill the fun, very high expectations.<br /><br />it is late at night, perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type.<br /><br />15minutes passes and you start telling yourself it is bound to pick up, at 25mins you start wondering if you should just go to sleep and save this for another time when you can fully appreciate the expected not existent subtle touches. over the half hour mark you realize half of your your hyped up audience is already asleep and call it a day.<br /><br />a few days later when you exhaust all other material to watch you go back to this, in the middle of the day this time, hoping your mood will keep you awake this time. 10 minutes later you find yourself fastforwarding the unbelievably and needlessly long intermediate transitions and images. any other stuff i would have given up already but there is cashback and its legacy. but that legacy can only carry you so long, this is a new level of boring movie-making, imagine a short story extended to a novel with just descriptions, this is what it is.<br /><br />decent cast is wasted, there is no cinematography that leaves you in awe like cashback either. there are films that annoy you, there are films that lack certain aspects, or just cheesy, unfortunately this is just a waste of time.<br /><br />final words, stay away.
