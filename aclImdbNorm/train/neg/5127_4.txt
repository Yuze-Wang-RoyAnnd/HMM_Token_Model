this film had no huge stars in it, but did have a very good cast filled with excellent supporting actors and gene tierney before she became a big star. with george sanders, reginald gardner, harry carey, bruce cabot, jospeh calleia and cederic hardwicke, you'd expect more from the film than it actually delivered. most of this, i suspect, is because of a second-rate script, as director henry hathaway was a competent and well-established man at the helm.<br /><br />the film is set in east africa during wwii--just before the americans entered the war. the brits are trying to control their african colonies while subversive nazi elements are trying to stir up trouble among the locals. one of the white men in the film is a double-dealer--working for the destruction of the british empire! but, lovely tierney, playing a sultan's daughter(!), is out to help save the day for good ol' britain.<br /><br />american film makers have long sided with the empire and the 1930s and 40s saw a plethora of pro-empire films. nowadays, with changed sensibilities, the notion of seeing the happy black natives dying for queen and country seems ridiculous--and it would be hard to root for either side! still, in its day, this propaganda piece was effective in drumming up support for the british--though when seen today, the film suffers from a long-winded script and silly casting. the one bright moment in the film is the final showdown between george sanders and the enemy agent. too bad after such a potent scene the film just seemed to talk and talk--losing some of its punch.
