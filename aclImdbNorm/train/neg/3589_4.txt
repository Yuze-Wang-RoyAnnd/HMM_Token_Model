i was attracted to this movie when i looked at cast list, but after i watched it i must admit that i felt a bit disappointed. the main problem of this movie is that actors aren't capable of holding this movie on their back. why? because of bad script. although dillon, lane and jones try very hard to take this movie on another level, there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too ordinary. so for matt dillon fans this is watchable movie, just like for admirers of beautiful diane lane. legendary tommy lee jones is always great but this is not movie for him; far below his level. so if you get hooked up by this great cast watch it but don't expect anything big or extraordinary. the only thing that you'll remember about this flick is diane lane scenes; rest of it is very forgettable.
