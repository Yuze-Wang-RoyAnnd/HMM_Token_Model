nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing! this time, it's being brought to you by the never-inevitable fred olen ray! as far as exploitation movies go, this one doesn't click! as science fiction, it's plain unoriginal! all that we see is an an ugly feminine android wearing a bikini out to destroy the earth, and showing off all that's nearly bare to resist! give me a f---ing break!!! if this kind of entertainment is your thing, then why not dust off those old si swimsuit mags from the attic for a change?! this would have been much better if it didn't set the sleaze factor on very high, but that still wouldn't make this one great. i'd like to point out another film called the assault (1996) by jim wynorski, which resembles the identity of alienator. it illustrates why top-notch 1st-person "femme fatale" action movies don't translate well in america. sorry, fellas!
