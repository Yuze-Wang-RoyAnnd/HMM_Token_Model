holy crap this movie was bad. i watched it just as a joke. it isn't even so bad that it's good in an unintentional way. this film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry. it worked really well at doing that. it's as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie priest, added in a bunch of ugly dudes, took out anything interesting, funny, or even remotely sexy and clever out of the concoction, and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese. that's all this is. cheese. there isn't a single person this film could possibly connect to. there isn't any universe this film could possibly take place in. why can't a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy? why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is? why couldn't they at least even tried to make it an okay film, or even a b-movie. now that i think of it, what they hell were they trying to do with this film? i watched it expecting a campy love story and instead i got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying christian brother tried to destroy it all!!! no, i'm not joking. that's what it's about. does that sound good? this film is pretty ignorant against people of the christan religion, with it's stereotyping of all christians being loudmouthed, rude, and hellbent on making as many people as miserable as possible. a lot of christian people i know would never speak or act like these freaks. the film, however, is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well. these have got to be the most tastelessly crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that roadkill video game. it's so nerve wracking and simply irritating to the point that i wasn't able to fully pay attention to this film. the makers of this train-wreck had no strategy for set design, acting, camera angles, lighting, script, authenticity, or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting. there isn't even a single sex scene, or at least not a believable one. jamie brett gabel was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all, but his good looks were sadly put to waste. this is trash. in a perfect world, this film would get voted a 0.0. it's worth 0 as a film alone. a mentally handicapped nun who is blind, deaf, and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her armpit could write, direct, and produce a better film, and she'd probably be a better actor as well. the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word "film" itself. this film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format. i could put a broom in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini x-mas tree and then record that and i've already made a film that will always be better than ben & arthur by at least half. there are only two things worse than death. torture and watching ben & arthur. i'm a homosexual and i will probably be the gayest person you will ever meet if you ever met me, and i don't think i've ever been more offended by an entire film than i was by the first five seconds of this film alone. if this movie was a mistake, i will personally find a way to change the famous phrase "it's okay to make mistakes" to "it's okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was ben & arthur." you know how people always say things like, "good things come out of everything!"? i think that ben & arthur was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of. to call this movie the worst movie i've ever seen would be giving it way too much credit. it's as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it's very own. there are good movies, there are bad movies, and then there's ben & arthur. this is ben and arthur.
