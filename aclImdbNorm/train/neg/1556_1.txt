i was china in this film. i choose the screen name sheeba alahani because i was modeling at the time in italy and they couldn't pronounce my real name correctly, so i choose sheeba and then added alahani since it was similar to alohalani.<br /><br />i had never acted before (and it shows), but it was so much fun to film. they gave me "acting lessons" each morning (which obviously were not useful). they dubbed my voice (thank goodness).<br /><br />david and peter were a blast on the set, full of good humor and jokes. this film was never meant to be taken seriously, it was a tax write off according to inside information. <br /><br />i give it a 1 because i have a sense of humor, but a 10 for the fun i had "acting" in it.
