this film is really bad....... no i mean really really bad. tony scott is a terrible director. out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state, besides that he is one of the worse directors of all time. what appalled me the most is richard kelly (director of donnie darko) did the screenplay to this. now richard kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has learnt his lesson.<br /><br />now i love mickey rourke's new roles but i cant even like him in this because of the terrible story and look of it. don't get me wrong i still love mickey rourke but he has made a few accidence's in his time and this is one of them. i don't know what to say about keira knightly, i think she's a little too overrated. i just cant feel for her in films.<br /><br />all in all this film is bad. thats it....... 1/10.......j.d seaton
