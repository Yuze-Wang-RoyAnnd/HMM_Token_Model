don't waste your time on this dreck. as portrayed, the characters have no redeeming values and watching them interact is sheer torture. "gothic" was entertainment at least, this is crap. if you like watching pretentious and spoiled poets straining to outwit each other, this may be right up your alley. lord byron is portrayed as a complete jerk, and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly bewildering. mary shelly appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever, but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect. what a waste of time. see gothic instead. i also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject matter, but didn't catch the title. i was hoping this was it, but no such luck. not recommended.
