for a lot of time i was looking forward to see this movie, here in latinamerica japanese or any oriental movies have no distribution in theaters, we can find some of those movies in some underground stores, and i just found avalon, i was expecting something good, but the only good thing in this movie is the first scene, the rest of the movie is boring and senseless, just plain stupid, with a lot of useless scenes, and a boring story. i am wasting my time even writing about this film. sorry but is the truth.
