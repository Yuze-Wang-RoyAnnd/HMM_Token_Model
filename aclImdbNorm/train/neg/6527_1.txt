surely no saturday morning tv kids' show was ever done this poorly. after all, those producers had to count on the audience coming back. well, in this awful offering, they could at least count the money they saved on sets. the script could have been a reject from some long-forgotten space opera serial, with a few smarmy lines added for cool-dude gerald mohr to murmur to naura hayden. no director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline, so the action just plods boringly along. the spaceship props are absurd--a bulova wall clock and portable typewriter, for example--but the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history. most are crude drawings, and it's all bathed in an often misfocused red light. even mohr's bare hairy chest is used as a prop. and it's a bad one--as rib-thin as the plot. any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the martians--and will probably agree completely!
