what a muddled mess. i saw this with a friend a while ago and we both consider ourselves open-minded to the many wonders of cinema, but this sure isn't one of them.<br /><br />while there very well could be some good ideas/concepts and there are certainly some good performances (under the circumstances), it is all buried under random nonsense. sir anthony draws way too heavily from the same gene pool as natural born killers, u turn and similar films as far as the editing is concerned, or maybe he watched himself in nixon for inspiration. say what you want about david lynch, but at least he more often than not has a method to the madness.<br /><br />his quote of stating that he made the film as a joke says it all. it's not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
