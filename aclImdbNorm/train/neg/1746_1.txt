probably the worst bollywood film i've seen.<br /><br />no plot line. very little character developments.<br /><br />full of silly and pointless humor. the whole film was chaotic and direction-less. there was no proper ending to the story. the airport was filmed in a shopping mall. <br /><br />same story chewed over and over again until you want to say "please, just move on with it!!" even the song and dance was pointless and badly choreographed.<br /><br />the only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around... but then most of the bollywood movies have that anyways these days.<br /><br />btw i'm not from an indian background<br /><br />2/10
