well, i can and will be very short. this is a wrong-balanced, non-convincing film that could have been a little bit better. the script seems to not know which way to go ... from funny to cliche-wise serious... it's a bit silly. that plus too much sentences we have heard before "the hacker is in florida, or no, he is in madrid, no he is in ... , he is screwing the signal". <br /><br />4 out of 10
