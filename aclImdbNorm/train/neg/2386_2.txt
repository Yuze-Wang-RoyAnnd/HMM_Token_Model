i missed this movie in the cinema but had some idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look, so when i saw it on the shelves in dvd i thought "time to watch it". big mistake!<br /><br />a long list of stars cannot save this turkey, surely one of the worst movies ever. an incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented. perhaps it would have made more sense if i'd read robbins' novel but unless the film is completely different to the novel, and with robbins assisting in the screenplay i doubt it, the novel would have to be an excruciating read as well.<br /><br />i hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more lately dvd blanks, take for example pat morita. even thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times.<br /><br />save yourself around 98 minutes of your life for something more worthwhile, like trimming your toenails or sorting out your sock drawer. even when you see it in the "under $5" throw-away bin at your local store, resist the urge!
