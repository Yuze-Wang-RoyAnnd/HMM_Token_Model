eytan fox, whilst generally leaning on the apologist side of israeli politics, has made several quite interesting films in the past such as "walk on water" and the simply wonderful film, "yossi & jagger". in "the bubble", however, he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme.<br /><br />far from giving this film a standing ovation, the people at the screening i attended quietly got up and left. i also quietly left, fuming with anger at such a ridiculously one-sided film that translates self-preservation as racist bullying, and racist bullying (and terrorism) as outbursts of justified anger; which implies that arabs are so wronged by the evil israelis that they react in anger to a constant stream of one-sided israeli aggression against them, and that they, therefore, should not be held responsible for their actions.<br /><br />this film wasn't worth the money i paid for the ticket (indeed, i considered demanding my money back), and was basically an israeli apeing of the palestinian film "paradise now". if you want to be an anti-israeli, then by all means watch this film, as it really justifies just such a belief system. the fact that this film was made by an israeli director and, even worse, such a talented israeli director, is a crying shame. indeed, just how israel can be surprised to be regarded as a pariah state when israelis themselves make such anti-israel propaganda, beggars belief.<br /><br />what a shameful, horrid little film!
