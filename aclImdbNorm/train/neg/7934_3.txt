a family traveling for their daughter's softball league decide to take the 'scenic route' and end up in the middle of nowhere. the father is an avid photographer, and when he hears of an old abandoned side show in the town, he decides to take another detour to take some photographs.<br /><br />of course, the side show is filled with inbred freaks, who promptly kidnap the women and leave the young son and father to fend for themselves.<br /><br />the only cool thing about this film is how the family actually fights back against their inbred captors. other than that, there's nothing worthwhile about the film.
