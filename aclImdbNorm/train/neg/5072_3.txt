and a self-admitted one to boot. at one point the doctor's assistant refers to himself as igor.<br /><br />working with the increasingly plausible idea that computers could be used to replace or reconstruct brain functions, this movie doesn't spend enough time exploring the premise. most of the screen time is split between girlfriend-in-a-coma domestic strife and chasing down the brain donor's killer. it attempts to be a sci-fi/drama/thriller but fails to deliver on any of the three.<br /><br />as a frankenstein remake this one is missing everything that made the original good. nobody calls the doctor insane or even threatens to kick him out of the hospital. the transformation scene consists of a coma victim opening one eye and the amazing computer that makes it happen isn't even shown. when the experiment works there is no praise, and when it starts going wrong there is little reaction.<br /><br />any suspense over who the killer might be is shattered by progressively showing him in the same room with all of the possible suspects. finding the killer is as easy as opening one file and interviewing one person.<br /><br />san francisco as a setting is both overplayed and underused. the opening sequence hammers home the point that this is happening in sf, a cable car plays a significant role, the leads live in a hilltop victorian, pier 39 makes an appearance, and the final showdown happens at golden gate park. more specifically along ten feet of cliff side at the park - just enough to keep the bridge in the picture at all times. once the obvious scenery bases are rounded no other attempt is made to explore the city.<br /><br />the acting is the only saving grace here. keir dullea shows a good range and pulls off a couple of genuinely emotional scenes. suzanna love portrays recovery from a coma well. tony curtis only gets a handful of lines and twice as many evil guy stares with most of the frankenscience explained away by his assistant. the little blond kid hits his cues fairly well also.<br /><br />i also gave it one extra star for the scene where the husband drives south from the bridge, it cuts to a u-turn in an unrelated parking lot, and then he's instantly back on the bridge driving north. it takes a whole lot of something - bravery, ignorance, deadlines - to try and slip that one by the viewer during the one single car chase.
