i just watched this movie and i've gotta say that with such a great premise and great talent this turkey just lays there!!! a friend lent me this movie and i watched with an open mind mainly because he had such high praise for the story. <br /><br />well, the movie started off with kevin costner as a fighter pilot retiring... why? why did they make him a fighter pilot? he was supposedly going to be hired by anthony quinn's character to be his new pilot... well, we never see costner go near a plane for the rest of the movie! <br /><br />costner runs into a texan (james gammon) selling a horse to a big mexican businessman and costner tags along for a ride. without knowing what happened, gammon is beat to near death and costner drives him to the meeting, which happens to be with an associate of quinn! but, nothing comes of it... nada, zilcho! why did they have gammon's character? why did they have the horse sale with the quinn associate if nothing was to come of it? <br /><br />also, after they leave costner for dead, they make madeline stowe's character become a whore, then she attacks one of quinn's men that was paying for a turn... she stabs him with his own knife, and the next thing she's been moved to a convent! no explanation as to why she was moved, or when it was done!<br /><br />too much talent wasted on such a weak script and poor editing!! i only watched this because a friend owned it and let me watch it... i'm going to throw it at him for the 2 hours i wasted of my life watching the blasted thing!
