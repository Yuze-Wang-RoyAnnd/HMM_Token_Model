oh god, i must have seen this when i was only 11 or twelve, (don't ask how) i may have been young, but i wasn't stupid. anyone could see that this is a bad movie, nasty, gross, unscary and very silly. i've seen more impressive effects at disneyland, i've seen better performances at a school play, and i've seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring the children tapping on the glass.<br /><br />the story is set in northern australia. a handful of ambitious young people, are trying out a new water sport, surfing in shark filled waters. it soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water. after they learn what, they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman, who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family.<br /><br />i think i have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is lake placid, and the worse of which is its sequel. blood surf would have to be the second worst croc flick i think, with primeval and crocodile tailing closely behind.<br /><br />the australian saltwater crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year. movies like blood surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the viewer's life. unless you really want to see it, avoid blood surf.
