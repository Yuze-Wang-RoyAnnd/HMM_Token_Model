this does give away some of the plot, by the way. a charlie brown christmas is one of those timeless classics that teach you the value christmas and just enjoying the holiday. this, however, does not. it tries to capture the emotion of a charlie brown christmas, there even is another christmas play, but fails with lackluster and easy jokes. charlie brown is no longer wondering about the spirit of christmas but is instead wants to buy a present for peggy jean ($25 gloves...what?). his sister sally is the most annoying character in the movie. here is one of her jokes: sally wants to write a letter to santa, but doesn't know how to spell charlie (for some reason he needs to be in her letter) so instead decides to name him sam, because she knows how to spell sam. also, sally plays an angel in the play with one word to day: "hark!" she instead says hockey stick (har har). if sally saying hark 12 times (all oddly sounding exactly the same) doesn't kill you, nothing will. peppermint patty and marcy are a large focal point, but that hardly makes it better. marcy is funny with her responses to patty, but patty is another story. she sounds like a boy (which doesn't dispel the rumors) and gets mad when she has to be the sheep in the play (terrible baas and all). apparently she is the sheep every year, and is worried she will forget her lines (lines she doesn't have). she is so worried she mentions it twice, one right after the other, and gets the same response. i'm assuming she must have short term memory loss, or something. lucy and linus are more welcome (although linus still has annoying advice), but hardly amount to much air time. i'm sure schroeder isn't even in this one. all in all, it tries to be a parasite to the original, but compromised the message for a few quick laughs.
