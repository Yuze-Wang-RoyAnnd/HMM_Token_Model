although the flock has some pretty good acting by veteran richard gere, and some okay shots that might harken some back to the silence of the lambs days, the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere.<br /><br />the film is about erroll babbage (gere) who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire. his office thrusts upon him his replacement, allison lowry (claire danes, stardust), who quickly discovers that babbage is obsessed with his job. and that job ain't very fun. he monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction. allison goes with erroll on many calls to check up on his "flock" of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement. but erroll is good at his job even if his methods aren't. he taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them. erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants' pasts. it is this "good justification" that challenges the audience on some level, letting us see how brutal erroll is and yet how out-of-touch he's become (by being too close to his job).<br /><br />when a teenage girl goes missing in erroll's "area", he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock. but how could he know? is erroll that good at his job? allison challenges him and erroll pushes back. their battles become as fierce as erroll's need to find this missing girl.<br /><br />although the set-up for the story was okay, it didn't have any umpf! i will give credit to richard gere, however, who plays the erroll character very well. battling retirement. worried about everyone who's near his flock. disgusted with those he's responsible for overseeing. disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does. quite a change in character portrayal for gere. but beyond him there's not much else. some of the sets are okay (dark and dangerous) but there are so many other problems as to be laughable.<br /><br />i'll be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films. but that suspension has limits. the biggest push against those limits is the destruction of extremely vital crime scenes. someone as meticulous as erroll would know that moving a body would be a huge no-no. or trampling through a crime scene. or moving evidence. it went beyond and hurt the film to no end.<br /><br />the other damaging part of this film is that we never get into clair danes' character, allison. she's almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and we're never privy to what her intension might be: will she stay or leave? will she end up like erroll if she does stay? this isn't a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground, but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up.
