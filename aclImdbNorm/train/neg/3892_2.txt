want to watch a scary horror film? then steer clear of this one. there's not enough beer in the world to make this film enjoyable.<br /><br />however, there is enough scotch. single-malt, if you can manage it.<br /><br />if the previous comments weren't enough to keep you from watching this film sober, allow me to assist. nasa sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit saturn. a really big solar flare causes colonel steve west to bleed from the nose. things go downhill from there, and wackiness ensues.<br /><br />i actually read the book adaptation, which was published and released only in the uk. miles better than the film, and the book was dreadful. at least some pretense is made towards suspense, and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the author's (rhymes with 'gas').<br /><br />not to say that the film is completely without merit. rick baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film, and jonathan demme found that he's really better suited to direct.<br /><br />yes, there is an mst3k episode featuring this flick, but it is, of course, edited quite a bit. without the obligatory flashing of the breasts, not even the healing power of scotch can save you.<br /><br />please, just go watch raiders of the lost ark if you want to see a guy melt. see space cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts. i can not, in all good conscience, recommend this film to the sober film-going public.
