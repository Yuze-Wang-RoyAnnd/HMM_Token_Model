i am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie! jack frost was my introduction into the films produced and distributed by a-pix entertainment, and without exception, everything this company deals with is pure crap! first, and this is very important, never ever watch this movie sober! why would you? unlike many other entertaingly bad movies, this one i feel was made intentionally bad. i just can't get over how fake the snowman is, which is why its always shown only briefly, the way it moves is the best! this movie is waaaaaaaaaaay better than the michael keaton piece of crap, becuz that was made too be a good movie, and that version is as bad as this.
