i saw this cinematic wretchedness in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (back when the tickets actually sold for $1). this is the only film i have ever walked out on (with my friend, while the idiocy that is the "laser bra 2000" sketch was on screen). evidently, my and my friend's reaction to the film was a common one. it is not that i found the film offensive (either as an 18-year-old or now), but rather that it is mind-numbingly stupid and patently unfunny, devoid even of the unintended humor that makes a ed wood film watchable. this is the real reason why nbc refused to air it, rather than a failure to comprehend mr. mike's "vision" (unless, of course, his vision was to drive the film's backers into bankruptcy).<br /><br />i remained surprised to this day that this film does not seem to have made any published "10 worst films of all time" list. it certainly makes mine. you have been warned.
