dreary. schlocky. just plain dreadful and awful. let's be honest, when you sit down to watch something called the double-d avenger you aren't expecting great art or even mild mainstream entertainment. you are probably expecting a cult film type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts. you don't get really either of these in the video. the story, as it consistent with most of these types, is inane: kitten natividad runs a local pub, finds out she has breast cancer, flies down to south america for a fruit that claims to be a panacea for any ills and a super-human abilities giver, returns and fights, dressed as the double-d avenger, a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition. as stories go, i have seen a lot worse, but as another reviewer noted the execution is horrendous. the action sequences lack zip, drive, motivation, and are tissue thin. the acting isn't even properly campy and the dialog is the pits. nothing, and i mean nothing is funny from the wincing puns to the heavy-handed boob references. all could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it, but they all fall way short. kitten, haji, and raven de la croix are all quite older(still lovely in their own ways) yet expose nothing and become the antithesis of what they are trying to be: older, campy caricatures of their former selves. instead, they look so lame and desperate - more because of the vehicle they are "starring" in rather than their own abilities. there are some other lovely ladies, but you really do not see much of anything. pg -13 definitely could be an appropriate rating for this. the material, the actresses, and director are all tired, tiresome, and dated - and again - not funny! it was a brutal hour plus sitting through this, and that is a shame as i was expecting something campy and fun. the guy playing bubba by the way was the only real laugh for me. not that he was good at all mind you, but every time he opened his mouth i kept thinking how truly awful he was. the lone bright spot here at all is seeing mr. sci-fi himself, forrest j. ackerman, play the curator of a wax museum and chatting to his wax frankenstein affectionately called frankie. other than that this is a complete bust - now how is that for another tired, dreadful, trite pun!
