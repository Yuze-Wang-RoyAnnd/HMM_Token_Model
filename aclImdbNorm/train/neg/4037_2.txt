i have no idea what the producers of the shield were trying to do, but the result speaks for itself: the shield is practically unwatchable.<br /><br />supposedly the performances on the shield are great...<br /><br />in reality, the show is so badly put together that you can't even really see the performances. for instance, the editing cuts away from reaction shots before they've had their full impact.<br /><br />i don't know what intellectual rationale there is for that, but it robs the show of all emotional impact.<br /><br />i'll give the shield one point for ambition in its subject matter, but that's pretty much all i can give it.<br /><br />it's a shame to see a number of talented performer waste their gift on something so strangely badly filmed.
