at least i was able to enjoy mocking the movie which is surprising since i was barely able to sit through it. in all honesty, my guess is the cover to the dvd case cost more than the entire movie. and saying that it is the same director as the boogeyman, when a new version of that just came out...nice touch guys, it was misleading enough to rope me in. the only thing that frustrated me more than the insufferable acting of the copycat was his haircut. usually you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like it. the film looks like it was shot by a d+ grad student of some film school excited to use every film technique he ever learned while attending classes....sometimes, less is more buddy. through out i would get lost by random plot twists that led nowhere or were unexplained. all this makes a bad movie but when the ending doesn't even come close to pulling it together, well, that makes it an exceptionally bad movie. without a doubt this is the worst movie i have ever seen, and that includes my friends' french final video for senior year of high school, but hey maybe i'm a bit biased, i mean i did get to play an extra. p.s. i don't even think this deserves a star...not even a half. none for you!!
