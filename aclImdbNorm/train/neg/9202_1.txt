i own this movie. not by choice, i do. i was really bored the other day and the box intrigued me. so i popped it in the old vcr and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying "why god why?". the story-line was not that bad, as an gamer i could appreciate bits of it. i think that maybe if you're into super geeky-cheese romantic scenes you'll enjoy this film. "i always thought of myself as a vulcan you know like dr.spock...unable to love" there is very few good things to say about this film, truly it is awful. but if you're up to really badly made film this is the one for you!!! the real story's much more interesting though ;)<br /><br />if i had to sum up this film in one word it would be:<br /><br />lame
