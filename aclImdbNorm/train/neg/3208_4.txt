this movie was a great disappointment for me. i had been waiting for this movie to come out for years, and i was a faithful follower of chaos comics until they went bankrupt. not only did they cut out half the story line, but they altered information. the statement that lucifer is hope's father is untrue. he did corrupt her father, but he himself is not her father. the voices also did not suit the characters, and once you hear the voice of a beloved character, the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned. i can not even remember everything about this film that was wrong. the bottom line is if you love lady death do not watch this movie. it just did not do the comic justice at all!!
