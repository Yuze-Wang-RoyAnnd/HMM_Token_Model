this movie was worth five punches on my "hurter card". i saw this while stationed in virginia in the mid '70's. i saw it alone so i was not distracted while i watched it. it sucked. it was the most ridiculous, total waste of celluloid i've ever seen.<br /><br />i know that others who have reviewed this movie have thought that it was awesome. i offer you this: if it was so awesome what was it's box office take? end of discussion.
