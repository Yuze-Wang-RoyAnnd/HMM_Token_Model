fairly good movie, but not a true story.<br /><br />rubin "hurricane" carter was a notorius liar, a murder and was never found not guilty. new jersey state just didn't go for it a third time as 20 years had gone. carter got an offer in 1976: "pass a lie test and go free". he didn't take it. this film should never have been made, but money talks. a lot of people have unjustly spend their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than white. why choose a fake story?<br /><br />jens
