...when he remade broadway bill (1934) as riding high (1950). recasting bing crosby as dan brooks did not help a screenplay that was 'dated' in 34 let alone 50. this sad film has entire scenes lifted from the original with many of the supporting cast repeating their roles, unless they were dead. though being older did not seem to matter to the director. nor that the cars and clothes in the background plates from 1934 did not seem match up too 1950s' standards. not even 'der bingel' singing can redeem this effort.<br /><br />we rated both the original and the remake imdb four****stars. frank's touch was long gone and all that was left was capra-corn. that did not stop mr. capra though. after floundering around the 50's making some educational documentaries he wound up his career remaking lady for a day (1933) as pocketful of miracles (1961). again a fine cast was let down on that imdb six******star effort compared too the originals eight********stars. sometimes it is better to quit while you were still ahead, right after state of the union (1948).
