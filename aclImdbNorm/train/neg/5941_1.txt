as a fan of notorious b.i.g., i was looking forward to this movie. i am unfortunate to see it is a terrible movie. jamal woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray notorious b.i.g. a lot of the story follows notorious b.i.g.'s real son, christopher jordan wallace as notorious b.i.g. as a kid. unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father. derek luke is just as unconvincing as sean "puffy" combs. in a nutshell, no one is convincing enough to play their roles here. the big problem with this are these are actual people they are playing. it was boring, and did not give any information about notorious b.i.g. that fans and non-fans alike did not already know. i was especially disappointed with angela bassett, a very good actress wasted here as voletta wallace. the movie slugs and slugs along thinking that notorious b.i.g. fans will spend tons of money on it. i am unfortunate to say that that happened. it's nowhere close to a good movie. i was expecting so much out of it, but unfortunately i didn't get anything i wanted from this. i think you should definitely skip this one.
