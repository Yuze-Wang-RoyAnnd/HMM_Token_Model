scary movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films, for there is not much of a plot , bad acting, pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes. but. and this is a big but, there is one good actor, one good recurring joke, and a good beginning. the good actor being tim curry, the one good recurring joke is the creepy,weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does cringey but laugh worthy things. and the good beginning is the spoof of the excorsist.<br /><br />the plot to scary movie 2 is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion, but will they survive the night? this film is not very good but if your bored you might as well watch it!
