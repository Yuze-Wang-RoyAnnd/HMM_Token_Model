i never quite understood the popularity of saban's power rangers show which was quite simply a second rate americanized version of japan's ultra popular super sentai series of the past three decades! what was cool about the japanese version gets completely lost in the american version, characterization, special effects, etc.<br /><br />of course many kids will say that power rangers are the greatest but they would be incorrect.<br /><br />i'm sure if they spoke japanese, they would learn how much better super sentai is over the american version.<br /><br />power rangers is completely awful, try super sentai instead! looking for a better show, try voltron the third dimension instead!
