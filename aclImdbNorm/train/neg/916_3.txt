lauren bacall and charles boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 film.<br /><br />there is a good story here about the axis trying to obtain coal to use for the upcoming war. unfortunately, this part of the story is not emphasized. instead, we deal with a supposedly bungling boyer. by the way, bacall is as british as vladimir putin.<br /><br />the real acting kudos goes to veteran oscar winner katina paxinou. as was the case with her memorable pilar in the 1943 oscar winner, "for whom the bell tolls," paxinou again plays a spanish revolutionary but this time she is a double-crossing counter-spy for the pro-franco group. she is quite a vicious character here;especially, when she throws a 14 year old child out the window. she believed that boyer had given the child important material to hide.
