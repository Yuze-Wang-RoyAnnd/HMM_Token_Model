i own almost every seagal movie (yes even ones like this that are low budget), and i must say, this may be the worst, not only of his movies, but of all movies ever made. the only highlight of this film, and only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1, is that a. it is seagal, and b. seagal does have some sweet action sequences, specifically in the store, and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife. next time give me 90 minutes of seagal killing people, and don't even bother with a story line, because the storyline not only stunk, but so did the acting, the fact that f-18's and f-14's somehow changed into f-16s, and also the fact that the stealth was as fast as an f-16. also the stealth never had to refuel??? and since when is afghanistan considered hostile territory from an air force stand point. last i checked, afghanistan has no air force, we (usa) control the skies. also, this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room, yet the admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret. also, how did seagal go from the bottom of the truck, to the top? please tell us why they jailed him, since when are air force pilots great commandos (unless they are owen wilson?) and since when are their drunks in arab countries, considering muslims don't drink alcohol? also on top of that, since when do arabs listen to orders from females like the #2 in charge? the highlight of the film was definitely seagal killing people in the store, and the other 50 people he killed with a knife, as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere.
