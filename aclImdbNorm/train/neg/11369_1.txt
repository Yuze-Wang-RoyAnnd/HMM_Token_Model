that's pretty ridiculous, i hope many people are exposed to muslims who live all over the u.s, u.k, and all over the world. the religion has over a billion followers. i myself born and bread in america and through my religious classes and teachings i have been taught to cherish my country and work to contribute to the society. i am very dedicated to the followings and teachings of my religion have been stressed through out life to educate and prepare oneself for success through education in order to contribute back to the world. i have know many muslims from all over and i have traveled to countries like pakistan..i have yet to meet one person who believes that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion except from the people in the media...i wonder why... also its sad that these extremists are the ones the media use to represent a whole religion. its a religion of one billion people, and these are less than one percent, i am sure the other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the kkk, ira and many more which are simple small percentage extremists who use outdated and not literal passages from the respected books in order to pursue their own revenge, personal, or business matters through their so called religion
