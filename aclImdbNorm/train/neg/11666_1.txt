as gently as i can, i sincerely believe this movie is a waste of time. i did not find it the 'warm, emotionally satisfying' film others did. i found it boring, with music that distracted from the film. the story was thin, the characters overdrawn, and the direction pedestrian.<br /><br />fooey.<br /><br />now i'm going to write some more about this movie, so i make the 10 line minimum. there really isn't more to be said and brevity is important, but imdb has its minimums, so here goes.<br /><br />young eager kid finds nascent talent, seeks time with aging, embittered mentor in spite of father's cartoonish homophobia. aging, embittered mentor turns out to drink a lot and teach very little. conflict arises. while i don't think this is a spoiler, i've added the warning in case someone feels this much information is too much. <br /><br />mostly, i just found the film boring and pretentious. a waste of my time. i honestly don't understand what little fuss there seems to be, mostly on this web site, about the transcendent quality of this movie. i think it's really worth avoiding. but, as dennis miller used to say, "maybe i'm wrong."
