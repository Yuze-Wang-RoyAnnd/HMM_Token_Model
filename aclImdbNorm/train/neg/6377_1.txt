this is easily the most disappointing, least gratifying movie of the entire so-called blacksploitation genre, which, by the way, are films we generally enjoy a great deal in our home. rather than being "exploitation" or demeaning, these films actually provide a priceless insight into an era. well, not bucktown.<br /><br />in this story, duke returns to bucktown to operate the night club left to him by his recently deceased brother. he quickly learns that the city is entirely controlled by a corrupt police force, bleeding protection money out of all the local businesses. duke resists, and determines that he will rescue the city from the corrupt police. unfortunately, he does so by calling in a posse of his friends (these people are vaguely explained as some former black-militants who have worked with duke on "jobs" in the past) and they simply murder the entire police department in cold blood. and literally in the presence of hundreds of witnesses who do nothing to stop it. ignorance is not a justification for murder, and it would have been much more entertaining to see the cracker police suffer for their actions as opposed to merely getting whacked in the street. while revenge is a ubiquitous and generally satisfying theme in films of this genre, it is a far cry from seeing pam grier track down the thugs who off'ed her family, cuss them out, give them a jujitsu ass-kickin' and set their 'fro on fire. that has art (and a reason for existing) and merits a level of respect that is quite undeserved by simply shooting someone in the back. of course, in this bizarre tale, she is playing a woman completely under the man's thumb, afraid of the crackers who run her town and oppress her people. indeed, her advice to duke is, "run, man, they gonna kill you!"<br /><br />following the sickening and gratuitous violence, we are expected to believe that the town's mayor wholeheartedly condones the actions of duke and his friends, congratulating them and offering to throw a parade in their honor, as opposed to, say, calling the district attorney to press capital murder charges against them and have them taken into custody. duke's posse declines the parade and instead opts to fill the numerous vacancies on the police force created by their recent killing spree. they immediately prove to be even more corrupt than their cracker police predecessors (to quote the mayor, "they are ten times worse than what we had before!"). now duke finds he must again rescue the citizens of bucktown from corrupt, protection-racket law enforcement officials and again make it safe for decent folk to operate a prostitution business in the streets. unfortunately, duke has already lost all moral high ground and sympathy due a hero, as he was a willing participant in the murder of the original police force. i wouldn't have cared one way or the other if he had rescued bucktown or gotten plugged himself at this point. i suppose we are to be entertained by the clever way duke has to outsmart the new police goons, but in reality the film has now just become an opera of gratuitous violence, duke murders all of his former friends and allies in cold blood with the same absence of compassion he had when gunning down the cracker police. duke is a pig.<br /><br />finally, when everyone in town but duke, aretha, and the employees of the local brothel are dead and bleedin' in the street, our hero and heroine walk off into the night as though they had some admirable qualities or redeeming values; they don't. duke is merely a murderous thug and aretha his enabling misogynist accomplice. if you are interested in this genre of film, by all means, i highly recommend them, see coffy, foxy brown, truck turner, blacula, sheba baby
