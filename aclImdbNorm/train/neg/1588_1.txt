this was the worst movie i have ever seen billy zane in. i understand that this movie was mainly to showcase the new comers, who did pretty good for newbies, but over all, the movie was not believable.<br /><br />with all of the gunfire, you would think the police would have intervened. even the coin being a bug on sean was stupid. the way sean suddenly realizes the coin is the bug, was not realistic.<br /><br />looks like this movie was slapped together fast. poor job. get a better writer.<br /><br />the count down to the end was not in sync with anything. it took longer to fight. and what a coincidence that each time billy was going to blast sean, he'd be out of bullets. once, i can believe, but not twice. <br /><br />actually, billy's character was goofy. it was so stupid when sean punches him out at the end. it was like a comedy. bad! bad! bad!
