i haven't seen the first two - only this one which is called primal species in england. i don't think i'll be bothering to look them out though.<br /><br />this is an awful film. terrible acting, bad dialogue, cheap rubber monsters. everything about it is so nasty. the most sympathetic characters die really quickly and leave you with the annoying ones, especially one called polchak, who is an incredible jerk. no-one like that would survive 5 minutes in the army. he lasted for ages but i was pleased when he finally got his head got chewed off - i was having nightmares he was going to survive. the colonel was rubbish too - all moody pouts and clueless shouting. and the specky doctor looked and acted like she was out of a porno. i was waiting for her to take her glasses off, shake her hair and turn into a vamp, but she didn't. pity that, as it would've livened the film up no end.<br /><br />didn't roger corman used to make half decent films once?
