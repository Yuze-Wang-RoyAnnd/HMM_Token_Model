why hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime (the texas chainsaw massacre, the hills have eyes) but is it considerably worse why hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that weren't brilliant to start with (prom night, the amityville horror) much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere, character or any genuine scares at all. prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch, but for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />it's a poorly acted, massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do. it's clear hollywood horror is dead. even the likes of the hills have eyes and the texas chainsaw massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot. prom night is virtually bloodless and i'm not even going to mention how bad the plot is. its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm... the original.<br /><br />one of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be. donna keppel (brittany snow) has survived a terrible tragedy, but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style.<br /><br />when the big night finally arrives, donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high-school blowout by living it up and partying till dawn. but while donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future, the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance. an obsessed killer is on the loose, and he'll slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only donna.<br /><br />who will survive to see graduation day, and what will donna do when she's forced to confront her greatest fear? scott porter, jessica stroup, and dana davis co-star in the slasher remake that will have tuxedo-clad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor. a plot that will probably put you off going to see this. witch if you ask me is a good thing.<br /><br />without much to work with, mccormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations. at one point, a girl backs into a floor lamp (a lamp!) and mccormick tries to pump it up into a jump-scare moment. desperate times really do call for desperate measures. there haven't been this many shots of closets since the last ikea catalogue.<br /><br />in the era of the hills, my super sweet 16 and to catch a predator, there probably is a freaky, scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and society's creepy obsession with youthful beauty. this is not that movie.<br /><br />my final verdict? avoid at all cost. nobody will like prom night, it's even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hack-job remakes. considering its absolute lack of blood or frights. a night you'll be in a hurry to forget.
