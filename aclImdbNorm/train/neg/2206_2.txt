a scientist on an island is in deep sorrow about the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer. so he thinks: why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark. well, who wouldn't? it's a little hard to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that's killing everybody is constantly being called "paul". also, william forsythe's cast as a macgyver-kick-ass-savingtheday- kinda hero lacks credibility. on the other hand there are a few hot chicks who make you actually look at the screen while shark paul bites another one to death. as a matter of fact i find bad b-movies quite amusing. but for my taste it would have been a much better movie if it was made for say 1000000 bucks less. then it might have been fun.
