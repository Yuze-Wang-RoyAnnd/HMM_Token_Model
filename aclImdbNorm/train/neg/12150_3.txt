feeding the masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be after your hard-earned dollars. suggestion? keep your hard-earned dollars and let's just say that good old theatrex took one for the team on this one. guess what the plots about? zombies taking over. this time though, for the sake of originality (?) this film takes place in rhode island, and to be honest i'm not sure i've ever seen a zombie flick based in rhode island. a tv station, controlled by the government, is supposedly keeping up "normal" broadcasts so that any remaining citizens won't think that there's any problem in the world, that is, those that never look or go outside, anyway. i will say though that a few of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this film. there is actually somewhat of a story to this but i'm not bothering with that because after a while you'll either not care or have fallen asleep. at any rate, this has plenty of terrible acting to throw on top off all the "seen it all before" stuff that gets trotted out before the camera. trust me, you can find plenty of other things to do with your time than watch this. 3 out of 10.
