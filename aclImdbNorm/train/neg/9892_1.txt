why is it that any film about cleopatra, the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making? whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest roman of them all, julius ceasar, and his successor, mark anthony, never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors. despite lavish sets and costumes, this movie is as bad as any italian "sandals and toga" extravaganza of the 50's. admittedly, this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen, which is why "gladiator" went over well, but "gladiator" did not have all the romance novel sex.<br /><br />miss varela has as little acting talent as elizabeth taylor, but timothy dalton has talent to spare. pity some of it didn't wash off on the others.
