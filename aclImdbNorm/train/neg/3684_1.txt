they sell it as a horror movie, it's supposed to be a thriller, but i found it pretty funny (comedy?, don't think so), i laughed the whole movie i think it was because of the ridiculous acting and plot. i don't blame the actors, i think they were not very good, but o.k. i think cillian is a very good "bad guy" i loved his acting in batman beggins, and rachel mcadams.. whoa! she's a beauty, and a good actress as well, but let's try to be a little objective here, the story mm mm... the direction mm mm... it lacks a lot of good suspense in fact is a really boring movie, but there's one good thing tho, it's a short movie, only 1 hour and 30 minutes (for me it was like 10 minutes under the water!!!)<br /><br />i just don't know why this movie is rated so high, and in rotten tomatoes, even higher, what's wrong with good, rational and objective criticism?
