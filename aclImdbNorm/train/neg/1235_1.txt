i really looked forward to see planet of the apes, but it was a huge dissapointment.<br /><br />the settings and masks are great, but that is the only good aspect of the film. all other things are really annoying. mark wahlberg is not acting, he is just in the movie, looking stupid. the other actors are also not very good.<br /><br />but the worst point of all, is the story. it is absolutely ridiculous! for example: the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground, but the humans don`t attack them, no, they wait until they are up again! this is just one example for the stupid story, but it would take too long to tell them all.
