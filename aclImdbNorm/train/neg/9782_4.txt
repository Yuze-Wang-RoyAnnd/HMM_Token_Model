this film had such promise!! what a great idea, an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, only to lose it's speed due to bad dialoge, poor editing and a half-written story. the characters in the beginning were interesting, only to lose steam half way through to become one dimensional people sputtering out tired one-liners.<br /><br />maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialoge it would have been a great movie, instead of a almost afterthought effort.
