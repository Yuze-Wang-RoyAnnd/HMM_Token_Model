i saw this film awhile back (while working on a trailer for the film's production company) and it was terrible. hewitt is mediocre at best, hopkins phones his performance in (but still blows away hewitt in their scenes together) and alec looks bored. trust me on this: you should avoid this film like the plague if it ever gets released. it seems to go on forever as the tired plot unfolds at a snail's pace. it is relentlessly unfunny, the cinematography is crappy and the direction is pedestrian. alec baldwin should go to film school if he plans to direct again. in terms of his acting, his character is totally unlikable, which makes it impossible to root for him. dan ackroyd is pretty funny and the surprising makeup of the jury near the film's end is cute, but this film is just plain awful.
