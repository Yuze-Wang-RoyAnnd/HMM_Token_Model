i would perhaps give 6 or 7 to this propaganda film because it shows when and how a propaganda film becomes successful. if there are people who watch this piece and think that "well then jews must have done something to be treated the way they were treated in ww2", then the movie is very cleverly made to conceal 'why's and 'how's as well as mix correct and false observations on how a people live. what more can a propaganda movie aim for? the part in which an american movie about the rothschild family is included is re-used very shrewdly here, for instance. the question of why the jew keeps his wealth away from the officer is never asked. no one mentions the system of taxation within that particular social strata.<br /><br />besides, the level of excitement (or, the level of disgust) in the movie increases slowly and the solution-like end of the movie suits the aim and the musts of doing propaganda. the audience would leave in joy and gratefulness to the times that are coming up...well done.<br /><br />in the movie, there is a kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perception of the audience. the movie is kind of history today, so no need to fuss much about it actually. however, in this simplicity of words of ethnic degradation, a careful watcher can find relevance to today's cultural hatred, violence, decivilization as well as the problems of integration. overall, fine trash.
