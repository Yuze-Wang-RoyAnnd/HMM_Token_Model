this is a rip off of the old frankenstein premise. an acclaimed scientist is killed in a freakish accident and his father, a noted brain surgeon saves the brain. it is then put into a robotic body of his own design. his brother, an electrical genius, gives the 'colossus' impetus to transfer thoughts into motion. the whole project goes bad, when the creation goes berserk.<br /><br />special effects are undeveloped. the script is lacking. and it is humorous that this is not scary a bit. well, very small kids will think this is good. if you are wide awake at three in the morning and this comes on....night, night.<br /><br />the lead characters are played by otto kruger, john baragrey and ross martin. ed wolff played the 'colossus'.
