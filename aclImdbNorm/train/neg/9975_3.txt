i remember watching this movie several times as a very young kid, and there were parts of it (many in fact) that i did not understand. i think i have seen it once as an adult, and i then understood those parts. the only problem with viewing it as an adult was that it was not entertaining to me at all. so what kind of movie is this? is it a "kids movie"? not hardly. it contains language and subject matter not suitable for kids. is it a hyperbole of what every parent feels like they are going through with their own children? maybe, but then why wouldn't it focus more on john ritter's character instead of junior? when a film has a 7-year-old as its main character, in order to do well with it's audience, it should be a movie for the seven and under crowd, otherwise people older than that will have no way to relate (even 8-year-olds wouldn't want to see a movie about a kid who is whole year younger than them). i'm pretty sure this film did not do well in the box office, and the reason has to be because it was unable to find a niche in the market.
