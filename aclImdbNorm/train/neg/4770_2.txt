i wanted to like this film, yes its a saw, blah blah blah ripoff but i like those films. if done well this had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film....unfortunately those ingredients had gone off! the acting was terrible, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners are just terrible, yes i know, bad writing....but this is more than that, it was bad writing coupled with bad acting. two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film.....<br /><br />sorry, im even wondering why i am bothering to review this movie at all.<br /><br />i will end with plot holes, plot holes & more plot holes! disappointing!
