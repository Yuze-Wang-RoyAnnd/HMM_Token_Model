you've got to admire director todd sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making: between 1985 and 2000, he made a whopping 34 films. unfortunately, if his zombie bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by, they're probably all crap (and a quick look at their imdb ratings seems to verify my hunch).<br /><br />part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead, who have escaped from a top-secret army base located directly beneath their school. working from a dreadful script by brian eklund (which relies heavily on liberal use of the f-bomb) director sheets delivers yet another embarrassingly amateurish effort featuring some mind-numbingly awful performances from his talent-free cast, dreadful visual effects (some crap cgi and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard space-shuttle) and his trademark shoddy gore (handfuls of offal pulled from beneath his victims' clothing).<br /><br />finally, after what seems like an eternity watching irritating characters running for their lives, and unconvincing undead people fondling animal innards, zombie armageddon finishes with a time-travel/paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re-watch several torturous minutes from the beginning of the film. honestly... once was enough, mr. sheets
