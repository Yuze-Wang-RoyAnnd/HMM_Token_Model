this film is just a shame. orlando, florida seems to becoming a more recognized filmmaking area (like vancouver's rise to prominance). the brothers was shot in central florida and this short film is a bit of a setback for the area (which made great strides with the indie film walking across africa and the great hbo miniseries from earth to the moon).<br /><br />i will try to be as honest as possible. i think orlando was the perfect place to film the brothers. it had the potential to give a new spin on the 'boy band' craze. after all, both n'sync and the backstreet boys come from this area. but, the brothers falls short probably because of a weak script. both lead characters are flat with almost no development (part of this could be the amatuer actors, but some of it is certainly the way the script was written).<br /><br />also a problem is the choice of jokes. many of the jokes are too repetitive (they do come off funny the first time, but it does grow to be a bit boring). some of the 'concert' scenes are staged poorly (and many of these scenes also don't seem to move the story along in any way).<br /><br />i had high hopes for this one, but alas its a disappointing effort. i also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this short. but i think the best thing for filmmaker john figg is to move to different genres (quickly). comedy isn't his strong suit. but, its indisputable that he definitely is one of the more prominant filmmakers in the orlando area (its just a shame that right now he's infamous, not famous).<br /><br />
