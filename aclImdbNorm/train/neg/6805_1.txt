i ve finished seeing the movie 10 minutes ago..wow i still cant believe what i've watched.<br /><br />this is absolutely the worst movie ever. if i would list all the flaws in the movie , this review would take me a lot of sentences.( very funny flaws, because of being that bad though)<br /><br />you got to be amazed with the skill of the commandos assigned to rescue the plane. they didn't even know how to move.<br /><br />ice-t is so bad actor... and the thing i don't understand, is how the production wanted him to be like a hero, but he's a zero..<br /><br />of course the major flaws will be the landing of an 747, needing only 3 or 4 tips from a guy in transmission to land the plane...amazing.. as well as the dead bodys that had almost no blood at all..<br /><br />but i strongly recommend of watching this movie, as its very interesting to see how bad can something get
