first, let me state that i am a big fan of ashley judd; that's why i was curious to check out this, her debut role. no argument that her talent is apparent and her performance excellent. i guess i can also see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. however, i like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and that is where this movie fails.<br /><br />by the halfway point, i found myself thinking, "how much longer do we have to watch a bored shop girl, idly standing around a deserted souvenir shop, rearranging the merchandise?" it seemed to go on forever!<br /><br />then, i thought, maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to lull the audience into a relaxed state before hitting them with some dynamic event. no such luck. the movie continues it's bland, boring, uneventful story all the way to the end.<br /><br />i'm not saying this because i'm an action-junkie. i like all kinds of movies, especially romantic-comedies. but i expect to be entertained.<br /><br />add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor's bad home movies. depressing!<br /><br />i just don't get how anyone could like this movie. zero-entertainment value. the longest 114 minutes of my life.<br /><br />
