in what seemed like the longest 1hour 35 i've had to endure in a long time, al pacino delivers an accurate performace to be sure. not his usual typecasting, which was nice. but his character was just truely pathetic. someone to pitty as he stumbles around forgetting appointments as we realise that the hollywood social life has drained him of his life energy. but in this movie we needed someone to like. and for some reason, every character in the picture said "i don't know why i like you, eli" to al pacino's chracter and i couldn't even come close to liking him.<br /><br />all the other actors played their usual styles. tea leoni, richard schiff, and bill nunn did nothing to change their established personas developed on tv or in earlier films. and kim basinger wasn't even in the film long enough to deliver a performance of any kind.<br /><br />the movie's story had no momentum. most scenes never driving the story forward, but rather just collecting factoids about characters which later came into play in an anti-climactic ending. it had potential except for their unwillingness to build upon the story.<br /><br />whats the point of the film? daniel algrant and jon robin baitz would have you believe "once hollywood has you, you can't get out." yeah right! and that's why so many people get fired in hollywood.
