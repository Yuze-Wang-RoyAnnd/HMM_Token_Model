"horrible people" ought to be the subtitle of this horrible film. if you want to see ordinary people doing ordinary things, then look out of your window at real life. but if you want to see unpleasant people doing dull things, you'll have to watch this horrible film by mike leigh. the characters talk at length, but never actually manage to communicate with each other. why not? presumably because leigh things that all of us are as ineffective and pathetic as his actors, and he wants to film real life. but we're not, and he failed.
