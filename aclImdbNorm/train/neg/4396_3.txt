my complaints here concern the movie's pacing and the material at hand. while using archival film and letters lends the film a fresh and interesting perspective, too often the material selected to highlight simply isn't very interesting (such as when goebbels complains about this or that ailment, &tc., or the ad nauseam footage of his small german hometown). also, the movie crawls along in covering c. 1920-1939 and then steams through the war years. in sum, the film is little better than a history channel documentary, with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensibility than your average history channel documentary editor and thus can more artfully arrange the details of goebbels' life. still, i found it wanting.
