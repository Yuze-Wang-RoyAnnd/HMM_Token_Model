i don't know about you, but what i love about tom and jerry cartoons is the (often violent) interaction between the two characters. mouse in manhattan sees jerry leaving tom behind to have an adventure in new york, and as far as i am concerned, this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat!<br /><br />as magical as jerry's exploration of the 'big apple' might be for the other t&j fans who have commented here on imdb, i couldn't wait for this self-indulgent rubbish to end, so i could watch the next cartoon on my dvd.<br /><br />in fact, the only part of the whole episode that i genuinely enjoyed was when jerry almost 'buys the farm', hanging precariously off the end of a broken candle, hundreds of feet above a busy road.
