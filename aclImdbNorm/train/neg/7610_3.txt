generally i don't like films directed by sydney pollack ("the firm" being somewhat of an exception) and i've never been a robert redford fan either. still, i thought "three days of the condor" must be good because of the number of praising comments it has received.<br /><br />although the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and max von sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer, i found the whole affair tremendously disappointing. the film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere, but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which doesn't seem to make any sense.<br /><br />the film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings i have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air. and what can one say about that absurd romance between redford and dunaway? i'd much rather watch any of hitchcock's films five times in succession than to sit through this piece of waste once more.
