if anybody really wants to understand hitler, read wwi history not wwii history. find out what happened during that war, how soldiers had to live around dead corpses all the time. how so many soldiers went insane, from what they saw during wwi, at the time they called it "shellshocked" now the call it post-traumatic stress disorder. if you learn the true horrors of wwi, you will begin to understand hitler. you will understand how a human being can become desensitized to death, not because their evil but simply because it was the only way for them too cope with the horrors around them.<br /><br />this movie unfortunately misses that, as so many others do. read some books on the subject and you should watch the movie "paths of glory", the only good wwi movie ever made. you will see the frustration of the soldiers in that movie, the sense of helplessness, and a utter devaluation of human life, as nothing more than bullet catchers.<br /><br />thats what this movie misses, its really the key point to understanding germany. a lost war, where millions and millions of germans lost their lives, for no real reason. then comes an utter economic collapse, following the war. those are the factors that create extremism.<br /><br />the loss of family members and massive poverty will create always lead to extremism. unfortunately this movie ignored these factors, and has just become another throw away piece of crap to throw on the pile. with really no real value, there are fictional movie's based upon fictional characters that could give you a better idea of hitler than this does. they just threw hitlers name on this so it would sell more.
