invasion of the star creatures would definitely be in the "so bad it's good" category if the film wasn't quite so sexist or racist. that it is such just makes it plain bad.<br /><br />it has the same kind of hardline stereotypical sexism that you saw in queen of outer space, and the kind of racist stereotypes (in this instance, native americans) that you would normally find in thirties & forties b-westerns. in terms of being non-funny, the same walking-through-the-cave gag is repeated well over ten times during the course of this fairly short movie. ray does do one good impression of jimmy cagney (but can't make it work for two impressions of cagney in a row, nor handle a peter lorre when he tries it). there really aren't any production values to speak of, as the "star creatures" make the ro-man from robot monster or tor johnson in plan 9 from outer space look like creations of industrial light and magic.<br /><br />this film was definitely one of a vanguard of what you would have to call early independent cinema...not artsy enough for those theaters and not good enough for anything but the last feature of an all-night drive-in.<br /><br />
