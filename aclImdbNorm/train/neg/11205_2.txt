yeah, well, i definitely had regrets about giving up my saturday night watching this strange little, yet very long, movie. apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life. here's the epitome of the antihero in 'no regrets.' we have this jerk, so messed up, so wandering, so selfish, aimless and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly favored businessman's up-and-coming son, jaemin, unless it was just that: physical attraction. he claims otherwise, that it's love. but after watching this, it's like loving charles manson because you dig the beard. (alright, he's not that bad, but still no real redeemable characteristics.) i could never get past the reason jaemin endless stalks sumin. it was never shown, just told, that jaemin loves sumin. perhaps it's a culture thing that flew over my head: crazy/stalking = mad love over in seoul. it has to be, because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point i thought this was turning into a screwball comedy. i was waiting for a tiger named "baby" to make an appearance. okay, so sumin works two jobs while going to school, so far so good on someone trying to better themselves. but after his first taste of his stalker's attraction, he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring. what? ok, well, as previously mentioned, the obsession doesn't stop due to the job/career change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable occurrences just seem to happen without buildup. basic movie, not 100% terrible, but you can do better with foreign gay-themed movies.
