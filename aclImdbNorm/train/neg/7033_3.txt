black candles is rather a muddled mess from the same director that brought us "vampyres" and much later, "rest in pieces", among others..i'm only noting the ones i've seen. at any rate, we have a couple making love and then somewhere near by a pin is poised over a voodoo doll and then pierces it, and the man keels over. not sure if it was good for either of them, at that point. fast forward to where the man's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will, or something to that effect, and of course everybody else except her is in on something, which happens to be devil worship. it's really hard to say who is who at moments during the movie and it does get a bit confusing at times. to spice things up though, there's a simulated bestiality scene (i hope it's simulated) with a black goat, sure to be a crowd pleaser. ugh. at times this echoes "rosemary's baby", minus the baby, because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place reeks of whatever nasty satanic herbs these are too, because that keeps getting remarked upon. however, the herbs aren't the only thing that reeks about this film. the end seems to be back to the beginning again, and many viewers might find themselves wondering where they've been during the middle part. it's not unwatchable, it's just not very good, and i guess it all depends on what you like to see in films, and there wasn't much here that did anything much for me. 3 out of 10.
