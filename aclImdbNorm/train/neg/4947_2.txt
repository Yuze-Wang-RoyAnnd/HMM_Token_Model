dieter bohlen, germany's notorious composer and producer of slightly trashy pop hits like "you're my heart, you're my soul" felt the need to tell his story - and gracefully he decided to hire a ghost writer. the result was a funny book about his life. well, more or less a fuzzy image of it. he didn't deny that he is a selfish asshole but the whole story was twisted to fit his image of himself. no word that he has probably beaten up his former wife and she ended up in hospital. however it was written in a funny style and a huge success after his appearance as jury member of the german version of "american idol" - especially his unforgettable comments.<br /><br />this should be the end of the story - really. in the hype of the mentioned "idol" tv show called "deutschland sucht den superstar" (abbreviated dsds) somebody must have come up with the terrible idea to make a movie out of the book. the result is "dieter - der film"<br /><br />i have rarely seen a movie which tries so desperately to be funny and fails so completely. none of the gags really hits the point. naddel's voice and style of talking was getting on my nerves right away although verona's voice should have done that more. obvious, childish, predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end within a few minutes. the content of the movie is a sloppy film adaption written sloppily down by a ghost writer based on bohlen's sloppy idealized memory. they could have used this freedom to do almost everything. it was supposed to be a satire, but they failed. the story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is bohlen himself guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical at all.<br /><br />it's no wonder that it was considered to bad for a cinema release. the probability that this thing would have rotten in some archive was quite high until recently when the current season of dsds turned out to be a mediocre success. with the "friendly" help of germany's biggest yellow press newspaper "bild" and the desperate situation for the tv station rtl to have something in the program while the still unbeatable show "wetten dass... ?" is running on channel 2 the movie finally arrived in television - unfortunately.<br /><br />watching this movie is a waste of time - there are certainly better cartoons with much more fun and a story actually worth looking at.<br /><br />therefore: 2/10
