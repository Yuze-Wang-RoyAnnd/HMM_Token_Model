<br /><br />this movie sucks big time. it reminded me of the movie resurrection (christopher lambert), which i also found extremely boring. and "semana santa" is in every way an even poorer movie.<br /><br />only fine one in the cast doing something for this movie is alida valli. alida is one of the grand old ladies in european movie history. i loved her maniacal looks in "suspiria" and "inferno" (dario argento). i will not spend more time dealing with this movie. i will say another good thing about this movie...use it if you want to fall asleep very quickly...
