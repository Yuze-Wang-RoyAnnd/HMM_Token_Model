i really must have caught a different film from the rest of the commentators on this site because at a screening of the film last night the audience was so mortified by the dialoge that (i'm not even kidding)half walked out. shot as if the filmmaker thought he were approaching some daring new territory by presenting a homosexual coming-of-age story, the film utilizes david lynch inspired visuals with fassbinder inspired acting. the performances in this film are so dull and bored that i figured one of the actors was going to pass out by how uninspired they seemed to be by the script. what's worse is that it's colored like an episode of miami vice. i don't know who this director thinks he is; maybe he has pretensions of the surreal like bunuel, jordowsky, etc. but the problem is that all of the afore mentioned directors display a level of erudite sensibility that is sorely lacking here. i could understand the meaningfulness of this film about ten years ago, but when we've got masterpieces such as bad eduction, mysterious skin and show me love why bother with this cinematic turd? there is nothing new to be seen here.
