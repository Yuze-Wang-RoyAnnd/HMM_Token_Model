razone is an awful movie! it is so simple. it seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life. just like zappa did many years ago. but unfortunately denmark lacks good young actors. leon are by many still the little girl in "krummernes jul", and laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie!<br /><br />even though i consider it a movie you ought to see. i do not agree that the youth are behaving like this, but i think it can show how it can end, if you are letting your child down. also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like "film folket"!<br /><br />all in all i think people should see razone. not because it is a great film, but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes. i also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and actually it is in these scenes, laura is acting best. - like the ending where she is holding the gun!
