this film is roughly what it sounds like: a futuristic version of the cinderella legend but with songs and (fairly tame) sex scenes! the film is not sure what it wants to be and pretty much ends up a mess. it's more expensive looking than most of director al adamson's films but it's not at the same budget level that viewers have come to expect from sci-fi films. the actors are pretty bad and unlike most adamson films, there are no former big namers or b actors. some of the music is ok but it's easy to see why cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years.
