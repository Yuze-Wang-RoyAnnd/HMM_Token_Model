this movie was a stupid piece of crap. bad everything. why is it that we who love western movies get jilted nine out of ten times when renting westerns. it seems that if you don't see names like robert duval, kevin kostner, or tom selleck attached to the cover, it isn't worth messing with. for the most part the main action of shiloh falls was taking place in 1892, yet the revolvers used were 1860s models. even the shooting was bad - in one scene the marshal fanned his six-shooter about nine times and couldn't hit any of three large men who were only about twenty feet away. i had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this inanity. perhaps those who participated in this movie could have taken some lessons at the sunset carson school of acting.
