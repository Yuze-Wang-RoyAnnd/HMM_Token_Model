well, there you have it, another disillusion on my account. two, actually! first of all, even though i like to think of myself that i know a little something about 70's euro-exploitation and its most prolific contributors, i never heard about joseph w. sarno before. here's a guy who made over seventy rancid and cult-laden exploitation movies and i haven't seen a single one! how? why? what happened here? secondly, and even worse, just when you think to have found a new source for obscure cult movies, that director's most famous and supposed "masterpiece" turns out to be an irredeemably dull and irritating film. admittedly, lesbian vampire movies form a pretty insignificant sub genre as a whole, but some of them bath in ominous atmosphere and curious sensuality (like jos'e larraz' "vampyres" or harry k"ummel's "daughters of darkness"). joseph sarno's film has nothing to offer, except copious amounts of gratuitous nudity and even that becomes boring rather quickly. the events take place in a secluded old castle, hidden deep in the german mountains, where five centuries ago lived a malicious and bloodthirsty (literally) baroness. her loyal disciples still throw naked dance parties in the castle's catacombs, which are lit by penis-shaped candles
