i really wanted to love this show. i truly, honestly did.<br /><br />for the first time, gay viewers get their own version of the "the bachelor". with the help of his obligatory "hag" andra, james, a good looking, well-to-do thirty-something has the chance of love with 15 suitors (or "mates" as they are referred to in the show). the only problem is half of them are straight and james doesn't know this. if james picks a gay one, they get a trip to new zealand, and if he picks a straight one, straight guy gets $25,000. how can this not be fun?! take my hand, lets stroll: <br /><br />the most glaring problem with this show is the bachelor himself. james is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body, the one you'd probably give two glances towards at your local bar before grazing for greener pastures. why they chose to cast james as the leading man is beyond me. god knows there's so many other hotter and vivacious homosexual men out there dying to be on tv.<br /><br />aside from his rather average physical appearance, james is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk. even as such, he has this arrogant, smugly condescending aura about him. however, if james were standing up against a blank, white wall he'd meld right into in it. i honestly can't recall a single interesting or noteworthy thing james said during the course of the show. he is that boring and forgettable. in fact, one of the mates flat out advised him he wasn't feeling a connection. i thought that was the best part of the show. also, james speaks with an excruciatingly annoying lilt. sound feminine or sound masculine, but don't ****ing segue tones in the middle of sentences...so painful to sit through. i hated him so much all throughout the show i kept thinking, "please choose a straight guy and humiliate yourself and your unfortunate looking hag"<br /><br />then we have the suitors. a remarkably bland bunch of men who don't seem to care either way what is happening. equally vapid, they seem to be indistinguishable from one guy to the next except, "hey that guy has blond highlights or oh that one has curly hair" again, astoundingly inept casting decisions seem to be the aim of this show. while it may be hackneyed to type cast roles, it would've been a lot more entertaining to watch than these amorphous drones. however, in all their banality they still manage to upstage james (which isn't all that hard to do anyway), slightly that is. you know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man. and the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around each other than with the leading man? very sad.<br /><br />also, i just thought that id point something mentioned on the message boards which i felt was actually true: the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys. <br /><br />don't get me wrong, im not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring, as a matter of fact i found some of them very cute. it's just that overall they were just blah compared to the men you'd see on shows like a shot at love with tila tequila or the bachelorette.<br /><br />i don't know how many times i hit fast forward during this show. i can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box, i can accept the mundane, apathetic suitors but please for the love of god entertain me just a little. no such luck.<br /><br />if you're expecting drama, intrigue, sexiness, or excitement you will be severely disappointed. the biggest "drama" comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a boyfriend in new york (how scandalous!). as titillating as that may be i guarantee you, that is the only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show.<br /><br />sure there is the twist, but if you have any semblance of gaydar in you, you'll easily discern who's who (it wasn't hard at all, i was only wrong once.) this show is stacking so much of its chips on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else.<br /><br />we get to watch as james & co plod along such exciting activities such as learning how to western step dance, shopping for gifts, visiting a petting zoo, and gay karaoke. yawn. sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway. that's one of main problems with the show: no one seems to be enjoying themselves--they are there just going through the motion trying mightily hard to appear to have a good time. and you really cant blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lame.<br /><br />finally, the physical aspect is not there. there's no cuddling, no caressing, no kissing (!), no endearment of any sort. it's just "ok that was a boring date, im gonna go back to my ugly, tacky wanna-be sydney operahouse dwelling (quick peck on the lips) cya." this show is so ****ing prudish it's ridiculous. i can understand them not wanting to play up the perceived indiscretionary nature of homosexual men, but come the **** on. people who watch reality tv shows are gonna want more than standoffish hugs and curt kisses. this show refuses to compromise.<br /><br />sorry if this was long winded but i felt these were issues that needed to be addressed. i do commend bravo for first putting up a show of this nature, but the staggeringly incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind boggling. to summarize my three points: boring + boring + boring = go do something else. you'll have more fun waiting at a doctor's office for an appointment, at least they have interesting magazines there.
