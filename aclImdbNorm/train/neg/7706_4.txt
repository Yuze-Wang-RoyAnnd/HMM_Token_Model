the same night that i watched this i also watched "scary movie 4," making for one messed up double feature. unfortunately for these killer tomatoes they could not stand up to the laugh riot that is the scary movie franchise. while i fought boredom here watching jokes that were silly and stupid, brutally dated and brutally bad, the more recent parody had me laughing out loud. how could i desire any more than that. director john de bello uses the basic premise that some sort of growth hormone has gone terribly wrong and turned the tomatoes into killers. but his main objective here is to slap around the disaster movie genre that was so big back in the day. the script reeks of stoner humor, and perhaps if you take illegal substances with your movie nights this could be your cup of tea. i, sober, was stuck watching a grown man go under cover as a tomato. and that one joke, that is never funny, where the discrepancy between the japanese speaking actor and the voice over is also here. some may giggle, i did not. they even had a hitler joke that wasn't funny, and i thought all hitler jokes were funny.<br /><br />the narrative of this film is so splintered (for no good reason) that it is nearly impossible to explain. tomatoes kill people, the government tries to stop it, bad jokes are told. their aim may have been correct as their targets include the media, consumerism, and paranoia (three things that still control our lives today). oddly enough the main selling point of this film, those gosh darn tomatoes, really don't make much of an appearance. and when they do, get this, they're played by real tomatoes. that washed up gimmick did nothing for me as i get very little out of watching a pack of tomatoes devour a body thanks to the magic of stop action camera tricks. there is also a fear of going for broke at work here that prevents this film from being truly funny. the gag of having somebody fall asleep in nearly every scene may please some audience members, but more than likely it will be seen as an invitation to join in the fun.<br /><br />i might also add that there does seem to be some old fashioned human egotism at work here. man eats tomato and that's dinner, tomato eats man and that is a worldwide catastrophe. but that is just the way the world works. in the film the produce becomes evil because of genetic modification, but in the real world our produce (see: taco bell) becomes evil thanks to neglect. and like those evil doin' green onions this film's shelf life expired a long time ago. there are a few good chuckles to be had. the last shot was really quite splendid, but it was nowhere near enough to save this moderate stink bomb. i'm pretty sure there is a good movie buried deep within this concept, but the script needed to be filtered through about a dozen rewrites to get there. and by "there" i mean to the level of "scary movie 4." **1/4
