well that's 90 minutes of my life i won't get back. this movie makes teen tv show "california dreams" look like "almost famous". the acting was horrid and storyline unrealistic. don't even get me started on the actual band at the forefront of this story, lame songs, look etc.. you had to believe that they were one of the hottest bands in the country, and there isn't enough irony in the world to accept that one. the guitarist is seen to be a heroin user, not that i blame him, if i was around such a putrid band with stale songs and wooden acting i'd be injecting the horse too.<br /><br />if you take music remotely seriously, avoid this at all costs.
