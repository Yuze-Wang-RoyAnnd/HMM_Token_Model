one of my best friends brought this movie over one night with the words 'wanna watch the worst horror movie ever?' i always enjoy a good laugh at a bad horror flick and said yes. i had expected your typical cheesy b-slasher but this was beyond b. this is z-slasher, the lowest of the low. with obviously low budget, extremely bad acting, bad lightning, no plot, really bad so-called 'special effects', shaky cameras and a horrible soundtrack this makes movies like house of wax look like oscar-winning masterpieces. the only good thing about it is about 15 seconds of one of the characters getting topless - she had some very nice tits. most of what i said during this film was along the lines of 'wow this is actually so bad', 'this is the worst movie ever' and 'i'm not drunk enough for this'. so in conclusion: don't waste your time (or money!).
