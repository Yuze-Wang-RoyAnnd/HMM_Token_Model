i was willing to go with the original _cruel intentions._ it went along with the plot and stayed true to the characters of one of my favorite stories. however, this movie was, in my opinion, a crummy rehash with essentially the same story line and no clear character choices. i didn't honestly care what happened to any of them. the strongest part of the original story (les liasons, not ci) is the characters and their interactions, not the events themselves. i wasn't clear until i read the imdb that this movie was meant to be a prequel, especially since the title includes a number "2," i expected a sequel, but then determined that it must be a companion piece. over all, i must say that this movie read, to me at least, like a soft porn version of les liasons. i was not impressed.
