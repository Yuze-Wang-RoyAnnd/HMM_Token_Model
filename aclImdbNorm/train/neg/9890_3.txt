another rape of history<br /><br />this movie is a catastrophe; it just uses a historic story and makes a sweet love story, with bad acting and low budget production.<br /><br />the movie should be 1/3 the time, they just dragged the time to make a mini series.<br /><br />the battle scenes are so stupid and illogical, the solders log stupid, the costumes a catastrophe. the romans were good in fighting in opened areas, one of their armies was completely destroyed by the germans when they tried to fight in a forest, in this movie the romans choose to fight in side the city, i mean get real.<br /><br />and by the way cleopatra was from a macedonian origin, which means a light skinned person.
