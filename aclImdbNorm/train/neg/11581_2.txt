this is a genuinely horrible film. the plot (such as it is) is totally undecipherable. (i think it has something to do with blackmail, but i'm not entirely certain.)<br /><br />half of the dialogue consists of useless cliches. the other half is spoken by the various actors in such unintelligible imitations of "southern" accents that (thankfully) the words cannot be recognized.<br /><br />but the one true tragedy of the movie is that such a historic talent as mary tyler moore apparently was in such dire financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in it.<br /><br />
