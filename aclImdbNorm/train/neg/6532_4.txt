the film begins with people on earth discovering that their rocket to mars had not been lost but was just drifting out in space near out planet. when it's retrieved, one of the crew members is ill, one is alive and the other two are missing. what happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member.<br /><br />while on mars, the crew was apparently attacked by a whole host of very silly bug-eyed monsters. oddly, while the sets were pretty good, the monsters were among the silliest i have seen on film. plus, in an odd attempt at realism, the production used a process called "cinemagic". unfortunately, this wonderful innovation just made the film look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of mars and the intensity of the redness practically made my eyes bleed--it was that bad!! despite all the cheese, the film did have a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message about space travel. for lovers of the genre, it's well worth seeing. for others, you may just find the whole thing rather silly--see for yourself and decide.<br /><br />while by today's standards this isn't an especially good sci-fi film, compared with the films being made at the time, it stacks up pretty well.<br /><br />ps--when you watch the film, pay careful attention to dr. tremayne. he looks like the spitting image of dr. quest from the "jonny quest" cartoon! plus, he sounds and acts a lot like him, too.
