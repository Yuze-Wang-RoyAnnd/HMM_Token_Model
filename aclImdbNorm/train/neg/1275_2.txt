this is a horrible movie. all three stories are bracketed with a psychiatrist hypnotist line which is unnecessary and all the stories are bad. the first is about wild wolves and some lady, there are some things that don't make sense, but the hypnotism thing makes up for that. the second one, with bad bill paxton as a maniac roommate should not be viewed by anyone. the last one, sadly the best is almost incomprehensible which i guess makes it better than the other garbage.
