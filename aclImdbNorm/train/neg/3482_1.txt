so, i know that i voted 1 out of 10 but really this deserves no more than half of a star. i hated it. it was so stupid and unrealistic, i can't believe any of the stars signed on to make this ridiculously absurd project.<br /><br />james g. and cathrine o'hara were excellent in their characters and ben affleck and christina applegate were just as good too, but the story sucked and i encourage anyone who sees this in the video store to not even bother picking it up and reading the back cover, but to just walk away...i don't even want to get into what the movie is about, because it is too stupid to pontificate about.<br /><br />don't rent this! it's horrible! horrible!
