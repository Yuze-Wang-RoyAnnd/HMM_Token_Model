this is a terrible, terrible film!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />first of all tooo long. the longest movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />the stories are all too damn over the top!!!!<br /><br />as a matter of fact there are too many stories that the story line is ruined.<br /><br />the comedy wasn't comedy!!!!! it wasn't funny at all....<br /><br />the story is so repulsive and badly written that it doesnot matter if the characters live or die.......<br /><br />i had some expectations from this movie......... but my expectations were crashed completely in the first few minutes......<br /><br />the only thing good about this movie is the music...... and obviously vidya balan. she gives the best performance and stands out among all the senior actors...... she's just a new comer and yet she shines and makes the rest of the cast look so pathetic!!!!! govinda and the blonde who playes his love interest also help saving this disastrous movie. govinda perfectly fits in the role of the taxi driver. and the blonde also gives a very subtle and consistent performance....<br /><br />another talented actress ayesha takiya is completely wasted in this movie!!!! so is priyanka!!!!!!!!! akshay does his role well but it seemed too over the top!!!!! anil and juhi are also totally wasted......<br /><br />the only one not wasted is salman because he has no talent what so ever to be wasted!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />all in all this is a very impossible movie with mishmashed screenplay and tooo masladar that the storyline is shaped according to the stupid comedy scenes. imagine how stupid this movie is!!!!!!<br /><br />3/10 it is four hours long!!!! think and rethink before going to the cinemas!!!!! better avoid it!!!!!
