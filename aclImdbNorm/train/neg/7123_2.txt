welcome to a bad ghost story and someone's nightmare. this horror tale finds a newly married husband(john hudson)and wife(peggy weber)haunted by the memory of his previous wife and screaming skulls found throughout their empty mansion and lily pond. is the husband really trying to drive his already anxious bride insane? or is it the learning challenged gardener mickey(alex nicol)who has taken care of the mansion's grounds since the death of the original mistress of the house? this low budget horror flick has a story line that keeps you involved all the way the finale. special effects are pretty bad even at 1958 standards. i swear at times the screaming skull sounds much like it should be in a godzilla movie. also in the cast as reverend snow is character actor russ conway. by the way...the lurking gardener(nicol)is the film's director. you can catch this as part of amc's monsterfest.
