it's been close to ten years since i've seen either of the last two sequels to "phantasm" - surely due to my still vivid remembrance of them not being very good. that being acknowledged to this day, i'm still a huge fan of the first two installments so i thought i'd go back and re-experience the 'final chapters'. part three is definitely the worst of the series since it obviously takes itself less seriously and throws in a bunch of confusing stuff that doesn't make much sense... again, kicking off right where the previous movie left us, reggie saves mike from the tall man who vows to come back for him later, but things aren't safe for long when they come across jody who is inexplicably able to the take the form of a sphere. apparently his soul is held prisoner by the tall man so mike is then dragged into the sinister double-pronged netherworld and reg has to find him... along the way, he meets up with a ten year-old kid and a nun-chuck wielding black chick named rocky who assist him throughout his journey.<br /><br />there's really nothing memorable about "phantasm iii" other than how stupid and forcefully "humorous" it tries to be. only one positive aspect that didn't even help the movie and that was the return of a. michael baldwin and bill thornbury who reprise their roles for the first time since the original 1978 classic. the problem is, they pretty much make cameo appearances... reggie banister is of course back in his starring role, but his bumbling, love-sick attitude makes his presence far too annoying to like. angus scrimm also just didn't seem entirely "into" his role. he talks too much here and is nowhere near as menacing and creepy in contrast with the "quirkiness" that the movie seemed to carelessly resort to. most people's opinion on this flick seem pretty impassive and tend to think "it's still entertaining". maybe i'm just too much of a nit picker but i just couldn't get into this one. i remember disliking it when i was a kid and after re-watching it - i can safely say - nothing has changed. don coscarelli rocked the scene with his original low-budget, nightmarish, legendary film "phantasm", which i still rank as my top favorite horror flick and his respectable sequel kept things moving and darkly surreal and gory, but "lord of the dead" (stupid title) just looked too rushed and slapped together to me... the inclusion of the two new characters, tim and rocky (the only thing missing was scrappy doo!!), was a strong indication of coscarelli running out of ideas and seeing how far he could ride the franchise...<br /><br />so, it's a "phantasm" movie with very little gore, nudity, and quadruple-barrel shot guns. need i say more?
