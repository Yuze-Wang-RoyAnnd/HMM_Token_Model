steve martin should quit trying to do remakes of classic comedy. he absolutely does not fit this part. like the woeful remake of the out of towners, this movie falls flat on it's face. how anybody ever thought steve martin could even come close to jack lemmon's wonderful performance is beyond me and the same is true for this movie. dan ackroyd could have played the bilko part better. martin is great when doing his own original characters but fails miserably trying to recreate other people's classic work. it's a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of the credits when the movie is over. the line "the producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation by the united states army" was just about the only line that actually made me laugh. if you want to see the real bilko, get hold of the original episodes of the phil silvers show. those are guaranteed to make you laugh, unlike this mistake that should never have happened. i put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned lemmon classic and the remake of psycho. none of them should ever have happened.
