i didn't think it was possible for a horror comedy film to fail so abysmally on both fronts....really awful. the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously (usually a good thing) works against it, primarily because the actors are so wooden you really would swear they are reading cue cards. on the upshot though.....the mst3k version, as always, has a few laughs....
