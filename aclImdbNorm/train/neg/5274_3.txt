if you like movies about creepy towns, hotels, houses, states (ala the eagles "hotel california"), etc. that possess the people that are "just passing through," read almost any stephen king novel instead. if you like the setting of "disappearance" start by reading king's "desperation" but also check out "the shining", "salem's lot" and "needful things."<br /><br />the crow motif, the desert, the family driving in desperation to escape or avoid possession are tired. why didn't they just make the film from the "desperation" novel? maybe they approached king and he nixed? must be.<br /><br />susan dey and harry hamlin look happy to be reunited and they have both worn well over the years, but they're still tv and direct-to-dvd caliber actors.
