i can not believe i wasted my money to rent this movie. i thought it was a porn flick when it started and it never got any better. the acting, the music drowning out the actors. horrible. save your money! you have to read the movie all the way through b\c they knew the music would drowned out the speaking lines. i never got the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being butchered. what did that have to do with the "real" btk killer? i understand why there were no famous actors\actresses in this movie. the script would have turned me away within the first page of reading. you would be better off watching paint dry.
