while this outing certainly doesn't live up to its predecessor, it does have more than its share of memorable moments. my personal favorite, just after laying waste to a city block with his "videodisc cannon," we see a close up of nimoy's face. as a single tear sheds from his left eye, we know at that point that nimoy is more than just a killing machine. the viewer can't help but be pulled into his emotional turmoil and we understand that his previously flat affect was only a facade. absolute brilliance!!! the sex scenes display a nice balance, carnal, but not pornographic. afterwards, i felt i had a pretty good understanding of how to work the magnavision videodisc player. too bad they haven't produced them in over 25 years.
