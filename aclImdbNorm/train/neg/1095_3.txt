i watched this a few days ago, so details are getting hazy. the film is shot on hand-held cameras, and a lot was made of this at the time it was released originally, since we hadn't had many studio pictures made in this way. i can't help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything, designed to make the audience think that what we are seeing on the screen hasn't had all the compromises that come with a big budget, and so was more "real". however what we have here isn't much more than a not-as-good rip off of the first half of full metal jacket, so anyone who has seen that, or any one of the other rip offs there of, will know what to expect.<br /><br />the main problem i had was the stereotyped characters, with the weedy soft kids out of their depth, close harmony singing, ebonics spouting black dudes, world weary sergeants, bitter and twisted psychos etc etc... all being put into the sorts of situations that would provide the most friction and tension at any given time. maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation, maybe it was laziness, or maybe it was just a committee trying to appeal to the biggest audience, all i know is it was annoying. one novel thing was the mixture of volunteers and draftees (where normally all the characters would have been forced into the situation,) although only the scenes between the two main characters really make much play of it. this seems to be the main pivot of the plot, with the volunteers coming to their senses and the draftees gaining a sense of duty and self worth, but its all done in a rather forced and unsubtle way. the other big bug i had was how all the characters (with the exception of the psychos and the real softies) would react to each inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threats of violence, faced with farrell's ubiquitous stoicism, immediately back down and be all reasonable and diplomatic.<br /><br />i guess if i had to find a plus it would be the acting from the two leads, which was strong and very convincing, tho considering the formulaic nature of the characters, this wasn't too hard.<br /><br />in my imagination, bozz grew up to be zeke off tour of duty, and for my money, 4 episodes of that would be more fun to watch.
