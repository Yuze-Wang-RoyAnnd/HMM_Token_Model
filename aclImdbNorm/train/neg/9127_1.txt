ok so here's the basic plot. it is 1933, peter sellers is dr fu manchu, a 168 year old chinese man who has lived quite a long time. the film opens with his birthday in which he celebrates by drinking a special elixir that (even the film never mentions) prolongs his life. well on this occasion the elixir is clumsily dropped by an assistant (kato if you remember the pink panther movies) and he orders his minions to then go find 6 rare items to make the elixir. this creates a global man hunt in which his henchmen end up robbing museums of diamonds and venturing into london, to meet up with dr fu's nemisis, a retired scotland yard detective nayland smith, also played by sellers who tries to stop him in what is suppose to be a witty comedic adventure.<br /><br />this was apparantly sellers last full length feature film that he made before he died. the terrible tragedy is that he was in it. sellers who is such a gifted comedian and has had memorable 'funny' roles in the panther movies and particualrly in the movie 'the party', is anything but that in this film. this film was absolute torture to sit through and i couldn't even finish it. he completly dies and i kept cringing while watching sellers performance. after coming of the great work of 'being there' a year earlier how, i mean how can he make this and how did this thing even get made??? like one person mentioned the first 10..15 minutes are ok but then it is all downhill...<br /><br />avoid like the plague.<br /><br />rating 1 out of 10.
