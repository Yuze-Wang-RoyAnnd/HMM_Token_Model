this movie isn't terrible, really. somebody commented that mo is the type of american europeans snicker at. but there are those, and not necessarily anglo-saxon yahoos, who do not care for frenchmen; and the xavier character isn't going to sway them.<br /><br />let's consider his stereotypical frenchman attributes:<br /><br />1). cynical - very cynical. check.<br /><br />2). reedy, underfed appearance, check, despite:<br /><br />3). a great appreciation of cuisine. check.<br /><br />4). lukewarm work ethic. check. (forget the fact he is supposedly a rich stockbroker, from watching him in the film he seems to put in ten hour workweeks.) <br /><br />5). beautiful wife, check. despite that:<br /><br />6). loose interpretation of the marriage vows. check.<br /><br />7). big sexual ego, which says an american girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner. check.<br /><br />whether mo is a hick or not, there's no reason for her to fall for this smug european twit other than the script dictates so.<br /><br />on the other hand, as other male reviewers have, i did enjoy seeing karen allen's cute, petite body. i'll give the movie four stars; two of them are for that.
