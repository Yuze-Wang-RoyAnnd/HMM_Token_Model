what made me track this movie down was the viewing vampyres, i thought i have to get the other movies this guy (larroz) has made, i was sorry i tracked this down,it is a weak attempt at an occult/satanic type movie laden with sex and only sex(with ugly actors and actresses, this is an excuse for sleaze. the only redeeming factor was the setting and atmosphere, avoid this one, too much hype surrounds it, not worth the effort of finding it, this refers to the welcome to the grind house edition. i hope he has some other movies which lives up to vampyres, oh and the goat scene was very boring, i understand that this is what carries the hype.
