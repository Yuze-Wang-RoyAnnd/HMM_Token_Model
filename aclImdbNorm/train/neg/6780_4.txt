this film was a critical and box-office fiasco back in 1957. it was based on a novel which was later turned into a play--which flopped on broadway. the story is about some navy officers on leave in san francisco during wwii. they have 4 day's leave which they spend at the mark hopkins hotel. the film meanders a lot and none of the characters seem very real. cary grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama--but here he plays a sort of wheeler dealer and he doesn't really pull it off. tony curtis or james garner would have been better choices. audrey hepburn was initially set to play opposite grant, but had other commitments--so suzy parker stepped in. she had never acted before, but was america's top photographic model at the time. i think that she did a good job, considering all the pressure that she was under. grant's pairing with jayne mansfield in a few brief scenes--did not really work. the studio was trying to give her some class by acting with grant--but the character had no substance at all.
