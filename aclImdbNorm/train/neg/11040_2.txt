you need to watch this show once to have seen them all, the formula is exactly the same in each episode. jim does something his way he means well but he upsets his wife, at the end she finds out that what he did was really for her, she caresses his cheek and gives a gummy smile while he looks on bashfully. in fact the story lines are so lame and formulaic that i'll take a stab at one now.<br /><br />episode 'valentines pay'<br /><br />jims wife notices that all of jims weekly pay has disappeared, he then explains to her he lost it at the casino. she screams and leaves the house lamenting how awful he is. then on valentines day he turns up in a limo with tickets to a ball (hence explaining the missing wages). she realizes 'her' mistake and the usual 'oh jim, you're so lovely'. ..the end<br /><br />another very obvious item is the fact that jims character is based on homer simpson who as a cartoon character can get away with being belligerent and ignorant, when this is attempted with human beings it does not work and jim just comes over as an arrogant self centered jerk. <br /><br />imo the only reason that this is successful is simply because we're so many now in terms of human beings with tvs, these days you could make a show about a man who insulates walls and you'd get an audience.<br /><br />'two and a half men' on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious.
