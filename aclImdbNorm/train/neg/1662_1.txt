this is no doubt one of the worst movies i have ever seen. this makes your run of the mill tv movie look like reservoir dogs. based on a book by the one and only britney spears and her mother this is trash with nothing bar a reasonable performance from virginia madsen (i hope you got paid well) to save it. the story of a red neck country gill who wins a scholarship in a prestigious music school is little but a vehicle to pedal ms spears pants music to the consumer and to generally agree that low brow must be the way. there is nothing good going on here with all the beats as predictable as night following day. never ever again.
