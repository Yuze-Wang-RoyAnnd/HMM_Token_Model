this is a complete hoax...<br /><br />the movie clearly has been shot in north western indian state of rajasthan. look at the chase scene - the vehicles are indian; the writing all over is hindi - language used in india. the drive through is on typical jaipur streets. also the palace is in amer - about 10 miles from jaipur, rajasthan. the film-makers in their (about the film) in dvd bonus seem to make it sound that they risked their lives shooting in kabul and around. almost all of their action scenes are shot in india. the scene where they see a group singing around fire is so fake that they did not even think about changing it to afgani folk song. they just recorded the rajasthani folk song. how do i know it because i have traveled that area extensively. they are just on the band-wagon to make big on the issue. i do challenge the film makers to deny it.
