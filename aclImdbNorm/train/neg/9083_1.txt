it was so terrible. it wasn't fun to watch at all. even the scene where the girl is using a vibrator, even that's not fun to watch in this movie. i say again, the scene where a girl is masturbating with a vibrator is not even fun to watch. or maybe if that was the only part of the movie that you watched, just girl on couch using a vibrator. maybe they should have just released that one scene in theaters, maybe then the movie would be enjoyable on a certain level. my advice, fast forward to that point, watch it, rewind the movie, watch it again, rewind, repeat. maybe you could enjoy yourself for 2 hours that way. this movie ranks alongside i spit on your grave and doom generation in the category of worst movies that i have ever seen.
