jet li, is one of the best hand to hand combat fighters in the world. he has been for over 20 years and he puts others in the genre to shame. while he is big in asia, he is almost unknown here in the us.<br /><br />black mask is supposed to be a breakout movie for him, but it fails horribly. first of all, it is dubbed. while it may have camp value (the dubbing isn't even close and it is flat in tone), it seems inappropriate for the ordinary movie viewer. secondly, the director in this movie, daniel lee, does a horrible job. he cuts scenes so fast, at times, you don't know what's going on. other times, the camera shakes and wobbles. fans see jet li's movies for the fantastic martial arts. however, the director edits the scenes so fast that you don't even know who's who half the time! other times, a scene is left hanging (ie li is beginning to cut a hole in the floor of a jeep, while the badguys arm their guns, two seconds later, both li and the love interest are already under the car!) other scenes are so improbable, that they cross over the point of being completely ridiculous (killer cd roms? just give him throwing stars!!!!). li, needs a director who is less prone to machine gun cutting and more to creating a cinematic mise-a-scene. the added rap/techno music goes from being okay to intrusive. the plot has possibilities but are all squandered by cartoonish characters that take away from any credibility that this movie strives for. and are we really to believe that the love interest would not recognize simon, because he has a half mask on? wouldn't the hair, lower jaw, or voice give it away?<br /><br />if you want to see a jet li movie, try iron monkey or his classic shaolin temple. this disjointed mess is a complete waste of time.....2/10
