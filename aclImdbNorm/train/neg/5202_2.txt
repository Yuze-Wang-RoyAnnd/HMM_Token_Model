contains spoilers the movie plot can be summarized in a few sentences: three guys go hunting in the forest. two of them along other people get shot in the head without explanation. the last guy can stand in the clear, shout and do anything without getting shot. he gets to walk through an old factory and has the evil people walk right into his scope without a struggle. the villains are conveniently dressed in black and look like villains.<br /><br />that is the whole story, not summarized but in detail. everything is drawn out with a guy standing ringing a door bell. we wait with him. long shot of guys being bored in the woods and sleeping. we can take a nap with them. the one drawn out shot of following a female jogger could have been redeeming, if we could see her butt or boobs bouncing.<br /><br />there dialog is less then terminator and it is not because there is so much action. the characters just don't talk. and, then they don't even have something corny to say like 'i'll be back.' if my buddy shot this on the weekend, i'd cheer for him, because it is quite a feat to figure out the camera controls. to pay money to rent this as a dvd is totally inappropriate.<br /><br />the one thing that is a little funny is the extra with the director telling, how they local police didn't realize that they were shooting and treated them like a random guy walking around with a gun. if they'd have filmed that, i'd be sure it would be more fun to watch then the movie.
