the only reason "the norliss tapes" deserves any stars is the presence of angie dickinson in the cast. other than getting to see angie baby in a pre-"police woman" performance, there's nothing else worth seeing here.<br /><br />the synopsis:<br /><br />*** minor spoilers ***<br /><br />david norliss is tapped to write a book on the supernatural. one day he mysteriously disappears after phoning his publisher and suggesting he has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger. the entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the "norliss tapes" -- a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural.<br /><br />in the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies -- but not before purchasing an ancient egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death. we soon discover the ring itself doesn't grant immortality. instead, it only reanimates the sculptor's corpse, allowing him to escape his crypt so he can run around town draining pretty girls of all their blood.<br /><br />blue-faced, yellow-eyed and growling out arrrghhhhhhs you haven't heard since you last watched "scooby doo" cartoons, the sculptor attacks his wife (dickinson) one dark night. she escapes and, via a mutual acquaintance, contacts norliss to get his assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband's uncanny reappearance on her estate.<br /><br />so is this guy a vampire? no. there's no vampire in this story despite what you may have read or heard. the sculptor doesn't drink his victims' blood -- he collects it. how? don't know. we only see him attacking, never collecting. why? to fulfill the second part of his bid for immortality. it turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if he builds a life-size statue of a demon named sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood. once it's finished, sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as his gateway into our world.<br /><br />the final analysis:<br /><br />"the norliss tapes" wasn't picked up as a series for a very good reason... it was garbage. as you can see from my synopsis, the story is a paltry, ill-conceived mess. the acting and dialogue offer no better. this isn't even a contender for a "so bad it's good" award. sometimes bad is just bad.<br /><br />after years of hearing underground rumblings about the great merits of "the norliss tapes," i was very excited to find it airing on fox movie channel on 10/15/03. i wish i hadn't set myself up for the fall.<br /><br />having screened this groaner for the first time two days ago, i can only assume any applause you've heard so far from other imdb reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth. or perhaps they are simply loyal fans of dan curtis. either way, they've offered you misleading reviews of "the norliss tapes."<br /><br />pauly orchid -- october 17, 2003
