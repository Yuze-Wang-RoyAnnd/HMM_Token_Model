worst de niro scorsese collaboration in this horrible agonizing violent overlong mess. scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with the horror cliched suddenly loud phone ringing and door slamming gimmicks that seem laughable and embarrassing coming from such a master craftsman. the cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced. nick noltie plays the wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone ! de niro's psychotic bowden is nothing more than the typical 90's movie psycho killer. the scene with de niro and lewis early on is very awkward and the climax goes on and on and we should all be more than tired of the on psycho stalker that never dies. one of my most horrible movie experiences. rent the original it's 100 times better. <br /><br />
