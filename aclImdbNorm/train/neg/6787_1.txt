i'm sorry to report that i have seen this film several times. when it bombed at the box office, it was repeated nightly for about a month on hbo. and i watched it over and over because television in general is so bad--or was at that time. i no longer watch, so it might be wonderful now--like samuel l jackson says about swine, "it might taste like sweet potato pie, but i'll never know because i wouldn't eat the filthy mfer." let's see. dudley plays arthur wandering in the desert, always a few steps behind moses. it came out right after life of bryan, so you can guess where the inspiration for this came from. the few mildly funny bits go on way too long until you just close your eyes and grit your teeth. there's one scene where arthur and dom deluise meet in the desert, both of them dragged out and dessicated, dying of thirst. then they meet like old acquaintances who didn't really know each other very well, promise to do lunch. it could have been funny.<br /><br />but the scene that i remember most clearly is a meeting with pharaoh in which pharaoh is a black street kid done up in full king tut regalia. he must have read the lines straight because at some point before the release, they overdubbed his scene with the hollywood equivalent of black street lingo voiced by a jimmy walker wannabe (kid dyno-wannabe). or it might have been jimmy walker--who knows? who cares. they managed to turn an essentially boring scene into a very racist, very unfunny, very long piece of excrement, one of those legendary things that just won't flush, no matter how many times you try, so you leave it there for someone else to deal with.<br /><br />well that's my review. if you rent this movie (don't buy it, whatever you do!) prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and a six pack of corona.<br /><br />now that they've remade the poseiden adventure, this one is probably high on the list for remakes. maybe they'll hire a comedy writer this time.
