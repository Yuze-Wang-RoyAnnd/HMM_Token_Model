this review applies for the cut of the film that's generally available as "fury of the wolfman". i understand there is an uncut version out there with additional footage, and i would hope that it contained at least eight or nine crucial scenes that seem to be missing from the cut known as "fury of the wolfman". in short, the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. it is utter nonsense, and incomprehensible nonsense at that.<br /><br />waldemar daninsky, that venerable lycanthropic antihero portrayed by paul naschy in a seemingly endless series of films, is apparently a normal guy who has just come back from a trip to tibet, where he was attacked by a yeti. somehow this has turned him into a werewolf. daninsky is a doctor, a scientist, and an instructor at what appears to be a college. one of his female colleagues, ilona elmann, is involved in a vague form of hypnosis..."chematodes", a nonsense word used to refer to a bunch of wires attached to a victim's head. ellman feels this will enable her to "change the direction of the human brain", naturally enabling her to rule the world, provided she can get us all attached to those wires with no trouble.<br /><br />elmann is also into werewolves, because she kidnaps daninsky and takes him to her hidden laboratory. she has a bunch of other people trapped there as well. some of them look like gypsies, and are chained up, being in varying states of lucidity. others are clearly hippies. elmann feels that one day she may be able to "help them be human again" (?), but in the meantime she controls them with her chematodes. waldemar becomes her hairy hit man, wandering around like a werewolf zombie--that is until the filmmakers decide to use footage spliced in from another naschy werewolf film, "frankenstein's bloody terror" (don't ask), at which point naschy's werewolf makeup changes considerably and he lurches around like an animal.<br /><br />is this making any sense? no? good. that's the film's saving grace. it doesn't try and engage you on any kind of intellectual level, it just goes full speed ahead with whatever nonsense dialogue or cheap horror movie sets it can muster up. "fury of the wolfman" may be the best halloween party movie ever. you absolutely do not need to pay attention to it, and in fact if you do, you will be completely confused.
