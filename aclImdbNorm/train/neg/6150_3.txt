i saw this movie with the intention of not liking it. i sure didn't. it's one of those movies that seems to have been made exclusively for the oscars: music throughout the film in almost every single frame, almost no profanity, set in a time long gone, sepia-toned imagery, pretentious title, no sex, and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in sfx/cgi so that we (the stupid audience) get it. one thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the nobel price wrong! instead they call the nobel-price (named after an actual person called alfred nobel) 'the noble-price'.. jesus! how can one make such a mistake in such a big production, supposedly based on a true story. what a sham! what were you and the others thinking ron?
