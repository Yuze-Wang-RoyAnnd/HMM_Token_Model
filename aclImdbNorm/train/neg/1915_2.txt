it's a pretty good cast, but the film has nowhere near the grace of the original italian comedy "big deal on madonna street" anyone looking for an entertaining caper film should visit the original. william macy may be one of our greatest living actors, but here he's put to little use. and his role in the original was played by marcello mastroianni, so i sort of feel sorry for him trying to fill those shoes. might as well try to imitate bogart or a young de niro. the art direction is rich and textured but brings nothing to the story, the extra bits they add to the story feel completely unnecessary and the things they take away are missed. even starting the way they do seems bizarrely gratuitous and takes away from the surprise of the original. sam rockwell has his odd and genial charm and luis guzman has that odd charisma, but the love story part of the movie just seems clunky and flat. it's too bad nobody has figured out how to make this movie as well as it was first made, but then again it's too bad we live in a culture where we feel like we need to remake amazing things instead of simply learning to savor the originals.
