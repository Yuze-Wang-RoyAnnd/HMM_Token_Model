just too many incidents of violence.<br /><br />the film goes from one scene to another, and in nearly every one violence erupts.<br /><br />now i am not one who is shocked by violence, and to me a film without a fight in it has something missing. but, please, not one after another. my reaction was not shock or horror, it was: "here we go again." there is some semblance of a story in between the scenes of violence, but two thirds of the way through the film i had switched off completely, and couldn't wait for the end.<br /><br />if this is the best the film makers can do, they should find something else to do with their miserable lives, like making shoes or delivering mail.
