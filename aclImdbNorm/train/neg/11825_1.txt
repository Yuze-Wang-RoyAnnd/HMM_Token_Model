this film is a flagrant rip-off of one of the best novels of all time, silas marner by george eliot.<br /><br />the details of the film shown on imdb do give acknowledgement to the original authoress but i did not see this at the beginning of the film, only a credit at the end of it saying "suggested by the book silas marner". suggested? it was nothing but a complete rip- off of all the essential elements of the story:<br /><br />a wronged and sad old man, an artisan, poor and lonely, has all his money stolen. one night a child wanders up to his door as her mother lies dying in the snow outside. the man takes her in and brings her up until one day the local squire (or rich politician here) demands to adopt the child. it is he who has fathered the child during an illicit affair years before. the battle then ensues as to who should have legal custody of the child.<br /><br />in this and every other aspect of the film, the story is exactly the same. in only one can i find a difference. silas marner had epilepsy - but perhaps that would have strained the acting abilities of mr martin too far. on top of that he has his hair dyed in some carrot juice concoction (presumably to make him look younger, but actually making him look more the clown that he is)! there is also the addition of meaningless jokes, that this offbeat comedian cannot resist bringing into the story which have no part in it and only detract from the profoundness of the story. like when the child cries in the courthouse declaring she can only be happy with the man who has fathered her all these years. this is conveyed in the film by the girl applying nasal decongestant to the bridge of her nose to make her tearful!<br /><br />i am surprised that legalities and integrity within the film industry permit such a film to be made. if i was a trustee of george eliot's i would insist on reparation. if i was steve martin i would send the profits to that estate, or to the poor. at the very least it should be entitled silas marner - adapted by s martin. or better still removed from the archives!<br /><br />if you are interested in this story - and i hope you are - dismiss this completely and watch silas marner. or read the book! the bbc made an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980's.
