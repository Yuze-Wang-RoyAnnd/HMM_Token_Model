i am a huge horror/splatter fan, i even enjoy horror films some people consider as stupid. i also like gore. the more the merrier as long as it has a point.<br /><br />after reading the other people's reviews on the site i was sure this film was going to be a little gem. but much to my disappointment it proved to be one of the most pointless films i've ever watched.<br /><br />the acting was terrible, the dialogs were stupid, the plot was pointless, the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the past 2 years. usually i find that all these characteristics make a great b horror movie . but not in this case.<br /><br />i waisted 11 eur to get this dvd. <br /><br />unless you actually enjoy pointless gore ( for example the "violent sh*t" films) avoid at any cost!
