this movie makes several mistakes. a few american actors in spain , and the spanish actors speaking english. the 'spaniards' english is ok, but the way the acting is performed it makes it all quite annoying. the dialog through the whole script is very weak; it may have been a spanish script but translated incorrectly, who knows and who cares. i can only assume that these are famous spanish actors forced into the english language , they may be good, but not in this flop. you will figure out the movie within the first 5 minutes, thats how pathetic it is. then the rest is just bad . lots of waste of time, lots of un-necessary plots. oh did i mention one of the baldwins' is in this.
