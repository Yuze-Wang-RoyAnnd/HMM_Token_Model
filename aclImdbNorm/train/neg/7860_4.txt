martin weisz, who directed the solid "rohtenburg", will be taking the heat, with wes craven, for another shabby "the hills have eyes 2". the memory of the legendary original, which boasted an unbelievable storyline and a dog having a flashback, will be erased forever by this more technically polished remake (in name only). a bunch of national guardsmen (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants. one by one the weekend soldiers are picked off. that's it. there is some hardcore violence and a reasonably brutal rape scene, but there is precious little else to get excited about. the film's "heroes" are the usual bunch of clich'es and the mutants, a far cry from craven's original "family", mostly resemble brian thompson from "cobra" coupled with some creatures stan winston had left over from the "wrong turn" shoot. much of the action takes place in caves, ala "the descent", and is well shot by sam mccurdy. a laughable aspect is wes and jonathan craven's addition of a sympathetic mutant who skulks around his cave like leatherface in hooper's original "chainsaw". weisz will be blamed for this dull debacle, but he's not really at fault because he does his best to maintain suspense and squeeze some freshness out of the contrived situations. not a fan, unfortunately.
