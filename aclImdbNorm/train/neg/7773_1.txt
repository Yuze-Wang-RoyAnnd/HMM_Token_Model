this movie had what sounded like a good premise: 9 people facing their fears to win one million dollars. unfortunately, it did not turn out to be a good movie. there are several scenes that are way too long and really pointless like the dancing scene. a few scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts. the acting is bad, but some of the lines are amusing in their awfulness. what's really strange is that towards the end of the movie it turns into like a 5 minute western, and at the end, the twists, of which their were several, don't make sense with the rest of the movie. it seemed as though the director just added stuff on because he thought it would look cool, while conveniently ignoring the plot of the movie up to that point. it just didn't make a lot of sense. the only creepy thing was the old people dancing down the hall, but that doesn't even come close to making up for the rest of this mess.
