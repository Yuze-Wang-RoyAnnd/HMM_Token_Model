this movie is about tyrannus, a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon tyrannus, a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead. tyrannus, we learn after about an hour, is also called demonicus. this adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity, psychology and ourselves. <br /><br />the spirit of tyrannus accomplishes his little to-do list (killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in latin) by possessing the body of a college guy. he uses a magic mind-control helmet to do this, which the college boy willingly puts on his head, and then at several points in the movie, takes off and puts back on.<br /><br />maria performs oral sex on a poor man's sean willian scott, and tyrannus wears the rollerball glove. tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no reason, and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this. utter misfortune.<br /><br />this movie is empty and will hurt you. see it.
