the storyline is absurd and lame,also sucking are performances and the dialogue, is hard to keep your eyes open. i advise you to have a caffeine-propelled friend handy to wake you in time for a couple gore-effects.why they bring alcatraz in?in this case,becomes increasingly difficult to swallow. all the while ,i wondered who this film aimed for?chock full of lame subplots (such as the cannibalism us army-captain)this is low-grade in every aspect.btw this movie is banned in germany!!
