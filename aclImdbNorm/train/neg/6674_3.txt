i'd have to admit that the draw of this movie is director eduardo sanchez, who helmed the wildly popular and successful blair witch project. besides, this is an alien movie of sorts, and sounded something like stephen king's dreamcatchers, one of those movies that the critics hated, but i enjoyed.<br /><br />but nope, unfortunately i felt that for the most parts, altered is a waste of time, so i shall keep this review short. premises are always promising, and altered's no different. it tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger, and as usual, others will take you as a nutcase imagining stuff. stories about alien abduction always have to deal with probes into the orifices, so i shall not go into details, but you get the drift it's damn uncomfortable, and something you'd like to forget.<br /><br />what if you're given a chance for revenge? that is, you manage to successfully hunt down, and capture one alive. what will you do? for this group, it's a gleeful payback time, or so they thought. and this is where the movie begins to develop into a snoozefest, with bad, uninspiring dialogue, and even worse acting. even if it's low budgeted, there aren't many redeeming factors, be it strength of storyline, or any help from the cast in making their characters just a tad interesting. it's the standard cardboard fare from a vanilla plain script, coupled with some cheap scare tactics employed.<br /><br />what's good though is the makeup. much effort has been put into making some of the stuff which i shan't mention, because that'll spoil just the few elements of what makes this movie tolerable. other than that, there are the usual cheap special effects, blood and gory moments which is nothing you've never seen before.<br /><br />watch this only as a last resort. compared to the other monster movie in town - feast, this one is less fun, and takes itself too seriously. bogged down by an uninspiring direction, you've been warned.
