this movie looks like it was made for tv . for years i waited for some movie to be made about rubin carter, because i loved to see him box at the old msg, and to see this movie was very disappointing.i have alot of respect for mr washington, but he was awful and boring.there is really nothing good to say about this movie except i did like the song.
