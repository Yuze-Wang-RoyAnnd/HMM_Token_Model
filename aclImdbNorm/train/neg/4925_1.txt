please don't waste your time. this movie rehashes the worst of bram stoker's dracula (van helsing), anne rice's vampire lestat (rock music and silly biblical references), and blade (high-tech toys). i really like vampire movies and novels, and there are many out there that are very good . but not this stinker. not even the soundtrack helps it, mostly because the movie resorts to ridiculous scary classical music rather than the "kick-ass metal" some reported. only a few times did i hear any metal; mostly it was tortured violins. avoid it like garlic and crucifixes.
