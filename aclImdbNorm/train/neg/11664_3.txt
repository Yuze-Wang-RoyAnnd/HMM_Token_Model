i wanted so much to enjoy this movie. it moved very slowly and was just boring. if it had been on tv, it would have lasted 15 to 20 minutes, maybe. what happened to the story? a great cast and photographer were working on a faulty foundation. if this is loosely based on the life of the director, why didn't he get someone to see that the writing itself was "loose". then he directed it at a snail's pace which may have been the source of a few people nodding off during the movie. the music soars, but for a different film, not this one....for soap opera saga possibly. there were times when the dialogue was not understandable when armin meuller stahl was speaking. i was not alone, because i heard a few rumblings about who said what to whom. why can't hollywood make better movies? this one had the nugget of a great story, but was just poorly executed.
