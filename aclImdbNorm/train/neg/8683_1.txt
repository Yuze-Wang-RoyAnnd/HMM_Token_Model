this show is not clever. that's basically what it boils down to. the "original humor" that these writers try to pull off to avoid completely biting off the rest of the worlds bush bashing is just unfunny. in another comment, someone quotes a couple hilarious lines. the standout for me was george h.w. bush telling the kids they're not supposed to watch any tv besides fox news. wow. i thought the episodes i saw were bad. the fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic.<br /><br />my problem with drivel like this sad excuse for political satire is that these folks are getting a second season. i'm a liberal republican and i know bush hasn't been a good president. we all do. but that's no excuse for putting out this utterly poopie waste of time. i place these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind 'meet the spartans'. their formula, bite off as many already unfunny topical jokes as you can and throw in even worse original material to actually be able to give yourself writing credit.<br /><br />again, just plain bad. unfunny, and it just makes me more and more unhappy that crap like this is renewed, but amazing and original shows like arrested development are canned after 3 solid seasons. please don't watch this crap, unless you're one of those green blooded liberal hippies who think any sentence with the words bush and dumb is comedic gold. <br /><br />oh, and the voice of bush sucks. all he does is slightly emulate a texan accent, and exhale really hard at the end of his sentences. at least south park admits the voices aren't accurate. if you want funny political satire, watch daily show/colbert. or look for any political sketches on robot chicken, which is fun to watch, since the stop motion action figure animation is extremely well done. look for the george bush as a jedi bit on youtube. priceless
