when i first saw this film i thought it was going to be a good sasquatch film. usually when you have these types of movies there's generally one sasquatch, but in this one there is like what? 7 or 10 of them?. acting was good, plot was ok, i liked the scenes where the sasquatch is killing the first few victims, very good camera work. i was expecting it to be a gory film but it was very little. this movie was way better than sasquatch. the sci-fi channel really needs to make more sasquatch films, i mean i really liked sasquatch mountain, abominibal was not good, the one i'm reviewing is ok, but the movie sasquatch was not, but i'm not reviewing that so let me get back on track. this movie is good for a rainy saterday afternoon, but for any other occasions, no.
