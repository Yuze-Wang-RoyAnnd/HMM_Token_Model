almost from the word go this film is poor and lacking conviction but then again most people would struggle to show commitment to a script as uninspiring as this. the dialogue really does not flow and sometimes as in this case more is less (or should have been). this is also backed-up by odd scenes (e.g. the cemetry slow-motion walk) that you think might lead somewhere but only seem to waste a few more seconds of your life.<br /><br />the plot is a strange combination of gangster / situation comedy which i am sure seemed a good idea at the time but if ever there was a case for someone needing to be honest with the scriptwriter then here was it.<br /><br />martin freeman is okay but then he seems to have one character which always plays so i am beginning to wonder if he was given a script or just filmed and told to react as normal.<br /><br />finally - humour. this reminds me of the 'python (i think) quote about shakespere, of his 'comedies' - if he had meant it to be humorous he would have put a joke in it. well i didn't see one.<br /><br />don't waste your time - i did because i was watching it with a friend and kept hoping that it was going to get better.<br /><br />it didn't.
