i could not, for the life of me, follow, figure out or understand the story. as the plot advances it too stays incomprehensible. i'm going to guess and say that there was a preproduction story/plot problem that never got sorted out. the producers could never separate the many details that the novel, or any novel, has the time and space to create from the other idea, which was to make a movie about a serial killer and the killer's pursuit by the police. they ended up with too many things happening in a proscribed feature film time limit. too bad really because they had a solid cast, a director who knows how to move things around and excellent cinematography. in fact, a well made movie that one could enjoy and relax with for a couple of hours.
