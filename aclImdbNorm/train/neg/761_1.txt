absolute garbage. the reason that this is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic. <br /><br />the supposed star didn't do anything to solve the case - and neither did anyone else really - it was just routine police work. utterly tedious.<br /><br />you sat right till the end hoping for a twist - and got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment. <br /><br />there was so much potential in having a relative in apparent kidnap. could the lt's personal involvement finally cloud his judgement? <br /><br />all the obvious signs were of a stranger doing it. but surely a genius like lt c, by constant conversation with the wronged husband, would gradually uncover a fiendish plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room while a masked groom surprises the bride, hides the body and then plants subtle clues. it could have been good. it was a complete waste of time.
