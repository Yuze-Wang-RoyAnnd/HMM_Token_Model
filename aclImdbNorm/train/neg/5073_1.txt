the teasers for tree of palme try to pass it off as a sort of allegory for a fairy tale with actual meaning, then immediately start raving about the animation. i should have known what that meant.<br /><br />the main character, palme, is a good example of the whole movie's problem. one minute, palme is a humble hero in search of himself, the next a violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once took care of.<br /><br />like all of the characters in the movie, palme is poorly defined. you do not bond with the characters at all, although shatta has acquired a couple of fan girls. it seems that the writer was more interested in cramming all the drama and complexity he could into this movie than actually exploring his characters' motivations and personalities.<br /><br />new, useless story lines were being introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the movie. the writer seriously needed to streamline his story. perhaps he was trying to be epic, but it was simply too much information for a two-hour movie. however i can't help but wonder if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been better suited for a tv series or graphic novel.<br /><br />in the last five minutes of the movie, i simply could not endure the sheer lack of quality any longer and began laughing at how contrived the characters, the relationships, and the whole plot was. i touched my companion and he started cracking up too, as did a young man seated behind us. we tried so hard to control ourselves, but we simply could not take the terrible quality of this movie.<br /><br />on the bright side, the animation is incredible and viewers will find themselves admiring the lush backgrounds and charming character designs. the animation almost guides you; when you don't care about the characters, it tells you how to feel.
