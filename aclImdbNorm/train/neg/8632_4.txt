i am a huge charlton heston fan. he is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time, but what was he thinking when he made this movie. normally if he made a bad movie i could blame it on the screenwriter or director, but in this case it's all him. the suckiness of this movie is all his fault. it proves that not even heston can make a shakespeare story interesting. i wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this snooze fest and i'll never get that time back. this is by far the worst heston movie that i've ever seen. if you are a shakespeare fan maybe you'll find this movie entertaining, but if you're not don't waste your time, you'll regret it in the long run.
