the opening scenes move as fluidly as frozen velveeta. the attempt at dramatic dialogue only makes me wish i had better control of the fast forward control. vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or mangy disgusting creatures. this vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost puppy. i usually tally a body count, so there was a cat (which doesn't count) a bum, a girl who fell out of the sky with a sword in her (whatever that was about) and then the plot. foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm, but using the sound of biting into an apple for a vampire biting a victim is just plain silly. i liked warlock, but this movie just stunk so bad that we turned it off, and it was so forgettable we rented it a year later only to turn it off again.
