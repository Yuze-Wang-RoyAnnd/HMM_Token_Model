this mini series, also based on a book by alex haley as was `queen', tried to use similar formulas, that is, constructing a long history following the lives of a family over many years. whereas in `queen' the result was masterful, here in mama flora the inspiration was lacking. firstly perhaps in the book itself, and most certainly in this tv production. too much is put in with too much haste over the years, such that the unfolding saga is shallow, superficial, not nearly so authentic as in `queen'. full marks for the scenification in the earlier parts of the film, which was prepared with great care, but as the film progressed it seemed to degenerate into a kind of dallasian-forsythian unpalatable mix in the last third of its three hours or so duration. i had hoped for more; but evidently haley was less inspired with this tale than his near-biographical `queen', and peter werner iii is no match for john erman. only recommendable for those who have an appetite for these lengthy tales of generations growing up.
