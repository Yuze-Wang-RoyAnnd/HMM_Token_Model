home alone 3 is one of my least favourite movies. it's the cream of the crop, or s*** if you tend to be more cynical, as it ranks up (or down) there with stuff like battlefield earth and flinstones: viva rock vegas. in fact, it could even be worse than those two, since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity. this just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling. no other movie has made me cringe in pain. now i will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious.<br /><br />first off, the plot is ridiculous. it revolves around a chip in a remote control car (?!) that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it. dumb stuff.<br /><br />the action that ensues is similar to that of the other two home alones, with boobytraps and all, but watching these boobytraps being executed is, rather than being funny, incredibly unpleasant to watch. i didn't laugh (or even so much as smile) once, rather, i cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid. the bird, rather than providing comic relief, was unfunny and annoying.<br /><br />the acting, as done by a bunch of no names, ranges from poor to atrocious. there is not a single good performance here. alex d.linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid, while the terrorists act (and judging by their movie credits, look) as they've been hastily picked off the street...and well, that's it.<br /><br />i can see some people saying: "man, it's for the kids. don't dis it, man." well man, kids may like this, but they can get a hell of a lot better. see monsters inc. and toy story before even considering getting this out. hell, even scooby doo and garfield (which suck - see those reviews for more) are better than this! <br /><br />so in short, this is an irredeemably atrocious movie. this was clearly recycled for the money, as it almost completely rips off the first two; the only thing is, it completely insults the first two as well. no human, kid or otherwise, should find any reason to see home alone 3. ever. it's that bad.<br /><br />0/5 stars
