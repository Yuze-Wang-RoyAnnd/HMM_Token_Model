what can i say about cruel intentions 2? well, i can say in all honesty, i will only watch this film again if i am fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork-orange-style.<br /><br />the film 'stars' robin dunne (no, i never heard of him either), whose awful impression of ryan phillipe made me cringe throughout. in a case of terrible casting, dunne attempts (and fails) to carry off playing a handsome charismatic, charmer. since the actor is not handsome, nor charismatic nor charming, the character is left wholly unbelievable. amy adams, (she was in an episode of buffy one time), tries to pick up where sarah michelle gellar left off and bring scheming katherine to life... however, adams is not that good a an actress and her performance was flat and lacking in any real emotion, often she looked like she was reading cue cards just off camera. there were two good actors in the film however, barry flatman (saw 2 & saw 3) and mimi rogers (mrs kensington in austion powers), made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of sebastian and katherine and are the only reason why i rated the film as a 2, not a 1.<br /><br />the film itself is a poor version of the original, with such lows as carbon copy's of dialogue and mimicked scenes which lacked the originality of the previous film.<br /><br />i think that as a tv show, it might have worked, but if it had been recasted with people who could actually act in the main parts.
