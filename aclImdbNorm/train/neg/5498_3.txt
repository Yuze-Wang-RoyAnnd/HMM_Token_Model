i think my summary sums it up. i found it inane and stupid. i also saw the ending a mile a way. everyone is copying that ending anymore when doing a tv/theater crossover anymore. sometimes, it's better to let the movie stand alone.<br /><br />others, its better to forget the movie altogether. this is one of the others....
