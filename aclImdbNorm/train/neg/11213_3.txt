ok ...i watch a lot of bad movies. i pride myself on that fact. many times there are some gems in the b rated bombs. but this movie is one of the worst i have watched. i like a good horror movie...but one with a plot of and sense of movement. the opening scenes seemed pretty good. decent music and imagery. then it goes down hill from there. one of the main characters has a disability (ringing in the ears called tinnitus). now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret. they made that too much of a focus of the movie. so what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that he shouldn't have been. no need to keep bringing it up. so this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table. so instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decides to dump the body. now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her. well after seeing her sister over and over again (as a zombie like ghost) and even pointing directly to the location of the body she finally finds her. now the body is recovered and she is set out to deal with the one and only suspect that killed her. bad thing is that she didn't have much of a plan. only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped. the idiot didn't even believe he killed her. so all is revealed there and even though she had a gun....somehow she manages to get herself strangled. so the last scenes of the movie are of the "spirits" of her and her twin walking out of the water. so you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy wins. and not one but two innocent people die.<br /><br />good things about the movie: imagery <br /><br />bad things about the movie: music sound effects long and drawn out misdirection of plot low grade acting from some not all actors
