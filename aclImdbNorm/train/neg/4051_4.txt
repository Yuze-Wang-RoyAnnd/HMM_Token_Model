lindsay anderson was very much a european film maker , whereas the likes of david lean , ridley scott and alan parker make spectacular movies involving visuel scope anderson`s movie are more about social commentary and subtext , so much so that the message often ends up taking over the entire film whose primary function should be to entertain the audience <br /><br />what you think of if comes down to what you think of british film makers . i`m very much of the view that cinema should be a universial medium ( the best brit movie makes are those who try to emulate hollywood in my opinion ) , if you want to send a message try pony express , and i find the movie dated , pretentious and too set in the 1960s . 1968 was the summer of love and the year of student rebellion in france . you can just imagine every single french leftist worshipping this movie especially the climax . french new wave film makers will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes but a mainstream international will dislike it , and many will dislike it intensely
