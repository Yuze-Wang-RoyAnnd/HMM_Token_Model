........and an extremely bad one at that!!! how long did this train-wreck last?? 14 episodes or something?? i can see why now.<br /><br />i bought the "serenity" episode from amazon unboxed. it was my first purchase, so was free. that is the only good thing about the experience (incident??)<br /><br />i won't comment really on the acting, since these were, i guess, fairly new people who hadn't really gotten the job down just right yet. at least i've never seen them before in any type of major show, theater or tv. if i did, then i have easily forgotten them.<br /><br />but the special effects were absolutely horrendous. true, this isn't exactly a multi-million $$ project, but the original star trek did better than this & that was thirty-five years ago. i especially got a laugh out of the bad guys (reapers or something like that) ship as it chased the hilarious looking firefly, with smoke coming out of the engines looking something like a gigantic model rocket. i fully expected to eventually see the wiley coyote riding on top, while chasing after the roadrunner. modern jet/rocket engines don't even do it that bad.<br /><br />and that wasn't even the worst of it. the wild-west type shoot-outs had me wondering if i was actually watching a sci-fi film or a gene autry one.<br /><br />regardless of the hype, don't waste your time...i did...all 80-something minutes of the disaster called "firefly".
