this is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticed.that is it.the dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the "sex scenes" is absolutely absent.the acting and the dialog are more suited for high-school children,yet the subject is intended for adult audiences. it is a gutless and shallow movie.it could have been way better if it had a story and more drama. ah and on top of that, one more thing: why are inner monologues so excessively used? makes it seem so cheap.all in all an embarrassing movie for romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view it.i know the means are scarce but, that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one does.and please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians (tudor chirila) - they can't act!
