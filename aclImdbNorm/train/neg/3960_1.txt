hi, may be because i am not a theater major or a sophisticated movie watcher ... i think this movie is "boring" and "dumb".<br /><br />i rented this movie because of charles bronson and it's title ... but boy what a waste of time ... just watching 2 guys sitting in a vault and talking ...<br /><br />the movie on this dvd was so "dark" ... i had hard time watching the darn movie ... i realize it is a 1968 movie ... but they are putting it on a dvd then they should do some digital remastering.<br /><br />also, i was totally surprised to see these high marks on imdb for this movie ... like i said before i am not as sophisticated as the other folks who commented on this movie earlier.
