despite some moments in heavy rain, an encounter with a drunk as well as an organ grinder with a gypsy and a monkey, and a stay in a sanitarium, this roscoe "fatty" arbuckle silent comedy short with support from buster keaton and al st. john is only fitfully amusing though there is a quite funny sequence of arbuckle in drag flirting with buster that's the ultimate in "meet cute" scenes especially since it's one of the few times we see the great stone face smile and laugh in the movies! also, many scenes seem to have been jump cut edited possibly because of overuse of the film stock. still, if you're an arbuckle or keaton completist, good night, nurse! is certainly worth a look.
