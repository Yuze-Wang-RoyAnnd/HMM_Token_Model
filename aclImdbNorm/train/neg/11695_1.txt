to call a movie like "thinner" bad is like calling the earth round or pauly shore un-talented. no news, but how they got that way is what people want to know.<br /><br />as far as this movie.... the book was good, even if it was a little derivative of other stories from the "be careful what you wish for" genre. burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of a gypsy and is cursed by her father (constantine from tv's "room 222") to several pounds a day. <br /><br />like i said, it starts out good, but why involve the mobster (mantegna)? why fire automatic weapons so much? why turn it into something so heavily dependent on fx? i thought it would have been much more effective if it focused more on the subtle ramifications of weight loss crazes, diseases, death, gypsy lore and such. <br /><br />but no, it's not to be. remember, this is stephen king we're talking about.<br /><br />and the ending... almost the same as the book, but a little too talky. in fact the whole movie talks too much, feeling it has to explain every plot turn to us. not that i expected "the dead zone", but i could have done without another "pet sematary", thanks anyway.<br /><br />one star for at least trying to do a halfway decent makeup job. however, the rest of the movie is left to be... say it with me... "thinner".
