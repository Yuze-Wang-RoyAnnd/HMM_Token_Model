i love a good war film and i fall into the "been there, done that" category. so i would like to think my review is an accurate one (imho). having just watched this film on dvd i can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish. there is no way i can recommend this film to you.<br /><br />it started off with me shouting at the tv saying "you wouldn't do that" etc...but i soon realised that having a bit of job experience would be a hindrance so i chilled a bit. but on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off i got a nasty feeling that this film would be a predictable dud...i was right.<br /><br />there simply wasn't any logic to the eod scenes. i just know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger. so much so i was left scratching my head all the time. then just when you think you know where the story is going the guys in the humvee are off out on their own driving around the desert. one of the most valuable assets in theatre out on a jolly bumping into some sas wannabe contractors.<br /><br />the sniper scene was just so laughable. it just made no sense at all and made me want to switch off there and then. then for them to drag it out so long really did test my patience.it started with the "contact right" and went down hill fast. if you had a brit accent then you got shot but if you were part of the eod team then suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day. then just as you thought it was over it stretched on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all. you are just left watching and asking why hasn't it ended yet?<br /><br />then we had the booze scene where they just hit each other for a laugh..another scene where you just wanted it to end. it added nothing to the film.<br /><br />then just as my life seemed very dull the main star went outside the wire to hunt someone down. this most be the most ridiculous scene i have ever watched. it defied all logic and ability to write a good storyline...it was senseless and awful. i still don't understand why they wasted time on it. then to watch him just jog through the busy streets heading back to camp had me rolling on the floor with laughter. pure comedy :)<br /><br />the sad fact is that this storyline is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be. i thought it was going to be stupid illogical eod scenes but then it kept going off on tangents trying to be something different. but as hard as it tried it just bored me to death. all i wanted was for it to end. it was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed into a batch of stupid, senseless, action(ish) scenes.<br /><br />there is no way i can recommend this. maybe my work experience compromised the enjoyability but even the naive must realise this just doesn't make sense. the only thing more stupid than this film is the artificially high imdb rating...which must be the 24/7 work of the box office pr team who seem to use this website as a way of making everyone think it is good. sorry folks...it just ain't!<br /><br />not recommended...it will just bore you.
