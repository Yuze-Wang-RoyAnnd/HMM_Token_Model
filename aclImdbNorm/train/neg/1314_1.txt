this is the worst piece of crap i have seen recently. there is nothing good about this movie. the plot is plain stupid, dialogs don't make any sense, humorous scenes never heard anything about the real humor. actors just don't play, the worse they don't even try. the script itself is somewhat which is in the same league with ed wood and uwe boll. there is only one good thing in this flick, the fights. they are well choreographed as one would expect of the hong kong guys, and are the only reason to watch prince of the sun. although i believe the fights are just supposed to fill the empty space so that the screenwriter didn't have to bother thinking about the storyline. however, this weak and absurd plot may prevent you from watching it to the end. avoid it unless you are fan of the dragon lady cynthia rothrock.
