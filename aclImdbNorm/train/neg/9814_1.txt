this is the kind of movie you regret you put in your vcr. it is some weird bad rip off version of stephen kings movie "misery (1990)". i cannot understand how this movie got a 5.2 score, because it has no story what so ever, and when the movie finally ended, i was relieved.<br /><br />this movie should have been released as a short-movie instead.. to much time is spent on the same thing. and as in every bad movie, everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minutes time span...<br /><br />so, before you decide to watch this movie, be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control, because you are going to do whole lot of fast-forwarding... don't worry, you wont miss anything important.
