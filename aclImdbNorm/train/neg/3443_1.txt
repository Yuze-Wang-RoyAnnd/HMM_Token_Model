i watched this movie last night and hoped for the best after watching all the cool trailers.even the cover of the dvd looked good.as soon as i started watching it i was thinking like others "oh my god whats this".there were some moments that were a bit creepy but then the mood was ruined by stupid music.there was rock and opera during what is supposed to be suspenseful scenes.that right there ruined it for me and i was shaking my head thinking damn i wasted money again on a rental and was deceived by the cover art.nothing against the music itself,it was just in the wrong parts of the movie.whoever edited the film has no clue what they are doing.the cover showed lightning, implying they were caught in a storm at sea.that would have been more interesting but it didn't happen. the acting wasn't the worst i've ever seen considering they are all unknown and this is obvious their first film.another reason i was disappointed was the plot made no sense.in the beginning 2 men saw all of the teens get on a boat,then at the end supposedly only 1 girl existed and the others were either her imaginary friends or were ghosts i'm not sure because it was very badly portrayed. whytefox who wrote a comment on here claims this is a true story.he or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says there is a haunted boat in the area this movie was filmed.there was no mention in this movie about it being a true story.i have never experienced something like that personally but am not saying it's impossible.i guess if anyone is interested in renting this movie,do it at your own risk.if you like amateur student horror films you may like this.
