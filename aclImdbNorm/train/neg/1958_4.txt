where to begin. this movie started out as something that seemed like a rip-off of "darkness falls". an old , disfigured woman living in the woods, giving kids presents for their teeth. sound familiar? then it changes. in "darkness falls", the tooth fairy only killed you if you saw her. the tooth fairy in this movie killed you no matter what. why did they need the rocker, his hippie girlfriend or the bubbas and their sister? i think the movie would've been fine without them. it seems like the producers sat around and decided that they needed to put extra people in the movie just so the tooth fairy would have people to kill. although, it's nice to see a pretty blonde girl not being portrayed as a bubble-head for a change. okay to rent, but i wouldn't suggest buying it.
