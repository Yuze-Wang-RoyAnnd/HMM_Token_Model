imagine the scenario - you are at the movie theater only because you are in washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're finished with the museums. you think you might go see the sarah marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don't have to engage your brain. it's sold out. options? - the bank job, in bruges, the leatherheads or prom night. you've seen the bank job (suprisingly decent heist movie that) and in bruges (again, pretty good) so you're down to two. you don't fancy watching clooney or the nice one from the office run around in 1930 football uniforms, so you go see prom night right? wrong. you take the $8.50, walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for $8.50. it would be money better spent.<br /><br />it actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror/thriller or whatever it is supposed to be. if i was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut i wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry. probably both. an insult to anyone's intelligence... my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie, as for the acting, they might as well have cast robots (or maybe dogs) in the roles, they would have been more realistic. the detective has to be possibly the worst actor i have ever seen (ben affleck and hayden christansan (i hate his acting so much i don't care how you spell his name) you are relieved on your title(s)) <br /><br />so in summary 'not good'
