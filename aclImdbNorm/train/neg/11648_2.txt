as if there weren't enough of those floating around at the time already, we have here another lame godfather clone from the director of il consigliori (1973) which i had watched earlier this year. the marquee-value name roped in this time is telly savalas who belatedly enters the proceedings and is first seen from behind, rather campily tending to his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of french painters! apart from not looking minimally sicilian, he sports no accent of any kind other than his familiar drawl. antonio sabato, then, makes for an unlikely gangster - apart from being a resistible leading man; his relationship with savalas, which becomes paternal at the flick of an eye, is also unconvincing (especially since he subsequently becomes romantically involved with the latter's spirited teenage niece)! besides, for a gangster flick, there's precious little action to speak of and none of it is in any way memorable (though the finale set in a clinic is well enough handled); furthermore, the score by francesco de masi is serviceable but nothing else. incidentally, the bargain-basement dvd i rented starts off midway through the credits so that none of the cast members - or even the film's title - is ever listed!
