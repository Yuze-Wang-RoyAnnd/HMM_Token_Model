a terrible storyline (amis at his worst), pointless and self-conscious 'decadence', obvious shock tactics and patchy acting make this film (rather like "rancid aluminium") embody everything that went wrong with the much-vaunted british film revival. the humour is, at best, limp, and the pretentiousness of the whole set-up (including some kind of "internet terrorist group" - ooh, how contemporary) really begins to grate.<br /><br />final summary - a half-baked attempt to be 'edgy' that does no-one any favours. still, it's always a pleasure to see katy carmichael on screen...<br /><br />
