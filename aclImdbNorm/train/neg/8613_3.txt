i almost burst into tears watching this movie. not from laughing but from the memories of a great rodney dangerfield movie. candyshack was his first and stole the movie, easy money had him at his best, and back to school is by far an 80's classic masterpiece. then there was ladybugs and that's when it started to show. poor rodney was getting old (meet wally sparks was a slight step up from ladybugs but not saying much). <br /><br />in my 5 wives rodney plays monte (a name he must love since that was his name in easy money) a rich (isnt he always) guy who loves women and gets married like its nothing. well now he inherits a huge piece of land and since the land was run by the amish, he inherits 5 wives. this sounds like a great idea for a dangerfield movie. the problem is everything. the script is so poor that rodney seems to be saying his one liners to the camera and all the side characters have nothing to do. the movie looks like it was shot on video with some really poor stunt sequences that are obviously not rodney. andrew dice clay plays a gangster who looks like he is dying to say the f word (which he should since the film is rated r but plays as if it was pg) and jerry stiller has a nice 2 minute cameo. don't get me wrong, at times i did laugh at a few of rodney's jokes but the poor man is getting way too old and way too slow. we can see his jokes coming from miles. and the film turns way too pc which thanks to the horrible 1990's, the 70's and 80's rodney just doesn't work anymore.
