losing control is another offering in the erotic thriller genre which could be considered as the pulp fiction of the film world. usually, they involve a roundabout route to murderous intent, interspersed with copious disrobing. this is not a complaint, especially when it is done by the stunningly beautiful women who invariably inhabit this make-believe world.<br /><br />kim ward (kira reed) is suffering a bout of writer's block. just by chance, (or is it?) she meets a man (doug jeffery) who engages with her in ever more risky sexual encounters. the man refuses to divulge any information about himself, yet kim steadfastly refuses to stop the affair. her agent, alexa (anneliza scott) thinks it will do wonders for her book sales. as in most films of this type, the denouement comes near the end but some things do not add up. i have seen enough of this kind of film to think, no change there, then - but i like them. they are so undemanding.<br /><br />performances of the cast vary. doug jeffery carries the film as the psycho/sociopath you do not want to cross. kira reed looks good but fails to convince as the woman in peril. clay greenbush as the pi did not convince either.<br /><br />finally, a note of caution about the dvd under review. both the cover and the disc state r-rated and running time as 93 minutes but the run time is less than 86 minutes. this probably explains why the sex scenes appear truncated and why jennifer ludlow's performance is cut short just as she's getting started. 4 stars.
