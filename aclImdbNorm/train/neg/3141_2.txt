i've just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. a bunch of kids, 14 to 22 put on the dvd of "titanic" on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal. only two of them had actually seen it before. but they all had seen the moment of kate, leo and celine dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie. shortly after the epic started, they started to get restless, some of them left asking the others -- "call us when the iceberg appears" over an hour and a half into the movie, only the two girls who had seen the movie before, were still there. they started shouting: iceberg, iceberg. a stampede followed, they all came back to see the sinking of the titanic. they sat open mouthed, emitting ohs and far outs. so, just like i thought when the movie first burst into the scene. what is this? one and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it. dr. zivagho, for instance, had a similar running time, but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time. in "titanic" leo teaches kate how to spit. look at the faces and hands of the, supposedly, creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship. look at the historical details, if you can find them. the storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink. the real sinking here is of film standards. all the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends. the film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so, what do i know?
