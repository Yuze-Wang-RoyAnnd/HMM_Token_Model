i have seen many, many productions of the nutcracker. now perhaps i viewed this movie from the tainted point of view of a theatrical director, but i was disappointed. i'm sure people in the specific business of ballet choreography find this production impressive but from a purely theatrical perspective i found everything from design to choreography to be lackluster and unbefitting of a "motion picture". none of the traditionally "weird" and impressive costumes looked like what they were supposed to be (i.e. the candies didn't look like candies, the rats didn't look like rats but rather like chocolate kisses,) the acting was weak, perhaps toned down too much for the screen, and the choreography just didn't do anything for me. this makes the entire show very satisfactory (at best), as if it were intended to not set itself apart from any other production. but remember, again, this is from the artistic perspective of a theatrical director, not a dancer or a choreographer, but a straight male theatrical director.
