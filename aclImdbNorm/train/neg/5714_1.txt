i have seen many good korean movies including thrillers and movies with darker overtone, but this one sucks. the director seems to be a sadist, who happened to get someone to produce some junk. the movie lacks any sort of entertainment value and is not even a thriller. i can't believe someone really made such a movie. even though acting is ok, the story line and the feeling it leaves is awful.<br /><br />i am sure, i am not going to see any movies of this director. no sense of movie making, and utter disappointment in having thriller moments. all this has is showing scenes with psychopath wasting the reels with badly shot scenes and showing more blood and violence thinking that makes it thrilling. very disappointing movie and i strongly recommend skipping all the movies of this sort.
