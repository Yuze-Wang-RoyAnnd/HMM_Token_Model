okay, i rented this movie because of the director...he has made some interesting flicks in the past (if you haven't seen waxork you are missing a fun ride). anyway, i had my doubts about this movie from the beginning but i decided to suck it up and give it a look. it's bad. very bad. if you haven't seen the movie and don't mind spoilers read ahead. first of all, the old saying 'you can't judge a book by it's cover' applies here. the box for this flick seems to indicate that jill is the stone fox with long hair with highlights. the back of the box has a cool shot of the red-leather jill and some other shots. the description makes you want to rent the movie because it sounds good. you start watching it and suddenly you find out that the movie takes place (inexplicably) in 1977. jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover. the movie is not quite as predictable as you would think...and that's not a good thing. characters do so many stupid things without any modicum of motivation...it's embarrassing to watch. 10 minutes before the end of the movie dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason. also, what was the point of having dolph kill this other lady in cold blood who had been helping him. anthony hickox the director should have seen a stinker when he read the script. had it been set in the underworld of the new milennium and made the characters halfway intelligent it might have been decent. to set it in the 70's makes no sense and has no bearing on the story whatsoever. avoid it!
