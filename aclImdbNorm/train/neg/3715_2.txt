black guy becomes rich white guy, and rich white guy seems to embrace hip-hop culture, and most of the "funny" moments of this film play off of this. the problem i have is that it doesn't work and almost never works.<br /><br />ok, so no one would expect lance to grab a body like that and suddenly start acting like charles wellington. that would be too much to ask. i'll grant that. but at the same time, it goes too far the other direction. i'm supposed to imagine a rich white guy singing rap and completely upending things, playing like he's a bastion of hip-hop culture, and people just *accept* him? and what about sontee, who falls in love with him *as a rich white guy*, even though she doesn't care about his money or power? this is so completely unbelievable it's not even funny.<br /><br />i just couldn't suspend disbelief and i couldn't finish the movie. i added one extra star because it did make me laugh, even hard, a couple of times. but i just couldn't get get past the whole "white guy doing hip hop" thing that has never been well done in any movie i've ever seen that tries it. this was no exception.
