for the knowledgeable beatles fan, the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws, inaccuracies, combined events, omitted events, wildly exaggerated events, omitted people, timeline errors, mis-attribute quotes, incorrect clothing, out of place songs, and (shame shame) incorrect instruments and other boners i just cant think of right now. the flaws come fast and furious so you'll have to be on your toes.<br /><br />i didn't give this a "1" primarily due the fact that it is filmed in liverpool and the actors (the band rain) give it their all (the lennon character is credible and does a good job). also, the song "cry for a shadow" is heard at one point and that counts for something.<br /><br />so,,, watch it for fun, but please don't take it as historically accurate.
