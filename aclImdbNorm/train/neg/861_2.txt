a disappointing film.<br /><br />the story established our protagonist as chrissy, a 'young', rather sullen individual drifting, not doing much. actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it didn't surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives. it's a pity though, chrissy seem like interesting character.<br /><br />story was predictable and at times felt quite formulated. so the question now is, when are we going to see the campions, jacksons, and the tamahori's breaking ground with compelling, cinematically-told stories that will inspire, rather than entertain for the toll of two hours?<br /><br />technically, a disgusting shot film.
