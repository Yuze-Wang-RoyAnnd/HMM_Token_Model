this movie shows a clip of live animal mutilation of an animal getting hacked by a machete and getting its skin ripped off. i know these horrible things happen in the world, but im watching movies based on the fact that what im watching is not actually happening on the screen. these live animal clips are not meant to be in movies, they are meant to show people that belong to certain organizations to help the horrible things that humans to do other species.<br /><br />this should be banned and destroyed. i have also contacted netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the market!!<br /><br />this movie should be removed from the public. the person who made this movie needs psychological help.
