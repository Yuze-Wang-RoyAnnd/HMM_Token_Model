i am a huge ziyi zhang fan and will go to any film to see her which is what took me to purple butterfly. as much as i wanted to like this movie, i have to agree with many others who have commented on it. it is very confusing and also extremely slow. because all of the film appears to have been shot with a hand held camera, significant portions of it are out of focus. <br /><br />the film has very little dialog and what there is doesn't tell you much. there are endless scenes of people just standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room staring at each other with no conversation. the way the film time shifts is also very confusing and hard to follow. even having read a number of reviews beforehand and having a general idea what the film was about, i still had a difficult time understanding what was going on. <br /><br />i knew beforehand that the movie was not remotely similar to previous ziyi zhang starring films but was looking forward to seeing her in something different but unfortunately i was ultimately disappointed. she never smiles in this film although admittedly most of the time she doesn't have anything to smile about. i could have done without the sex scenes as they were about as sexless and without any obvious feeling between the participants as you could hope to find.
