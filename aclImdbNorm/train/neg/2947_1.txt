there have been very few films i have not been able to sit through. i made it through battle field earth no problem. but this, this is one of the single worst films ever to be made. i understand whoopi goldberg tried to get of acting in it. i do not blame her. i would feel ashamed to have this on a resume. i belive it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls flat on it's face. well it happens here. not to mention the sfx, look for the dino with the control cables hanging out of it rear end!!!!!! halfway through the film i was still looking for a plot. i never found one. save yourself the trouble of renting this and save 90 minutes of your life.
