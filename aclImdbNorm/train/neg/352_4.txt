seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie. and so i sat down for 102 minutes of unbelief. beside ed harris no-one seems to own the skills of acting. even sean connery, who i normally worship, must have had an off-day during the entire filming of just case. not once in during the whole movie one actor could convince me.<br /><br />this made this movie look cheap and unreal.<br /><br />the story makes up a little. it is thrilling, and the plot is unexpected.<br /><br />conclusion only watch this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do.
