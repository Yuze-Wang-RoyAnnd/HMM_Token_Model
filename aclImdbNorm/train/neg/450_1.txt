this show is painful to watch ...<br /><br />it is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show, from the ever changing "jobs", boyfriends, and cast. it appears that they wanted to cast amanda bynes in something ... but had no idea what, and came up with this crappy show. they cast her as a teen, surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings, and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy. soon, they realize that she needs a "clique" and cast people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagers.<br /><br />how this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me. somehow, abc has now decided that it is a "family" show, and thrown it into it's afternoon lineup on abc family.
