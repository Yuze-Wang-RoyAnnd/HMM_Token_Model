the movie is steeped in religion, so it is impossible to separate it from religion in commenting upon it. in my opinion, this movie pretends to explore deep issues, but thrives on stereotypes and prejudices; with little true insight. what the people in the movie (and therefore, the writer) failed to see was grace. they failed to understand that god is the author of beauty and he is the creator of passion and sexual gratification in the proper context of marriage bonds. to imply that the people of the society in which the story is based believe that nudity is sinful, and both the man & the woman enjoying the act of marriage is dirty, is just an oversimplification. such stereotypes really don't exist, for even jewish holy writings speak clearly of the caring husband who will seek his wife's pleasure before his own. scripture says that a man ought to love his wife as his own flesh, and that no man ever hated his own flesh, but he nourishes and cherishes it. even if you want to ignore the new testament, the writers & characters completely ignore that there are passages such as the song of solomon in the old testament, and the even the book of proverbs which says, "rejoice in the wife of thy youth, let her breasts satisfy you always"! how can that be read in any way other way than that god knows, and approves of, and smiles on, the marital union and the enjoyment thereof? real men don't ignore the value and needs of their wives. those that do deny a very basic teaching of the judeo/christian religion. god never said those things. it's absurd. sonia rebelled because of the misapplication of the teachings of the true god of abraham. it didn't need to be so. how sad. what sonia desperately needed was truth, not tradition. in knowing, loving and obeying god, we love others more; before ourselves. that is the faith of the god of abraham, isaac, jacob & joseph; once for all delivered to the saints; bought & paid for by jesus christ, the righteous. but alright, ignore all this and abandon ancient, holy scripture and turn to the wisdom of homeless people & ghosts. that's a good plan. i would never recommend this movie; partly because the sexual content is unnecessarily graphic, but also because it really doesn't offer any valuable insight. check out "yentl" if you want to see a much more useful treatment of jewish tradition at odds with society.
