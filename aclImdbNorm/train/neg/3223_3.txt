lol! not a bad way to start it. i thought this was original, but then i discovered it was a clone of the 1976 remake of king kong. i never saw king kong until i was 15. i saw this film when i was 9. the film's funky disco music will get stuck in your head! not to mention the film's theme song by the yetians. this is the worst creature effects i've ever seen. at the same time this film remains a holy grail of b-movies. memorable quotes: "take a tranquilizer and go to bed." "put the yeti in your tank and you have yeti power." i remember seeing this film on movie macrabe hosted by elvira. there is one scene where it was like king kong in reverse! in king kong he grabs the girl and climbs up the building, but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl (who was falling)! also around that year was another kong clone mighty peking man (1977) which came from hong kong. there is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts. this film will leave you laughing. it is like i said, just another king kong clone. rated pg for violence, language, thematic elements, and some scary scenes.
