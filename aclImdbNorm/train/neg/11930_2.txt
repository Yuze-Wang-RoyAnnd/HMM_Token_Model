times are tough for angel town, gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown (mainly due to embarrassing writing) the gangs want a street kid, martine to join the gangs, so they beat him up everyday. however due to the presence of an olympic kick-boxer (olivier "world's lamest actor" gruner) named jacques, hope is on the way. angel town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made (and i've seen my share) it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need, are french kick-boxers who can't act. worst of all there are so many awkward moments it's just truly hilarious. best of all comes from the exchange between gruner and aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is. to wit: "you like the fighting? (olivier grabs his asian best friend in a headlock) i could kill him right? when i want him dead he dies! the reason why i don't want him dead is because i'm afraid of him, and i know that if i kill him his son and wife will kill me, that's why he doesn't die!" <br /><br />of course the fact that it's wrong to kill someone, let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation. odd.<br /><br />however don't let me make this sound that i hated this movie, far from it, it's so terrible it's priceless. the biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees grunner going one on one with gang-members who (the film's biggest logic gap)decline the use of pistols. also a handicapped vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs, while gruner kick-boxes the rest. all of this set to the sound of horrible "mexican" accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as this.<br /><br />the other treat about this movie, is that for some reason olivier gruner never attends college despite that's the main reason he's here in the states and not in france getting it on with his girlfriend (in a graveyard in the film's awkward beginning) angel town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level, this is the perfect movie for you. on the other hand make sure to down tequila, like the laughable opening song details "ain't no mercy in angel town" <br /><br />* out of 4-(bad)
