i saw arthur(the tv series and the books)years ago and never was fond of the show very much(if you're a fan of this cartoon,sorry if i'm spoiling it for you,but this is actually what i think).lots of people liked it,but i didn't.<br /><br />the school kids characters seemed to fought all the time(especially arther and dw),they were nice to each other frequently,but gradually i got tired of arthur's complaining attitude towards everyone and his sister dw(however the name was spelled),and dw was an adhd(or add)-like 4-year-old sister of arthur who was sometimes demanding(which could be why arthur got annoyed with what her routines were,like her imaginary friend and her stuffed animal collection etc.),arthur's friends acted like teenagers instead of what they were like in the arthur books,and the parents,well,they didn't care very much.<br /><br />the greatest cartoon was rocko's modern life,not arthur(no offense).
