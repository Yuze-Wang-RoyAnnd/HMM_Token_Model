this is simply put, the worst movie i have ever seen. it ranges from like 2+ hours, and the box art was totally misleading. my friends and i rented it because, we thought it would be a poor man's 300. you know, to laugh at and make fun of. no. there is nothing funny about this movie, only pain. then, the movie starts up, and they are speaking some sort of different language. we think, 'oh its just the beginning.' but no, from there the movie plummets and becomes more of like a super boring book you had to read in grade school, where nothing literally happens for hours, and the battle scenes rival those of 2 kids fighting on a playground. omit cinematography, and this movie belongs in trash compactor. movies like this will lead to the world we see in wall-e, which by the way was a good movie.
