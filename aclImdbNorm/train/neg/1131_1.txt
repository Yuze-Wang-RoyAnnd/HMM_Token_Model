a shame that even a talented director, desplechin, could not muster a decent performance out of a bleakly-talented actress, phoenix, esther kahn lacks the substance to convey a very concise and clear plot. in an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an actor's plight, the performance and presentation is too contrived and poorly executed to draw any compassion from the viewer. in an overly long running time, the redundancy of esther's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the storyline into a frail frame of a disastrous display. the content is incoherent and gratuitous as phoenix struggles to carry out desplechin's instruction, just as esther is supposedly trying to do the same. never feeling a convincing victory over esther's pain, we never feel a victory in phoenix's talent.
