"houseboat horror" is often regarded as the worst australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher film,which carried the promotion 'see the movie that can't get an academy award'.an underground disco band members begins to die slashed to death by burned maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the australian outback.badly acted and written slasher flick with zero suspense and annoying characters.it certainly delivers the gore:heads are split in half with a machete,throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe.if you like cheesy slasher movies you can give this one a try,but you have been warned.at least it's better than swedish "the bleeder".4 out of 10.
