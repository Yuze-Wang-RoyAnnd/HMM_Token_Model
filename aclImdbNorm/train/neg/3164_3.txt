obnoxious eva longoria dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel (without wings) falls on her off the back of a truck and kills her. she is then tries to ruin the relationship of her ex-boyfriend with his new girlfriend, a psychic who can see her.<br /><br />obvious unoriginal movie wouldn't be bad in a clich'ed sort of way, except that longoria's character is hateful and obnoxious that she drains all of the fun out of the film. its like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper. to be fair longoria, nor anyone else in the cast or crew, isn't the problem, its the god awful script that sinks the proceedings. its just really really stupid.
