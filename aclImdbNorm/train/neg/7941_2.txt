as the 2000's came to a close, king kong's adopted daughter went ahead and made a tearful announcement her show as coming to an end.<br /><br />while miss winfrey was tearing up, i was laughing and screaming like a wild indian from the old west.<br /><br />so what does oprah do? she takes famous people, and puts them on her show. what kind of famous people? people who've suffered (just like her, except these people have lost more than their virginity) they've suffered melted faces (true story), missing limbs (true story, see end of paragraph), and spousal abuse (too many to count). and somehow they come on the show and tell their story, as if we haven't heard it before tons and tons of times (bethany hamilton, i've heard your tale about losing an arm to a shark since day one, which was october 31st, 2003. don't tell me you have no hard feelings.) but the biggest thing probably on oprah was michael jackson's interview in 1993, after being accused of being a child molester. sadly, mr. jackson has since passed away. but that one particular show told about michael's personal life, something not many people knew about at the time.<br /><br />oprah's real influence comes from middle aged women and soccer moms. they seem to think she's like a personal jesus sometimes. but all i see in oprah is some big ghetto lady who made it big, and she's just showing off how rich she is.<br /><br />i'm glad her shows going to end soon. we need better television programs.
