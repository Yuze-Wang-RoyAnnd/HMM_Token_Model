i've had a thing for this kari chick for a while, and as far as how she looked in this movie, no complaints. but after catching it last night in high definition, i am certain: that's the only thing in the movie that isn't substandard. the script is horrible, the acting is horrible, the direction is horrible. i saw in another comment someone commenting on how great the sex scenes were...what? not at all. when a movie is this bad you might as well just turn it into softcore porn, but instead i get to see some pasty white dude blocking me from seeing wuhrer's body and scenes that offer me nothing except a tease. they should have just gone cinemax so that the movie wasn't a complete waste of time, but no. with a script this awful they should've capitalized on wuhrer's looks, since that's the lone pro of the movie. 2/10, only because she looked so hot.
