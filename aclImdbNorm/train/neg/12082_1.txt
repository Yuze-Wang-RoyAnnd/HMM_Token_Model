alas, poor hamlet. i knew him, dear reader, and let me tell thee, this version sucks! i don't know who of all people put up the money for this flotsam, but i hope that they're proud of themselves. they took the classic play and turned it into the most boring melodrama imaginable. this version is quite literally so bad, that not even the presence of a great thespian like maximilian schell in the title role can save it. this movie's only redeeming quality is that it made great fodder for "mst3k"; mike, servo and crow had a lot of fun with this one.<br /><br />but either way, i'm sure that shakespeare, had he been alive when they made this, would not have wanted his name associated with it. this "hamlet" is not even so bad that's it good; it's just plain bad. absolutely dreadful.
