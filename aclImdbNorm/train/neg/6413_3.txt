my friends and i went into this movie not knowing what to expect, but hoping for the best. when we came out, we were only slightly more informed on what the plot of the movie actually was. though not the worst movie i've ever seen, i definitely do not recommend spending your money to see it in theaters. maybe have a friend rent it for you (it's not even worth the rental cost, either) if you really want to see it.<br /><br />when a movie is so convoluted that you have no idea what's going on until the last five minutes, there's really not much that can be said in its defense. the acting was decent, more than you'd expect to get from this movie, and some of the shots were good, but it was all bogged down by a lame plot and poor script.<br /><br />this movie was actually so bad that as soon as it got out, i went and purchased a ticket to see a good movie just to cleanse my mind. i recommend that all of you just skip the first step and go see a good movie instead.
