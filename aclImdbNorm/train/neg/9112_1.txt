basically, cruel intentions 2 is cruel intentions 1, again, only poorly done. the story is exactly the same as the first one (even some of the lines), with only a few exceptions. the cast is more unknown, and definitely less talented. instead of being seductive and drawing me into watching it, i ended up feeling dirty because it compares to watching a soft-core porn. i'm not sure whether to blame some of the idiotic lines on the actors or the writers...and i always feel bad saying that, because i know how hard it is to do both...but it was basically a two-hour waste of my life. it literally amazes me that some movies get made, and this is no exception...i can't believe they'd make a third one.
