where is it written that sequels must suck? scream 2 didn't! others didn't! but this one sure did... problems include horrible actors (only christopher walken could act in the entire film), bad writing (you will never understand what's going on and i even have done research on the idea of nephilim before), and just horrible choices for casting. eric roberts makes the stupidest archangel michael that i have ever seen in my life!<br /><br />avoid it like the plague unless you are desperate to see christopher walken. in that case just fast-forward to the parts where he is in the film, and avoid the others.<br /><br />yech!!!
