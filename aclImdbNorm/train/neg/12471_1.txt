living in the middle east (in israel), i was excited when i bought my ticket for syriana. having seen the trailer, and being a thriller-lover, i expected to see first of all a fast moving, breath catching movie, which wisely dips in global policy-making and the relation between oil, power and corruption, from a fresh angle. well, i almost left the movie in the middle. the pace was painfully slow, almost all characters were stereotyped, the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult, but, as steve rhodes wrote in his review, in the end you don't care. save your money, save your time, choose another movie.<br /><br />robi chernitsky
