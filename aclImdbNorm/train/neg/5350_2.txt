yes, talk about bad sequels. rick moranis stars in this awful third sequel to the once-funny-and-entertaining "honey i shrunk the kids". the concept basically plays the same way as the first film, but with the adults instead of the kids being shrunk and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore. if you think this sounds interesting, think again. the movie is boring at best, right down an embarrassment at worst.<br /><br />first of all, the continuity of the series has been completely flushed down the toilet. the only remaining actor of the first movie is apparently rick moranis. the actress playing his wife has changed, the actors playing the kids have changed, the ones playing the neighbors have changed... you name it. they try to make us believe this is the same family, but the results are puzzling to say the least.<br /><br />second, the story is a rehash of the first one, with not one bit of originality. all the few jokes (and there's barely any) and the dangerous situations presented in the movie are just copied straight from "honey i shrunk the kids".<br /><br />third problem, the special effects. i'm sure this has been done on a smaller budget, but they are pathetic, way way worse than the ones appearing in the rest of the series. you're supposed to admire in awe these tiny figures exploring the huge domestic area, but you'll probably end up cringing most of the time.<br /><br />fourth problem, to locate the action inside the house is just boring. only few things happen, and when they happen, they are not thrilling at all. the first movie was amusing because the kids were dealing with nature, the grass, and the bugs that live in it. in this one, the adults (which come up as rather boring, compared to the kids) deal with dust, a cockroach and a cockroach trap. disgusting.<br /><br />i don't know why the idea of releasing such a trite sequel to the already moribund series appealed disney's executives, except maybe because they needed to cash in without spending five minutes thinking about something new. i'm warning you: leave this tasteless cash-in garbage where it should stay: getting dust on the shop's shelves.
