some of my old friends suggested me to watch this movie but i got chance only recently. i had high hopes of seeing something interesting from kamal hans, what i saw was bunch of garbage camera angles mixed at high speed. i could not understand what was the message except demeaning hinduism. i am more like many religion type but i felt kamal hasan is a man low character to have orchestrated this kind of thought. he could have made a horror movie than this crap. he tried to add hollywood genre of viruses and god forbid he did not convert that guy into a mutant and ultimately going to go for world domination. this is a much befitting movie for a film school vs regular public. shame on him for not holding up to the talent he has. starting of story tried chaos to borrow ideas from butterfly effect, then in between little religious harmony at the cost of insulting hinduism (once again i insult hinduism more but this movie has no equal and my insult is same for religion in general which may have made this movie intellectual one.)
