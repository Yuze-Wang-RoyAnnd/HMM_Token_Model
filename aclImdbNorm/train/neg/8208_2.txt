"hey everybody! i've got an idea, we found this egg-shaped thingie from outer space so why don't we thaw it out and open it up?" "yes, i know that would be the dumbest thing a scientist could do, and it could be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses unknown to earth and could potentially wipe out the human race, but hey, i want to know what's in it". "and nobody tell nasa, they might take it away from us". "wow this thingie gives off vibes!" "yes,really strong ones on contact so don't touch it but it's okay to cut it open". "hi there handsome, check out my nips". (later that day); "do not open"!!!!! uh oh, we have to run all the way to the lab and tell them not to open it because we don't have phones or radios or intercoms even though we have a gazillion dollars worth of other equipment here. "i've never seen such organic technology!" "yeah, lemme take this stick and stab it.". "i'm getting out of here, i don't care if i do kill the other 6 billion people on earth, nobody's nukkin' me!" "look! it's the friendly aliens from "the abyss"! they want us to come with them". the end
