i was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise, the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man.<br /><br />intriguing.<br /><br />not! i hasten to add. these women are all drawn in extreme caricature, not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other down.<br /><br />anna chancellor and imelda staunton could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this, but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, which doesn't work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small town.<br /><br />and for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of men/sex/lust in their lives. i felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension, the lesbian sub-plot went nowhere and those smoking/drinking women (all 3 in their forties???) were very unrealistic - even in the baby scene - screw the baby, gimme a cigarette! right.<br /><br />like i said, a shame of a waste. 4 out of 10.
