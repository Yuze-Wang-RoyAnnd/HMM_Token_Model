like most comments i saw this film under the name of the witching which is the reissue title. apparently necromancy which is the original is better but i doubt it.<br /><br />most scenes of the witching still include most necromancy scenes and these are still bad. in many ways i think the added nudity of the witching at least added some entertainment value! but don't be fooled -there's only 3 scenes with nudity and it's of the people standing around variety. no diabolique rumpy pumpy involved!<br /><br />this movie is so inherently awful it's difficult to know what to criticise first. the dialogue is awful and straight out of the troma locker. at least troma is tongue in cheek though. this is straight-faced boredom personified. the acting is variable with pamela franklin (flora the possessed kid in the innocents would you believe!) the worst with her high-pitched screechy voice. welles seems merely waiting for his pay cheque. the other female lead has a creepy face so i don't know why pamela thought she could trust her in the film! and the doctor is pretty bad too. he also looks worringly like gene wilder.<br /><br />it is ineptly filmed with scenes changing for no reason and editing is choppy. this is because the witching is a copy and paste job and not a subtle one at that. only the lighting is ok. the sound is also dreadful and it's difficult to hear with the appalling new soundtrack which never shuts up. the 'ghost' mother is also equally rubbish but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that at least it provides some unintentional laughs.<br /><br />really this film (the witching at least) is only for the unwary. it can't have many sane fans as it's pretty unwatchable and i actually found it mind-numbingly dull! <br /><br />the best bit was when the credits rolled - enough said so simply better to this poor excuse for a movie like the plague!
