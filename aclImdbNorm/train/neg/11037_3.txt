i love the episode where jim becomes the greenman. it is great! when jim tosses that little person through the window, the look on his face is priceless. then when he starts to address the priest in his wife's behalf only to find out that she has become the pee-woman? great writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see. i am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode. i'd like to use it as my avatar on a message board because i think the greenman is hilarious. does anyone know where i can download a photo of jim as the greenman? can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a photo?
