blonde and blonder was unfunny.basically, it was a rip-off girl version of dumb and dumber, but less funny, and they used too much background noises and music.way too much background noises and music if you ask me!!!!it starts out immensely boring, and totally inane.it doesn't pick up pace anywhere soon, and i was feeling more frustrated as this nonsense carried on.maybe, the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutes.i found it somewhat entertaining and interesting as it neared the end, but that was the only part.also, i couldn't help but like pamela anderson and denise richard's characters a little.even though this movie didn't get any laughs from me, it kept my attention.i wouldn't say to completely avoid this movie, but there are thousands of better films for you to spend your time and money on than blonde and blonder.
