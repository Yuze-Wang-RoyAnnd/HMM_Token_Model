this show was absolutely terrible. for one george isn't funny, and his kids are snobby little brats. he also treats his mother with no respect. as a hispanic, i am highly offended by this show and the way the characters are portrayed.<br /><br />plus the dysfunctional family thing's been done to death. for once, i want to see something original. what makes this show funny when other shows have done it millions of times? i thought abc would come to its senses and pull this piece of garbage off the air, but sadly, we're going to have to stomach this until they "jump the shark".<br /><br />in my opinion, they already did.
