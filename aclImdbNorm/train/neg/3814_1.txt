i can see little girls enjoying this show, but calling this a family show is ridiculous. i'm amazed how well remembered it is after all these years. it's an extremely unfunny and stupid show about widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school, and others as the seasons go on. all of the plot lines generally have a really dumb lesson. in the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light unfunny joke. as for the actors, i didn't like them either. bob saget was painfully unfunny as the dad with the mom responsibilities. dave coulier is a one note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid, and he's horrid. john stamos was the most tolerable character but he was so clich'ed it was hard to watch him. the oldest girl, dj, on the show was a genuinely bad actress and showed no emotion ever. the middle girl stephanie was too clich'ed as the annoying little sister. the youngest girl michelle showed what bad actresses the olsen twins were. you can always tell when they are switching them off. the plot lines to too many story lines were so unrealistically stupid it's cringe worthy. this is a "family" show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love, and though those are needed for a show about a family they overdid it way too much. this will be remembered as my least favorite sit-com from the 80's and 90's.<br /><br />my rating: terrible show. tvg 30 mins.
