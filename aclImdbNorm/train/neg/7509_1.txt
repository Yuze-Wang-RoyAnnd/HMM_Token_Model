"why?"<br /><br />that simple question had to be on the lips of every single new yorker during the 12 months of terror that david berkowitz created in 1976-77. that same one word will surely become the same perplexing question 22 summers later as people exit theaters exhibiting the trite and exploitative "summer of sam".<br /><br />director spike lee attempts to weave the story of a pack of misguided thugs searching for the celebrated psychopath -- who paralyzed new york city for over a year -- with a stark and graphical depiction of the killings, the demons inside berkowitz's head and the frustration of a futile nypd manhunt. he presents an ensemble of despicable losers who hear their own "barking dogs" as they live lives devoid of love, honor and humanity -- no different than berkowitz. lee browbeats the audience in nearly every frame with "not one of us are what we seem to be". often a critic of the white establishment, lee perpetuates the stereotype by including a scene where mira sorvino, playing a newlywed with a cheating husband (john leguizamo), hopes to have oral sex with a black man "in the back of a big black cadillac". an italian mafioso tells a black detective that the famous willie mays' over-the-back center field catch was "lucky". lee even makes sure to deliver the racist musings of one middle aged black woman who declares "i'm happy it's a white man killing all these white people because if it were a black man killing all these white people - there would be the biggest race riot in nyc history."<br /><br />other than an outstanding opening pan shot of an arrival at a disco (reminiscent of shots from martin scorcese's "goodfellas" or orson welles' "the third man"), this film has no soul, purpose or passion. he parades characters on the screen bereft of human decency. although we learn nothing about the true victims of this horrible spree, spike lee seems to be saying new york city got what it deserved during that frightening, boiling summer over two decades ago.<br /><br />"how could anyone wreak such havoc on his beloved city?" "how could someone show such hatred toward his fellow man?"<br /><br />are these appropriate questions for berkowitz or lee?<br /><br />you decide.
