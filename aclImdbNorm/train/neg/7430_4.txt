it's interesting to see what shape pierce brosnan's career was in before bond arrived on the scene. in this "tense" thriller, pierce brosnan plays the gentle patrick, who works leading ghetto kids on "confidence courses". he romances a woman, who has a bog-standard mop-top mid-90s kid called eric. the woman's drunken ex-husband soon arrives on the scene and begins to mess with pierce.<br /><br />at one stage pierce is innocently making "vegeburgers". the husband enters. pierce resumes making vegeburgers. the husband then assaults pierce. little chunks of half-eaten vegeburger call fall from pierce's mouth. the fight abruptly ends without showing the outcome. this is as good as the film gets.<br /><br />
