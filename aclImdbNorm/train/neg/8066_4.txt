melissa sagemiller,wes bentley,eliza dushku and casey affleck play young students at middleton college in the town of middleton.the four teenagers form two love triangles.one night during an ominous full moon they drive and argue along a slippery and twisting mountain road.not looking properly they careen into another car and one or more of them are killed.the ghostly nightmare begins...pretty lousy and politically correct horror flick without gore and nudity.it's obviously influenced by "carnival of souls".the cinematography is decent,unfortunately there is zero suspense.4 out of 10-just another instantly forgettable teeny-bopper trash.
