what can i say, this is a piece of brilliant film-making that should have won an oscar. a copy should be kept safe in a secure vault for posterity. it should be required viewing for all high school students across the world. sam mraovich is a genius, perhaps the most genius writer/director/producer/chef/babysitter/walmart greeter to ever grace the cinema world with his art.<br /><br />where do i begin with this one? every millisecond of ben and arthur was so completely breathtaking! and mraovich as arthur, wow, he is so attractive i'm surprised he didn't go for mr. universe. i couldn't contain myself during the nude scene. i loaned this movie to my brother and he called me on the phone saying how arthur's nude scene turned him gay. i am totally supportive of course, because of this film and it's beautifully crafted lessons in tolerance. why just yesterday i burned down a church and i wrote "for sam and arthur" in its smoldering ashes.<br /><br />the cinematography was the best thing about this film. when that fed-ex plane took to the skies amid the palm trees of vermont, i wept! why, i never even knew they had palm trees in vermont or that people could travel on fed-ex planes before this film. it opened my eyes to a new realm of possibilities. this film inspired me to enroll in sam mraovich's school of screen writing, acting, directing, composing, casting, producing, production design and real estate. i just want to say, "thank you, mr. mraovich. thank you for bringing this creation into the world. we can never re-pay you enough."
