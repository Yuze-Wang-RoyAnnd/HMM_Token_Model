i watched this movie at 3'o clock in the morning, a time in the day where i am usually very open when it comes to movies. but still i think it wasn't good, this movie wasn't good at all. the reasons why are many.<br /><br />the acting isn't all that good, and time after time situations occurring in it reminded me of a poor 90's chevy chase comedy. i mean, come on, like the handcuff situation, and the poker situation amongst the servants... this movie was so obviously based very much on the first one, and thats ok. but if i hadn't seen the first one before seeing this, it would have sucked even worse. like the ending, it came very suddenly, and i felt like i got no closure what so ever... sebastian changed very suddenly, and this this movie seems like it was made solely to explain nr 1, and like no time or effort was used on making anything else good. the score is the same as in the first one, and it didn't feel like a movie at all...<br /><br />they should have handled the situations with more style and class, but they didn't, and therefore, this movie turned out bad...
