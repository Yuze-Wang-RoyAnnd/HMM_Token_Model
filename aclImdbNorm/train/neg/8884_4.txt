"dominique" is one of those films that the expression "slow-as-molasses" must have been invented for. too many endless and repetitive sequences (how many times do we see robertson walking down the stairs slowly because he can hear someone playing the piano?). it is almost redeemed at the end by a surprising twist, which, unfortunately, is followed by a second twist that succeeds only in leaving a bad taste in our mouths. not a very enjoyable film.
