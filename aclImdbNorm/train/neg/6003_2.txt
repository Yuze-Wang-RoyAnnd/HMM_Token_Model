sundown - featuring the weakest, dorkiest vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most unfitting, pretentious scores ever written - and with shane the vampire, who's every move and spoken word was so ridiculous that i burst out laughing half the times and rolled my eyes the rest.<br /><br />the vampires don't seem to have any special powers at all - except for strength (sometimes), being able to switch off a lamp with their mind (one time) and... that's it, really. ever imagine count dracula worriedly recoiling from a fight 'cause he ran out of bullets? neither did i. practically any other movie-dracula would eat this one for breakfast, skin his followers and use their bones as toothpicks.<br /><br />the main plot of the movie is that a human family of four gets caught up in a vampire gang fight - dracula's vs. some old geezer's. it could have been some good old b-flick fun, but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this movie a bit too seriously, and ends up ruining the remaining part of the movie not already ruined by clay bats, mediocre acting and the laughable screenplay.<br /><br />in the end it's just too silly to be funny. sure, it has some amusing moments, but they're few, and far apart.
