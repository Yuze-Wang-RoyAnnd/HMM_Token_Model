this is the single worst movie i have ever seen. let me say that again: this is the single worst movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />it had all of the ear-marks of a bad movie: continuity errors, bad writing, bad acting, bad production value, bad music. i thought that there were a couple points to horror movies. the first is that it is supposed to be suspenseful enough to scare you. this movie gets and f in this category. the second point is that when a character dies, or something bad happens to them, we are supposed to care. this movie gets an f in this regard as well. <br /><br />the first story, a woman gets mauled by wolves after being afraid that this would happen to her. the next story, an ocd guy dies from not being careful and talks to a dead friend of his. oh, and then there is the horrific, nail-biting story of a bad roommate. come on, could you pick topics a little more interesting and a little less common than being alone in a house, being anal-retentive, and having a roommate? turns out all of these stories where hallucinations, virtual reality induced by a doctor who in turn uses it himself. wow, stupid.<br /><br />let me explain something, i enjoy watching bad horror movies and laughing at how bad they are. i couldn't do that with this one. it was utter pain to sit and watch. do not under any circumstance watch this movie. you will regret it.
