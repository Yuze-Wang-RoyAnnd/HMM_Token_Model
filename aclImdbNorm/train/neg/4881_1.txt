this is the most boring worthless piece of crap i've ever wasted an hour of my life on. all i can say is thank god it was only an hour. over half of this 'movie' is footage from the original "criminally insane". at the very least, i was able to see the highlights from that rare exploitation classic, since for some reality-defying reason my video store only has "criminally insane ii" (as it had it, "crazy fat ethel ii"). but the rest of this movie is some of the absolute worst home-video acting and backyard filmmaking you'll ever see. why is it my video store has this and not the original? why does stuff like this actually end up in video stores? why do people rent it and not immediately burn the copy once they've seen its sheer horror? why - aauugghh - why, god, why?<br /><br />unless you enjoy seeing annoying fruits eating an entire candy bar in an excruciatingly slow scene, or said fruit getting hung from the stair railing in an even slower scene, or a character getting stabbed sideways (don't ask) multiple times in the back, or brain cell-murdering monologues about giving poisoned tea to one's wife and then complaining that all the talk has made one's own tea go cold, or the mentally-retarded eating fly soup, or just simply want to see crazy fat ethel dancing with a bloody knife in a garden: don't watch this movie. repeat: do not watch this movie. do not rent this movie. if at all possible, do not walk past a shelf in a video store that has a copy of this movie setting on it. you can still be saved, but it is too late for me now. . .
