i had high hopes for this movie, because i enjoyed the book so much. however, i don't think i would have understood the premise of the movie if i hadn't already read the book. the movie is a noble attempt to show the despair of people trying to break the bonds of overpowering government rule, but the book portrays the suffering much more thoroughly. the corrupt government officials have comfortable, almost luxurious lives, while the common people struggle to obtain the bare necessities for survival. perhaps most people feel this way toward their leaders and rulers regardless of whether or not they are actually oppressed or repressed. orwell's dystopia seems as if it could exist in many places in our modern world. it has been several years since i've read the book, but one hears references to big brother, the thought police, and newspeak frequently in the media and casual conversation. probably many people using these terms don't realize where the terms came from. i strongly recommend that you read the book.
