i'm not sure how related they are, but i'm almost certain that lost and delirious is a remake of this movie (or the story that it's based on). very similar plotline, and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very, very similar. lost & delirious is actually a much better movie, so see that one instead.<br /><br />this one moves very slowly, but being a late 60s french movie, that is to be expected of the style. told in a retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls revisiting the school. the editing of the flashbacks with the current scenes is a little bit confusing at first, particularly since the audio from each overlaps (ie, hearing flashbacks while seeing the present and vice versa). also, the "girls" are a bit old to think that they are in a boarding school. finally, not much character development to even get you attached to the movie.
