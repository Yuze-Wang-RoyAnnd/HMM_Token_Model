ok..... this is the third in the series of carnosaur. lets star with the dinosaur puppets! in the start of the film you cant see the dino's cause when the body count starts you can only see the dino's eye vision, pretty smart to hide the bad puppets! and maybe in 16 minutes forward on the film some special force team with scott valentine as the leader rance, the team walks into the warehouse and then they begins to find body parts and dead body's after the dino rampage, after a while some big box comes failing on the team and you can hear a velociraptor scream, pretty creepy!!! and then a black girl walks forward and now one blooper is found! it pops up a raptor hand and slashed her face but if you pause when the raptor hand comes you can see that its just a guy with a hand puppet!? wtf! the story is simple. 1. some terrorist's attacks some truck cause they though it wash some weapons in there. 2. they where dead wrong it seams to be ten tons raptor and one giant t-rex in there! how did the t-rex fit in there??? 3. rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs! sadly some stupid blond girl told him to capture one of them alive=( 4. holy jesues the raptors have wheels on their feats! 5. the dino's is now on a boat in the pacific. 6: strange i didn't know that the t-rex had a strange thing on hes neck??? 7. the end. the film is good if you want a good laugh. 5/10
