i am sorry to fans of this film but it is the worst thing i have ever seen. slow,badly cast and badly acted it is a film trying to escape the deadbeat romcoms of the recent years and failing! mcdonald and parker seem unable to convey real emotion and are lifeless. they seem to be in this one for any pay checks they are getting for it and not because they thought it was a good idea. the plot is dull!! i love great chick films as much as the next girl and this is not one!! if you avoid one film this year....let it be
