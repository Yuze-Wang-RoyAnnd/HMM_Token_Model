woody allen made "september", proving that even a genius could screw up. this is mel brook's "september". monumentally stupid, boring, and unfunny, i must confess i did not watch it through to the end. the flick ranks among the dishonored few (e.g., "the money pit", "out to sea", "spitfire grill") which either put me to sleep or forced me to reach for the "rewind" button. and i say this, sadly, as a devoted mel brooks fan. he should stick to straight comedy and leave social commentary alone. how the same fellow that made "young frankenstein" and "spaceballs" could crank out a dog like this is beyond me. to be avoided at all costs.
