i love henry james books and washington square was no exception. i was very excited to see a new movie coming out, based on the book of that title. jennifer jason lee is an exceptional actress and ben chaplin good enough to play the lead roles. albert finney is miscast and doesn't carry the role well. i wanted to shoot maggie smith....or rather her silly, insipid role. the real problem and what's lacking in this latest version is a good script, music, and direction.<br /><br />i fell asleep in the theater watching this long, drawn out and exceptionally boring movie. there are more pauses in the dialog than a pinter play. in the book i felt a deep caring for catherine sloper and her life. the movie had just the opposite effect. i also disliked the twist where her aunt has a sexual attraction to morris. eeeeeeeek. yuk.<br /><br />watch it if you can't sleep, it's a definite snoozer. don't watch it if you're depressed. you'll need zoloft after this.<br /><br />sure, "the heiress" was exceptional with olivia haviland and montgomery clift in the title roles. the actor who played her father was on the mark as the uncaring, cold father....still grieving for his dead wife and hating catherine for it. the movie was not faithful to the book but neither is this one.<br /><br />this movie was a box office flop. i have no doubts as to why.
