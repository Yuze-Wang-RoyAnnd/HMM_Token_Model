i think this one sucked on ice, because it left the cube, and gave us to much information as to the who's and why's. the original cube never left the cube, and it left everything to your imagination. this crap fest however, gives you it all. and i didn't like it...though the acting is solid, i think the reason this one was a downer was because it was done by people other than the original filmmakers, if they had vincenzo natali do this prequel, or even the sequel i think it would have done better and would have been more true to the source. so i recommend you stay far, far away from this one, and hypercube, another movie i don't even want to discuss...(i gave it a 2 for the acting only)
