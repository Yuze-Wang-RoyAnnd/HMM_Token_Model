how can a movie with amy, posey and raechel have nothing funny in it? believe it or not 'house bunny' did this better and funnier. hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got some money - this movie is an embarrassment to all of them. it is a clich'e from beginning to end. clich'es can work well with a script, or at least an idea. this movie does nothing but use clich'e after clich'e rather than ideas or script. it uses the preexisting persona's of the actresses rather than develop characters. bad, sad, and rubbish. now i apparently have to have ten lines of text for a comment. really? why? as an it ops manager this is another example of sloppy coding.
