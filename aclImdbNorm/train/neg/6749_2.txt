this mess is so bad it doesn't even qualify as horror. <br /><br />debbie rochon's talent is completely wasted in this film. she is not even the villain. the rest of the actors look like porno wannabes and the plot is so lame i won't even mention it.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and skip to the end credits to hear upcoming band twomarlowe perform "better than sex" it's total 80's disco candy song. nice up tempo song about gambleing & sex. way more entertaining than "bleed". put it this way, when one has the equipment to copy videos, but decides only to record the song at the end of movie, you have a really "bad" movie.
