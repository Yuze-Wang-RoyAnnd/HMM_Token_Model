i have no clue as to what this was shot on but you can definitely tell that they had no budget. bad acting, horrible cinematography, and lame plot and some decent special effects do not make a good movie. the wwf style cinemtography will make you cry...where's the tripod?! the filmakers aimed high, but sorely missed their mark.
