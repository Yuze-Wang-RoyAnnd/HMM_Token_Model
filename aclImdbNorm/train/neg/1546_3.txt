i rented this movie for a few laughs. i had never seen the snl skit, but with hits like tommy boy, and waynes world, it couldn't have been that bad, could it? the answer: it was. this movie hardly was a means of relaxing after a hard day at work. i just kept waiting for a plotline and a funny part, but there wasn't any. the highlight was tiffany amber thieson, and thats just about it.
