no artful writeup here because it doesn't deserve one. not an art film. not even one of those 'hidden' gems. you know, like those movies you hear about through a friend who saw this amazing movie downtown where they show all the good independents and art films.<br /><br />just pack it into the christmas boxes, and dispose of quickly.
