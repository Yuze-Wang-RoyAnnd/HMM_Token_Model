for those of you who've never heard of it (or seen it on a&e), cracker is a brilliant british tv show about an overweight, chain-smoking, foulmouthed psychologist named fitz who helps the manchester police department get into the heads of violent criminals. it's considered to be one of the finest shows ever to come out of england (and that's saying something), and was tremendously successful in england and around the world back in 1993.<br /><br />now, the original stars have re-teamed with the original writer to knock out one more 2-hour episode. i've loved this show ever since i'd first seen it, over a decade ago. the dvd box set holds a place of honor in my collection, and i can quote a good deal of fitz's interrogation scenes practically word for word. the idea of robbie coltrane reteaming with jimmy mcgovern for another tv movie about fitz filled me with absolute glee.<br /><br />i'll start with the good. one of the many things that impressed me about the original cracker series was how quickly fitz was defined as a character. five minutes into the first episode
