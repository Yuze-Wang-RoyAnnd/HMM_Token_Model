we all knew even before it aired, the ron moore mini-series is no battlestar galactica. that's fine. it just means it must stand on its own. it can't lean on battlestar galactica. if it's any good, it's good on it's own merits, and ron moore has something to be proud of. if reports are true, this is what moore wanted. however, if his mini-series rots, he has shamed all the excellent actors that performed on-screen, not to mention the myriad off-screen personnel. and this is what he's done.<br /><br />yes, this mini-series is no remake. i wouldn't even call it a re-imagining. it's a new production, inspired by battlestar galactica. it does not take place in the galactica universe, with the same places and jargon and technology. it doesn't tell of the galactica's search for the thirteenth tribe. nor does it rely on the legends and mysteries that underpinned galactica. ron moore's mini-series is a space-opera, action flick with a ceremonial nod to battlestar galactica.<br /><br />maybe i should say, "just another" space-opera, action flick. because as plots go, his has little that's original, or even interesting. i could relay the whole thing to you without a spoiler warning. but i won't inflict that on you. i'll just hit the most important point. ready now? here it is: just watch the trailer. it will tell you everything there is in the story.<br /><br />yes, creations of man turn on man and seek to destroy man. (i guess they forgot azimov's rules, again.) they look like humans, so there's the whole aliens-among-us thing. at least there's no time-travel. oh, and lots of fighting scenes and random acts of sex and violence. the end result was that when moore did draw from galactica, that ceremonial nod, it came off more corny than respectful. i mean, couldn't he even think up anything of his own?<br /><br />from the first few minutes, i wanted to watch something else. i didn't care about any of moore's characters, since i couldn't identify with any of them. this fact hit me in the face when the cylons began their attack. armageddon on a planetary scale, and i didn't give a damn. how depressing.<br /><br />moore's heroes when faced with an insurmountable obstacle, instead of overcoming it, rather tucked tail and saved their own butts. after all, it was the only way to save humanity, yadda yadda yadda. they took the safe way out, rather than risking their own lives to defend others. at least disgust is not apathy.<br /><br />but in the end, the ron moore mini-series was just activity without purpose, a movie on a treadmill, forever running yet going nowhere. and i just wanted it to be over. and by the time it was over, my life-force had been sucked from me. against my own will, i was turning into a mindless, soulless zombie, probably of the type to which this mini-series would appeal. i needed to replenish myself. i needed to-and i swear this is true-i needed to watch an episode of babylon 5. two episodes, in fact, and i felt much better. and happier.
