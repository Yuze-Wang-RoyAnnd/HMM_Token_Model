i am fully aware there is no statistical data that readily supports the correlation between video games and real life violence. the movie is false and phony because it is in complete contradiction of itself, which is what i tried to emphasize in my original review. the movie fails, not necessarily because i really do think these kids were influenced by video games, but because the movie sets it up as "random" and doesn't follow through. let me clarify. in aileen: life and death of a serial killer, you can see her claims about the police and being controlled by radio waves are ridiculous, yet she is so troubled, she really believes them to be true. the viewer can make the distinction however. in zero day, the 2 kids keep saying how they are not influenced by anything environmental, which is obviously false since everything they do contradicts this. neo-nazism, talking about going on cnn with wolf blitzer (which is laughable not only because they know his name, but its a shameless attempt by the filmmaker to get coverage of his bad movie)..etc. this movie doesn't depict 'reality', it shows nothing but phoniness to prove a point. unfortunately you fell for the bait and didn't see this, and you didn't pick up on it from my review either. the entire movie is just taking michael moore's hypothesis and applying it to something "real life" in hopes of validating and it fails, not necessarily because the hypothesis is wrong, but because the movie is wrong and doesn't support it. of course i don't think kids that play video games are more likely to kill people, but if i'm not mistaken, didn't video tape exist of the columbine kids (or some teen killers) shooting guns in the forest claiming how much they looked or acted like the weaponry in doom? hmmmmmmm, the distinction is kids are most likely aware of the media, influenced, but obviously balanced or intelligent enough that its not even an issue. zero day is a bad movie not because i really believe a correlation exists, but because the film maker doesn't know what hes trying to say, and the movie does more to disprove his point then support it. it's almost as if the new ratings given to video games made someone upset so they came up with 'zero day' in retaliation. if you want to see the 'mindless' teen killer theory pulled off right, go watch bully.
