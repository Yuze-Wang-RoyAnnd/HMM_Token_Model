a christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie. so naturally, i was elated when this movie came out in 1994. i saw it opening day and was prepared to enjoy myself. i came away revolted and digusted. the anticipation that rang true in a christmas story is curiously missing from this mess. a red ryder bb gun is better to get than a chinese top.and it is not very funny at all. charles grodin is good but the buck stops there. bottom line:1 star. don't even bother.
