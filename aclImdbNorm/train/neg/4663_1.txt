this movie was just down right bad. i love war movies and can normally come away from most movies and find something that i liked,but this was not one of them. this movie lacked substance and intensity.ok i get it, the finns put up one hell of a fight and thats great, but the story is poorly told. you don't have any real connection with any of the characters and there's no real story line to follow. you just go from one random scene to another, nothing flows to form the story that is trying to be conveyed. if you want a war movie that will keep you riveted, and amazingly enough without battles scenes, then i would suggest "downfall" (wwii german film). or if you prefer a great story line and a lot of action then i would suggest "brotherhood of war" (korean war/korean film). these two movies will not let you down as winter war will.
