damn, i thought i'd seen some bad westerns. can't top this one though. hell i think i'd rather have my eyes stapled open for a trinity triple feature for cryin out loud. i dont think i'll be able to watch ben hur again without laughing my ass off. just really bad.<br /><br />but hey, if you like stupid westerns with acknowledged stars in the thing take a peek at shoot out with gregory peck. it's just as bad, but much funnier. 1/10
