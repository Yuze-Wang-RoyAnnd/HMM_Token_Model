buck's role as the kahn brings to mind bob barker (of the price is right) running a country the same way he runs his show. but there's lots more to chuckle and snort through in this turkey. kurt thomas as the baby-faced "hero" displays some considerable acrobatic skills, but not a whit of acting talent whatsoever. there's a few spooky moments (in the village of crazies, mostly), and some mildly impressive martial arts sequences. but any given "ninja" movie will give you much more entertainment, and you won't feel as guilty about laughing.
