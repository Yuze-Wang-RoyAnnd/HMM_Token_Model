i give this five out of 10. all five marks are for hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material. unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling! we have countless full-face shots of hendrix where he could almost be doing anything, taking a pee perhaps? we don't see his hands on the guitar thats the point! also we're given plenty shots of hendrix from behind? there appears to be three cameras on hendrix, but amateur fools operate all of them. the guy in front of hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus lazily about the stage as if hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction. while the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work thats bleeding out the amps (the sound recording is good thanks to wally heider) interspersed on the tracks are clips of student losers protesting against vietnam etc on tracks like machine gun, complete waste of film! if hendrix had lived even another two years berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes. the one gem it does contain is the incredible johnny b good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both woodstock and isle of wight
