is this the movie??? is this what indians are trying to show?? i think this is one more effort from a sick-minded director to turn down pakistani soldiers and in fact country....but what we pakistani's know that we are always ahead of india in every part of our lives...not only in armed counters.<br /><br />well...this is bad filmed as that of border in early 1997...and director and writer just tried to overcome a shame of defeat in kargil by pakistani armed forces, by creating films like these..<br /><br />one thing is very clear...whenever there will be an encounter between pakistan and india....we will win....!!! so mr. dutta try to make some good movies instead of nonsense movies like this
