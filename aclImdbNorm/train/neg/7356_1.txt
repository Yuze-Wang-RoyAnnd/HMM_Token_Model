got into this flick, just as it was beginning, on an afternoon where i was home with a touch of flu - otherwise i'd have missed it. that probably would have been best.<br /><br />i noticed the presence of lindsay crouse and jay thomas - both very good performers - and thought this might be worth a look. it proved to be to some extent, but only because it is one of those stories so awful it fascinates.<br /><br />zoe mclellan has little to recommend her talents, except for her jayne mansfield- or loni anderson-like bosom. unfortunately, her acting prowess - at least here - makes mansfield and anderson seem to be garbo or davis by comparison.<br /><br />the young nut case's white rat, the owner's cat, the young nut case having the owner evicted and restrained in her own home, and a bunch of doophus's (including the young nut case) running around a bio hazard facility, and the absurd conclusion. i kept waiting for at least some scene or plot element to contain at least a modicum of realism, believability or being capable of evoking some empathy/sympathy -- but this proved to be in vain.
