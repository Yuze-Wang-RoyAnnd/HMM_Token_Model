wow...where to begin...picked this up at big lots for only $2.99. that's three bucks i'll never see again...ever...and for what? i'll tell ya. an hour and fifteen minutes of boring, boring, boring chat and college angst that seemed more suitable for a lifetime movie than the horror flick advertised on the box. (may the marketing droids who designed it burn in hell for all eternity). follow that up with a little bit of cheap gore (not even good gore mind you...) and a plot twist at the end that comes out of nowhere, and makes no sense. awful, awful, awful...<br /><br />was there any redeeming qualities? well, on the joe bob briggs scale, there were six breasts involved, but that's hardly worth my long lost three bucks. without those, this coulda been on sci-fi at, say, two or three in the morning...<br /><br />bmoviefreak
