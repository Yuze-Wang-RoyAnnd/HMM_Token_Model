this is really a very bad movie. why? first of all, the story is bad. it is an artificial story, combining all sorts of things together that make no sense. it just seems a wrong experiment. secondly, the actors cannot play in a realistic manner. they cannot even talk as an actor should. why did i buy this movie? and what must i do with it now?
