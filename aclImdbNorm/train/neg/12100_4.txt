now don't get me wrong. if you need an insightful summary of everything that been wrong with the history of human civilization as well as a flawless path to brighter future for mankind, who better to turn to than a comedian and practitioner of pop culture? if you need a healthy dose of all the solid, sound reasons why religion has outlived it's usefulness then turn to sagan or dawkins, not bill maher for god's(?) sake! that's a good point in and of itself. maher dismisses our religious past as a neurological disorder conveniently ignoring how his entire society, art and science is rooted in it.<br /><br />in this film, he relies heavily on his keenly-honed skill set of irony and cynicism to make his point while attempting to appear erudite and wise. unfortunately, his intellect isn't up to the task.<br /><br />maher makes us laugh but is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box. as an example, he responds to an interviewee's (and i use the term loosely as they were clearly all "ambushees") assertion that the existence of jesus is historical fact with a deadpan "no, it's not" followed by a long stare meant to convey contempt at the subject's naivety (a device nauseatingly overused in this film). the problem is that the person was correct and maher dead wrong in his assertion that jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically- suspect gospels. i guess mr. maher has never read the contemporary historian josephus.<br /><br />but the masses will flock to this pseudo-documentary as they do the fictional works of other intellectual giants like michael moore, and they will loudly bray and guffaw (they certainly did at my showing).<br /><br />it's doubly telling, however, that the loudest and most mule-like braying occurred during the approximately 70% of the running time that the film devoted to it's anti-christian tirade while the audience was wholly mute during the token 10% devoted to criticizing the self-described religion of peace. hmmm. either criticism of islam is off-limits to the hip and liberal target audience or they were just afraid to laugh. very telling, either way..
