i went to school with jeremy earl, that is how i heard of this movie, i don't really know if it was in the theater's at all. i don't recall the name. i have seen it, it is like one of those after school specials. the acting is ok, not great. the plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty corny. so the only comment i can give this movie is "eh" i borrowed the movie from jeremy, if i was in a movie rental place, this is one that i would walk past and after watching it i wouldn't recommend it to anyone past middle school age. i've also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed, the slang is overused or just outdated. many times i think thats what makes their characters unbelievable.
