what a long, drawn-out, pointless movie. i'm sure that historically this film is delightful but as entertainment goes it just doesn't make the grade. ralph fiennes has been in some fantastic movies, the english patient, schindler's list, but this one was such a let-down. it didn't seem to be going anywhere, his character at the beginning was so shallow and uptight it amazes me that his "sister" would ever have been interested at all. don't bother paying to rent this movie, buy yourself a copy of the english patient instead.
