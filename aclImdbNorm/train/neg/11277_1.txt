there is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn't help with the major downsides to the movie. i never understand why directors ask actors/actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can't convince. fiennes just can't do irish and fitzgerald isn't much better at russian. when the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing. as the for the major problem....the plot....was there one? i guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that i just couldn't wait for the film to end...it was ridiculous. save 90 minutes of your life and don't watch this movie!
