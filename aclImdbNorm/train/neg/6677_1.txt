after reading the first 5 reviews on imdb i was very enthusiastic about this movie. but it's really an awful movie, the total time you see the alien is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is cheap suspense), the acting is over the top en the story, oh boy, which story?<br /><br />the story doesn't seem to go in a direction, first they capture the alien (after 7 years! they finally succeed), then they don't know what to do with it (after 7 years?) and even want to release it (why the hell did they capture it?). then the girlfriend, who's acting is the most over the top, wants to walk away from this madness, then suddenly she doesn't, then again, she does and then she doesn't. then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien will kill the whole human race (and remember, in all those years no other human have seen these permanently settled aliens) and what do they do? they torture it and blow a bunch of aliens to peaces.<br /><br />this is my first review on imdb, i'm a very lazy person who doesn't write very soon, so listen to my warning: this move is not worth your time, don't watch this movie.
