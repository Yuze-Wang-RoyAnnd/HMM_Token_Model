i read somewhere that hollywood should concentrate on remaking bad movies and leave the classics alone. we can only hope. while this remake wasn't a total waste, i still wish i had the six bucks back to go toward a dvd of the original. lots of violence and one of the worst endings i've ever seen. this version doesn't add anything new. it only reiterates why hollywood should leave the good stuff alone.
