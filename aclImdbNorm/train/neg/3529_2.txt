i heard this film was much more stylistic than the films director guy ritchie (lock, stock and two smoking barrels, snatch) had directed before, the problem is, it is possibly too stylistic. basically jake green (jason statham) is released from prison after seven years in solitary,and within two years he gambles loads of his money. he is ready to seek revenge against the violence-prone casino owner who got jake sent to prison, dorothy 'mr. d' macha (ray liotta). in the process, doctors tell jake that he has three days left to live as he is dying from a rare blood disease, oh, and macha puts hit men on him. loan sharks zach (vincent pastore) and avi (andr'e benjamin) are demanding jake pays their cash back, and do some odd jobs for them. the film is filled with jake narrating through some flashbacks, and through his last three days before coming to the big revelation about zach and avi, and macha, well, i assume that's what it was. also starring terence maynard as french paul, andrew howard as billy, mark strong as sorter, francesca annis as lily walker, anjela lauren smith as doreen and elana binysh as rachel. the are sequences involving a little bit of animation, repeating lines twice in different perspectives, and changing speeds for moments, and all of these are irritating to the point of confusion and boredom, making it a silly crime drama. pretty poor!
