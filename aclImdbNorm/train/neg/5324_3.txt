vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie. vovochka, the main character, is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood. with the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way, he finds changing his mischievous ways hard, yet worthy of doing. personally, i found actor who played vovochka too annoying to sympathize with, however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen. this struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre, that's the little flavor i meant. all in all, i did not really care for this movie, although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience.
