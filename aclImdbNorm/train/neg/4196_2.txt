this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time. not just the story, but the acting is shockingly bad. the dialog sounds like someone reading the news.<br /><br />this is rated as comedy/drama/romance, it's not of those things ! it's a little action, that's it. there's really no comedy and drama at all.<br /><br />if you went to the cinema to see this i feel sorry for you. i would not recommend it at all. pretty much anything else that you choose to look at will be better. this is pretty much a action/crime movie. the actions scenes sucked, and crime story part of it was very predictable.<br /><br />if you are not really interested in a good story, or good acting. and you simply want to look at a 'foreign' film for the appeal of being foreign. then this might be for you.
