" it had to be you" is another sign that hollywood is running out of ideas. this picture is about charlie hudson a former police officer turned author. when charlie's fianc'e goes out of town he's stuck with all of the wedding planning. he spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets anna penn a teacher who just happens to also be getting married. the two quickly become friends and set out to plan their separate weddings together. this is when the plot gets boring, charlie falls in love with anna and she has to choose between a safe life or charlie. this movie rips off every romantic comedy ever made and just has you waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else. micahel vartan and natasha henstridge give really mediocre performances which just makes this movie all the more gut wrenching to watch.
