devil's experiment: 1/10: hardcore porn films fall into two categories those with a semblance of plot (gee that is one lucky pizza boy) and those without (anal amateurs 36). devil's experiment falls solidly into the latter category. <br /><br />it is of course the horror version of hardcore porn. an almost completely plot less 43-minute wait for the money shot. shot on video in 1985 it consists of three relatively non-descript japanese boys torturing one fairly unattractive japanese girl. the tortures range from the banal (slapping her 50 times, kicking her a hundred), the silly (tying her to an office chair and spinning her around), the fear factor (a bath of maggots and sheep guts) and finally the money shot. (a well executed eyeball piercing). <br /><br />that's it, no plot, no motive, just blair witch tree shots and torture. the girl looks bored and with the exception of yelling, "no one expects the spanish inquisition" during the office chair scene i was bored silly. staring dumbfounded at the screen, waiting for the money shot. just like hardcore porn.
