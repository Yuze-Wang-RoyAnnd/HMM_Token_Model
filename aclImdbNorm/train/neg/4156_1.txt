yes, this movie is bad. what's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title!! in the entire movie, zombies and vampires fight each other once or twice. on top of that, we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is definitely a vampire. one might argue they were trying to "tone it down" or make it "realistic," but it ends up just boring. more than half of this movie takes place in a car. the scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about, either. also, there's no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /><br />however, i will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere). <br /><br />i'm all for independent films, but it doesn't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /><br />"worse than scarecrow slayer."
