i saw this movie for a number of reasons the main being mira sorvino. with her on the cast it couldn't be so bad. and it even seemed like it had some mystery and olivier martinez was her boyfriend at the time and he was pretty good in `unfaithful'. the story is set in spain so it could be an exotic entertaining movie with one of my favorite actresses.<br /><br />if you're thinking about the same thing let me warn you: this is a truly awful, uninteresting, boring movie. the only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic.<br /><br />the story is contrived with sub-plots that add nothing to the narrative. they try to build a slasher/thriller with a look at fascism in spain but fail horribly. the twists have no credibility and the so-called investigation leads nowhere.<br /><br />the characters are paper-thin! i didn't care about anyone. more than that they're irritating and pretty hateful people.<br /><br />the acting is atrocious. mira what is wrong with you? why mira? you're an oscar winner! keep some dignity! her character was weak but that is no excuse for such an awful performance. she seems to be sleepwalking all movie long. come to think of it, i actually think i saw her eyes slowly closing in some scenes. i used to think this woman was sexy. well she isn't here. if you want to look at some skin try romi and michelle because there's nothing to see here. and that accent? my god...<br /><br />olivier martinez is even worst. it's too painful to remember his performance to describe it here. im sorry but i can't. ive suffered enough with this garbage.<br /><br />this whole movie is depressing! it's so bad in every way it's a wonder how it was even made. a lousy team to produce a lousy script and make some money over the actor's name. don't fall for it.<br /><br />avoid it!<br /><br />
