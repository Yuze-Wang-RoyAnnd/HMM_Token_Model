trifling romantic drama directed by clint eastwood about the loving relationship which grows between a comely hippie (kay lenz) and a los angeles real estate agent in his golden years (william holden, surprisingly affable within this highly-concocted arrangement). the script is slight but not without some thoughtful passages; still, the scenario is such a middle-aged clich'e by now that most of the picture comes off as puerile. it may have worked much better with different leads: holden and lenz don't match up well (her stature is so slight he seems to tower over her), making their intimate scenes less stirring than simply uncomfortable. dated, blurry-romantic, and mostly unmemorable. ** from ****
