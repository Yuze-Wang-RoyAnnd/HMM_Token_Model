i simply give this a three because it fulfilled what my buddies and i hoped it would do: entertain. <br /><br />i wasn't stupid enough to rent this thinking it would be a zombie film up there with the likes of romero or fulci, but what i rented it for was a laugh. <br /><br />if you are looking for a film for amusement, or a film to make you shake your head in embarrassment, go for it. this is perfect for junior- "mystery science theater" fans, but the only downside is that it is so bad, it makes fun of itself. <br /><br />i, personally, think it is a shame to relate this to any other hollywood title that we may know, because when a film sucks like this, it has its own genre.
