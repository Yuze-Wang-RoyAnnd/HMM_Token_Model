hey arnold! is a slow-paced and slightly boring movie. the plot is not very creative. the paul sorvino character (shenk) is buying all of the decrepit, low-priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall, shopping complex and office buildings. this plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies. it is boring. paul sorvino is not very exciting either, so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary. gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when arnold and jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of helga, whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to shenk's mall. the kids must move around town on buses, and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly, but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids. hey arnold, the tv cartoon is usually very entertaining, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. the tv cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie. hey arnold the movie, is about five times more sedated, and a good way to put anyone, including kiddies to sleep. hey arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending. if you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive movie, this is it. i get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie, the producers started out with a 30 minute tv cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes. this mall story definitely could have been covered in the tv cartoon. hopefully arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel.
