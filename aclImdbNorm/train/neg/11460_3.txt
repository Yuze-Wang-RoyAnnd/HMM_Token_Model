fairly amusing piece that tries to show how smart orcas are but in the meanwhile (and quite oblivious to them) makes the audience feel stupid by making the most ridiculous film. richard harris plays quint.. i'm sorry, that's wrong, he plays captain nolan, a fisherman who catches sharks for a living, but is lured by the big catch, and tries to catch a killer whale. when the capture of a female killer whale goes awry (don't ask) it's mate (don't ask) goes on a rampage (don't ask) and starts stalking captain nolan (don't ask). soon, captain nolan realizes that they have something in common (don't ask). pretty amazing film-making here folks. i got to tell you though, the beginning (with the whale noises and nothing much else) is pretty haunting and the end credits (with the most godawful song) is pretty entertaining.
