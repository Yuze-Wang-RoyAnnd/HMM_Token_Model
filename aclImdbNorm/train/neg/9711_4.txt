a response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed: one person suggested that the closing and destruction of the ocean view amusement park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods. this is simply not true. prior to the construction of interstate 64, which bypasses the ocean view area, the primary route for traffic went through the heart of ocean view. once the interstate was completed, ocean view rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime. this led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park, which also faced new competition from nearby busch gardens in williamsburg. meanwhile, in the past few years, the city of norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought-after location for construction of high-end housing.<br /><br />it has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film "rollercoaster". this is also untrue. footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film, but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to "death of ocean view park".<br /><br />as to the film itself, the storyline of a "supernatural" force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly, but somewhat typical for b-grade movies of the time. with the cast involved, there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors. i don't believe this film was intended to be another "citizen kane"; i believe playboy was experimenting with a new non-nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into (apparently not!). a strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table, but proved unmanageable in execution. the roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway; "let's come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise!".<br /><br />for the casual movie viewer, this would be a "see once and forget about it" film (except for diana canova fans); but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park, this movie is like a "walk down memory lane" for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown norfolk, the first "harborfest", and old dominion university. even a limited release of this film on dvd would be welcome.
