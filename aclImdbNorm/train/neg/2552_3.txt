this is listed as a documentary, it's not, it's filmed sort of like a documentary but that i suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming. this has just been released in the uk on dvd as an "american pie style comedy" it's not that either.<br /><br />basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid. throw is a couple of dwarfs, also on the same sort of quest and you have a non-hilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girls.<br /><br />considering the 18 rating this has very little nudity, and practically zero sex scenes, mainly i guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plenty.<br /><br />if you like crude jackass behaviour without the humour, then this may be your thing, if you have any brain cells left then i would probably avoid this!
