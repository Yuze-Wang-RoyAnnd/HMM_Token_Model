this movie should be nominated for a new genre: complete mess! except for a few chuckles and one or two scenes of gore, this movie is a complete waste of time. calling it "campy" doesn't even cut it. "campy" implies fun which this movie was not. you spend the first half of the movie thinking "its got to get better, right?". in fairness, it does, at the very end when its finally explained who the "brother/sister" team are and what they want but by then, you hardly care anymore because you've spend the entire second half of the movie wondering exactly what did mr. onorati & ms. pacula do to tick someone off this badly to be stuck in such a horrible movie.<br /><br />
