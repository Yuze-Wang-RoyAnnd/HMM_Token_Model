words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is. i wish it were "so bad it's good," but it's not. it's just dull, lifeless, and boring. it's so bad i couldn't even laugh at it.<br /><br />in response to other posters, anne-marie frigon is not the highlight of the movie. the only person less charismatic is the director brett kelly, who as a true statement on vanity, cast himself as the male lead. they both look like inbreeds, sister and brother.<br /><br />the gal, sherry thurig, is a looker. the complete opposite of anne-marie - attractive. this girl is tall and willowy, and can act. although you can tell she's holding back.<br /><br />all the actors seem to be holding back, especially the supporting male, mark. i've seen less wood in a rain forest, but he's still better than kelly. why would kelly keep his actors from acting? is he really that bad a director? everyone else has summed the story up perfectly - there isn't one. kids are kidnapped and kelly steps in poo to solve the crime. i know how he felt stepping in the poo, it's how i felt after watching his movie.<br /><br />yes, i tried to get my money back from the rental store. this is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director (and if you search them out, you'll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks).
