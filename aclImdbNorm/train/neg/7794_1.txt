this movie is god awful. not one quality to this movie. you would think that the gore would be good but it sucks bad. the effects are worse and the acting if you can call it acting is the worst i've ever seen. this movie was obviously shot on a camcorder and runs on a budget around 500 dollars probably. if you want to watch a good zombie movie than watch dawn of the dead or day of the dead. if you want to watch a good cheap shot on video zombie movie like this but way better than watch redneck zombies. please avoid this movie at all costs. it is unwatchable and pointless. you've been warned. i've got nothing else to say about this stupid movie.
