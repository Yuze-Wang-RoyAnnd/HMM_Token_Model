in a college dorm a guy is killed by somebody with a scythe. his girlfriend beth (dorie barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. she's institutionalized. a year later she's out, has a new boyfriend named hank (joseph lawrence) and is about to spend spring break with hank and four other mindless friends in a big, beautiful condo in florida. naturally the killer pops up (for no reason) and starts killing again.<br /><br />lousy slasher thriller--a textbook example of how not to do a low-budget horror movie. for starters, large portions of this film are endless filler of these six idiots videotaping themselves, having "fun" (more fun than the audience), getting drunk, acting stupid etc etc. also there is no nudity in here at all. i'm not saying a horror film needs nudity but anything to liven this up would have helped. none of the deaths are really shown (you hear them), are only a little bloody and there is no gore. there's one real gruesome one--but that's not till the end.<br /><br />with a few exceptions the acting sucks. dorie barton is dreadful as the main woman and tom jay jones is lousy as oz. chad allen pops up as brad and he's terrible. lawrence is actually very good--handsome and hunky and giving this crap his all. and jeff conaway pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job.<br /><br />logic lapses abound--after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex; baston's non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and what happens to lawrence? his character disappears without a trace at the end! dull, stupid, no gore, no nudity--skip this one.
