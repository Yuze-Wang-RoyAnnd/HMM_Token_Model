envy stars some of the best. jack black, ben stiller, amy poehler, and the great christopher walken. with such a cast, one can only expect the best. however, with "envy", no one could save this disaster.<br /><br />tim dingman (stiller) and nick vanderpark (black) are best friends and co-workers at a sandpaper factory. both are making a decent living, but because tim has a better performance at work, he's able to afford more than his buddy nick. nick is a dreamer who's always coming up with new ideas for inventions. one day, nick comes up with the idea for a spray can that makes dog poop disappear (yes, i'm serious). falling in love with the idea, nick decides to really invent this product. he makes an offer to tim to invest in his idea and share the profits 50/50. tim refuses thinking the idea will never work.<br /><br />nick's invention, titled "va-poo-rize" (again, i'm serious), ends up making millions. he enjoys spending his money on things like a much larger house, a horse, a personal trainer, and fancy deserts. tim starts feeling envy for nick. hence the name of the movie.<br /><br />the concept isn't bad, but it still turns out awful. this movie contains some of the worst dialog and very poor performances from all the cast. then again, as i mentioned earlier, none of them could save this mess. not even the great christoper walken, playing a homeless character named "j-man", made this movie funny. the movie is bad from the start and only continues to get worse.<br /><br />i recommend this movie if: *you like crap (no pun intended) *you want to see jack black in a white tux<br /><br />i say, avoid this movie at all costs, but avoid especially if: *you're offended by bathroom humor *you love animals
