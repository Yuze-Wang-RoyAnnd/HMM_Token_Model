i generally like watching burt lancaster's films--especially when he is needed to go nuts with his imposing screen presence like in elmer gantry. however, his greatest strength, his magnetism, was occasionally also his greatest weakness as he rarely, if ever, underplayed anything. and it is this lack of subtlety that really hinders the rainmaker. now i understand that his character was meant to be a sort of showman but how katherine hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable. she is supposed to be smart but doesn't seem so when lancaster's blarney is being thrown about the screen! in addition to this, the story is perhaps one of the most stagy looking films i have ever seen and it is way too obvious that this is a movie based on a play. it just looks like it was mostly filmed in a sound stage instead of in the great wide open west like it was supposed to be.<br /><br />overall, a very overrated film.
