my wife and i both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made. certainly in the top ten of those i've watched all the way through. at least "plan 9" was enjoyable.<br /><br />i did really enjoy "christine", "the dead zone", "firestarter", "carrie", and some of his other films. i didn't care much for "cujo" (only because the sound was so bad on versions i've seen and i often couldn't tell what people were saying), or "pet sematary (pet cemetery)".<br /><br />but this mess was a total mistake in every way possible. the "creatures" themselves seemed designed by a 9-year-old. (no offense to 9-year-olds.)<br /><br />even the "one-liners" made us groan and weren't remotely amusing.
