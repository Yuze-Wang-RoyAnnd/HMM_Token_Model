oh man is this movie bad. it flows horribly. the story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself, and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this, doesn't love himself. he tries getting out of the contract and horrible, painfully unfunny gags ensue. jim nabors seems as if he's sleepwalking, not acting. you'll miss such burt sidekicks as dom deluise and jerry reed while watching this stinker. loni anderson's hair is downright scary, proving that tons of hairspray didn't go out in the sixties. or maybe that was a wig. speaking of, burt's wig wasn't bad in this film. his worst "wig day" was in "smokey and the bandit 2". anyhow, this movie is the worst reynolds car movie, ever, ever, right up there with "cannonball run 2". the original "smokey" and "cannonball" (and "hooper" which, thankfully, had no sequel) are great, funny films. this one isn't. even ned beatty, who is a great actor, stinks. you'll long for a jackie gleason type villain who is fun to hate. and mind you, this isn't one of those fun movies to bag on. it's lousy, pure and simple. even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring, and worst of all, unfunny. and least i forget, "stroker ace" was one of the first heavy nails to seal burt's coffin before his somewhat-revival years later in "boogie nights", another film that, like "deliverance" years earlier, shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so.
