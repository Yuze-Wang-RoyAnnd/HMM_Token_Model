i've seen about four other japanese horror films and they weren't too impressive. however, i could sense that there was a sensible script guiding the way.<br /><br />not here, no way. this is about a detective who is trying to tie together similar murders that have been happening. when he finds a suspect to question, the suspect freaks out because they keep seeing a ghost. then, the ghost starts to follow the detective around for a reason that is never explained and takes up more than half of the movie.<br /><br />bad enough? oh no. the film keeps switching perspectives to different characters who don't have much to do with the story. i've seen this before in other movies where it shows a different perspective. not the case here.<br /><br />also, whatever is happening on screen that is actually tolerable quickly ends. for example, there a few scenes with a slight instrumental score that builds up and...then it just cuts to another scene. i'm aware that this can be a dramatic effect. that's definitely not the intention here. it's just bad editing.<br /><br />finally, there's the "ghost" who just screams in a way that's not scary or unintentionally funny. it's annoying and it happens a lot throughout the movie.<br /><br />all of the scares have been done before in better ways so you can see them all coming. then after one of them, the movie is over. at that point, a wave of confusion swept over the audience as i could sense we all felt that we had wasted our time. someone did a mock clap and laughter ensued. it was better than the whole film. simply put, avoid.
