based on the novel by michael chabon, the mysteries of pittsburgh is about the young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last teenage summer roaming around with two friends. the year is 1983, and young art bechstein (jon foster) is at a crossroads. completely opposed to his father's lifestyle, art plans to become a stockbroker. visually contrived with painful attempts to create beautiful hip indie cinematography, the whole film feels like the director - whose previous effort dodgeball was funny if outright commercial - is desperately seeking indie credibility by cobbling together aspects of other indie films but sprinkling it with stars like mena suvari, sienna miller and nick nolte. like so many of the star-laden premieres at sundance this year it felt like this was a secrety studio-sponsored vanity project to help the director earn some indie credibility points - it failed in that respect and as a film in its own right.
