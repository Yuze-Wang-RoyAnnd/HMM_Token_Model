think of this film as a saturday morning live-action program from ages ago. even the small tykes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses! i can't fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting, especially in the costume department! too many warrior-wizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over, but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings. and who in the world would've let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place? i thought this was a "family" movie! mst3k, here's another fine gem for your 1999 tv season!
