admittedly, i find al pacino to be a guilty pleasure. he was a fine actor until scent of a woman, where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably. i hoped this film, of which i'd heard almost nothing growing up, would be a nice little gem. an overlooked, ahead-of-its-time, intelligent and engaging city-political thriller. it's not.<br /><br />city hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters, names, and "realistic" citywide issues, that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating, that once you find out the truth, it will blow your mind. in truth, however, these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as corruption of power, two-faced politicians, mafia with police ties, etc. and theoretically, this setup allows for some thrilling tension, the fear that none of the characters are safe, and anything could happen! but again, it really doesn't.<br /><br />unfortunately, the only things that happen are quite predictable, and we're left with several "confession" monologues, that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the "real world" of politics and society. but after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spider-web of lies and cover-ups, the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal. i don't think we're left with that in city hall, and while it's a very full film, i don't find it altogether rich.
