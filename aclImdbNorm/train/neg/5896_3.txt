one missed call, another asian horror based on the cell phone. i recently rented a korean horror film based on a cell phone called "pon". one missed call was just as boring as that one. maybe phones just aren't scary or something, but this move was dull and drab. no tension or thrills for me, and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and unscary. the movie dragged quite a bit in different parts, and felt too long. didn't keep my attention. it seems phones are hard to make frightening, it's kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine eerie. and it is ridiculous to compare this with "the ring", it seems every asian horror movie is compared to it and so far i haven't seen any that measure up in the least. to horror directors - take the phone off the hook as a horror device.
