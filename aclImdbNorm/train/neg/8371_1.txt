i think its pretty safe to say that this is the worst film ever made, when i saw the trailer on tv i knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of **** and it would be best to avoid it, but i somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends, i walked into the cinema with low expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during this film. the so-called "jokes" in this film bring a cringe to the face, they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls, the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays garbage comedies. the film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull. the characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped. i never want to have to see this **** film again, i'd rather take a bullet to the foot than be exposed to this piece of fuckwood ever again. if anyone i see says they liked it i will physically punch them in the face
