this movie starts slow, then tapers off. after watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing happen, i walked out. i mean, nothing happened. zero. zip. nada. there is no story. the characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know. the producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a "motion" picture. there is no motion. i could have told the same "story" with a couple still pictures with captions. the script is a joke. it's just awful. i doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it. my biggest regret is not that i wasted 60 minutes of my life watching "love in the time of money", but that i missed a great opportunity to be a leader. i could have been the first to walk out, but i waited a bit too long. instead, i watched about 20 people walk out before me.
