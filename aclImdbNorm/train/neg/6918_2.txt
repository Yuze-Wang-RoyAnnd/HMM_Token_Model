i went for this movie believing it had good ratings. firstly, it is ridiculous that they're releasing a movie originally made in 2001, seven years later in 2008 here in india. everything in the movie looks dated. even for 2001 the movie looks like its been made on a shoe string budget. there is a scene where a taxi hits a man to elaborate how low budget you can get. anthony hopkins doesn't seem to know what he is doing in the film. he ends up giving a long monologue towards the end. if the film had bright sparks during that scene, i missed it as i was sleeping on my seat. nothing about jennifer love hewitt resembles a devil. she wears ill-fitting trite clothes and scowls at random kids. as for alec baldwin a scene where he goes to meet webster for the first time is not to be missed. what a waste of money! as anthony hopkins rightly put it, "go back home and write better!"
