like with any movie genre, there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies. if you asked me to name a good gangster movie, i'd have dozens to choose from. if you asked me to name a bad gangster movie, probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since i saw the film for the first and i promise you, the last time. that film is "the general", unrelated to the 1926 silent film of the same name. this is a very dry, very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story (it's more than easy to follow) but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor.<br /><br />like "goodfellas" (1990) and "american gangster" (2007)
