it might have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movie...it is quite predictable not mentioning that the two girls resemble the russian group t.a.t.u....coincidence? i don't think so. there is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous.you know the recipe. the other actors...well,i just don't know what their role is supposed to be. most of them are well - known people in romania and i must mention some of them are not even actors(e.g.mihaela radulescu).so to summarize it: "girl band tatty"+desperate/publicity needing "actors"+ a non-existing plot+ the occasion to use bad language in order to shock= love sick....too bad...the idea was good,though...and i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title...
