...there's no one else watching the movie. my husband and i went to watch it last night. it's just a small theater, but there's usually a decent amount of people there. not this time! my husband and i were the only people watching dragon wars last night! now we know why.<br /><br />the movie was by far one of the worst i've ever seen. yes, the cg was good, but that was it. the acting, script & dialog, directing, editing, etc. was god-awful! since we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the movie. that is, we talked about how bad it was, that it reminded us of the mighty morphin power rangers, godzilla, mortal combat and the lord of the rings. it was like we expected to see rita and lord zed portraying commanders of sauron's army.<br /><br />the creatures were ridiculous. you can't just introduce legions of dino/dragon/lizard things loaded down with cannons without explanation. the lord of the rings has a wide spectrum of characters, but it introduces and develops them over 3 movies, not in an hour and a half.<br /><br />the scene transitions are horrible. i didn't fall asleep during the movie, but even though it was an overly simple plot, i found myself getting lost in the plot holes.<br /><br />the characters were caucasian americans, but spoke almost with broken english because of the badly written dialog in the script.<br /><br />the final scene that could have redeemed some value of the movie...failed. ethan didn't cry when sarah died...though he hadn't known her for very long during this life anyways. he didn't seem too upset to be left in "mordor", not knowing where he was or how to get back. we couldn't for the love of god figure out where he was or how he got there either, but if he wasn't upset we shouldn't be either.<br /><br />oh, and why did the dress that sarah's spirit was wearing look like she borrowed it from queen elizabeth? one more thing...all 3 of the main hero characters were reincarnations brought back to finish the job. sarah completes her task and moves on to the afterlife. jack does this as well. then why does ethan get screwed? he's left alone, without the girl, without a map/compass/helicopter to help him get back. what's he supposed to do? send smoke signals? and if he gets back home, does he just go back to his job? he should have been given the same mercy of getting killed out of the movie that the other heroes had.<br /><br />don't waste your time or money on this movie. we only stayed til the end because we'd paid for it, but as soon as the credits hit, we were out the door.
