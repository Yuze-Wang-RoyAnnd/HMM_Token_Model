i really wanted to like this, but in the end it's a poorly made film with too few laughs.<br /><br />the politics are spot on, it's gonna offend the hell out of republicans but that's what it's designed to do. that alone gives me reason to chuckle.<br /><br />the problem is, it looks like it was made in a real hurry (like about a week). and it contains a stupid subplot about some bimbo singer, which seems to be completely off topic.<br /><br />turiqistan is obviously iraq, or afghanistan, or any other number of countries the us has f**ked with since the 50s. the humour is a little dark (amputees dancing with prosthetic legs made by tamerlane corporation) but it is on the mark, especially with the corporations cashing in on the reconstruction ("democracy lite"!) <br /><br />however like a lot of satire criticising the us, it seems terribly heavy handed and laboured. i guess it's running counter to so much bs propaganda so it has to bludgeon people over the head to make a point. who knows. i prefer more of a nudge, wink approach - a bit of subtlety. but that's just me.<br /><br />anyway i might watch it again, perhaps i missed something.<br /><br />i'm hoping "w" is more on the mark.
