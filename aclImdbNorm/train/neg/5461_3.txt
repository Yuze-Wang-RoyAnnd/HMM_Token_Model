like all cult tv shows, there is a group of people who love the twilight zone so much that they rate practically every episode like they are the greatest shows ever. while several of them are indeed wonderful classics, the truth is for every great episode, there were several that were mediocre and at least one that stank. however, like die-hard trekkies, these zone lovers insist that all of them are gold. in fact, this is what initially got me to review some individual episodes of a couple cult series instead of the movies i usually watch.<br /><br />while this isn't the worst episode ever made nor is it among the very worst, it is poor by any reasonable standard. a widow watches a long procession of civil war soldiers going past her home. in the end, a very unexpected twist is revealed and there isn't a whole lot of excitement or suspense here.
