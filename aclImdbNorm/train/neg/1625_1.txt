when i was in school i made a film about a couple roaming around in the trees and talking, and i realized halfway through editing that this was not just a failing aesthetic strategy but a clich'e of canadian cinema: sodden lyricism married to vacant, metaphor-burdened stabs at social commentary. but whatever my own film's failings i feel much better after seeing this...this...thing. for one thing, mine ran 20 minutes, not 85, and had more content at that: every pointless bit of business here is fawned over for four, five, six relentless minutes. the male lead is just incredible, a brow-beating, loudmouthed creep given to outbursts of drama-class improv in between philosophical insights culled from the u of t pub, and he is given lots and lots of space to make us hate him. admittedly if he weren't such an a**hole then the third act would make even less sense, as a couple snarky dudes show up to provide distant and thoroughly unhelpful echoes of 'exploitation' values; but it doesn't make it any easier to watch the caged creep whimper "please" in closeup until the magazine runs out. i take back what i said about autumn born, which at least had the courage of its own misbegotten lechery: this cinematic crater is and will remain the very worst canadian movie of all time. at least, i really really hope so.
