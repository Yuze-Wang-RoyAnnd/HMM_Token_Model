this was recently on amc's vibrant movie classics and i had to laugh. i had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of "voyage to the earth's core" and "mysterious island". i was sorely disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the silly story line that reads from a five year old's comic book. be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the pterdactyl's wings when they grasp "ogar" a half idiot pre-modern man who befriends the lost adventurers. the ending left it open for further rehashing of the same effects in "people that time forgot". don't waste your time.
