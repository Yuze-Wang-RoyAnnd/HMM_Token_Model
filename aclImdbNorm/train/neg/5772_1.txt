i just have to add, in case anyone actually reads this and hasn't completely gotten the point yet. these other reviewers aren't joking around, this really is the worst colour movie you're likely to ever see. when the movie started i couldn't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see.<br /><br />they're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie. it really does. like the "director" took the family hi8 camcorder (before dv cameras and computer non-linear editing), no other equipment (lights, sound gear, etc), grabbed some decent-looking acting students, and went out to shoot a movie. no script, just making it up as he went along.<br /><br />when i watched it, it was on my mono tv, so i only have one channel of audio (left of right speaker). at first i thought i'd hooked it up wrong. the movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in. i got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly i could hear music and sound effects but then couldn't hear the dialog. they recorded the sound on different bloody channels! i mean, there's movies that can be funny to watch, so bad they're good, kind of thing. i'm not sure this is one of those. i mean, i'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker. and seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and prove you can do it better, you know. but watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it.<br /><br />as bad as they were, the actors are the only good thing about this. i thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of her bath scene. a bit of t and a from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4. but alas, no. if you want to make a movie but it's turning out crap, throw in some gratuitous nudity. worked for roger corman.
