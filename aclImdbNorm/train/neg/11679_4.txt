first, this film is not a "thriller." neither is it "gripping, taut." it might have been so based on the script, but the direction's slow pace makes it difficult to get into.<br /><br />the plot itself is very interesting and ingenious. unfortunately, we only get a sense of *how* ingenious after the picture is over. that leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with music playing over them punctuated by some action scenes that don't grab the viewer, and "cunning vixen" scenes that inject a little more overt intelligence.<br /><br />i wish this had been the fast-paced thriller the box promised. it would've been an outstanding film. instead, spike lee made it plod along through the end.
