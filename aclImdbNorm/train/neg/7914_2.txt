this film was slated to be a blockbuster film, and it really is. this is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics. with that in mind, the movie delivers, perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy iron man, but well enough. outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects, the film drops off of the cliff faster than wile e. coyote.<br /><br />many viewers, myself included, will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered, but that only makes the film a poor adaptation, not a poor film. this film is unsatisfactory for other reasons. the makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind. the characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to 4-scene cameos. the main characters of wolverine, victor creed (never called sabertooth in the film) and colonel stryker are well developed. i was pleasantly surprised by liev schriber's performance. the rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eye-candy. wolverine's character is fully developed after 30-minutes, as is sabertooth, though victor does pull off some surprises late in the film.<br /><br />the "final boss" of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is. the filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular character.<br /><br />very disappointing...
