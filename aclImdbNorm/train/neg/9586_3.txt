following the disasterous revolution, this film was pretty much the final nail in the coffin of goldcrest and thus the british film industry. the film is absolute pants, it's full of music from the attempted mid-80's jazz revival and based on a book & author that was briefly popular at that time and has deservedly sank back into obscurity. temple searched for ages trying to find suzette and came up with 8th wonders patsy kensett another person who was briefly popular at the time. by the time the film came out of post production the jazz revival was over, as was kensett's career and the film met a totally uncaring film public.<br /><br />mediocre would be an overstatement for some of the worst/campest/cheesiest acting to ever grace the british silver screen watching it almost 20 years on and the film is truely cringeworthy.
