i sought out a copy of the forest because i was watching a vh1 special, i think "where are they now", and saw the video box flash across the screen during a segment on the actor corky pigeon. he played the male child ghost in this b horror horrible, but i remember him from his character freddy on the silver spoons television show. this flick's a major letdown. there's nothing here. it actually took me four months to watch it from start to finish. i kept stopping it in boredom, setting it aside and forgetting about it, then stumbling on it and trying once again to get through it. obviously, the angle of this film that was intended to set it apart from its counterparts was the supernatural element, the apparitions. and obviously, here, that doesn't work. i can't stand the male leads. i kept expecting them to look down at their palms during the longer dialogue scenes in order to read cheat lines. the situation at the beginning where the couples decide to go camping separately is awkward and plain dumb. i guess the only positive thing to say about this one is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg, you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh. it's fairly good gore makeup there. man, i'm really reaching for a positive now, huh. the only other no-budget horror film on a level as bad as this one would be home sweet home.
