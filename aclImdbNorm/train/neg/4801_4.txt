i really wanted to like this movie. it has a nice prison setting, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly hideous 80s-touch and it is a directorial effort by actor john saxon, who also plays a bad (you guessed it) a bad guy. it reminds me of some (beloved) italian horror flicks. but the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish/frightening moment in there. it just goes on and on and on, and then it (logically) has to end. more suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed.
