i saw this "hot" movie when it came out in 1986. it had a x rating for a brief scene involving oral sex but played in mainstream theatres (it was an "art" film). supposedly it's the first film to ever show a respected actress in an explicit sex scene.<br /><br />what i saw was a boring tale about a high school boy (federico pitzalis) in love (understandably) with an older woman (maruschka detmers). as has been mentioned before detmers is very beautiful with a good body but she also gave a very good performance. pitzalis was (to put it mildly) pretty poor. it's no wonder he never made another movie. still, despite the infamous sex scene (which is explicit but pretty brief), this a slow moving dull story which bored me silly. the good acting by detmers only helped to a certain point. mostly i was looking at my watch waiting patiently for it to end. if it didn't have that sequence this movie would have been forgotten long ago. dull and slow. you can skip this one.
