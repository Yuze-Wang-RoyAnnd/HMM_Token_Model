the major fault in this film is that it is impossible to believe any of these people would ever be cast in a professional production of macbeth. hearing david lansbury's soft voice struggling laboriously with the famous "tomorrow, tomorrow, and tomorrow" speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him for the role. i kept believing therefore that he didn't get the part because he was a lousy actor; not because a bigger name was available. then when we see portions of the play in rehearsal it is difficult to believe the director is not parodying things with a hopelessly miscast, misdirected travesty of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and directors who see the play through their own screwball interpretations. sometimes directors are so anxious to have their films done (and writers think they have the ability to direct their own works)that they settle for less. this appears to be such an example.
