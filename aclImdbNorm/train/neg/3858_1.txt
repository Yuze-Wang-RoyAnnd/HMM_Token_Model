what a terrible, terrible, film! one of the worst movies i have seen in my life. i usually love movies like this, the whole "a guy meets an eccentric woman who he likes, but he happens to already be involved with someone, who not right for him....". i expected something predictable and i didn't mind. the movies are always entertaining mixing the right amount of romance with comedy, but not this one! every single joke falls flat and the "romance" makes me want to vomit. the title character is one of the most "please kill me" characters that i have ever witnessed on my television, the "eccentric woman" isn't very eccentric, more like quirky and annoying. the "other someone" is the most reasonable, mature person in this film but also happens to be just as annoying. this films flat out sucks, there's no way around it, don't waste your time.
