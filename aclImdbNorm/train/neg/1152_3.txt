i understand what this movie was trying to portray. how the old are often ignored and treated like a bother, which means they end up feeling unappreciated and like their lives are empty.<br /><br />i do not have a problem with this message, but i just feel that it could have been put across in a way that is not so painful to watch. i enjoy a good art movie but when a movie becomes too self-consciously arty (as in this case) the result is often frustrating. including shots of a person packing a suitcase slowly that take 5 minutes try to make a point but just end up annoying the audience.<br /><br />the female characters are very weak and you end up wanting to just tell them to pull it together. this is a movie you feel you should enjoy or rate highly and certainly has its' merits but i was just too frustrated watching it to ever recommend it to someone else. it might have a deeper message than other roger michell movies (for example: 'notting hill') but at least that was a movie you could enjoy watching.
