elizabeth rohm was the weakest actress of all the law and order ada's and her acting is even worse here. her attempts at a texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic. nor can she adequately summon the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child; at times while her daughter is missing she manages to sound only vaguely annoyed, as if she can't remember where she left her keys.<br /><br />this is an important true story, so it's too bad that the awful acting of the lead actress distracts so much from the message. the rest of the cast is talented enough, but they just can't overcome rohm's tendency to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of a southern drawl whenever actual acting is required.
