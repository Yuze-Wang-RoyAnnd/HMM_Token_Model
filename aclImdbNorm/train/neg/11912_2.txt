the story behind this movie is very interesting, and in general the plot is not so bad... but the details: writing, directing, continuity, pacing, action sequences, stunts, and use of cg all cheapen and spoil the film.<br /><br />first off, action sequences. they are all quite unexciting. most consist of someone standing up and getting shot, making no attempt to run, fight, dodge, or whatever, even though they have all the time in the world. the sequences just seem bland for something made in 2004.<br /><br />the cg features very nicely rendered and animated effects, but they come off looking cheap because of how they are used.<br /><br />pacing: everything happens too quickly. for example, "elle" is trained to fight in a couple of hours, and from the start can do back-flips, etc. why is she so acrobatic? none of this is explained in the movie. as lilith, she wouldn't have needed to be able to do back flips - maybe she couldn't, since she had wings.<br /><br />also, we have sequences like a woman getting run over by a car, and getting up and just wandering off into a deserted room with a sink and mirror, and then stabbing herself in the throat, all for no apparent reason, and without any of the spectators really caring that she just got hit by a car (and then felt the secondary effects of another, exploding car)... "are you okay?" asks the driver "yes, i'm fine" she says, bloodied and disheveled.<br /><br />i watched it all, though, because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting... but in the end, the poor execution made me wish for anything else: blade, vampire hunter d, even that movie with vampires where jackie chan was comic relief, because they managed to suspend my disbelief, but this just made me want to shake the director awake, and give the writer a good talking to.
