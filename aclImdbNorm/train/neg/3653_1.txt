i cant help it but i seem to like films that are meant to be scary and are just plain bad. i have personally listed it in my own top 10 worst movies right under creatures of the abyss!. watch this film and have a laugh just don't expect to see any academy awards for acting. more chance of understanding the film its self. in all honesty though i have seen much worse than this. plus some maniac cruising round the desert wiping the same people out that just died is that unbelievable that its got to be original. i think its one of those love or hate movies. you can make up your own mind yes its awful but it pulls it off somehow thats why i love it
