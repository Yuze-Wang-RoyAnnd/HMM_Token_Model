ha. without a doubt tommy's the evil one here. i don't know why, but for some reason, little kids in horror movies tend to come across as little butt munches. and since they're kids, they won't die. because they're annoying...well..except for asylum of terror. but those are few and far between.<br /><br />anyway onto the movie. can't find this movie on dvd? sure you can! all you have to do is buy the chilling classics dvd pack! not only do you get metamorphosis on dvd for $15, but you also get 49 other movies! what a bargain! pff. ok. i'm done advertising for these cheesy movies. let's just say, this movie ain't worth the 15 bucks on its own.<br /><br />so we have a chemist scientist. yeah. cause all chemist scientists look as handsome as this guy playing peter. he's trying to come up with a serum to stop deterioration of the body. the college he works at wants to pull the plug on his project, so he tries it on himself. but because this is a horror movie, he sucks it up and starts and incredibly long transformation sequence that takes nearly 3/4 of the movie.<br /><br />to pad out the movie he gets into a relationship with some woman who has a son. and she was never married! scandalous! but of course tommy is one of the most irritating characters....no. i take it back. he is the most irritating character. far worse than the old crippled guy who wants to take over peter's work and gloats over him while he's in the hospital. that's right, even as an old cripple, you can still be the villain.<br /><br />so we see peter start to randomly kill some people in visions he has until he realizes he's the one doing it and just decides to kill everyone in his path to get back to normal. however at the end he ends up de-evolving into a lizard. yeah, i know don't ask. the ending really doesn't make any sense. and if you're hoping for any really good payoff, you're not going to get it.<br /><br />this isn't a horrible movie....it's just frustrating because of the lack of a good payoff. if you already own the 50 movie pack and this is next on your list, you're not in for a snoozer, but you're also not in for a great movie. just sit back, relax, and eat a lot of snack food. because this movie isn't going to be making you jump out of your skin anytime soon.<br /><br />metamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizard heads, out of 10.
