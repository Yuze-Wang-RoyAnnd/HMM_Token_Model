another in a long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story. within 15 minutes, the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines, so there is absolutely no mystery, which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense. the only half-way competent actor is killed 10 minutes into the film, so we're left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things. low budget films can't afford expensive special effects, so the cgi portions are unsurprisingly unimpressive, but were at least a valid attempt. the creature suit is terrible, as seen when it falls to the sidewalk, and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes, which aren't even the red color shown in mirror shots. the dialogue is clumsy and uninspired, with some lines reminiscent of aliens or terminator. the last action sequence takes place in a police station, also a rip-off from terminator, with everyone hiding in the one glass lined office that the darkwolf doesn't smash into. in the end, the girl calls the hero "a good protector", but he gets both his partners, the original protector, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen cops, all killed without getting a decent shot off, in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun. but here's the real clincher for bad writing: they could have killed the beast right after the beginning credits when it was holding the stripper while flashing its red eyes. instead, they took it into custody?!?
