the story of the film was as simple minded as its morality: go find a girl, marry her, live with her happily ever after. though the film had some fine moments and turns, most of it stayed at the surface of what might have been shown in a film with the same storyline.<br /><br />the baptist/mormon struggle was only touched superficially and was mocked about, probably intentionally. a more interesting story would have been a mixed couple.<br /><br />if you wanna see a film which doesn't need too much concentration, which can be watched by the whole family and which teaches your children modest and conservative values (besides the modern tolerance stuff ;-) ), you will be fine with this film. might be shown at a family-home-evening...
