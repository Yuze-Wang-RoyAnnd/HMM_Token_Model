interesting film about an actual event that took place during the civil war in vermont. it kept my attention to the end and i don't regret viewing it. i haven't ever read any on this raid incident so i was curious to see if the rebels pulled it off. i enjoy historical films from that era.<br /><br />my major complaint is with the confederate uniforms. they look too good!!! the acting was a little stiff at times. i like the old man eating the mashed potatoes because he didn't have any teeth. the wounded soldier playing fetch with a hound was a little strange. overall, it was a descent film.
