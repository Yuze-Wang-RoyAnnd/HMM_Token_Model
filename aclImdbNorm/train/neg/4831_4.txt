i rented this film on netflix after it won all the oscars, to see if it was really that good.<br /><br />the hurt locker is a very realistic portrayal (for the most part) of a group of soldier's rotation in iraq. the film centers around will james, a reckless soldier who gets his adrenaline fix from taking risks, and defusing bombs.<br /><br />where this film seems to lack in my opinion is the plot and direction of the movie. this film has no clear plot unlike other films such as black hawk down. what this film tries to do is focus more on the characters, and their different attitudes about the war. bigelow does an okay job of focusing on the characters, but there are many points in the film where the dialogue seems to drag. hurt locker is 131 minutes long, yet it feels like a 3 hour movie.<br /><br />one scene in the movie that was particularly awful, and ruined the films perfect credibility, was the sniping scene halfway through the movie. it was both unrealistic, and very long.<br /><br />overall, i thought this film was okay, but the reason i gave it a 6 instead of a 7, was because it was a major letdown for winning best picture at the oscars. i felt like this film could have been so much better considering saving private ryan lost best picture, but was much better than this film. another notable mention is black hawk down which only won 2 oscars. i honestly do not know how this won best picture.<br /><br />if you are looking for an action packed war flick, rent black hawk down. this film will be forgotten in a year or two.
