this movie is about a cop (ching wan lau) trying to catch a super-clever thief (ekin cheng) who blackmails an insurance company headed by a kelly lin. basically, whatever plans the cop tries the thief somehow knows them beforehand. this movie, covered by handsome lead actors, beautiful lead actress and good camera shots of hong kong scenes, really has no substance at all. it's all flash, and the flash quickly becomes dull too. i lost all interests a third of the way into the movie, and there is no redeeming quality after that, except for the cinematography, which looks good. only consider seeing this movie if you can do so for free. also, consider stopping watching the movie 20 minutes into the movie because it's all the same to the end: boring. 6/10
