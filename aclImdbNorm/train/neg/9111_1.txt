cruel intentions 2 is bloody awful, i mean uber-bad. words can not explain how bad it is, but i'll give it a go anyway.<br /><br />the plot of cruel intentions 2 is very similar to the first film. sebastian (robin dunne), is kicked out of a private school and is forced to move to new york. there he decides to make a fresh start and just a life a normal life and settle down. unfortunately he has to deal with his step-sister kathryn (amy adams) wants to drag him down. sebastain starts to fall in love danielle (sarah thompson), the innocent daughter of the headmaster of the school. kathryn wants sebastain to just sleep around with the whole school which had been describe as a 'whore-house'. kathryn also wants to get revenge with cherie (keri lynn pratt), who humiliated her during the school assembly. kathryn wanted to make the freshman into the biggest slut in the school, a similar sub-plot to the first film.<br /><br />cruel intentions 2 is basically a cancelled tv-show, which was turned into a prequel. there are so many problems with the film. it is poorly written, unfunny, and badly acted. luckily for amy adams that the show never took off because now she is a fairly big actress. whilst cruel intentions had a sense of realism and can been seen to be set in the real world, cruel intentions 2 is set in sitcom land and as described on amazon.co.uk 'a randy version of saved by the bell'. there were some dark themes involving sex and drug use in the first film, but in cruel intentions 2 tried to make it funny and some of the ideas in the film shouldn't be, such as kathryn having an affair with a teacher. other ideas also don't work such as the secret society where all the popular kids meet to discuss the downfall of other students. the film also had a major problem of sexualised 15/16-years-old. i know that teenagers do have sex, sometimes a lot, but when done on film or television, is treated very seriously. one famous sense was when daneille encourages cherie (who is around 14/15 in the film) to simulate sex on the back of a horse to the point where she has a orgasm. the idea of turning a girl around 14/15 into a slut is just very wrong with me, and shouldn't be made into a subject of comedy. the jokes in the film fall flat, whether if it's a verbal gag like 'she goes all moist when she sees you' to a visual gag where sebastian pushes kathryn face first into mud.<br /><br />there is a lot wrong with this film, which i don't have time to go into, but i say it should be avoid. just watch cruel intentions, whilst not a classic, still is a decent film and treats the subject matter well.<br /><br />this film is just a pervert's wet dream, having school-kids having lots of sex with each other.
