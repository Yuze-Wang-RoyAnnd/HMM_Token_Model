another vast conspiracy movie that tries to blame the us government and the armed forces (especially the army) for every disaster since the great flood. anyone who has ever served time in the us military can see how bogus this film is. uniforms, equipment, sets, and mannerisms are all wrong. (and of course, all senior officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots.) blatant propaganda with no attempt at objectivity. most of the theories presented have been disproven over the past few years. uses every cliche', rumor, and urban legend from the gulf-all are presented as gospel. (the truth is, no one knows for sure why some gw vets are sick and others are healthy as horses.) ps this is not new. war is not fun and i know wwii, korean, and viet nam vets with some pretty serious ailments, too. (and the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them.) sensationalistic movies like this will not solve the problem!
