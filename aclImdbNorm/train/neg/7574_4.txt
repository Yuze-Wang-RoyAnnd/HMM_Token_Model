but it does have some good action and a plot that is somewhat interesting. nevsky acts like a body builder and he isn't all that attractive, in fact, imo, he is ugly. ( his acting skills lack everything! ) sascha is played very well by joanna pacula, but she needed more lines than she was given, her character needed to be developed. there are way too many men in this story, there is zero romance, too much action, and way too dumb of an ending. it is very violent. i did however love the scenery, this movie takes you all over the world, and that is a bonus. i also liked how it had some stuff about the mafia in it, not too much or too little, but enough that it got my attention. the actors needed to be more handsome...the biggest problem i had was that nevsky was just too normal, not sexy enough. i think for most guys, sascha will be hot enough, but for us ladies that are fans of action, nevsky just doesn't cut it. overall, this movie was fine, i didn't love it nor did i hate it, just found it to be another normal action flick.
