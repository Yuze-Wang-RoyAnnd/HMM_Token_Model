considering how much money was budgeted for this film, you would expect more from the story as a whole. this could be quite possibly the most worthless movie i have ever watched. there was no real advancement of anything. character development, minimal. plot advancement, maybe. enjoyment, none. i'm not sure what points were even trying to be made. if you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys, american cia bombs everything that doesn't agree with our opinions, all capitalists are corrupt, and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death, have at. for those of us who realize that it doesn't take killing off a good guy to make a point, we'll stick to other movies. in summary, this was a horrible attempt at an 'ocean's 11' style hide-the-plot-so-person-has-to- think movie because not only do you not know what's going on, nobody who made the movie did either. home alone 3 was a better cinematic piece.
