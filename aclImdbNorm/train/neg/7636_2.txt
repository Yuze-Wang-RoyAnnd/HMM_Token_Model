i so wanted to believe in this movie after the only form of mainstream comedy this country recognises is slapstick and stereotypes.<br /><br />of course, it went completely the other way - let's be cool and edgy - and came out the other side with little to show for it. i bet one small seed went nuts for this. i know sl did.<br /><br />none of the main characters have the comedic chops to pull it off. even danny k had better timing. i'm actually being serious. every time they introduced a bit character i kept thinking, "darn, this person should have been the lead!".<br /><br />independent doesn't mean that the camera work needs to be horrible. black and white did nothing for this movie - actually with such flat dialogue it hurt this even more by bringing the boredom into sharp relief. the black and white also wasn't crisp. the composition was horrible. the use of music was horrible. strangely enough i watched little miss sunshine after this movie and the composition on that was superb - maybe that's why the deficiencies in this movie stick out in my mind.<br /><br />i think corne (who was funnier than the leads before he even said anything) was speaking to this movie and not david - see it and you'll understand. i bet the guys who organise oppikoppi were dismayed. one would think nothing happens there at all. i got the feeling it could have been filmed in someone's back garden. i know regular guys who have much funnier, raunchier and wittier conversations than any of these "comics". the dude who they hooked up with end was ok though.<br /><br />guess sa comedy's gonna stay in the stone age a little longer. nice work guys.
