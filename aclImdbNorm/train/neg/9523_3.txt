the plot of this film is not strong at all, lots of holes. if you approach it as a car movie its not bad, lots of great cars in this one. the reason i like it is because i am from the area where this was filmed. i get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in st. cloud mn and seeing how the town has changed since 89. its an interesting historical piece for us locals. seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it. it is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it came out on vhs. had to get a copy from japan on ebay i find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town. i didn't know the director was from st.cloud.
