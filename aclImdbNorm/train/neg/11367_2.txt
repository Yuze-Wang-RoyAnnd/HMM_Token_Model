greg davis and bryan daly take some crazed statements by a terrorists, add some commentary by a bunch of uber-right reactionaries, ascribe the most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist moslems on the planet to everyone who calls themselves a moslem, and presents this as the theology of islam. maybe their next film will involve interviewing fred phelps and the congregation of the westboro baptist church, adding commentary by some militant atheist "scholars, and call their film "what the world needs to know about christianity." ultimately, this film suffers from both poor production values and lack of attention to the most basic standards of journalism. don't waste your time and money; just turn on your am radio and listen to rush limbaugh for a couple of days for free and you'll get the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis.
