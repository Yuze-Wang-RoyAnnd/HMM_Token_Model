i agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film. i found it incredibly silly (at best) and downright misleading, misinforming and harmful (at worst). like others, i found this film to be an awful mix of "real" science and pseudoscientific, new age propaganda. <br /><br />as a psychologist, i was especially offended by candace pert's contributions. true, i was not a fan of hers before this film, but her discourse on the "consciousness" of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term ("consciousness") that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify. it is an old orwellian mind-f**k that the master himself described so well in his superb essay "politics and the english language." to refer to "consciousness" in this manner--indeed, to refer to this film as "based in science" in general (which is its clear intent)--is to use language in the same manner employed by stalin when he labeled his slave-states "democratic republics" and hitler when he called his party a "socialist workers" movement.<br /><br />i don't claim to really understand quantum physics. i know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study. ah, but we americans do love "instant enlightenment," and that's what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish. if it asked questions, that would be one thing, but it clearly attempts to ask and answer them, which no film could possibly do simply because we are far, far away from the answers (if they indeed exist).<br /><br />by the way, ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several "expert commentators" with the maharishi mahesh yogi (and tm), not to mention j.z. knight, who often speaks in her "ramtha" voice. (i'm always amazed at this channeled 10,000 year-old atlantean superman's grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology. but then again, this film argues that the past, present and future are all one and the same, so if ramtha existed in atlantis 10,000 years ago, i suppose he could exist now and tomorrow. only, then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers? oh, i forgot, i'm the creator of "good" and "bad" advice, so it's all my fault, not ramtha's.)<br /><br />what a mess.
