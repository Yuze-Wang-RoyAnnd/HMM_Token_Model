the problem is the role of the characters in the film. man to man shows a british anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself. the problem is the role of the pygmies in the film - two people who are kidnapped, treated like animals, and yet given such a shallow, stereotypical role within the film... the kidnapper (british anthropologist) ends up being the hero of the film because he 'manages' to relate to the pygmies... no notion of how the two hostages feel, of their point of view, of their ordeal... i find it is a shallow film, with a one sided fundamentally racist view... it never manages to move away from the 'white mans' view
