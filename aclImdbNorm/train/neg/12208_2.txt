as an army veteran, i was deeply offended by this film. in my opinion, it is a disgrace to those who fought in the vietnam war. to say that the real sf soldiers i knew were offended by this crap is an understatement. if the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon (it was), it would have been better received. but it was taken seriously my many people, especially overseas. silly as it sounds, wherever i went in europe in the late 80's people seemed to judge me and americans in general by this film. unrealistic? hmm, let's see. a monosyllabic, muscle-bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to se asia to free some american pow's. in a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an m-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats. and he never misses, running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm. i could go on, but i'm getting a headache. i gave this a 2/10 only because it's slightly better than rambo iii.
