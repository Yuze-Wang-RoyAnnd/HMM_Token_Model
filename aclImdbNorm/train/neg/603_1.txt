absolutely laughable film. i live in london and the plot is so ill-researched it's ridiculous. no one could be terrorised on the london underground. in the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs, etc. that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely. or that it's even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and age...<br /><br />the worst that's likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them. although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network, another thorn in the side of the story. (remember in london as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.)<br /><br />if it had been set in a city i am not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed it through ignorance, but it's not a high quality film so i just couldn't bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it is.<br /><br />i would have given it 0/10 if such a rating existed! possibly the most disappointing film i ever thought i would like.
