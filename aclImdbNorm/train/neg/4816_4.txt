i imagine that the young people involved in the making of "necromancy" (aka "the witching" plus a bunch of other titles) must have felt a little weird being on the set of a horror movie with the man who: participated with john houseman in the production of a proletarian play ("the cradle will rock"); scared people into thinking that aliens were invading ("the war of the worlds"); and directed and starred in the greatest movie of all time ("citizen kane"). and now orson welles was starring in a third-rate flick about a satanic cult.<br /><br />there's basically nothing creative about this movie. lots of nudity, but the background music always proves really distracting. even if the movie wasn't particularly predictable, it still wasn't worth seeing. how low welles had sunk. fortunately, over the final thirteen years of his life, he narrated the documentary "bugs bunny superstar" (about the warner bros. cartoons of the 1940s) and hosted the documentary "the man who saw tomorrow" (about nostradamus). i recommend those two, but not this one. just avoid it.<br /><br />also starring pamela franklin and michael ontkean.
