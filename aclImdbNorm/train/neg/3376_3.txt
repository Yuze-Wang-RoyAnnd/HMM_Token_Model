for anyone who has seen and fallen in love with the stage musical a chorus line, the movie is a shoddy substitute. not only are songs cut, but unnecessary plot twists added, new dance sequences choreographed, and, let's face it, richard attenborough just doesn't know how to film dancers.<br /><br />onstage, michael bennett's a chorus line was just that: michael bennett. his idea, his choreography, his direction, his gift to broadway and the rest of the world. it was two hours of hard-hitting, in-your-face realism that really made you feel for these "boys" and "girls." the movie, however, lacks empathy and depth: the actors look like they are auditioning for a chorus line rather than actually auditioning. every move, every line of dialogue seems so weighted and planned; michael douglas, especially, as zach is too in control for us to believe that he is this extraordinarily bitchy choreographer. even when he throws his temper tantrums, you never quite believe him because every gesture, every accented word, every nuance is so obviously rehearsed. and as for him not dancing: kevin kline auditioned for the role of zach on broadway. michael bennett loved his reading, but kline couldn't dance and ultimately lost the part. how i wish they had done the same for douglas! a chorus line is supposed to be a show about nobodies, and aside from a few recognizable faces (vicki frederick, who played cassie on broadway, as sheila and khandi alexander, of tv's newsradio, as one of the many auditioning dancers) you're not supposed to know any of these people. because you do know these people. having a star in any of the roles is a terrible decision: when you focus on michael douglas and his ranting instead of on the girls and boys on the line and their stories, you lose something.<br /><br />it is truly unfortunate that the best sequence in the show (montage: hello twelve, hello thirteen, hello love) is cut drastically to make way for a terrible new song entitled "surprise, surprise" that surprisingly received a nomination at the oscars. cassie's "mirror dance" has a new song and tragically boring choreography -- one wonders why they bothered to shoot a movie version at all if they were going to mess with a working formula this much.<br /><br />for fans of musical theatre and those who enjoyed the stage version, this movie is a sad mockery of everything they cherished and loved. for those who never got to see the original production, either on broadway or on tour, this movie is the only reference they will have to go by. and they'll have to wonder just how it got to be the longest-running musical in broadway history -- until a little show called cats overtook it in the late 1990's. but that is a different story, and don't even get me started there.
