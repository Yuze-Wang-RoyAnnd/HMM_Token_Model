wow, i can't believe people consider this a 'good' movie. now, i have seen much worse, but there are much more romantic/funny comedies with john cusack.<br /><br />this is a mediocre film at best. while the acting wasn't terrible, but not great, for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, little romance. there were many loose ends that don't show up or are not addressed. unfortunately, the main characters do come off as complete cowards. they don't know themselves well enough to realize that they don't love the people they are engaged to. how do we know they aren't in love? by the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances. i can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show.<br /><br />the movie doesn't even end with a wedding scene, more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing. this movie is really about two people who can't commit to anything, unlike cusack's previous characters, who were more than willing to make a deep commitment (loyd in say anything, martin in grosse pointe blank, etc.).<br /><br />the greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns, or anything of interest. when the movie ended, i felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story, which basically fits the whole movie: boring. no suspense about whether the two will end up together, no joy when they do, no consequences to their actions.<br /><br />it is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie, that they simply rebuke any criticism with 'everyone is too cynical!'. criticism of this movie is not cynicism, simply unbiased examination. there are many other better romantic comedies, even ones with grace kelly, or eva marie saint.<br /><br />if you think this movie is great, try these movies, you hearts will explode: the princess bride, say anything, grosse pointe blank, high fidelity, keeping the faith, charade, rear window, north by northwest, or there's something about mary (which is a good examination of idealized romance vs. today's society).
