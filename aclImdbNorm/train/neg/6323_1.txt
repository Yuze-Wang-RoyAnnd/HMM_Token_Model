this movie is a bad memory from my childhood. this is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you can't go out for recess, and you'd rather be watching anything, anything else. at least that's what it was like when i was in elementary school. i just remember hating this movie. granted, i haven't seen it in 15 years or so, and they probably don't use it on rainy days anymore but i just want to warn everyone: you'd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them. trust me, pick anything else. even though the topic is kind of controversial, the plot is so tame and slow that i can't remember anything about it except that i disliked it so strongly that here, 15 years later, i felt the need to warn all of you against it.
