i have always wanted to see this because i love cheesy horror movies and with a title like this, i was sure "the incredible melting man" would be a lot of fun.<br /><br />it really wasn't. i mean, the acting was entertainingly bad, the script contained some classic bad lines and the special effects looked like someone had sneezed all over the lead actor, so i should have loved it. unfortunately it's really draggy between these highlights. i decided to watch the last half of the movie while doing my tax return. that's how boring this film is.<br /><br />nevertheless, if you love bad movies you will enjoy the dramatic exit of the fat nurse, and the stellar acting of the guy who plays dr. ted. to be fair to the poor man, he does have to deliver some amazingly inept lines with straight face - like the conversation he has with his wife on tracking down the i m man:<br /><br />"i'll find him with a geiger counter." "is he radioactive?" "just a little bit." <br /><br />yes, the plot has dr. ted wandering about trying to find a superstrong zombie killing machine armed only with what looks like a mini-dyson. he's a brave man. unfortunately his plan fails when he finds a big lot of goop on a tree. "oh god - it's his ear!" says dr. ted to the audience. i'm so glad he cleared that up. <br /><br />i realise i'm making this movie sound rather fun. it would be if it were only 10 minutes long, but unfortunately it goes on and on, and the incredible melting dude just dangles about making a sticky mess when he should be eating more people in my opinion. i think if you were truly stoned you would probably love it, just don't have pop-tarts during the movie, because the lead actor really does resemble one near the end.
