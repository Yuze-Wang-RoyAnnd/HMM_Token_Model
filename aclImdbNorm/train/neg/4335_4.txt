the movie and acting are not bad and jay hernandez does a good job playing calito brigante but the movie forgets it's suppose to be a prequel to a hit movie. the makers of this prequel clearly did not watch the original carlito's way or at least did not care about continuity. this movie is a prequel which means the original movie has already laid out some history for us and this movie should end where the original begins or at least lead up to it. not one of carlito's close old friends from the original make an appearance in this movie, they're not even mentioned. luis guzman, pachanga in the original, is in the movie but he plays a completely different character. the original takes place in 1975 and the prequel takes place in 1969-70. considering this movie takes place less than 5 years earlier, wouldn't you think one of carlito's long time friends would make an appearance? in the original, carlito start's out being released from jail after spending 5 years in jail. that's only a few month's between the end of the prequel and the start of the original! ***semi spoiler*** we know from the beginning of the original, carlito has spent 5 years in prison so when the prequel gives us this hollywood happy ending it's an insult to the intelligence of fans of the original. what happen to gail? it's the lack of continuity that made this film go direct to video release.
