this was a movie that i hoped i could suggest to my american friends. but after 4 attempts to watch the movie to finish, i knew i couldn't even watch the damn thing to close. you are almost convinced the actual war didn't even last that long. other's will try to question my patriotism for criticizing a movie like this. but flat out, you can't go from watching saving private ryan to loc. forget about the movie budget difference or the audience - those don't preclude a director from making an intelligent movie. the length of the movie is not so bad and the fact that it is repetitive - they keep attacking the same hill but give it different names. i thought the loc was a terrible terrain - this hill looked like my backyard. the character development sequences (the soilders' flashbacks, looking back to their last moments, before being deployed) should have been throughout the movie and not just clumped into one long memory. to this day, i have yet to watch the ending. but there was a much better movie (not saying much) called border.
