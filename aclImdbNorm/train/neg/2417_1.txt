this was without a doubt the worst thing i have ever spent money on. i feel dirty for admitting that i rented this 'movie' and actually paid money to see it. this does not even rate trash. no no. this is the juice that collects at the bottom of industrial dumpsters located in particularly foul neighborhoods after an extraordinarily humid summer. to call it trash would be to degrade trash everywhere. it was so bad i felt i had to register at imdb and warn my fellow man. this luvahire character claims this movie is great. one has to question his grasp on reality. let's take some of his comments and analyze them.<br /><br />"the actor who played ricky (i forgot his name) did a very good job."<br /><br />i see. well, if the director envisioned his audience cringing and wincing at every sentence uttered by ricky or alternately bursting into uncontrollable laughter at moments when most directors would want a more somber reaction from their viewers, then yes; ricky did an outstanding job.<br /><br />"i'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and it's not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off."<br /><br />wow. i too must give props to actors who can pull off emotional scenes. luvahire, you may want to look into another line of work there buddy if you think these chuckleheads pulled it off. still, they can help you if you need to practice crying. just watch the movie. ha. ha. ha. <br /><br />"bring on the sequel"<br /><br />if i was your theater teacher at school i'd fail you based solely on this comment alone.<br /><br />i am too disgusted to continue. i shall now turn over the movie bashing to my associate, mr. bangla. <br /><br />howdy! if you've continued to read this far, i take it for granted that you've already seen the movie, and you're now looking for one of two things in this comment: 1) additional vitriolic debasement of what you agree was an exceptionally poor movie. 2) additional vitriolic debasement of what you feel was a good cinematic effort which needs defending against such libelous scum as myself. whether you want help articulating your disgust or ammunition for a stirring repartee, if i say anything good it'll only disappoint you--so let me assure you, there is little chance of such disappointment. <br /><br />the other negative comments here at imdb have already enumerated the particular failings of the movie (e.g. the acting, the soundtrack, the directing, the dialogue, the editing, etc.), however all of these faults can readily be forgiven, in and of themselves. few people will rent a movie titled "hood of the living dead" if they require these elements to be top-notch. the ultimate failure of "hood", however, is its failure to deliver on the abundant promise of its name. "hood of the living dead" practically leaps off the shelf at the video store with its implications of corny one-liners and gruesomely creative kills. here was a chance to mix the cheesy gore of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto, to have gangsta-thug zombies bombin' on the innocent living while rockin' do-rags, to have undead pimps drivin' over all-too-mortal po-lice in their tricked-out rides. the mixture of the two genres could have been hilarious. instead, the movie is more like watching middle school kids timidly deliver the lines to a play they are performing, but don't understand. to avoid a feeling of betrayal on the part of their video-rental audience, i suggest that the quiroz brothers re-release the movie with the following new title: "hood of the living dead: a home-made horror video we shot on our camcorder with some friends over a weekend last summer because we were bored". or perhaps they could release it as a documentary. "the day creativity died: an exploration of how a low budget movie can still be perfectly devoid of clever or original thought despite lacking ties to a major motion picture studio." <br /><br />the potential renter whose interest has not been quelled, should find the following blurb on the back of the video case: "the quiroz brothers have proved once again that watching things which you can easily do yourself is not very interesting."--mr. bangla
