i viewed this movie in dvd format. my copy may have been affected but i was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the dvd. i will say that my initial reason for viewing this movie was claire forlani. while fun to watch, i feel she didn't live up to my expectations that i have so far found from her other films. i actually was equally pleased to see arkin turn in a humorous performance. the other two actors i wasn't very familiar with so i can't compare their performance, however they were fairly enjoyable also. the acting is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion. the story line, while some could say slightly compelling, lacked direction. i feel that the main problem stems from the script and not the direction of this film. if you enjoy any of these actors to a fair extent then i recommend this film, but otherwise leave it alone.
