i've seen the movie only recently, although it appeared in 2001. i hoped to see an entertaining movie, but let me tell you, princess blade is nothing compared to azumi. the "princess" is not very talkative, as you may have noticed... she reminded me of jean claude van damme, who only stared to make his point, then beat the crap out of the opponents. during the entire movie, i waited to hear at least a confession about what she liked, why was she fighting, who did she love and trust. i waited in vain. crappy movie. crappy dialog. don't watch it unless you want to be bored out of your minds! it's so bad, that in the end i was wondering how i managed not to scream in frustration 1 and a half hour. approximately. i give a 4/10.
