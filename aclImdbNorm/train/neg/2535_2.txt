just like last years event wwe new years revolution 2006 was headlined by an elimination chamber match. the difference between last years and this years match however was the entertainment value. in reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the pepsi arena in albany, new york with the wwe championship. those men were current champion john cena, kurt angle and shawn michaels. there was no way vinnie mac would put the belt on any of the rookies; carlito or chris masters. and kane? kane last held the wwe championship in june 1998, and that was only for one night. it was obvious he wasn't going to be the one either. last years match was a thrilling affair with six of the best wwe had to offer. 2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by far.<br /><br />the only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event. out strolled vince mcmahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber. it was then announced that edge was cashing in his money in the bank championship match right then and there. with no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the elimination chamber match john cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining heels in wwe. this was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all night.<br /><br />the undercard, like last year, was truly atrocious. triple h and the big show put on a snore fest that had me struggling to stay away. hhh picked up the win but that was never in any real doubt was it? any pay-per-view that has both jerry lawler and viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success really does it. the king pinned helms (who books this stuff?) and big vis tasted defeat against the wasted shelton benjamin with a little help from his mama.<br /><br />the women of the wwe also had a busy night. there was the usual diva nonsense with a bra and panties gauntlet match which was won by ashley and the woman's championship was also on the line. in a match, i thought would have been left to brew till wrestlemania 22 mickie james challenged trish stratus in a good match. trish won the contest but it was evident that this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />the opening contest of the night pitted soon to be wwe champion edge against intercontinental champion, ric flair. this could have been better but it was a battered and bloody flair that retained after a disqualification finish. edge obviously had bigger fish to fry.<br /><br />so new years revolution kicked off the 2006 pay-per-view calendar in disastrous fashion. the only good thing from that is knowing that for the wwe the only way is up. they don't get much worse than this.
