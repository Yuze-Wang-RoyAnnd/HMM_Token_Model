this movie is phoniness incarnate, a straight 11 / 10 on the phoniness scale. the fakeness of the accents as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are just staggering. yanks, although the real scotland may be just as colourful, if you ever go there don't expect to be given much of a the chance to "dance out" controversies with the locals. also, don't attempt to sway local opinion through the otherwise fine art of tapdancing.<br /><br />there are a couple of infectious singing-and-dancing scenes, but the plot is far too cheesy and linear, and the dialogue is often too weak. i also doubt whether anyone would want to be stuck in a timewarped 18.th-century scottish village in the boondocks rather than gay new york city. maybe it wasn't such a big sacrifice for that priest to have left brigadoon, maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of that dump.<br /><br />watch it for the fine alternative-reality view of what a christopher streed day-parade in scotland would look like on lsd. other than that i'd only recommend it to hollywood muscial completists.
