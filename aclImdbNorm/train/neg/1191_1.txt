i'm a big fan of troma but i can't figure out why they bought the rights to this movie, it's so boring i felt like i was watching for 3 hours. some where on the plot summary it says "but what satan doesn't know he's stuck with annoying tourists" well they didn't seem to bother him in the movie, just me.<br /><br />the only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays satan, i like bad movie's but it was just boring.
