i have seen most, if not all of the laurel & hardy classic films. i have always enjoyed there comical stupidly, even after watching it over and over again. this new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both laurel & hardy, however fails miserably for various reasons. one of which is how out of place their cloths are (still early 20th century) however are both portrayed in the 90's setting. some of the former dialogue was brought back, however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series. this film could very well be the worst film i have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever. the real laurel & hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation.
