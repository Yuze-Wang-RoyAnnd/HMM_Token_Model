celia johnson is good as the nurse. michael hordern is good as capulet, though it's his usual neighing and whinnying and not a patch on his king lear. john o'conor reads the verse well as friar laurence though he never takes it anywhere. alan rickman is good as tybalt, in the first of his "yuk" roles that would make him famous. christopher strauli's benvolio is sympathetic.<br /><br />the sets are pretty, if not stunning as in some of the other bbc shakespeare's.<br /><br />and that's it. the rest is weak to dreadful. rebecca saire turned 15 during production, and hasn't a clue about how to act juliet - she opens her eyes real wide and whines every line in exactly the same way. patrick ryecart is poorly matched to her, and his self-regard is inexplicable. the balcony scene flows smoothly and uneventfully with zero emotional or erotic impact. their deaths come as a relief. if i had a dagger, i would have offered it to them hours earlier.<br /><br />anthony andrews is unspeakable as mercutio, a great shock if you remember his fine work in "brideshead revisited." he breaks the mirror of shakespeare's verse into a thousand shards of two or three words each, and then shouts the fragments in as disconnected and unintelligible manner as possible. in this production, queen mab abdicates. awful.<br /><br />the director, alvin rakoff, shows only an intermittent gift of putting the camera where it will show us what we want to see. the opening brawl is notably incoherent. however there is humor when in a later fight, romeo apparently knees tybalt right in the cobblers. tybalt then grabs the offended region. however did that get through? <br /><br />r&j is a long play. this version is not recommended for classroom use, or much else.
