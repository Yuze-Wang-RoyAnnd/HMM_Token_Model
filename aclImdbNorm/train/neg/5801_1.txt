ivan (valeri nikolayev) is a bitter, cynical journalist who investigates the unexplained. he travels to this small town where it's said that a witch (ita ever) is terrorizing the community.<br /><br />his car stalls and he takes refuge in a small building, and meets a beautiful, mysterious girl. suddenly she turns into a demon and he kills her, and the town is wondering who murdered this woman...who i guess was the witch but i am not entirely sure. ivan is now being pursued by her spirit, or something, and he has to have faith, or something, to beat it.<br /><br />i really hate christian films. they are usually filled with lame actors, stupid storyline and minimal effects. not to mention that this isn't just a christian film...but a foreign one as well. the voice-over actor for ivan made the movie more comical than terrorizing, because it is so high pitched and whiny. you won't miss much by missing out on this film.
