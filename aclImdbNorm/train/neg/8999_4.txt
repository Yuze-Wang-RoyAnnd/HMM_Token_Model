saturday night live, national lampoon, and sctv alumnus are all together in a sometimes funny sketch film.<br /><br />however, it is very interesting to watch now, at the start of 2005. twenty years after this movie is supposed to take place, look at how many of their gags have become absolutely true: there is a mock movie trailer, that probably wasn't even clever at the time, for something called "the pregnant man" which came true with arnold schwarzenegger's dumb movie "junior" there is a commercial spoof, that probably wasn't even clever at the time, for something featuring sammy davis jr. and jackie onasis called "celebrity wrestling" which has now come true with a popular show called "celebrity boxing" there is a mock movie trailer, that probably wasn't even clever at the time, that features john candy in a movie about a severed head. watch this trailer and look how similar it's shots and plot are to frank hellenlotter's basket case!! and finally there is an ad for a late late show documentary about "a dead dream, the only two left ..." the name of the documentary is ... the last hippies! lol.<br /><br />four prophecies come true!
