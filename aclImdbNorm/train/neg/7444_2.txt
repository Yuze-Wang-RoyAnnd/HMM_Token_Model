unless you are petrified of russian people or boars, this movie is a snorefest. actually, i fell asleep about 40 minutes in & had to fight the urge to just leave the theater. i wish i had. a waste of a perfectly lovely saturday evening.<br /><br />even "silent hill" was scarier. heck, even "pan's labyrinth" was scarier. i'm still unclear on what was supposed to be scary in this flick.<br /><br />to begin with, i'm very leery of movies that use "pidgin russian" like this one did in the opening credits. it's embarrassing to me since i brought a group of my russian friends & we all cringed. oh my god.<br /><br />hmm. well, luckily for me (& probably you, too) this movie has already escaped my brain & i just stepped out of it an hour ago. so i have no specifics, just murky visuals that go nowhere & some languishing-now-dead hope that anything would happen.<br /><br />perhaps i saw a completely mutilated version of this film because i can't believe it got such great reviews here (which is why i saw it) & ended up being so completely devoid of not only horror or suspense but overall entertainment value as well.<br /><br />i give it a 2 because, yes, i fell asleep & wanted to leave after 40 minutes but i woke up & didn't leave.
