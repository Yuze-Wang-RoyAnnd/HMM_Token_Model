i really can't say anything bad *or* good about this thing. its characters are likable enough, it's capably produced and designed, and professional-looking (except for that cheesy monster suit). however, it has no originality, no ideas, and nothing you haven't seen in alien, predator, armageddon and/or outland. it's just another formula, cookie-cutter, "grimy corporate drones in deep space versus unstoppable monster" flick. pretty much a waste of time.
