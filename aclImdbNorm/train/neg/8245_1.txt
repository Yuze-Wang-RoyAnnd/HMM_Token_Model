i can't believe anyone liked this movie. i've seen a lot of low-budget indie films, but this one absolutely sucked. low budget doesn't mean the movie has to be demented. horror doesn't mean the movie has to be demented. there was nothing scary about this movie at all. it was just a gore-fest, and a particularly disturbing one at that. the acting was average, considering they were all unheard of actors, but the story was pathetic, the dialog was pathetic. the movie tries to come off as "artistic", or something. this is not one of those really great indie films that cost only thousands of dollars to make, but are incredibly well done. this was nothing more than an excuse for some extremely sick people to put their perverse obsessions on film. other reviews here also said that the soundtrack sucked...that's because most of it was written by the same person, and some of the songs were written by one of the writers of the movie. there were no redeeming qualities to this movie at all. a complete waste of my time and money.
