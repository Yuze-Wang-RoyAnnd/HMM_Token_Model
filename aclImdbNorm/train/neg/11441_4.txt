after a promising first 25 minutes that makes you feel all warm inside, you're pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy. then the movie takes a turn for the worse. <br /><br />the warm feeling might still be there, but as others has said: the plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial that it's almost unbearable to watch. <br /><br />the movie gets sped up, and you get the impression that you're either fast forwarding through it, or that the producers decided to fit it in less than 1h40m and had to cut a lot of scenes out.<br /><br />realism isn't a goal onto itself, but as a viewer, i'm pretty convinced that this comedy isn't intentionally unrealistic, it just happens to be.<br /><br />on the plus side, this movie has a couple of nice interiors, and despite the bad script, i think that the actors performances are mainly good. if i could rate the first 25 minutes only, i'd probably give it an eight. as it is now, it gets a four. ...and that's being nice! <br /><br />if you're a sucker for romantic comedies you'll probably have a great time anyways. if not, i'd recommend that you watch something else.
