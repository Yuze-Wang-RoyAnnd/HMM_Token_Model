i am never a big fan of taiwan movie production as opposed to korean, hongkong or even china. strong acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film. i don't consider myself as hard-to-please audience as i am, in fact, a fan of indie movies. however this movie shows weak plot and slow pace. i found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going. the acting certainly does not make it better. rainie's acting is sub par as she 'over-act', trying to be perky and cute. although i have to admit she is a pleasure to look at. isabella leong on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a confused, sad, regretful, extremely reserved character. overall i find this movie is a disappointment.
