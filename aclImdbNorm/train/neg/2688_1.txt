in order to avoid confusion, let me clarify a couple of points: i am not a red neck. i am not even a moderate nor a conservative. quite on the contrary, i am a radical: a libertarian. i'm not a wasp either, i was not even born in the states.<br /><br />jorge luis borges used to say that there are some kind of folk who do not feel poetry, and that these sad people usually earn their living teaching poetry. this movie was made by and for people who do not feel poetry, by and for show-offs; and i dare say, by and for people who have no sense of decency or, for that matter, respect for other people's life or death (especially when the victims are thought to be mostly 'bloody imperialists' killed in yankee soil.) i even find the original marketing idea of the eleven episodes of eleven minutes, nine seconds and one frame as particularly hideous and repulsive. just plain awful. why didn't they assign a budget of as many dollars per episode as individuals were brutally murdered in the attack? the whole idea rests somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism. anybody who is serious about film-making (and serious about life and death) should have angrily declined to participate in this recollection of innuendoes and non-sequiturs. with two exceptions: the episode of burkina faso -- almost amusing --, and the one from india --which documents the story of a man who was unfairly and wrongly investigated in relation to the attack, on the basis that afterwards he didn't return home and that he was an american muslim (and, truth be told, when the facts were known he was honored as a hero). all other nine episodes, essentially and extremely boring and emotionless, can be listed in two different categories:<br /><br />first: 'i don't care about the thousands of victims: americans, foreigners, children, youngsters, adults, old-timers...' and can be resumed in pure boredom and lack of emotion. makhmalbaf's (iran); lelouch's (france)
