i will say that at least the movie makes sense, but it's bad. the acting for the most part is not good (i think only sky showed any promise) and you feel awkward watching it. all of the scenes that should be meaningful are really shallow, like when ng comes out to her parents. there are a lot of corny details, like the kanji tattoo on the sky's shoulder, the magnets on the girls' refrigerator and the god awful decor at the sets...and the music...and clothes..and everything. real life has never been like this movie. the boy says at one point "i'm gay, not corny." and not aware. even the commentary is awful, i turned it off after ng talks about how she was weirded out playing a lesbian.
