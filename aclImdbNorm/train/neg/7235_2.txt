not even bob hope, escorted by a raft of fine character actors, can save this poorly written attempt at wartime comedy, as his patented timing has little which which to work. the plot involves a hollywood film star named don bolton (hope), and his attempt to evade military service at the beginning of world war ii, followed by his enlistment by mistake in a confused attempt to court a colonel's daughter (dorothy lamour). bolton's agent, played by lynne overman, and his assistant, portrayed by eddie bracken, enlist with him and the three are involved in various escapades regarding training exercises, filmed in the malibu, california, hills. paramount budgeted handsomely for this effort, employing some of its top specialists, but direction by the usually reliable david butler was flaccid, and this must be attributed to a missing comedic element in the scenario. a shift toward the end of the film to create an opportunity for heroism by bolton is still-born with poor stunt work and camera action in evidence. oddly, lynne overman is given the best lines and this veteran master of the sneer does very well by them. dorothy lamour looks lovely and acts nicely, as well, and it is ever a delight to see and hear clarence kolb, as her father, whose voice is unique on screen or radio, but there is little they can do to save this film, cursed as it is with an error in script assignment.
