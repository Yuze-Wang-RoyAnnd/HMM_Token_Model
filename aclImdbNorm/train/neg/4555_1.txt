this film fails to capture any of the mystery and intrigue that the book offers. the main point of the book, the insights, are hardly even touched upon, leaving the viewer wondering exactly why everyone is making such a big deal about them and why they are willing to risk their lives.<br /><br />the character development is not good at all. no background or personal development leaves the audience not really caring at all about what happens to them, and so the action sequences fall flat.<br /><br />the search for the manuscripts ends abruptly, and with no real explanation, not leaving any sense of satisfaction as to what the whole search was for.<br /><br />this is one of the worst adaptations of a book i have ever seen. it is horrible and a waste of time. if you have not read the book, skip the movie and read it. if you have read the book, skip the movie and reread it.<br /><br />it is almost as if the point of making the movie was to discredit the book, that is how poorly done and ridiculous this movie is. it is a shame too, because it could have been good had they capitalized on it at the height of its success and they probably would have been able to get a good screenwriter and some good actors.<br /><br />please don't waste your time, read the book!!!
