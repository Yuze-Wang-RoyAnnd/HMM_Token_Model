i was not nearly as smitten with this as many other reviewers. sure, it has a pair of lovely girls playing erotic, lesbian vampires. marianne morris and anulka d. play these two lovely sirens with razor teeth that run up to cars on a road out of the way, hitch to their home(at dusk), and invite their prey...sex-starved men to their boudoir. what happens there...well, after they disrobe and kiss each other mostly, they kill their visitors. director jose ramon larraz does have some flashes of brilliance with his camera. some scenes are quite eerie and effectively shot, but sex alone does not hold a film up(no pun intended...at least consciously). there really isn't much of a story here. we have the two girls. we are shown some inexplicable and unexplained beginning where we see them shot with pistol. why? what does it mean" why do we have the guy that stays for several days greet a guy at the hotel that insists he knows him from years ago? does that have a purpose? of course i have even more general questions like what is a couple of nice-looking girls doing as vampires in the english countryside and having a wine cellar filled with wine from the carpathians? anyway, the script is riddled with such flaws. it is also very sparse on the action outside of catch victims, wine and dine them(quite literally), and then go to bed in the crypt. the end gets going with some juicier scenes, but it is anti-climatic. there are, as i said, some effective scenes by the director...i particularly liked the way the girls dressed and were filmed in the woods looking for their prey. the house is also a most impressive set. and both girls are as i said very lovely. marianne morris in particular stands out - in more ways than one. for you older film fans, silent screen veteran bessie love has a brief cameo at film's end.
