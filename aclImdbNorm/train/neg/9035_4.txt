being born in the 1960's i grew up watching the tv "movies of the week" in the early 70's and loved the creepy movies that were routinely shown including "crowhaven farm", "bad ronald", "satan's school for girls", "kolchak the night stalker", etc, but this one is just plain dumb.this is obviously the writer's trying to capitalize on the horrific manson murders from a few years earlier. the movie stars dennis weaver of "mccloud" and "duel" fame as a father who takes his family camping on a beach. the family encounters some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family. the reason for this is never explained, and weaver's pacifistic stance is hard to swallow. for god's sake, call the police, beat the hell of them or something, just don't sit there and whine about it. the acting is pretty lame, the story unbelievable, etc. susan dey looks cute in a bikini but that's about it. ignore this if it ever airs on tv.
