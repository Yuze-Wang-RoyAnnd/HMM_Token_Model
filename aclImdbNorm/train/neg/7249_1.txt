this movie rivals "plan 9" as one of the dumbest movie ever made. always be concerned when the same person is the:<br /><br />1. star 2. director 3. producer 4. writer 5. stuntman, and 6. editor. unfortunately, justin kreinbrink did all 6 jobs! imdb shows that he and his father were western 'stunt men'. so maybe that was the problem. <br /><br />here's just one example from the film: in the film the sheriff has to take a witness to another town for protection. of course, the bad guys find out and are waiting for them. but, what happens? the good guys are riding along and a shot rings out and hits a tree near them. when the camera shows us the bad guys they're all just sitting on a log, chatting. what's wrong with this picture!<br /><br />i could go on. perhaps this film was meant as a comedy. if so, it didn't do that well either.
