the main aspect about the superstar's movies at his later stages were the frequency, the lacuna between one movie and the next. being a well established star of the south indian cinema, the feedbacks he was receiving before baba was great. <br /><br />since nattukku oru nallavan (1991), the number of movies he acted in tamil as a mass hero in 11 years were only 11 exactly at the rate of 1 per year. all of these were a great hit. he was having a image that many thought could not be easily brought down. <br /><br />but after padayappa (1999), he went into a state of hibernation. his fans all over the world, especially in south india were ready to see movie of any kind with their superstar in action. so, the tamil cinema industry decided to come with baba. <br /><br />the movie makers thought that the fans will take whatever they show with superstar in it. but this clearly did not work out in this movie. as usual, the hype from the media and the expectation from the fans were way beyond limit. <br /><br />rajinikanth's image was totally damaged. the fans went nuts. the movie's collection did not meet the expected level. reputation of great people went down. <br /><br />the only positive aspect about this movie was the songs by a.r.rehman. rehman is known to have composed good music for some worst movies like tajmahal, kadal virus, alli arjuna, paarthale paravasam, star, en swasa katre, vandicholai chinnarasu etc. well, i never thought that this movie would join that league.<br /><br />you'l feel very much depressed not because the movie was bad, it'l be because of the superstar's image going down. it took him five full years to regain it fully back with two movies chandramukhi and sivaji and give fans back what they really look for in a superstar film.
