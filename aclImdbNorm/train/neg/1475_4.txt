most of the episodes on season 1 are awful..there is no comparison to twilight zone or outer limits, as they programs actually had decent story lines. most of amazing stories are well dull..not amazing in the least..go rent or buy the twilight zone series...i have heard season 2 of this series is much better..also for some reason on the dvd's they cut out the ray walston parts which further diminishes this compilation. the one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985...most of the story lines are very predictable though and the series could of been better with twists and turns that left you wondering...
