i watched scarecrows because of the buzz surrounding it. well, i can't imagine anyone liking this movie because it's just bad, bad, bad.<br /><br />it's obvious that whoever made this movie doesn't know a single thing about horror. the whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres: action movie (guns and criminals) and horror (living scarecrows). when the criminals are killed one by one by the poky looking scarecrows, the two genres automatically cancel each other out because, first, they're criminals and who cares about criminals, and second, because they're stupid criminals to boot! having zombie scarecrows go after them just doesn't work here. where's the horror in that? i wanted the criminals to die horrible, painful deaths.<br /><br />but the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres, which could have been original if handle well, never gels. we're simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of scarecrows, which are "alive" for whatever flimsy reason the filmmakers thought up. making things even worse is the fact that the cinematography is terrible (tv like) and, worse offense of all, whole bunches of the dialogue are told on cbs, and we continuously hear inane dialogue spoken over disconnected images as if we're watching some sort of radio show. this part was really bad. the director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea! i can't tell you how annoying that was.<br /><br />as i've already mentioned, the criminals in scarecrows are amazingly stupid. for instance, when someone suddenly shows up, gutted and filled with money and straw (yep, straw) in his huge open wound, the others ask "what drug is he on?" after they shoot tons of bullets in him, unable to kill him (he's been "zombiefied" by the scarecrows. don't ask...). get a freaking clue, morons. i've never seen such stupid people in a movie. and then there's the girl. i wished one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she was a pain in the butt. when she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow "cross", she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene (bad acting), even though the criminals couldn't have done it. what a dimwit she was! but the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick. they're not scary. nothing much is explained about them. they're just a plot device in this plot device filled movie.<br /><br />mr wesley, filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 seconds nonstop doesn't elicit anything but sheer boredom. and that scene with the talking head in the fridge. thanks for the laughter.<br /><br />all in all, this had to be one of the worst movies i've seen recently (and i've seen a lot of movies these days!) between the equally woeful silo killer or scarecrows, i'd rather watcher silo killer again. yep, scarecrows is that bad.
