barbara streisand directs and stars in this very jewish story.<br /><br />to have a chance at obtaining an education, babs enthusiastically disguises herself as a boy which isn't the most difficult thing to do since she already looks like a boy, anyway. at her new school she meets many male classmates who have no trouble at all in believing she's a guy.<br /><br />don't miss the best of many moments of unintentional humor when babs' male friend thinks she's a man, but pins 'him' to the ground, sits on top of 'him', and looks affectionately into 'his' eyes.... *snicker*.<br /><br />mediocre film; splashy story about nothing particularly interesting.
