david lynch's crude and crudely drawn take on south park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clich'es about suburban middle class families. the father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouth-hole from which are uttered the most horrendous guttural noises, the son and mother are permanently horrified, incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life. a number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series.<br /><br />lynch is not famous for his comedies (i.e. on the air, aspects of wild at heart), and i am not particularly fond of comedies in general. however, there were a couple of scenes in dumbland which made me laugh out loud. there are some clever bits of animated cinematography - where lynch conveys wide ranges of reaction in his characters through a syntactical arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions (which never really vary in dumbland).<br /><br />i believe lynch was really trying to give his audience a straight-forward, if disturbing, animated comedy here. interestingly, he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra-low-brow humor (i.e. most will farrell films) while adding elements of vicious social critique and classic cartoon violence and gross-out humor. while the blend doesn't really work very well here, it is nothing if not lynchian.<br /><br />worth seeing by lynch fans.
