yowza! if anyone who loves laurel and hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you're a better person than me! this movie, while a great attempt at 'imitating' laurel and hardy through appearance, sound and routine, falls very short of honoring them, or even being a movie of any substance. i blame larry harmon. dialogue is torn from old l+h movies and planted in unrealistically, the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless co-stars, pinchot's accent was bizarre for stan, and while sartain did an excellent job with ollie's accent, he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was mr. hardy. where was a (good) musical number? editing is choppy, acting is stiff, lines are horrid, physics are -implausable- (although perhaps they were trying to give it that feel of cheap sets?), and overall it's a terrible thing to witness. it's even more painful to watch than atoll k, where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950's era writing and photography. do yourself a favor and watch as much of the original laurel and hardy films as you can, and learn how things were. you know what a magnate is, don't you? stan laurel did not perpetually reply with semi-moronic quips at every sentence.<br /><br />i pity anyone who thinks that this was a decent update/honor of the boys. where was the classic theme song?!? why ruin 'here's another fine mess'? why skip 'any the wiser'? why was there a pointless gaggle of co-stars?! why miss gulch from the wizard of oz???? why must larry harmon be in it? why bozo!? and did the learning channel help fund the thing?<br /><br />i mean, really. fart jokes, for god's sake.<br /><br />fart jokes.
