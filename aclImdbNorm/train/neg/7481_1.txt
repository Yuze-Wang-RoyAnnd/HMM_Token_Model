someone should tell goldie hawn that her career as a teen-age gamin ended thirty years ago. <br /><br />this is one of the worst films released in years, an unequivocal disaster in which the two leads give themselves over to a frenetic exposition of their trademark tics in an effort to make up for a bad script and bad directing. this thing should have been smothered at birth.<br /><br />i hope john cleese got paid a lot for having his name attached to this disaster. he is the only performer who came through this stinking mess more or less unscathed, his only fault being a failure to realize that the rest of the cast would sink the picture.
