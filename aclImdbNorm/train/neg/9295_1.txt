i was very surprised how bad this movie was. nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie so far. i was hoping for a rerun of hero, but this is much, much worse.<br /><br />this movie is why kung fu movies got a bad reputation in the first place. no believable characters (even within the cartoonish world of kung fu movies, these characters are ridiculous), virtually no plot, and ridiculous story twists.<br /><br />this movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a make believe game with a child. every time you think your silly battle makes some sense, they invent another ridiculous twist that makes no sense ("ah ha, you only think you've got me with your super powers and 10,000 ray guns, but i ate my vitamins laced with plutonium and teflon, so your ray guns don't work and i'm invulnerable to your super powers....tap tap no trade backs infinity plus one.") children can continue with this lunacy, because they don't really care whether anyone is listening because they are having a fun time. however, for the viewer, especially the adult viewer, this long movie is worse than a bout with bad gas.<br /><br />spoilers ahead note to kung fu movie makers, (a) if you have a knife in your back it hurts unless you are on pcp, in which case your kung fu is not strong, (b) if you repeatedly fall on your back, which has a knife in it, it will hurt more and do more damage, unless it is a fake prop, (c) when you get stabbed in the heart with a knife, you die, especially in ancient china where there isn't a kaiser permanente around the corner, (d) kung fu fights don't last for hours while 3 feet of snow falls, and (e) sometimes it is worth while explaining your characters and their motivations.<br /><br />in any event, go watch hero again, because at least within its own little world it is comprehensible.
