this film is awful. the screenplay is bad, the is script mediocre, and even the sex scenes are worthless. the thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking. this movie was shot in a dark, shadowy and monochromatic style (a la "war of the worlds"), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. greg morrisey's brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film. the twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here; the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic. the only highlight is sharon stone's performance as catherine tramell, faithfully continued in this sequel, but it isn't enough to make up for the other shortcomings. the only circumstance under which a "basic instinct 3" should be made would be if michael douglas agrees to join the cast.
