i couldn't tell if "the screaming skull" was trying to be a hitchcock rip off or a modernized edgar allen poe tribute. these days, someone would have chopped it up a bit and presented it as one of those tv anthology episodes from the old "tales from the dark side"...but only after an extensive rewrite.<br /><br />the sad thing is, there seems to be a nice, nasty little story trying to get out from under the rubble of this movie, and the actors are obviously doing the best they can with both their talent and the material they have to work with. but the director just didn't know how to stage or pace a dramatic scene; the special effects simply didn't work; the screenplay telegraphed its threadbare plot points so plainly that a bivalve could have seen them coming; and the soundtrack kept playing german "oompah band" music when it was supposed to be trying to scare the audience. <br /><br />they tried; they tried really hard. but this is of interest only as a period piece.i suppose someone very young who hadn't seen a lot of suspense or horror might get a charge out "the screaming skull", but someone that young probably wouldn't get most of the subtext or plot motivation. ("mommy, why is that nice man trying to scare the twisty faced scaredy-cat lady??")
