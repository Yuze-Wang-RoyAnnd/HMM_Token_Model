henry sala's "nightmare weekend" is a rotten piece of sludge from troma.this is a juvenile,sloppy and stupid low-budget horror film about some teenage girls spending the weekend at a mansion.the professor's evil assistant lures the girls into a bizarre scheme to perform hideous experiments.using a brain implant she transforms her victims and their dates into zombies."nightmare weekend" is a completely braindead piece of garbage that features lots of nudity and some cheesy gore,not to mention a laughable musical score.the acting is horrendous and the script is utterly incoherent.why such piece of crap is widely distributed is beyond me.avoid it like the plague.1 out of 10.
