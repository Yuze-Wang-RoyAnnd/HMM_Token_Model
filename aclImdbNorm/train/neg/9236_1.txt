i'm among millions who consider themselves cary grant fans, but i can't think of a single reason to recommend this movie.i don't understand the casting of betsy drake and it appears no one else did,if we're to judge from the small number of films in which she played afterwards.<br /><br />most fans will agree that katharine hepburn was superb at chasing and catching cary grant in bringing up baby.here the director or writers try to rehash the idea,but it fails miserably.i've read comments about how "creepy" drake was,but i thought that was far too mild a description. franchot tone walked through this one as if he were hungover.a casting disaster is one thing.this film is a total disaster.<br /><br />this one doesn't deserve 10 lines of comments and i don't know why that's a requirement.too bad this one was preserved when so many worthwhile films lie rotting in vaults.<br /><br />unless you want to torture someone,give this one a wide berth.
