i read all these reviews on here about how this is a such a good movie. jeez, this movie was predictable and pretty boring. the acting was below average most of the time, especially by mckenna. i haven't seen a more pathetic attempt at making someone "badass" in a movie. oh man, this movie was a letdown. i also read somewhere this might be a cult classic. i know there are followers of the director, but this movie was just a average piece of film.<br /><br />the script was lame, for the most part the acting was lame, this movie was lame.<br /><br />oh and pray for the guy that used to be in cheers. he looks really bad. <br /><br />the best actor in this movie was probably the guy in office space, and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes.<br /><br />4/10
