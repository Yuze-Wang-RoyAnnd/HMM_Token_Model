for your own good, it would be best to disregard any positive reviews concerning this movie. this flick stinks. now, i like (at least in theory) low budget horror movies, but this one makes the worst mistake a low budget flick can make: it takes itself way too seriously. and, unfortunately, that's not it's only problem.<br /><br />it's the story of the murderous beane clan of the british ilses transposed to modern times. an interesting premise, but there are two things that are immediately perplexing about this film once you start watching it.<br /><br />#1- why is the biggest name on the cd box jenna jameson? she's a below average looking woman who can't act, and she has a minor role. answer: she's apparently a well known porn star (as you no doubt read in other reviews), so i guess this is a "cameo" appearance for her. she's giving the film much needed "name recognition", it seems. her top billing isn't any indication of her talent, though, it's an indication of how untalented the rest of the cast is.<br /><br />#2- how can film makers be so stupid to think canada can be passed off as ireland? it doesn't even remotely look like ireland. and the house that the guests/victims stay in is this great big north american wood frame edwardian thing. they should have skipped the whole beane theme and developed a story that took place in n.a. also, if you're going to make a movie that takes place in ireland, it's probably best to have more than one character with an irish accent (and that was a really really really bad irish accent.) now,this wouldn't have been so bad if the director wasn't trying to make the next "night of the living dead", but it seems he was. too bad. he could have had some fun with it. in fact, some of the scenes weren't far from being unintentionally comedic as they were.<br /><br />like the infamous gutting scene, were the woman is chained to the table, stripped naked, and then sliced open and eviscerated. that's funny, you ask? well, in the deleted scene version, the mutant killer pulls out mile after mile after mile of intestines. it's actually funny after awhile. and what self respecting cannibal eats intestines, anyway? do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens? heck no, we eat hams and ribs and drumsticks. oh well.<br /><br />some of the other cast who were annoying: the whiny, creepy howard rosenstein. i'm not sure, but i think he was supposed to be cast as a stud. in fact, he's as big a loser and goof ball as his name would imply. which would explain why the character played by the equally annoying gillian leigh fell for him.<br /><br />i checked gillian leigh on her link on imdb, and apparently it's important to know that she graduated high school with honors. i can't decide if it's more amusing or pathetic to know that only a couple years after graduation, the honor student is doing nude soft-core porn scenes in a shower with a guy named howard rosenstein. wonder if her former classmates have seen this movie? if they have, hopefully they'll get the message: avoid this fate! go to college!!! i could go on and on, but why. if you like gore, you'll find something redeeming in this flick, but not much more.
