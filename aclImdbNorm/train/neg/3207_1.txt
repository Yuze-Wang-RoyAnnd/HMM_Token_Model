oh my god this was so bad! the story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish. this film takes itself far too seriously...unless of course they meant to be funny. i saw this last week at the london sci-fi festival and the entire audience was laughing at every scene. i think my favourite was 'shouldn't you be studying medicine at oopsalof'! and i also think they were trying to see how many times they could cram in the character nicalo's only line 'we will be together...it is our destiny.' i'm sorry but after the first time, the words lost all meaning.<br /><br />and what was with the apple?<br /><br />i recommend this as a lesson to americans: you cannot animate, so please don't try. you only embarrass yourselves.
