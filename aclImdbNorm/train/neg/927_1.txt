i mean really, how could charles band the head of full moon let a total stink-ball like demonicus out. i mean it should never got the green light to begin with. the story is repetitive, the characters are weak at best, there is no real story on tyranus other then he's a bad dude. then they writer or director goes out his way for a bad ending. that's right a bad ending, demonicus rises. the last survivor escapes a deadly cave in, then a picture of chimera comes to life, cheaply i might add and chases her out. then as she is walking home ala funhouse. a statue that has been destroyed centuries ago reappears for no reason just to collapse on top of her. i mean, that makes no sense. what the hell was charles thinking allowing this pile of puke to be made, with four different movie companies they were that desperate for movies. they could have asked me, i had better ideas then demonicus. thanksgiving turkey.
