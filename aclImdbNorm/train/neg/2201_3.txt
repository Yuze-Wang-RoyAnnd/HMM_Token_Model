horror/sci-fi that is interesting as it is laughable. f/x pretty good...for what you manage to see. a made for tv thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them. jeffrey coombs plays a brilliant although misguided scientist that tampers with stem cell research and manipulates human dna with that of a hammerhead shark. the horrifying results give birth to one hell of a killing machine. a group of scientists led by william forsythe and hunter tylo are invited to a remote island to check out the brilliant new experiment. of course, after laughing and stammering in awe...coombs' creation, by the way is his own son fused with a hammerhead, is let loose to hunt down one by one his father's colleagues. revenge is not always rewarding. also in the cast: elsie muller, g.r. johnson, arthur roberts and velizar binev.
