another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved children tale, la bete (1975) aka the beast tries to imagine (in very graphic and what may seem offensive and disturbing but in reality rather silly and comical way), what actually happened between beauty and the beast? i am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look too deeply into this movie. i would not go so far as saying that it is a serious and dark exploration of such subjects as sexual frustration, longing, fulfillment, or satirical criticizing of the catholic religion. i would not even call it a horror-erotic movie. it's more of the parody on all genres it touches or mentions even though it's got some shocking moments in all departments that sure will stay in your memory.<br /><br />the long (way too long) scene between an aristocratic young woman and the supposedly horrifying but the most laughable i've ever seen in the movies creature with truly impressive...well anatomy, is set to the clavichord music of scarlatti and is hysterical. my husband and i both laughed out loud at the exaggerated details of the encounter. the moral of the scene is - beauty can and will defeat the monster. the question is - who is the target audience for the film? for an erotic picture, it is too verbose; for an art movie - it's got too many jaw-dropping scenes of sheer madness and i'd say an abrupt ending. imo, the film creator did not mean for it to be a serious drama. as a parody of art house/horror/erotica, it is funny and certainly original. have a good laugh and try not to look for some deep meaning. this story of the curious beauties and the lustful beasts certainly is not recommended for co-viewing with the children. the opening scene that may shock an unprepared viewer much more than the infamous scene of bestiality can be successfully used on discovery channel for the program like "in the world of animals - mating habits and rituals of horses".
