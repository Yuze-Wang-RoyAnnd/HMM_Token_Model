even though this was a made-for-tv production, there's absolutely no excuse for the rock bottom results of the finished product. this movie did have a budget and it had a casting department, so, if you're going to make a movie about a true life story, and actually put "the true story" in the title, shouldn't some effort be put forward to try and capture some realism ? first of all, this movie is absurdly cast. these actors belong in daytime television soaps, or in those ridiculous lifetime channel movies, and not in a real-life gangster/criminal tale. everything about them, from their looks to their mannerisms, just screams of the 90's-shopping-mall-alt-rock-listening generation. what about the script ? two words describes it - stupid and insulting, and again it's way too 90ish sounding. i don't think the real clyde barrow ever uttered the words "i'm outta here." it's as if a bunch of "new kids on the block" fans got together and decided to make a really "kewl flick" about bonnie and clyde, you know, one that would be totally rad and rockin'. well, this sticker doesn't even rank on the rad and rockin' scale. everything that can be wrong with any kind of film is wrong here, from the casting and acting to the editing and music. every single thing is grossly wrong....and it's infuriating that the parties responsible for this atrocious turkey had the nerve to put "the true story" in the title. it's certainly not the true story, but even worse, it's not even remotely entertaining as a mindless popcorn flick that's accepted on its own terms. like i stated in my heading, it's simply horrible beyond words, on every level imaginable. trust me on this, or watch at your own risk.
