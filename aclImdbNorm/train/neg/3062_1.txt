some might say something like "baby geniuses" with its giant robot infants or "dumbo" with its psychedelic drug-addled nightmare sequence would win the award for the most disturbing movie ever made for children. you might say that too, but you'd be wrong. lo and behold, for i bring to you: santa claus, the most helplessly messed up family film since ... well, ever. <br /><br />from the opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their insipid theme songs (seriously, this segment is nearly 20 freakin' minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot!) to the thrilling conclusion in which merlin pops up from outta nowhere and saves the day (don't mind him, he's from barcelona), this is childhood trauma at its finest. and no matter how hard i try, no matter how many different therapists i visit, i just... can't... get... those... reindeer's...laughter...out... of... my ... head! <br /><br />avoid this mind-bending piece of trash like you'd avoid a sex-starved whale during mating season. still, if flaming gay demons with a serious case of the overacting flu are something for you, i guess you should give it a try. but really, this movie isn't worth your time and mental health.
