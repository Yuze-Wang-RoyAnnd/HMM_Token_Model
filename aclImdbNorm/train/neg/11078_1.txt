honestly, where can i begin! this was a low budget, horribly acted film, it was so cheesy it had us all bursting with laughter to how completely retarded it was! the sword fighting scenes weren't even sword fights, they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at wal-mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try and make it look like they were struggling!! me and my family was in the mood for a really good action movie one day, so we decided to go to the store and look for one, and there it was the sawtooth island movie. i mean it looked so great but when we watched it at home i practically died after the first scene.<br /><br />oh and the plot of the film, the story board, the script, etc..was a bunch of garbage that i don't even know why the director and producer even wasted their time making it!! but if you happen to stumble upon this movie..do not get it!!!!!
