take a scifi original movie and mix in a little alternative/revisionist history, and you get "aztec rex." apparently hernand cortes, before conquering the aztec empire, had to first conquer a tyrannosaurus rex and her mate. that's the thrust of this movie. given the plot it could have really sucked; the fact that it only kind of sucked is a tip of the cap to the writers. there are a few problems. for starters, cortes is played by ian ziering. even with a black wig, ziering as cortes is about as convincing as axl rose playing gandhi. and though cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of mexico, the aztecs here seem to be played by an all-hawaiian ensemble. casting aside, the t-rex(es) look reasonably good, though every time one of them gets shot it just oozed cgi. and they die too easily; i suppose if a t-rex were around in real life they probably could be felled or at least wounded by some rather rudimentary, 16th-century weaponry. but it takes something away from the movie. there are also some graphic t-rex-swallowing-human scenes, which is surprising, but in this context i thought they worked ok. there's plenty of action, and the whole colonization angle is prevalent throughout but doesn't overwhelm the dinosaur angle, unlike the other recent scifi original dinosaur movie "warbirds." overall, a mediocre (but decent by scifi original standards) movie that rates a modest 4.
