the first episode set the bar quite high i thought. it starred william hurt as a hit-man who is contracted to kill a toymaker. we are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill, indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all. returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers, this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business. but he is in for a night of hell, the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war, driving jeeps, shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters!. the special effects are good for a tv show and it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive, sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not. i wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist. this gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment, the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one. stephen king adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception
