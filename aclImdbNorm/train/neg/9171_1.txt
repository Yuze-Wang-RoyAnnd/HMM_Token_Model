what can i say? i ignored the reviews and went to see it myself. damn the reviews were so right. what a waste of money considering it's budget.<br /><br />good thing, i went to see kill bill after this one.<br /><br />to see a really scary movie, would be crossroads!<br /><br />bottom line-- i like "girl in gold boots" better than this crap.
