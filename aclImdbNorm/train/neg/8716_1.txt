i don't know where to start; the acting, the special effects and the writing are all about as bad as you can possibly imagine. i can't believe that the production staff reached a point where they said, "our job is done, time for it's release". i'm just glad the first two in the series never made it as far as the uk. i would actually recommend watching this film just so you can appreciate how well made most films are.<br /><br />i don't know how any of the other imdb users could find it scary when the "terrifying" dinosaurs waddle down corridors with rubber arms flailing around.
