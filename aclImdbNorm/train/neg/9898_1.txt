this version of "moby dick" insults the audience by claiming it is based on melville's novel-even going so far as to show a phony first chapter sentence rather than the famous "call me ishmael". in addition to having atrocious acting, even from john barrymore,this is perhaps the greatest example of how far hollywood (especially early hollywood) would go to revise and change a famous novel just to beef up its chances at the box office.all of the novel's beautiful,poetic language has been absolutely eradicated, and ahab has been changed from a brooding,blasphemous,obsessive madman to a dashing,misunderstood hero who only wants to kill moby dick after his fiance(!) turns away from him after seeing his wooden leg. to this is added the standard evil brother who wants the fiance for himself, and a different ending!
