hahahaha!!!!!!funny-that sums this movie up in one word.what the crap was this "thing",since it might kill me to use the word movie!?!?!i hope the director,writer,and producer didn't mean for this to turn out good,because it sure didn't!!!a scientist turning his son into a hammerhead shark,and the shark killing a bunch of people the scientist invited to the island!!!oh my gooooooodddd!!!!i hate this film so much that when i was watching it i laughed at all the serious parts,because they were so corny and unprofessional....and they couldn't have made the shark look more unrealistic,even though this "thing" had a bit larger budget than most low-budget movies.all i have to say is watch this movie expecting to laugh at all the bad acting,and stupid corny dialogue,because if you are expecting a good movie you'll be highly disappointed.
