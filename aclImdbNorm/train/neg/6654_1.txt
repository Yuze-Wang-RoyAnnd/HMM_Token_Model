usually, i don't think hollywood productions are fit to be called film, so i call them 'movies' instead. but this piece of elephant manure, is not even fit to be called a movie, hence the quotes in the title.<br /><br />where shall i start? 1. if this isn't the start of geriatric casting, it sure is the epitome of it. stefanie powers is supposed to play someone even less than half her age, she's supposed to play an 18 year old, and she is forty effing two!!!! <br /><br />2. a horrible and stupid mindless portrayal of paris and france, where we see clich'e characters such as: the sympathetic grumpy shop owner, the bitchy queen of models, the fairy god mother ex-queen of models, etc. this film is surpassed only in this respect by the da vinci code, (which reviewers correctly determined was a comedy). <br /><br />3. it's highly and utterly ridiculous to have no nudity in a film about a time and a place where nudity was so common place, especially if the whole focus is about that<br /><br />4. the horrible accents!!! <br /><br />5. the nana mouskouri elevator-music!!!<br /><br />i could go on, but i think this is enough. and i was able to make these observations after watching this crap for just half an hour, while surfing the internet and talking to my friends about math equations ... i mean ...!!!!!<br /><br />i invite everyone to add to my list. :) :p :d
