i don't see how anyone who even likes van damne could like this movie.<br /><br />the movie actually starts out with some promise. i would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie is excellent. the actions scenes with the family ward trying to save the twins is a great start and is good lead in to the main story. however, the film is all down hill from there. <br /><br />it would have been nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise. that is the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills. one brother is supposed to be skilled in martial arts, but the other brother is supposed to be skilled in firearms. how convenient when the time arises that the brother who has never picked up a gun before all of the sudden is a great marksman, and the brother who has not been taught any martial arts is all of the sudden doing the splits and high kicks.<br /><br />the plot, action, etc. are just plain ridiculous. my favorite scenes? how about when van damne is confronting an armed soldier with an ak-47. the soldier is about 100 yards away. instead of aiming and shooting at van damne he is doing a war cry like he is wielding a battle axe and running at him. van damne proceeds to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him,...while he is still about 75 to 80 yards away. <br /><br />this movie has one of the most disappointing endings. bolo yeung is a skilled martial artist. however, instead of choreographing a decent fight. bolo is throwing barrels at van damne like donkey kong. absolutely aggravating movie that had so much promise. if your a van damne fan, save your time and see hard target or one of his earlier films.
