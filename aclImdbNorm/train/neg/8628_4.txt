my 7-year-old daughter loved it, as disney execs crassly calculated that she would. that's the problem with "air buddies." it's a strictly by-the-numbers children's film filled with carefully calculated cuteness, a couple politically correct morals, and enough potty humor to avoid the dreaded g rating. as a parent, or even as a 10-year-old, you've seen it all before, and done better before. think "101 dalmatians meets home alone" and you get the general idea. i'm of the opinion that a good children's story is a good story, period. "air buddies," which is about as original as recycled paper, fails to meet that standard. it isn't the worst video your child could watch, but there are megatons of better ones.
