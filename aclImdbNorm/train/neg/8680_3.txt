i just finished watching this film and wow was that bad. actually the only thing that kept me watching was that it was so monumentally bad it was kind of entertaining. the action of the characters is hilarious, from the hyper-dramatic way they fall to gunfire, to their incredibly bad acting (were the bad guys all just pulled off the street, or were they actually actors?), to incredibly bad delivery of lines, to their inexplicable actions (if you are going to try and shoot someone through a doorway as they enter, obviously the thing to do is shoot directly at the doorknob!!). this film must break some record for worst written and delivered lines.<br /><br />the camera work was also really bad - you can hardly see what's going on in the fight scenes due to switching camera angles and shakiness.<br /><br />i would have voted "1" except that i do like chiba and sidekick sue shihomi, and i was entertained by a couple of scenes: 1) breaking of a villain's arm so the bone pops out of the skin (that's gotta hurt) 2) a drug kingpin eating a brown-furred animal (a monkey??) by hacking away at the carcass with a meat cleaver 3) sonny chiba's performing some impromptu eye surgery on a guy with his fingers.<br /><br />i am actually a big fan of sonny chiba but this one is really not worth anyone's time. i've seen about 7 or 8 of his films and have come to the conclusion that the only ones worth watching (and they are great!) are the street fighter series, and the killing machine. i've also heard the executioner and golgo 13 are good. i recommend sticking to those ones.
