feature of early 21 century cinema of lets pit different evil creatures and bad guys against each other. we haven't seen stuff like this since godzilla v king kong and the like. always sounds great on paper when you're splicing up and in a haze of the good stuff you have an inspired idea and see the whole playing out before you like beethoven's symphonies. then you come to writing it. great ideas like all vampires are female. ergo hot, seductive deadly but in a way i want to perish sort of way. and all zombies are men. well thats what men are like to a woman just after shes been dumped or cheated on right? so it all looks good up to actually making it. then the rot starts to set in. mosters have fight. nothing much happens. another fight. philosophical noodling and cods wallop. eureka we've found how to win. big fight again and the end. sounds great doesn't it? if it was made an indie company it would be great. but this is hollywood with the eye on the bucks: gloss instead of what the fans want. it all could have been gore soaked beautiful.
