i'm shocked that there were people who liked this movie..i saw it at tribeca and most of the audience laughed through it at scenes that were not meant to be funny. i felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience, but honestly the plot to this movie needed major revision..it didn't even make sense, one second the characters question what exactly it is that they're snorting..the next scene they're hopelessly addicted and figure out how to make it?? also the ending just took the cake..i'm not going to spoil the magnificent conclusion..but it pretty much blended right in with the rest of the horrible plot/script...see this movie for comedy if you must..
