this might be the poorest example of amateur propaganda ever made. the writers and producers should study the german films of the thirties and forties. they knew how to sell. even soviet-style clunky leader as god-like father-figure were better done. disappointing. the loss of faith, regained in church at last second just in time for daddy to be "saved" by the hoover/god was not too bad. unfortunately, it seemed rushed and not nearly melodramatic enough. a few misty heavenlier shots of the angelical hoover up in the corner of the screen-beaming and nodding- would have added a lot. the best aspect is hoover only saving the deserving family and children who had "proven" their worth. unfortunately, other poor homeless were portrayed as likable and even good- yet the hoover-god doesn't help them. a better approach would have been shots of them drinking spirits to show the justice of their condition. finally, bright and cheerful scenes of recovery (after hoover saved the country from the depression) should have rolled at the end. we could see then how hoover-god had saved not just this deserving family, but all the truly deserving. amateurist at best.
