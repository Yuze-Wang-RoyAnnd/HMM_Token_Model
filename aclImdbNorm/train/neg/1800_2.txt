this movie does not rock, as others have said. i found it really boring and silly. the story is about this metal high school kid who idolizes this really bad heavy metal singer. the singer dies, but not before making one last album that is to be played over the radio at, of course, midnight on halloween (which would actually make it november 1st, a much less potent date to be sure). the kid gets a copy of the record and it contains secret hidden back-play messages. it also is the key that opens the door so that the really bad metal singer can return to bring havoc and death to the world. <br /><br />the first part of this film is not a horror film at all, but rather an after school special. we see the metal kid (the outsider) tormented over and over by the popular kids. and he fails to learn the most important lesson in high school movies: when the cool kids who bully you suddenly invite you to a party, don't go! it is a trap. especially if it is a pool party. anybody surprised when he ends up in the water?? it was such an after school special that i kept waiting for melissa sue anderson to show up and teach jody foster a lesson.<br /><br />so back to the horror part of the film. so this metal kid gets some powers and instead of using them to kill the bully boys (which would have made much more sense), he freaks out and tries to protect all of the bully boys and girls from harm. what? a sensitive hero? what fun is that in a horror movie? thank goodness carrie white did not follow this lesson. he actually tries to prevent having the music played at the halloween dance, the very music that could unleash a power to kill all the kids who had been mean to him. if it were me, i would have put that music on, and pronto. <br /><br />the rest of the movie is about this metal kid going around town trying to kill the horrible metal star he idolized. why not partner with him and really do some damage. why you ask? it seems he is in love with one of the popular girls and does not want her hurt..more appropriate for a molly ringwald film. is this a horror film or an episode of beauty and the beast? the movie just goes on and on at this point, with no scares, horror, or anything worth watching. if you went to high school in the late 80s like i did, this movie is fun to have a little flashback to fashions and big hair, but that is it for this film. skip it and stay home and just listen to some kiss.
