this 1977 cult movie has two crazed lesbians (sandra locke & colleen camp) appearing at the home of wealthy socialite doctor george manning (seymour cassel), in hope of help in locating a residence they can't seem to find. but these two have other plans in mind, when they find out george's wife is out of town, they end up taking control of the residence, tying up the george, killing a delivery boy while destroying the place all in one evening. bizarre and disturbing movie, but the two get there just reward in the same bizarre way as the movie ends. most will either dislike it right off or get caught up in this ludicrous movie after about 30 minutes into it. either way some even consider this a cult classic.<br /><br />larry dodson
