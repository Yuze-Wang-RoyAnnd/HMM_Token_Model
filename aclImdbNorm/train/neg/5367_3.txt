i have seen every episode of this spin off. i thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is grey's anatomy. thus i have continued to watch. i'm afraid the second season lacks the charm, the chemistry and more importantly the drama of it's predecessor grey's anatomy. the relationships seem contrived and the acting is so-so. the writing lacks the intelligence and comedic hints seen in ga. there are shows that a formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived, unfortunately pp is not so. i loved kate walsh's presence in ga. i'm afraid kate walsh's life in la is simply not interesting.
