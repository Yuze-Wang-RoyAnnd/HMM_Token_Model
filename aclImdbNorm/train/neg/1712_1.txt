if todd sheets were to come out and admit that this movie was intended to spoof the zombie genre, i would change my rating to an eight. try to imagine a movie where every scene, line, and even every acting nuance was designed to be a parody. i could probably crap out alphabet soup, rearrange what was left of the letters, and still have a better script. two scenes in particular come to mind when i think of this movie. spoiler alert! one is when mike's dad and the other dad walk, i repeat walk down a staircase jam packed with zombies. this is a small staircase and even though they brush up against the flailing undead, nothing happens to them. when they reach the end, the ex-marine turns around, says "god you're a horny bastard", and shoots only one. the other is in the military complex. the girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded. the camera moves around her for roughly forty seconds, while she is surrounded by zombies at an arm's length away. she then almost casually runs out from the crowd and joins the other humans. spoiler alert over! these scenes must be seen to be believed. still, i enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it's so damn funny. kudos to todd sheets for getting so many people in his movie and having the drive to make it but not really for anything else.
