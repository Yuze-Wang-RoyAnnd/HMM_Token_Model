basically, a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity. the premise is interesting, the acting is good, and the music, although sometimes abrupt and without direction, is pretty cool.<br /><br />the problem is the plot. the husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then walks back in to give her something, but sees her with another man. the rest of the movie deals with his angst about this episode, his visual hallucinations and a macho alter-ego (denis leary, a former patient of his) and his fear in confronting his wife lest he will have to "do something about it." i won't tell you the ending, but let me say that the film goes nowhere and the ending is like a sputtering whimper. the motivations of the characters are missing: why is she cheating on him? he's a dentist, decent looking, good father. the film doesn't say. who's she doing it with? don't expect any answers on that either. why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this? who knows. what purpose does all the kids vomiting serve? where is this film going? good performances by campbell scott and hope davis (and denis leary as comic relief)are completely wasted by this stilted nonsense which doesn't know if it wants to be american beauty or a family film. a root canal is more interesting. avoid it.
