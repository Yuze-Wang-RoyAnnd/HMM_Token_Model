unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there's nothing to spoil about that movie.even if b. mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun eurotrash director. but for the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it.this film is just empty, nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 min.no sex, no blood(it's suppose to be about snuff?),no actors, no dialogs, just as bad as an 90't.v film.it's even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics.so rest in peace bruno, you will stay in our minds forever anyway, thanks to such unforgettable gems as:zombi 3, robowar,rats, l'altro inferno,virus, cruel jaws and few others.so except if you want to see b mattei possessed by jess franco's spirit's new film, pass on this one.but if you don't know this nice artisan's career track down his old films and have fun.
