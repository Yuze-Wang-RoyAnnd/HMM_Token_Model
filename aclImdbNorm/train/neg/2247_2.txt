kris kristofferson, at his drugged-out peak in the mid-70s, finds himself barely able to squeeze on to the screen alongside la streisand's humongous ego and discount-store feminism.<br /><br />none of the characters are really likable; i was _so_ glad when kristofferson's ferrari went over that hill and crashed.<br /><br />if you want to see a good movie about rock and roll stardom, try _the buddy holly story_ (made only about a year and a half after this dreck).
