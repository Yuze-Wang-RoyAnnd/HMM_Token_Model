this sci-fi adventure is not the best and by no means the worst. i agree with the statement that bad sci-fi is comical. bizarre pink tinting and unusual special effects make this a favorite for the late, late, late show viewers. space explorers on the planet mars fight off strange giant amoeba-like monsters and other strange creatures. pretty cool.<br /><br />the cast includes les tremayne, naura hayden, gerald mohr and jack kruschen. get comfy and enjoy. don't feel bad if you nod off for a moment. i agree with adding this to the list of cult classics to not miss.
