this is the kind of movie that my enemies content i watch all the time, but it's not bloody true. i only watch it once in a while to make sure that it's as bad as i first thought it was.<br /><br />some kind of mobsters hijack a boeing 747. (that, at least, is an improvement over having boeing hijack a good part of the pentagon.) the airplane goes down in the bermuda triangle and sinks pressurized to the bottoms, a kind of post-facto submarine.<br /><br />it has one of those all-star casts, the stars either falling or barely above the horizon.<br /><br />"we're on our own!", says pilot jack lemon. he is so right. except for george kennedy. he's in all these disaster movies.<br /><br />watch another movie instead. oh, not "airport" the original. that's no good either. instead, watch a decent flick about stuck airplanes like "flight of the phoenix."
