star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning <br /><br />ray (ray winstone) has a criminal past, has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife valerie (kathy burke) who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming off more like a doormat. meanwhile, her mother janet (laila morse) is aware of ray's son, billy (charlie creed-miles) and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails. the film follows these despairable characters as they tredge along with their lives.<br /><br />it is said that the british seem to enjoy being miserable, and that would include watching films that entertain them this way. films like nil by mouth highlight this. it's a tale of a broken family, torn apart by crime, poverty, booze and drugs, the kind jeremy kyle would lap up like a three course meal. it is also essentially a tale of self destructive men, three generations apart and each copying the other, tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together, despite not being strong enough. if you pick up a little of what it's about from the off-set, you can see it doesn't promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly doesn't disappoint in this.<br /><br />it's true what everyone said about the performances, and the lead stars, winstone and burke, do deliver some great acting. we see winstone lose it with his wife, beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia, breaking down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid. likewise, in a private moment, we see burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase, the full impact of the night before kicking in.<br /><br />this is another of those films where there's no 'plot' to follow, as such, just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next. it's been acclaimed by many (including the baftas!) but it really was just too grim and bleak for me. i have no right to criticize it for this, knowing what i knew about it from the off-set, but sadly this is how i found it. **
