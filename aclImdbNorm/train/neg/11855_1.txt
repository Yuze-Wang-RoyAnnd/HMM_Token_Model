this is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they iron. the acting is second rate. poor mathew modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film. and god help gina gershon. her accent is too over the top. it sounds nothing like an true english woman. it sounds forced and phony, much like her acting. she should stick to what she does best, lesbian showgirl con-artist who plays in a rock & roll band and has a drug problem. the other characters are no better. they are two dimensional. empty, vapid and silly. how are we to supposed to care about these people. at one point christy scott cashman get's lost in central park. really? it's not that hard to navigate central park. just follow any path out. not only did i not care about any of the characters,i downright hated them. the only reason i even stayed with this train-wreck of a film was fisher stevens. even his brilliant humor couldn't save this dying fish. each scene is typical romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us. the script was awful as was the acting. if you catch this fish throw it back!
