i confess to have quite an uneasy feeling about ghosts movies, and while i sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horror, but when it comes to comedies, they really need to be crazy to be funny. 'over her dead body' seems to take afterlife a little bit too seriously, and fails in my opinion from almost any aspect i can think about. the story is completely unbelievable of course, and did not succeed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register. the choice of the principal actresses was awful. while paul rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy, the taste in ladies of his character seems to need serious improvement as eva longoria seems too aged (sorry) for him, and lake bell seems too unattractive (sorry again). a romantic story without good enough reason for romance is due to failure from start. jason biggs and lindsey sloane were actually better but they had only supporting roles. the rest is uninteresting and uninspired, with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful tv comedies. nothing really worth watching, nothing to remember.
