this has to be the worst movie i've ever attempted to watch. in the first 15 minutes, there wasn't anything to keep my interest in this movie. i was on vacation at the time, and had plenty of time to devote to a just-for-the-fun-of-it movie. the condo we were staying in had this movie in stock -- they must have got it from the $1 store or something.<br /><br />if you like adam sandler, this is nothing like any other movie he's made. this started with a bad premise and then just got worse. there's nothing even remotely funny in it.<br /><br />i've watched a lot of movies, including some i didn't care for. but if you decide to waste your time on this movie, don't say i didn't warn you.
