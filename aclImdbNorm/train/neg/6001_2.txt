this may sound crazy to even the people who remember this show...but i remembered this as being live-action. i don't think i ever saw the cartoon. but movie? maybe. i remember it very clearly. the guy was in a building kinda like a showroom. he even had the red jacket. it was dark out and he turned into a red car and there was this guy on the second level looking down at him. the car/guy spun around and crashed through the big showroom type window and out onto the street. and then proceeded to drive off. that is all i remember. i really hope someone else out there remembers this too. if not, maybe i'm still crazy. but i'm hoping i'm not.
