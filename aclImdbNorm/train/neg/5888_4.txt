i saw this recently on a faded old vhs tape, and remembered it dimly. looking at it now, it seems charming.<br /><br />when it was first released, it was recognized by pretty much everyone as a spoof of coming out as a gay teenager. to hammer the point home, the mother is seen reading a paperback copy of "1 teenager in 10", the most popular coming out book of the time. david warner hams it up as the persecuting vampire hunter [= gay-hating evangelist], who is of course a self-loathing closet case. the list of sight gags and in-jokes that were included to make sure nobody missed the point would be too long to go into. the producers were having some good-natured fun, and hoping, no doubt, to lighten-up as well as to enlighten.<br /><br />but i have no clue how a teenage audience would look at this film, nowadays. in some places, where there is education and culture, the terrifying ordeals that gay teens had to go through are a thing of the past. but i'm sure there are plenty of dark, nasty corners of our continent where it's just as bad as it always was.
