fot the most part, this movie feels like a "made-for-tv" effort. the direction is ham-fisted, the acting (with the exception of fred gwynne) is overwrought and soapy. denise crosby, particularly, delivers her lines like she's cold reading them off a cue card. only one thing makes this film worth watching, and that is once gage comes back from the "semetary." there is something disturbing about watching a small child murder someone, and this movie might be more than some can handle just for that reason. it is absolutely bone-chilling. this film only does one thing right, but it knocks that one thing right out of the park. worth seeing just for the last 10 minutes or so.
