dumb is as dumb does, in this thoroughly uninteresting, supposed black comedy. essentially what starts out as chris klein trying to maintain a low profile, eventually morphs into an uninspired version of "the three amigos", only without any laughs. in order for black comedy to work, it must be outrageous, which "play dead" is not. in order for black comedy to work, it cannot be mean spirited, which "play dead" is. what "play dead" really is, is a town full of nut jobs. fred dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of billy bob thornton's character from "a simple plan", while jake busey does a pretty fair imitation of, well, jake busey. - merk
