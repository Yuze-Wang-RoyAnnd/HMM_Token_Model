now i get it. the title refers to each audience member's immediate post-reaction after 68 minutes of mental torture. trying too hard to be terrifying, lacking good dialogue even any fear for that matter really makes the screaming skull more like a snoring dull. albeit, the mansion and property set in black and white does set a dark tone for the movie, but that's about it. the only scary thing about this flop is that people actually made money on this! remember the coffin guarantee in the beginning? that may be the funniest thing i have ever witnessed on screen. sad thing is that viewers probably hoped director alex nichol was forcibly placed in a coffin, nailed shut, and buried alive for his lame effort. jenny placed in this unfortunate horrific situation never really draws any sympathy you would feel for a woman whose anxiety is blamed on a haunted, cranial receptacle. also, her husband john comes off as a condescending wannabe smooth talker, but this doesn't work and he ends up proving how tough he is by slapping a helpless cripple around! ah, mickey
