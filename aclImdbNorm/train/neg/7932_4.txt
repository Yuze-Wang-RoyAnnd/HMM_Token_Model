oh dear!what a disappointment. i've been watching old westerns on british tv for decades, and i wasn't aware of this one until its showing yesterday - most other scott westerns come around every few years or so and are usually worth watching again.<br /><br />the rich colour and outdoor sets were good, but that's all i can say about this film. i have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made. several times i felt like turning it off, and finally i did, halfway through, something i hardly ever do.<br /><br />scott seemed unusually oily in charming the girls, his two sidekicks were annoying and so was the mexican bandit lad. and i've a feeling the army uniforms were 20 years or so too modern, not that this has bothered makers of many other westerns.<br /><br />perhaps it got better in the second half, but i couldn't be bothered to wait and see.
