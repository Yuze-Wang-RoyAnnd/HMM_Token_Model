tom wolfe's sprawling, brilliantly observed satiric novel of life among new york snobbery gets a glossy look here but is nevertheless not well served. the film suffers not merely from the miscasting of everyman tom hanks as an uncaring yuppie, kewpie-doll melanie griffith as a manipulative southern belle and bruce willis (?!) as the darling of new york's literati. the most serious miscasting was in the director's chair. robert altman might have breathed life into these unlikeable characters and made them interesting, but brian de palma, for all of his visual sophistication, has never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience. the resulting film looks good but seems blah toward its subject of dehumanization in favor of status. honestly, if a satire does not make the viewer angry, what is the point?
