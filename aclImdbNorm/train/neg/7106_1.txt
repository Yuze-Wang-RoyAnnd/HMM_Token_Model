i am not a big fan of horror films, and have only seen a handful of them (and none of the "halloween"s or "friday the thirteenth"s) - but i can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore. and i'm pretty sure this isn't scary.<br /><br /> what's so spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere? in all of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots, so there's no real surprise in any of this film. (not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway, but . . .)<br /><br /> the plot concerns claus von bulow's third cousin (john hudson), who marries a donna-reed look-a-like (peggey webber, giving one of the worst performances ever) who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband's mansion. did i mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? ooooh!!!! wonder who did it!!!!<br /><br /> this is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and/or drive their wife insane. if you want to see a well-done version of this stuff, try "reversal of fortune". and btw, jeremy irons is one hundred times more talented than john hudson.<br /><br /> the msting was okay but nothing special; paired with the "gumby" short, however, it makes for good viewing.<br /><br /> two stars for "the screaming skull"; eight stars for the mst3k version.<br /><br /> and now, to paraphrase mr. von bulow himself: "how bad is this film?" "you have no idea!"
