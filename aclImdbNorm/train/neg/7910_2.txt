i saw most of "my bollywood bride" today at the iaac film festival in new york and had to leave the theater due to feelings of nausea welling up within me. i've seen bollywood movies, and i've seen satires of bollywood movies. this movie couldn't decide which one it wanted to be, so it ended up being a joke on itself.<br /><br />it seems to have been liberally copied from movies like bride and prejudice and bollywood calling, and what a sloppy, lazy job at that. how can bollywood ever be weaned off of its determination to stick to overused, well-trodden scripts? is there no one who can bring to the screen the millions of real, fascinating stories that surely exist and transpire in the land of a billion people? the over-smart auto driver, the cow on the street, gratuitous scenes of foreign locations, pointless scenes of mumbai streets, they're all in there. every possible clich'e about india has been faithfully included. so sickeningly predictable. ugh!!! acting performances are weak across the board except for neha dubey, who is talented and beautiful. one wonders why she would pick a project like this.
