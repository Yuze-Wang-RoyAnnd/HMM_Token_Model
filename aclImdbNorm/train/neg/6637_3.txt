they should have named this movie ...blonde women that needed to get their roots colored. also the main character, geeze, the too tight sweaters. the giggling. thought the guy did a good job though. i keep hoping we'll find a good 8 star christmas movie to watch this week. the dart throwing. had to laugh at that too. we've still got 3 more on the dvr to watch, maybe we'll get lucky. oh yeah, i figured the guy out pretty quickly and nailed it when he picked up the flowers and then drove out with his cousin. i told my daughter they were on their way to the cemetery. and how stupid was it that the two gals followed them there spying on them? creepy.
