don't let the name of this film deceive you, in reality jake speed the character is quite possibly the laziest action hero ever known to film. when jake speed is not saving virgin girls from evil madmen, which he is often not, he's seriously relaxing. perhaps this adds to his charm, but in my opinion an action hero is not suppose to "chill out" whenever he gets the chance. furthermore, unlike other daring heros who usually have an impressive list of talents, this man has none, unless of course you call sleeping a talent. anyhow, this movie is basically worthless, the writing is sub par and the action, when there is some, is very lame. (the machine guns on the jeep weren't bad, but that's about it) so, if you're in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia, then this piece is perfect for you - it has a hero that not only puts himself to sleep, but also his audience.
