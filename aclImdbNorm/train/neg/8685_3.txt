honestly, my expectations for little bush were low. i was expecting a little cartoon series with lots of fun (but rehashed and overdone) bush jokes. apparently i should have lowered my expectations even more.<br /><br />the writing was absolutely pathetic. aside from the cheney-chicken-eating joke, and some giggly-little swipes, it was really boring and unfunny.<br /><br />the animation was about as sophisticated as a thirteen-year old's flash project. it's disgraceful that they used macromedia's product for this, because it's capable of so much more.<br /><br />i don't like bush that much, and i enjoy a bush-joke as much as the next guy, but this was just a half-hour swipe at the president with several painfully un-funny moments. trey parker and matt stone did so much more with that's my bush.<br /><br />do yourself a favor, skip "lil' bush" and go buy a copy of the short-lived comedy "that's my bush". you'll thank me.
