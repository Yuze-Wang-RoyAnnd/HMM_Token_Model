sadly, marry harron decided to do a fictional account of bettie page's life to go along with her own issues with men. as typical in all her work, every major male character is portrayed as weak, bumbling, or twisted. to add to her fiction, she projects ideas and issues that are not true, according to bettie page herself. bettie did not leave the biz because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious issues (though she became a born-again later in life, through the influence of her 3rd husband- a minister). she left it, because she was in her late 30's, her acting career had gone nowhere and she felt she was losing her looks. the hints of molestation and rape are unvalidated and denied in bettie's own words and are the director's attempts to claim that any woman who did what bettie did must have been victimized by men. harron fails to point out that bettie designed her own clothes in almost all her shoots (not handed to her by "sick" fetishists). harron also fails to make a point that bunny yeager, who did many famous photo shoots of bettie, also did many "naughty" shoots with bettie and was not the morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the film.<br /><br />the only saving grace is gretchen mol looks very much like bettie. otherwise, there are other movies and documentaries more accurate and honest to her life and the people in it.
