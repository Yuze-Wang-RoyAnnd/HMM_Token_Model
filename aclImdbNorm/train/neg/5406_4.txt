my first opinions on this movie were of course bad.i was expecting a horrible, crappy acting, bad entertainment, ridiculous special effects movie.what i got was actually not that bad.the special effects were absolutely horrible, but i found the movie itself quite interesting, and the script was actually pretty good and decent.the acting wasn't that bad, and overall i had fun watching this movie.it's still a pretty bad film, but it's not completely worthless like i thought it was going to be, and i'm pleased to know that this movie managed to wow me, even when it wasn't that good.overall, it's a film that should be avoided, but to me it wasn't as bad as i was expecting it to be.
