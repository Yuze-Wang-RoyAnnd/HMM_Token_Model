i don't know why i keep doing this to myself!! i keep on defending the dutch and belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances...and then they smack you around the head with junk like this! intensive care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing that was ever made in the dutch-speaking countries. it's a dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise, clearly based on mainstrain american slasher classics such as friday the 13th and halloween. the producers and writers aimed really high with this, but fell really low. intensive care became an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here. it's almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and it's only showed on special occasions, like "the night of distaste". for exactly 5 minutes, intensive care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline...then it changes into a lame and low-brain slash 'n stalk movie with gruesome - yet very hilarious and cheap - make up effects. the acting of the entire cast is abominable, even though there are a few respected names involved. the leading male role is played by koen wauters...this guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in belgium. he's a beloved singer, host of tv-shows and idol of many young girls. he never ever mentions this thing he starred in, though. like everybody else in the netherlands, he's trying to convince himself intensive care never happened.
