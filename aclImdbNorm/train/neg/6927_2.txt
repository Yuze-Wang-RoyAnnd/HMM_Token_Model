although i rated this movie a 2 for showing a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror film it was a 10 on the unintentional funny scale. i couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were but i didn't care because i knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter. dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie but i believe this is because they started filming without a script. the fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile. it doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be confused with enjoyment. i particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks. i believe the doctor refers to this as treatment. genius!
