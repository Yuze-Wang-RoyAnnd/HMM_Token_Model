===minor spoilers=== <br /><br />i am, like many others, a huge jerry bruckheimer fan. so when i saw all the beautiful posters hanging out front, and the trailer coming by before mi:2, expectations were rising. a jerry bruckheimer production. big cars. nic cage and fresh from an oscar- angelina jolie. what can possibly go wrong? a lot. <br /><br />the script is neither funny (which it tries really hard to be) nor exciting. you put in a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and wooh-haa!! you've got comedy? i don't think so. excitement is totally out of the picture. first of all (and this is probably said many times) there are no sympathetic characters so who cares who gets killed? if you can stomach the premise that a psycho is gonna kill nic's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, next thing you know is that kip (the brother) is walking with nic in the streets again. is this excitement? think not. then comes the best bit- the romance between nic and angelina. she actually looks bored having to utter all these stupid lines to nic. 'do you have a girlfriend?' 'are you seeing anybody?' 'what went wrong?' etc.<br /><br />then there's only one sparkle of hope left: the car chases. they're disappointing to say the least, because the trailer made it look like it was full of them, and there's only one. a very long one, caught in irritatingly hectic camera movement. i really had trouble following the action.<br /><br />so is it an action movie? a thriller? a romantic comedy? - there's no need to decide, just avoid this horrible mess. i'll give 3 out of 10 stars, and i feel like i'm being generous.
