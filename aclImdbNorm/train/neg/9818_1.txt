this movie raises a number of pressing questions in my mind. firstly, how has jennifer tilly managed to sustain a film acting career for all these years based on that ridiculous squeaky voice and the very limited range of hammy facial expressions she employs? secondly... what on earth were the people responsible for making this offensive and deeply repulsive film thinking of? and thirdly... given that there were people perverted enough to decide to make dreck like this, shouldn't there have been someone in the system - the studio, the distributors, or somewhere - sane enough to prevent it actually getting completed and released. you really would have to search a very, very long way to turn up another movie as profoundly nasty as this... and it isn't even billed as a horror movie - which, inasmuch as it can be seen as belonging to any legitimate film genre, it certainly is. the movie wallows from beginning to end in the sickest kind of madness, violence and abuse, and has essentially no redeeming features at all. i'm not actually advocating censorship (which i don't believe in)... but i really can't see how anybody could conceivably draw anything positive from watching a film like this.
