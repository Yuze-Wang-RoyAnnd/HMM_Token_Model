i would have left the movie halfway through if i hadn't been with people who liked it. the movie is based on real incidents, but it's so over the top it didn't feel real at all. i have some psychological background, hang out with a lot of psychotherapists, and have known seriously crazy people, so it's not that i think people like this don't exist. but in the film, the only characters who seemed consistently human were augusten's father (alec baldwin) and the young augusten (jack kaedin). (although evan rachel wood was an intriguing diversion - very sexy with a wicked sense of fun). there were a few amusing moments, but the overall tone of the movie was grim, bizarre, and nasty. what a waste of an outstanding cast! as i watched them go through their turns, i just felt like i was watching an acting class. this was brought home during the credits, when a couple of people were shown just sitting there, not acting, not talking. those few moments were more entertaining than the previous 2 hours.
