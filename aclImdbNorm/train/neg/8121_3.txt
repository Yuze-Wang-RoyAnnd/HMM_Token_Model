time is precious. this film isn't. i must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like fargo and this complete waste of time.<br /><br />the theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction: is this the film the critics are raving about? what a piece of crap!<br /><br />the hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family. get it?<br /><br />the acting is superb.<br /><br />the production (lighting, sets, editing, sound) is about 2 steps above a 60 minutes story. the characters are shallow and unintelligent. i was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience; the audience was murmuring to the movie screen what the characters should say next.<br /><br />i have had more fun doing the laundry.
