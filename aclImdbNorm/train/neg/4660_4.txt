at first glance this gives the impression that it is going to be a laughable blaxploitation flick, and it does contain moments where it veers in that direction. however, the basic story idea is much stronger than might be expected, and is a respectable effort at portraying racial issues in the world war ii era army. the recognizable cast is hit and miss, with glynn turman, richard pryor and the underused billy dee williams faring best. stephen boyd, however, stops just short of twirling his bushy mustache in an overindulgent star turn.<br /><br />the obviously low budget leads to inconsistency in the production values. the locations are great, the effects and action are weak. imagine if "saving private ryan" had consisted of half the platoon getting killed exactly the same way vin diesel's caparzo had (except we do get to see the shot because they effects can't handle it), then hanks, damon and burns drove around in a jeep and shot five germans for the climax. yet, the denouement, with the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their accomplishment because they are black, and boyd's racist captain being effected by this, is compelling, as are the sequences of of turman's character writing in a journal of his imagined exploits if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines.<br /><br />in short, "black brigade/carter's army" doesn't quite succeed. but it's a respectable failure, not a bad joke. it could be remade as a very good film, and, as it stands, is an interesting effort.
