dave (devon sawa) and his friends sam (jason segel) and jeff (michael maronna) have scammed their way through college. when creepy ethan (jason schwartzman) discovers their secret, he blackmails them into helping him score with beautiful, good-hearted student angela (james king).<br /><br />stupid and incompetent "comedy" - a lot more groan-inducing than laugh-inducing. movie tries appealing to its target audience with its disgusting gags - but none of them work. what's more, it's full of worthless, unappealing characters - and schwartzman's character is so repulsive he's a major turn-off. movie even tries using 50's/60's sexpot/actress mamie van doren in the movie's most outrageous scene. yuck!!!<br /><br />further bringing it down are its utter predictability and the waste (yet again) of veteran comedic actor joe flaherty's talent - when's this guy going to stop accepting every role that comes along and do something worthwhile?<br /><br />all in all, the only thing i liked was james (a.k.a. jaime) king, who was very appealing - and deserved better.<br /><br />this gets no more than one out of ten from me.
