i watched this movie for its two hours and have absolutely no idea what it's about. somebody got murdered or maybe they didn't and maybe somebody did it or maybe they didn't. this brought back memories of the good old days (bad old days?) when all cbc canadian movies were stinkers. lately stinkers have been the exception but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism, mind reeling flash backs and mumbled dialogue makes up for lost time. i've never found margaret atwood's books easy to read. this movie continues that fine canadian tradition. it isn't easy to watch. maybe the trendy folks at the chi chi toronto cocktail parties will pretend they liked it. us folks in the boonies are a little less pretentious.
