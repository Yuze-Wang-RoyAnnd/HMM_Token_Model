okay.. this wasn't the worst movie i've ever seen, but i had heard lots of good things about it and i was sorely disappointed. i could see where the film makers were coming from and that they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle weren't a whole lot different from one another, that the individuals were getting lost in the fighting, etc, etc. (well, that's my presumption, anyway =^_^=)<br /><br />at any rate.. the movie kind of bored me. i've watched a lot of really long movies, but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on.. basically because i just couldn't bring myself to care for any of the characters. i just kept thinking.. who cares??? i also found the acting to be rather dead pan and the dialogue strained. i understand that this was the 1800s and all, but most of the conversations just seemed rather unnatural. no one seemed to have any emotion throughout most of the film except during melodramatic events.<br /><br />the "romance" in the story didn't seem to be supported by anything other than "i'm a guy and you're a girl", which i don't consider much of a romance, and yet i felt i was being steered to the belief that these people were in love. oh well.. i guess it's the whole "all this horror around us, we have each other to cling to" type thing, or whatever. i was also hoping for some sort of dynamic between the two best friends (who both initially seemed to have an interest in the girl) but that was just sort of dropped. maybe avoiding a cliche love triangle. i don't know.<br /><br />oh well.. daniel holt was about the only character i really truly liked. and sue lee was all right. i didn't exactly dislike jake, but he seemed a bit too... spineless, i guess. jack bull i did not care for at all. and i'm pretty sure you're *supposed* to hate just about everyone else, with the exception of the poor normal people who just get mowed down left and right. it was pretty graphic and had that whole "the horrors of war" thing down, but i've seen plenty of other movies with the same theme, done better. (i enjoyed the patriot a lot, for instance, even if it was a bit emotionally manipulative) but, as i've already stated, i'm a cynic. what can i say? :)
