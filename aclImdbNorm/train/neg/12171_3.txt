being a slasher film aficionado, i typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas, which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain, i will say. while channel surfing the other night, sleepaway camp ii happened to cross paths with me. of course, i wanted to check it out, as i had heard of the sleepaway camp franchise, but have never actually seen any of them (for shame, i know). i will note that since i have not seen the original, my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously, because perhaps what i think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchise's own design.<br /><br />now i'm assuming that the franchise of sleepaway camp is, in itself, a joke on itself. hell, even the name comes off as an intentional joke. sleep away camp? it's good fun. i can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value, but that's about as far as i can go. the acting in this movie made the cast of the original friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of macbeth. campy requires bad acting, but come on. pamela springsteen as the evil out-of-touch-with-reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast. as far as comedy goes, there were a few times where i chuckled, but it was few and far between.<br /><br />ultimately, sac ii is pretty boring, and i really did want to sleep away the camp. the deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them. if you're looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp, i recommend club dread. if your channel surfing takes you across this one, check and see what else is on.
