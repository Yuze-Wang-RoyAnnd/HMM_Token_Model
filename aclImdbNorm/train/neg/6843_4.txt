fairly interesting exploitation flick in black and white written by david f. friedman. the lead actress stacey walker is well-cast and strangely attractive. she resembles a deranged renee zellweger with a bad hair-do. this chick only made two of these films and then moved back to texas. the music is terrible. one of her boyfriends is played by sam melville (from the tv show the rookies) using a different name.<br /><br />best line in the film from tony - "are you putting me on, doll? none of my chicks put me on". good b/w cinematography from laslo kovacs (easy rider & targets & many others). good locales (cool swimming pool, also used in the defilers). strange ending but fitting. a 4 out of 10. best performance stacey walker.
