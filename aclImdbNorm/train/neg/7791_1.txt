i've seen the original non-dubbed german version and i was surprised how bad this movie actually is. thinking i had seen my share of bad movies like ghoulies 2, rabid grannies, zombie lake and such, nothing could've prepared me for this! it really was a pain to sit through this flick, as there's no plot, no good acting and even the special effects aren't convincing, especially the so-called zombies, wearing nothing more than white make-up and their old clothes, so their good set wouldn't be ruined by ketchup and marmalade stains. <br /><br />if you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, then watch it, for all the others, don't do it, because you will regret it!
