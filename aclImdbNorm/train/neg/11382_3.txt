anyone notice that tommy only has 3 facial expressions.<br /><br />1. the angry eyes look he gives every enemy. 2. the holding of the hands to face, mouth agape and frightened eyes. 3. the smiling tommy turnbull.<br /><br />i have to say that i pretty much hate this show, i don't watch it but it's like code lyoko, we've all watched at least one, i must say that this show is borderline racist, uninteresting and pointless.<br /><br />every episode ends with robotboy winning, except for one exception when robotboy basically let this overly geeky freakazoid fly away on a jetpack.<br /><br />the jokes are pretty crude too, i think it's mostly people saying the word "suck" or farting, i think the bullies of the show are quite shocking too.<br /><br />isn't there one that hides a bowling ball under his hate, and the other uses a chain, for god sake, what kind of school is he going to. not to mention his older brother, who is borderline psychopathic and has no other character qualities.<br /><br />the whole show i feel is ripping off megas xlr and fosters. like you could say the trio of coop, jamie and kiva, as well as robotboy being similar to megas where he beats everyone no matter what the odds and he's free spirited despite being a robot.<br /><br />there is simply no appeal to this show, i'm surprised that it's still running.
