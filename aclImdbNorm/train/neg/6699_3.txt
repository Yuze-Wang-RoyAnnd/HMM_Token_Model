"algie, the miner" is one bad and unfunny silent comedy. the timing of the slapstick is completely off. this is the kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if they're supposed to be funny or not. however, the actual quality of the film is irrelevant. this is mandatory viewing for film buffs mainly because its one of the earliest examples of gay cinema. the main character of algie is an effeminate guy, acting much like the stereotypical "pansy" common in many early films. the film has the homophobic attitude common of the time. "algie, the miner" is pretty awful, but fascinating from a historical viewpoint. (3/10)
