where to even start? the horrendous acting? the nonsensical plot? the bargain basement effects? the completely loathsome characters? the choppy editing? the headache-inducing casio keyboard score??? the embarrassingly racist remarks ("watch it, charlie!", "back off, jackie chan!!"??? the constant misogyny??? i am a lifelong horror fan, and i have no problem at all with the current "torture-thon" trend of movies. however, this is a poorly-made piece of garbage. i think i suffered more pain watching this than the characters did dying in it! if you like girls being forced to eat stir-fried penis, really poor soft core porn and think lines like "i'm gonna find that b**** and staple her c*** shut!!" are clever, live feed is for you.<br /><br />as for me, i feel the need to go wash my eyes out with oven cleaner to prevent from ever seeing this movie again!
