after disney's witty live-action george of the jungle, i had high hopes for this flick. major disappointment. thread bare plot, bad acting, bad visual effects. this film relied on lame one-liners, idiotic ( and pointless) product placement, and the lamest most annoying side-kick in that gadget car thing. i took two young kids to see it and they where bored out of their mind. the only laugh received from this movie was bad standby of when needing a laugh show a guy getting it in the groin!
