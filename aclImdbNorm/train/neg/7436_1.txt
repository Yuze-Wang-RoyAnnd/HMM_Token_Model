this movie is a waste of time and money. throughout the entire hour and a half, i continued to wait for it to get better and it never did. it was slow moving, the plot jumped around, it wasn't scary or interesting, and really never amounted to anything. the credits during the introduction were long and drawn out, which was basically like the rest of the movie (long and drawn out). numerous parts of the plot made no sense. several times during the movie i had thought that maybe i had "zoned out" because the incongruity of the plot, however, my companion had the same issue and assured me i did not "zone out" from boredom, but it was indeed the movie. i've actually never posted on here about a movie before and have been actively looking up movies on imdb for numerous years. so the fact that i'm actually taking the time to write something should speak volumes of how bad this movie is and that you should not waste your time or money on it.
