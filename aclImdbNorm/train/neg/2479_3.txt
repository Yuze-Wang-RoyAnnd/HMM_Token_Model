i first learned of the wendigo many years ago in one of alvin schwartz's "scary stories" books: according to that story, the wendigo - after calling your name in the wind - drags you along, and then pulls you up into the sky and pulverizes you. while it sounds like a pretty bizarre notion, schwartz's story turned it into a fairly coherent idea.<br /><br />the movie "wendigo" doesn't. it basically consists of every horror flick clich'e: family moves to new house and strange things start happening, anyone who harms them is asking for it, and everyone had better listen to the old indian guy. i've seen this stuff so many times that i no longer bother to count.<br /><br />anyway, avoid it. patricia clarkson and erik per sullivan (dewey on "malcolm in the middle") have done far better than this.
