is seismic activity with little or negligible results on the surface. so in that respect, imdb's average voting score is spot on.<br /><br />a spanish film made in the usa with third or fourth rate actors giving a kind of "falcon crest" dimension to the whole affair is a wonderful way to waste your time, as well as wasting the money of those who backed the project financially.<br /><br />the slugs involved are originals from asturias, northern spain, but as they were not allowed into the united states, plastic ones had to be made. however, chopping them up in the lettuce being used for making the evening dinner-time salad contrasts rather weirdly with parisienne music as well as a rather tatty array of other us forgotten hits (or misses if you have no idea who was responsible for composing it). the actors involved were also a rather tatty array, just suitable for a low-budget film which might be categorised as horrific, horrifying, horrible or just simple awful.<br /><br />as a result, the outcome is negligible on the surface, undetected underground, and about as attractive as chapter 17,000 of coronation street or the latest news from baghdad.
