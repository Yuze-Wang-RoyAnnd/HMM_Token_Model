without wishing to be a killjoy, brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clich'ed films i've ever seen - this being one of them, and camp blood being another. <br /><br />the acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams "seriously, you could do better yourself". maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap?<br /><br />i bought this for lb1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. you'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.
