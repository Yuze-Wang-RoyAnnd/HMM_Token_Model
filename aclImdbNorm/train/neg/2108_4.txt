a number of brides are mysteriously murdered while at the altar, and later their bodies are stolen en route to the morgue. newspaper writer patricia hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings. she discovers that right before each ceremony, the bride was given a rare orchid (supposedly from the groom) which contained a powerful drug that succumbed them. patricia is told that the orchid was first grown by a dr. lorenz, who lives in a secluded estate, with his wife. in reality, dr. lorenz is responsible for the crimes, by putting the brides in a suspended state, and using their gland fluid to keep his wife eternally young. patricia, along with dr. foster (who is working with dr. lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife) try to force dr. lorenz's hand by setting up a phony wedding, which eventually leads patricia into the mad doctor's clutches. this movie had a very good opening reel, but basically ended up with too many establishing shots and other weak scenes. the cast is decent, walters and coffin deserved better, but that's life. russell steals the show (even out hamming lugosi- who does not give one of his more memorable performances, even considering his monograms) as countess lorenz playing the role with the qualities of many of the stereotypical characteristics of many of today's hollywood prima donnas. weak and contrived ending as well. rating, based on b movies, 4.
