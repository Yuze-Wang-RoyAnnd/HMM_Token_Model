i never saw the original 1954 version with judy garland, so have no means of comparison. also, it's been some years, but i found this tale neither gripping nor its romance captivating. the movie tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are headed in opposite directions. john norman howard is a worn out, disillusioned rock star on the decline, embarking upon a romance with a fresh, talented new singing sensation, esther hoffman. her dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline.<br /><br />the lead actors, kris kristofferson and barbra streisand, are adequate in their roles, but neither their chemistry nor the plot left much of a mark with me. the film is noteworthy to me for only one aspect, streisand's beautiful rendition of the oscar winning song 'evergreen'. she truly has a powerful and magnificent voice.
