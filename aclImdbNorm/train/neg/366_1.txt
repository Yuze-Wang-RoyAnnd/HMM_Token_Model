bad actors, bad filming, choppy dialog, shallow characters, but then again it was a bad premise in the first place. basically, an 11 year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal. of course, the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house, cash a check for 1,000,000 dollars, and even foil three bumbling idiots, reminiscent of the three stooges. <br /><br />preston blake is an annoying, obnoxious, boy, who decides that, when written a blank check by a complete stranger, he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can. in other words, he wanders into a bank, <br /><br />hands a teller a check he makes in his printer, and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash. preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle, due to the fact that a man driving a jaguar after preston and his 10-speed could not catch him, even when preston jumped a row of cars.<br /><br />of course, with every hokey adventure movie, there has to be hot heroine. in this case our hot heroine is a child molesting fbi agent who dates the eleven year old preston, and promises another date when he turns 17. <br /><br />however, the absolute worst aspect of this film was not its casting, nor its sloppy dialog, such as "the only other way i could think of skinning a cat is to stick a hose up it's butt and then pick up the fur". it was, rather, the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the fbi does not give a damn about random people . what i have failed to explain is that preston uses the alias "macintosh" to masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts. of course, the fbi finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after preston, who uses his 11-year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face, then treat her to hamburgers, finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettison's from the ground. our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the fbi is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two, as they make their way to preston's limousine, complete with a 1-dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap, 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on.<br /><br />overall: 1/10 is incredibly gracious for this film. i don't see how it only has a 4.4/10.
