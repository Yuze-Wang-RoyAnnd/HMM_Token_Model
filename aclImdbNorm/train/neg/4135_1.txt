this film was so bad i had to fast forward most of it to get to the good bits. hah what good bits? the only bit that was worth it was the ending (those who have seen the film will know what i mean). i expected a lot from this film like a underworld meets dawn of the dead meets freddy vs. jason but what i got was this crap. story was forgettable, the cast was used badly and what was the director thinking when he made this. this could have been a great but i turned out to be the most boring film i have ever watched. ok so what if there was a nice bit of t and a, i was after the gore and i was bitterly disappointed. don't expect a film thats good but if you want a bad cheesy horror then by all means watch this and see how a horror movie shouldn't be done.
