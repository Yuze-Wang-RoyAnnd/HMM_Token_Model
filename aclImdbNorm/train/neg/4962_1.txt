99.999% pure crap. and the other .001% was a brief moment where i thought the blond chick was going to disrobe. nope.<br /><br />the dialogue was legendarily bad. the action sucked, and there was no sex (the afore mentioned blond chick is modestly dressed, alas, the whole movie). the cgi had the dubious honor of being the worst i've ever seen on film, and the anachronisms were numerous and glaring. acting was mediocre even from ben cross and marina sirtis, the only 'names' in this movie. and marina sirtis looked really, really bad.<br /><br />i've seen high school plays more capably produced. this is the kind of movie that mst3k thrived on. heads should roll at sci-fi for allowing this steaming pile on the air.
