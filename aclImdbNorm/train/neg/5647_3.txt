we purchased this series on dvd because of all of the glowing reviews we had seen here. i gave it three stars because there can be little doubt that sometimes the acting, directing and writing are brilliant. in fact they are so brilliant we did not see the propaganda that was being transmitted so smoothly on the series. if one watches it with discernment, one will see the entire litany of the radical right wing beliefs being promulgated by the fox (faux) news network. to avoid giving away any spoilers i will refrain from pointing out all of the dozens of specific instances. a brief look at the plots found here on imdb will disclose that everything from torture to gun control to the right of a network to provide "infomercials" and call them news is justified with cute plot twists and impassioned speeches given by some of the best actors in the world. we watched many shows and finally gave up in disgust when they justified torture using attorney general gonzales as a shining example of why all kinds of torture should be used in the name of protecting all of us. the series also manages to demean male and female gays in subtle ways by using them as plot devices depicting evil people. all in all the complete litany of the radical religious right wing.<br /><br />no doubt the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as proof that america lost its way in the early part of the this century. as a student of history myself i would characterize this program as being in a league with the propaganda produced by goebbels for hitler and some of the propaganda produced by hollywood for the american audience during wwii.<br /><br />so if you want to use this as a teaching tool to help your students understand how subtle propaganda can be then by all means do so. just be sure to purchase an inexpensive used copy so you can avoid enriching the ultra right wingers at faux network who produced this travesty.
