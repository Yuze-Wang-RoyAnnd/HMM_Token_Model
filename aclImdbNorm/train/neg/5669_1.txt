the director, outfitted in chains and leather, warned the audience at the sf frameline film festival friday night that we were about to see an "experiental" film. experimental? leave the video camera on the back seat of the car, let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within eyesight. a meandering pastiche road show manqu'e that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place. the gratuitous violence that opens the movie drove more than one patron from the castro theater. i would have left, too, but my cine-buddy needed a ride home and has this thing about seeing even the worse merde through to the end. by the time the lights came up the audience had thinned considerably. tepid applause. pro forma questions of the director who seemed pleased with the product. avoid this film!
