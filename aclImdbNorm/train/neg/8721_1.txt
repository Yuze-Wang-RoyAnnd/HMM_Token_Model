i'm sorry but this is just plain pathetic. the little girl was a brat, their were no enjoyable characters and the plot sucked. besides it wasn't even a gator as the film would like us to believe. if you check out any complete guide to reptiles you will find that it really is a crocodile, not a gator. obviously they didn't hire a real animal expert or they would know that the creature is a croc. it is a sad excuse for a movie. especially the ending. i nearly fell asleep with this one.
