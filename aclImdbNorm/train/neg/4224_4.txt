star rating: ***** the works **** just misses the mark *** that little bit in between ** lagging behind * the pits <br /><br />in this debut effort for nick park's beloved man and dog, they are forced to fly to the moon when good old wallace runs out of cheese.<br /><br />as well as being the shortest feature at just 22 minutes, this w/g adventure is also the earliest and it kinda shows. the plasticine animation is a little creaky and funny here, sort of reminiscent of the mork animation about the little man in the box.<br /><br />admirable though the craftsmanship behind it is, i've never actually been hugely into wallace & gromit (maybe a bit too clean and traditional for someone of my generation.) the only one i've really enjoyed is the wrong trousers (and that was more from when i was younger and less aware of, shall we say, the seedier pleasures of life.) i was driven to actively seek out this early effort due to the resurgence in popularity as a result of the hugely successful recent film adaptation.<br /><br />as technically impressive as the first two (all things considered!) this one lacks the emotional angle it's successors were to possess. that being said, it's fairly good fun as a first try and certainly set the standard for greater things to come. two stars, but a good two stars. **
