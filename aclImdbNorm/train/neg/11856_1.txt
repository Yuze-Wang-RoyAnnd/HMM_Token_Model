i just saw this film last night in the 2006 tribeca film festival and it seriously makes me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the films before selecting them. the film was simply awful - i say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives - it was awful. matthew modine's days as a leading man are way over. gina gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary english accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film. gloria reuben had a weird little cameo in it - she should also be ashamed. the script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters. i highly doubt this will be picked up, but then again, people in hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes. i really think "kettle of fish" is a serious contender for the worst movie i've ever seen.
