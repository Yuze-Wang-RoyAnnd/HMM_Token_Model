an interesting idea for a film, both showing the last dragon on earth and showing the struggle he and someone evil have together. when he was younger, einon got stabbed in the heart, so bowen (dennis quaid) took him to the dark lord who gave him half his heart. now grown up einon (david thewlis) is now the selfish and evil king. meanwhile, bowen is using a new friend draco the dragon (voiced by sir sean connery) to get rewards for "killing" dragons. but because einon has half of draco's hear, they both feel the pain in one of them is hurt, or killed. also starring pete postlethwaite as gilbert of glockenspur, jason isaacs as lord felton, julie christie as queen aislinn and john gielgud as king arthur. it was nominated for the oscar for best visual effects. worth watching!
