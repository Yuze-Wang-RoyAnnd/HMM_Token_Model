i started to watch this movie with high expectations. however, after one hour i gave up on this movie as it only instilled lots of unanswered questions upon me. this already started in the opening sequence and only got worse.<br /><br />why would they bury the hollander under a statue? why is there an italian comediant present? why did the farmers wife save the hollander? why did he, upon being saved, not run for his life instead of starting to make love to the farmers wife? why did the farmers wife not save the hollander at a time when the farmer wouldn't be around? why did these presumably illiterate farmers understand italian? why did the italian comediant know about the hollanders gold? why did he hide it in the cesspool in the midst of the evil farmers property? these and many more questions popped up, and none of them seemed to get answered in an acceptable way. so i guess i am totally missing the point of this movie, and i am not connecting to the story in any way....
