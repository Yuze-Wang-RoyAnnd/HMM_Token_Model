steve carpenter cannot make horror movies. first of all, the casting was very wrong for this movie. the only decent part was the hot brown haired girl from buffy the vampire slayer. this movies has no gore(usually a key ingredient to a horror movie), no action, no acting, and no suspense(also a key ingredient). wes bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that it's sad. there were a few parts that were supposed to be funny(continuing the teen horror/comedy movies) and no one laughed in the audience. i thought that this movie was rated r, and i didn't pay attention and realized it had been changed to pg-13. anyway, see this movie if you liked i still know what you did last summer. that's the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely scary. and seriously, this is to you steve carpenter, stop making horror movies. this movie makes scream look like texas chainsaw massacre.
