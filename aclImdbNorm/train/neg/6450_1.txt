well this movie is amazingly awful. i felt sorry for the actors involved in this project because i'm sure they did not write their lines. which were sometimes delivered with slight sarcasm, which lead me to believe they were not taking this movie seriously, nor could anybody who watches this obnoxious off beat monster slasher. while watching this " creature unknown" i could not help but think that there was not much of a budget or a competent writer on the crew. but, if you go into watching this for a laugh you'll be happy, the movie is shameless to mocking itself because i cant see how anybody could look at this and be proud of pumping this straight to dvd clich'ed wanna be action thriller/horror movie fightfest to light.
