this should be my kind of movie. even if it sucked, it still should have been right up my alley; hell, i like "congo," and "allan quatermaine" movies. i have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien/demon/adventure movies. let's go over why i decided to watch this in the first place.<br /><br />1. horror/sci-fi almost always intrigues me 2. i'm a big fan of archaeology, and this movie does involve a rare treasure. 3. super-natural enemies with quality fx. 4. christian slater and dorf i generally enjoy. 5. tara reid is hot.<br /><br />so this movie had potential, at least in the cheese-horror section of the video store, but boy did it suck ass. the only redeeming aspects are slater and dorf, and not everyone finds them as entertaining as i do...i mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. but now on to some of the many faults.<br /><br />tara reid. even though the movie as a whole is worse, reid's performance is truly awful. we're not just talking bad, i'm talking about nominating tara reid for worst performance of the year. i don't know if she is capable of acting, but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league...completely. watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn. i mean this isn't just bad, it is laughably bad. oh, and for those of you curious, she doesn't get naked, only down to a bra in a silly, totally unnecessary love scene.<br /><br />even with reid's performance, perhaps the movie could have worked, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems written by a 10 year old. i hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until after watching the dvd, otherwise i would have appreciated the stupidity in real-time. <br /><br />the storyline jumps back and forth from slater's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened, he has amnesia, of course. in his adult life slater was recruited by some unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something. slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, i guess, you never really know unless it was in one of those voice-overs i zoned out during. the movie starts with slater hunting artifacts, obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a "chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities." i may have the exact quote wrong, but you get the idea.<br /><br />there is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth (no reason given), experiments on children, super demon/alien-human hybrids, "photonic" bullets (the demon things can't stand sunlight) and, of course, slater and dorf to try to save everyone.<br /><br />jesus, i can't even being to wade through the clich'ed elements. the script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide some depth. i mean, why is this evil scientist so damn evil? oh right, humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race. i guess he's infected? how did that happen? oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself. how the hell did that happen? why and where did he get the super slugs (oh yes, they use the old sci-fi stand by of parasitic aliens/demons which "fuse" with the spine of their host)of course, slater is, like blade, half super-slug powered, but his slug "didn't fully fuse due to an electrical shock," thank god. oh, and the people with these "fused" spines, have no idea they're half-alien/demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies. yeah we get zombies.<br /><br />so lots of crap that could be entertaining, but none of it is.<br /><br />also, the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place...at least nothing a little dynamite can't handle.<br /><br />not the very worst thing you'll see, but a truly bad movie.
