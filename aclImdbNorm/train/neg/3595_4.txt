i wasn't as "lucky" as some of the others commenting on this film: i have never seen anything else out of the...shall we say... "fecund" mind of sarno. i agree with many: some of the actresses who spend a lot of time topless and (go-go) dancing are not really that attractive. i kinda liked fraulein crank(?)...she was so homely , she was cute! the acting was pretty stale, also, though delivering lines in a second language might have accounted for a lot of that problem. trying to follow the plot was a major chore: was there one, really? i do heartily agree with one other comment: for a vampire movie, there's not much blood. yep, if you want good bloodsucking flicks, check out such hammer classics as "horror of dracula" and (my personal favourite) "brides of dracula".<br /><br />the most (unintentionally) humorous part is where the lady doctor gets her clothes torn off by a cloud of bats...which you never see!...the bats, i mean.<br /><br />okay as a time-waster if you happen to catch it on cable here in the great white north but, for heaven's sake, don't rent it!
