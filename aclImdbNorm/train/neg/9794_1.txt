i really do not have any clue as to why some people find the power rangers television show even remotely interesting at all. the costumes are completely ridiculous and the people playing in them also look completely foolish at the same time. there is absolutely anything remotely interesting about the power rangers. this is just a higher priced television commercial designed to sell extremely cheesy plastic garbage to the unsuspecting children around the world. from the notes, i can see that it's been banned in the country of new zealand and from what i have seen, i can agree with their decision. avoid this show at all costs, it's terrible and ridiculous.
