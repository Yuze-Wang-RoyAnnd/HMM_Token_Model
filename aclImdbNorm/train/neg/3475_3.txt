i have to admit i laughed a few times during this trivial 2004 holiday movie, but it's already moving out of my short-term memory. in a career that is sliding rather swiftly toward tabloid obscurity, ben affleck, once a promising comic character actor who became enmeshed in the hollywood publicity machine to recreate himself into a romantic leading man. judging from this film, the transformation doesn't seem to be taking, as he continues to lack the gravitas that would make him credible in such parts. while his buddy matt damon takes on smart roles in films like "syriana", affleck appears in this type of commercial pap. at least the superficial character of successful but lonely advertising executive drew latham suits affleck better than most of the other roles he has tried.<br /><br />directed by mike mitchell (whose most famous film is 1999's "deuce bigelow: male gigolo") and scripted by no less than four screenwriters (always a bad sign), the flimsy plot revolves around his character's need to "rent" a family living in his childhood home in order to live out his fantasy of having the old-fashioned christmas he never had. the concept is actually intriguing because there is something to be said about the cathartic release of sentimentality we are all directed to feel amid the frenzied commercialism around the holidays. the real problem, however, is that the movie feels like an extended sketch lacking any logic or authentic emotional resonance. affleck seems to be on overdrive attempting desperately to be lovable, but the net result is an exhausting turn by an actor who has an increasingly annoying habit of playing stupid people in ill-conceived films. fortunately, he has the likes of james gandofini and catherine o'hara playing the valcos, the couple who decide to accept drew's monetary offer to pretend to be his parents.<br /><br />gandolfini plays tom like a gruff, non-violent relative of tony soprano, but he does what he can in the role. from her classic sctv days to christopher guest's mockumentaries, o'hara is always a comic gem no matter the vehicle, and unsurprisingly she earns the best laughs as tom's wife christine, whether dryly delivering a one-liner or posing in an inch of make-up for a dominatrix photo shoot. in what is becoming her standard screen role, christina applegate plays their mistrusting daughter alicia, who of course becomes drew's love interest. despite some good moments where she is enjoying the deceit of playing drew's sister in front of his girlfriend's family, her character seems to change in lightning-flash strokes making it hard to see what drew would see in her. the story spins completely out of control by the last third with one contrived situation piled on top of another until plot strands are tied together in short order. it's rumored that much of the movie was improvised since there was no finished shooting script. it shows, but i also have to admit i stuck with it to the bitter end.
