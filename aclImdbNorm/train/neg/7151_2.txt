im proud to say i've seen all three fast and furious films.sure,the plots are kinda silly,and they might be a little cheesy,but i love them car chases,and all the beautiful cars,and the clandestine midnight races.and ill gladly see a fourth one.<br /><br />wanna know what the difference is between those three and redline?decent acting,somewhat thought out plot,even if they are potboilers,and last but not least,directors who have a clue.all three were made by very competent directors,all of them took the films in a different direction,equally exciting.redline looks like the producer picked out a dozen women he slept with on the casting couch,and made them the extras,then picked up his leads from hollywood's unemployment line.and the script.yikes.its mystery science theatre 3000 bad.this is 70's made for tv movie bad.<br /><br />yeah,the movie had a few cool cars,but you don't really get to see that many in action,and the action is directed so poorly you cant get excited by the chases,and if the cars aren't thrilling you,why go to a movie like this?<br /><br />im in the audience with a bunch of teenagers,and i cant stop laughing out loud.im getting dirty looks,but this was just a debacle.<br /><br />rent the f&f movies.go to nascar race.go to a karting track and race yourself.whatever you do,avoid redline like bad cheese.
