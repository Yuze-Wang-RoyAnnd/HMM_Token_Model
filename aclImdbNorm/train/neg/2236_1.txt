i don't really know where to start. the acting in this movie was really terrible, i can't remember seeing so many 'actors' in one film that weren't able to act. not only the acting was bad, the characters were incredibly stupid as well.<br /><br />then there's the action. i believe that even children know that when someone gets shot, there's blood involved. but when someone gets shot in snitch'd for ten (!!) times, there's no blood at all. well, i guess that's just me.<br /><br />to make a long story short (because believe me, i can go on for hours about this film), this is without a doubt the worst film i ever saw. this film should be number 1 in the bottom 100 without a doubt.
