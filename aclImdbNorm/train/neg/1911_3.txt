formula flick of guy who wants girl, guy who will lie to get next to girl, guy who will get best friend to help in outrageous way (comedus reliefus, no?) to help deceive girl, etc. this one's been done to death, and with rare exception of a few z-rated outings, it's been done better.<br /><br />stale plot aside, the leads are attractive and there's a couple of good moments. jonathon schaech has done better, and his acting here came close to being phoned in. not a complete loss, but nothing new here in this tepid affair.
