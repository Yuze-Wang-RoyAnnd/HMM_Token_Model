goodnight, mister tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of england where the sun always seems to shine. before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of world war ii. soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from london and when shy little william is billeted with reluctant, gruff old tom (who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold) our tale begins.<br /><br />and what a load of sentimental claptrap it is. in fact it's just the old odd-couple buddy formula. aren't any new stories being written?<br /><br />as i suggested there's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in london apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around. and certainly no hint of the horror of the blitz as london's citizens file politely into air-raid shelters. even when the local schoolteacher's husband is declared missing presumed killed, he is later restored to life.<br /><br />i found `goodnight, mister tom' cliched and obvious and john thaw's accent conjured up a picture of ronnie barker of the two ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his `country bumpkin' accent.<br /><br />incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that i disliked it and looking at fellow-imdb reviewers i seem to be in a minority of one.<br /><br />
