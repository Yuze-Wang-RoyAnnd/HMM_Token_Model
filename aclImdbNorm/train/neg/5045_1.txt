claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the movie: too long face only shots where you most of the time get the feeling that the lower half of the film is missing (that the screen is cut off), because there seems to be important actions going on, but you cannot see them. there is anyway already too much confusion in the movie, so these viewing angles make it worse and do not contribute to artful visuals. <br /><br />i like artfully made movies and unconventional camera work. i can handle deep and slow movies. but this one is trying too hard to be something artful and fails in my opinion painfully.<br /><br />nothing to get attached to, to any of the characters, because they are not worked out well enough. to work out characters more is needed, than just minute long face shots, at least with this set of script+director+actors.<br /><br />i wonder whether some of the not so good acting is due to the script and director or due to the actors. <br /><br />i will stay away from films both written and directed by le you for sure in the future. <br /><br />what an annoying film even for someone who would be interested in that part of history, and for someone who spent time in shanghai.
