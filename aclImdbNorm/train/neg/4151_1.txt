this is probably the best horror film made since ed wood died. <br /><br />i can't spoil the ending, because i have absolutely no idea what happened. i'll try my best, though. there are some kind of lesbian vampires, but they keep swapping bodies, so any character might or might not be the character you're supposed to think it is, or it might be a lesbian vampire. <br /><br />sound confusing? it's not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters make any sense to begin with. there's no plot, no character development, and random people show up, speak a few lines, and then disappear, never to be heard from again. there are also zombies, who are *possibly* the enemies of the vampires, but there's also a dream-within-a-dream kind of sequence in a mental hospital, so maybe none of this actually happened, and it's all the main character's hallucination. <br /><br />the upside? both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly. the special effects are simply mind-boggling (i particularly liked the incredibly slow, awkward fight sequences). everyone has a really silly canadian accent, which adds to the general level of hilarity. <br /><br />well worth the price of rental. we laughed until we cried.
