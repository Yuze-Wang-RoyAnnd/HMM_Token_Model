i love morgan freeman. paz vega is an attractive, appealing and talented actress. i'm sure that this would have been a good movie had anything happened in it. nothing does. it's short (less than 90 minutes). it was 75 minutes too long. after an hour of frustration, i scanned through the remaining 20-odd minutes. excruciating.<br /><br />freeman plays an actor - who hasn't worked in a while - researching a part that he might play, as a checkout clerk in a supermarket. he visits the supermarket where she works. nothing happens. she decides to give him a ride home and they go to an arby's, a target, a car wash. nothing happens. they converse about their lives. nothing happens. ever.<br /><br />i don't get it. but i also don't get the bill murray flicks "lost in translation" and "broken flowers". if you like those movies, maybe you'll like this. lots of people find movies like this whimsical, charming, or - for reasons that escape me - find the dialog fascinating. a common device in movies of this ilk is to have a long take of stillness/silence after an actor delivers a line that's supposed to be meaningful. we know it's meaningful because it's followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen. sorry, i must be a philistine. i don't get it. to me, these kinds of movies aren't funny, or charming, or thought-provoking. they're just boring. why? because there's no comedy. no drama. no tension. no laughs. no suspense. no action. nothing to watch. in short, none of the things i go to the movies for. i can be bored for free. i see oddball/quirky characters in real life. i go to target, and fast-food restaurants, and car-washes. these elements do not a movie make, even if stars are doing this stuff. i pay to be entertained.<br /><br />if you're crazy about morgan freeman and just like to hear him ramble on about nothing, have fun. if you wanna drool over paz vega, you can look and listen to her. but nothing happens, i promise. a total snoozefest.
