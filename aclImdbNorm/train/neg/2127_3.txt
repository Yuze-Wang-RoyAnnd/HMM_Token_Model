why? because for one reason, there has never been a more adorable scene in any film than ann margret singing "bye bye birdie" at the opening. she reprises it again at the ending, too (in a different mood!). both wonderful. rent it and see. even if that's all of it that you watch. you'll agree, i'm sure.<br /><br />everything about the original was so excellent it just didn't need a remake, sorry! jason and vanessa gave commendable performances, as well as tyne and chynna. in fact, all the actors and singers in this new version were giving their 'all,' but it's like trying to improve on "casablanca" -- it just can't be done! it's even annoying finding yourself comparing the two mentally as you try to appreciate the remake, and it just falls short, through no fault of the actors.
