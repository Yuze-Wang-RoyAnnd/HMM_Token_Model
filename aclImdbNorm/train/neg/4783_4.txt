this is yet another bad movie that you should probably avoid watching. the plot could be a lot "thicker" than it actually is and would be better made as a blockbuster type movie.<br /><br />the acting leaves something to be desired, though you can not quite place your finger on what it is.<br /><br />this is one of those that you watch on late night tv, perhaps on usa, simply because you can not get to sleep. watch it if you want but do not expect too much from it.
