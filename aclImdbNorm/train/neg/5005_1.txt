a cheesy, compellingly awful (and not in a fun way) c grade movie. everything shouts 'amateur', from the crumby script (bizarre premises, limited coherence and predictable endings; the turgid lighting, sound and hand-held wobbly camera angles; the coy and passe sexual inneundo and references; the patchy and unbelievable dialgoue to the z rate acting. i saw it on dvd and kept hoping edward wood would pop out. all is forgiven - your worst films are works of art, and more coherent than this twaddle.<br /><br />but still, preferable to the warbling 'every night in my dreams i hear you' - are you sure the titanic crew weren't involved in this on the side?
