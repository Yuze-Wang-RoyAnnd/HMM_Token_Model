first, the cgi in this movie was horrible. i watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the scifi channel. at the end when the owner of the park gets killed, it's probably one of the worst examples of cgi i have even seen. even night of the living dead had better animation.<br /><br />that said, the movie had almost no plot. why were they on that island in particular? well, it wasn't stated in the movie. and, why would the people keep coming into the cat's area? makes no sense.<br /><br />one thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting. in what could be called a "b made for tv movie" movie, the acting was very good. parry shen stood out in particular.<br /><br />if you have absolutely nothing to do on a saturday, watch this movie. it may be good for some memorable quotes.
