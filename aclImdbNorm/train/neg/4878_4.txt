if you want to make a movie like this, have the threat be real. don't surround your patsy with a bunch of bonzos. there is no credibility here. the plot is dull and unbelievable. the acting is even worse. i thought that i was watching arthur lake (dagwood) who is one of the worst actors in history, when i saw the main character. oh well, at some point he has to face the music and get fighting mad. i don't care. do you? there are all these long scenes set in this austere office (the furniture made out of cardboard or masonite). people talk and smoke and don't do anything. most of the action happens in a five minute sequence. after that, it's over. don't bother.
