i went to see this movie with a crowd that consisted predominantly of "spiritual" new age types, who, quite unlike me, very much enjoyed this movie---although according to those that also knew the book (apparently there is a book that contains more of this nonsense), the movie is not quite as good. so, if you tend to think of yourself as "spiritual", believe in or at least can tolerate stuff like "aura" and "astral body", and don't mind the frequent use of the term "energy" outside of the context of physics or technology, you might actually like the movie, and will likely even more enjoy whatever book it is apparently based on.<br /><br />however, if you are mostly in touch with the physical universe, if your ability to suspend disbelief is easily exhausted by inane new age nonsense and plots based thereon, if in addition to that you have a low tolerance for cheesy lighting effects to denote the happening of spirituality, and perhaps even expect reasonable non-wooden dialog an acting, then this is my recommendation for you regarding this movie: stay. away.<br /><br />don't even think about it. tonight, this movie displaced dungeons and dragons as the worst movie i ever personally saw in a movie theater (i do not count movies i went to see with the expectation of them being bad, such as plan 9 etc.). at the same time, it raised the grand total of movies i almost walked out on to two (d&d being the other one). i do not walk out on movies, not even on this one, but i should've when i first saw the visual depiction of an aura, because the new age bs keeps on getting thicker and thicker from that point on.<br /><br />the plot is about a group of people involving themselves with some old prophecies, in a quest for spiritual enlightenment and aiming at bringing mankind to the next step in its evolution. or something like that. they actually talk about this spiritual stuff being the next step in human evolution, which should make anybody who has even the faintest idea of what human evolution is cringe. the movie is shock full with whoppers like that. occasionally people beam to what they would certainly describe as "another dimension", or perhaps "another plane", only to become invisible to those around them who haven't yet reached enlightenment. goodness.<br /><br />at the end the director patronizes the audience by rolling the "insights" making up the prophecy, painfully slow, presumably so that we can memorize them and leave the cinema as better, more enlightened individuals.<br /><br />good things about the movie? some very pretty nature shots, and some decent supporting performances by elizondo and de almeida.<br /><br />i honestly can say that it seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if they consider this movie interesting or acceptable. it really is el cheapo spiritualism of the most naive kind, and unless that's your thing, you better do something else with your time and money.
