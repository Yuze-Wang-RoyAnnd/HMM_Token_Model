i, like many people, saw this film in the theatre when it first came out in '97. it was a below average film at best, defiantly not the "masterpiece" that all these "titanic" fanboys like to make it out as. first off, dicaprio is a terrible actor no matter which way you look at it. people just like him because of his looks. his acting "skills" essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy. second, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot: girl falls in love with guy, ship they're on sinks, lots of crappy love scenes thereafter. anyone with an iq above 50 will realize this isn't ingenious in any way whatsoever. nor is it original. plus the director felt the need to drag it out for 3+ hours. i could compress it into a 1 hour block without losing any of the plot. in conclusion, "titanic" is the most overrated movie to date. why it got so much attention and money is beyond me.
