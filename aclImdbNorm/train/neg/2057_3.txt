sorry to go against the flow but i thought this film was unrealistic, boring and way too long. i got tired of watching gena rowlands long arduous battle with herself and the crisis she was experiencing. maybe the film has some cinematic value or represented an important step for the director but for pure entertainment value i wish i would have skipped it.
