i don't get this. the movie obviously has a pretty good budget. it has very good cinematography. it has nice pacing, good editing and pretty good directing too. then why oh why didn't they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and why oh why did they hire such lousy actors that can't act their way out of a paper bag? this movie could have been good. at most times it looks good and feels good but in the end, you realize that the movie was no good at all.<br /><br />so i would say it's a good production but a bad movie. too bad actually.<br /><br />and eels? come one, really!
