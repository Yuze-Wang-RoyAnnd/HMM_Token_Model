the script was very weak w/o enough character arcs to make you care one bit about the characters or what happens to them. the script is way too talky and not enough gore or action to even call it slow paced. the story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you don't have to listen to them talk this very muted, stiff dialogue. on a technical note, the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times. then again, this could be called a blessing. overall, this same story could have better been told in a short film w/ a running time under 30 minutes. the obvious "in your face" homages to sam raimi and "evil dead" would have been good had they been more subtle, but here they seem more like a bald faced rip off. c'mon, this kind of 35mm budget and this is the best that could be done? still, the cinematography, lighting design and shots were very well done indeed.
