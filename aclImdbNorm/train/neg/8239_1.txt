this really is the most dreadful film i have ever seen. i simply have no idea how anyone has the audacity to put this on release.<br /><br />the production standards are atrocious. there is no pretence here at cinematography. the camera work, scripting, acting and sound are unbelievably crass. i think there is a plot, but it could have been done in 10 minutes sparing us the time to watch it. the hysterical neurotic girls at the centre of this piece have no credibility whatsoever.<br /><br />i would urge anyone to avoid spending any time or money on this title. it is truly atrocious.<br /><br />jdd - 14 december 2008
