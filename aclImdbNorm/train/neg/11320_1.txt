someone needed to make a car payment... this is truly awful... makes jean claude's cyborg look like gone with the wind... this is an hour i wish i could sue to get back... luckily it produced severe somnolence... from which i fell asleep. how can actors of this caliber create this dog? i would rather spend the time watching algae grow on the side of a fish tank than partake of this wholly awful concoction of several genre. i now use the dvd as a coaster on my coffee table. $5.99 at walmart is far too much to spend on this movie... if you really have to have it, wait till they throw them out after they have carried them on the inventory for several years and are frustrated that they would not sell.<br /><br />please for the love of god let this movie die of obscurity.
