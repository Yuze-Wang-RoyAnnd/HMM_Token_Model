everyone involved (and the audience) should seek out "the candidate" to see how good this movie could have been. what happened the south american story? what were julie christie and kate capshaw thinking to allow their roles to be cardboard cut-outs. up to now i have liked every gene hackman performance and/or movie. he was either disinterested (which i can hardly believe) or dreadfully miscast. i have also liked and defended richard gere (and been vilified for it). but here he had no "power". he was never intimidating and only occasionally persuasive. all in all i was very disappointed. i really expected much more from this director and cast. if you can't find "the candidate" watch "wag the dog" again or even "bulworth".
