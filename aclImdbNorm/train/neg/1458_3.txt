the back cover of the dvd (missed this one when it came out) hails hitler -the rise of evil as "a triumph" (the new york post) and "mesmerizing" (newsweek).<br /><br />well,never mind the post but really, who ever wrote that word in newsweek in the same context with this peace of, ahem, art should be sacked.<br /><br />i don't no where to start with. why try to paint the picture of hitler's evil with colors that did not exist? he was evil alright, but now his character is portrayed in way that is often historically inaccurate (compared to his love of animals, the gentle and subdued way he treated women) and so on.<br /><br />the actors are good, so you must feel sorry for them as they are imprisoned inside their one-dimensional characters. some kind of curse here with peter o' toole: this is the second time in his honorable career when he has ended up playing an old and failed leader in a failed movie (or in this case tv-production, to be accurate). the first one was of course the legendary galigula.<br /><br />the list of historically inaccurate scenes alone would fill the 1000 words allowed by imdb, so i think i'll leave it here.<br /><br />this one is ok if it's on telly and you don't have anything else to do, but believe me - it's best left on the shelf in your local virgin store.
