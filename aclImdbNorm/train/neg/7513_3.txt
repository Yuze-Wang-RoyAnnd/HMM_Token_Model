what can i say? i think i have to write "spoiler alert" and then "reveal" they used the f-word a lot in this movie - like in every two sentences. i did not like this movie at all - too much hints on sexual perversions, sidesteps and cheating. and that swearing was totally out the window. i gave this movie "3" and two of those points are for mira sorvino's sexy movements on the dance floor.
