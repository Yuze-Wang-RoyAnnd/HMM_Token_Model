i read one other review that expressed the view that platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people, being killed, taking drugs and talking trash.<br /><br />i don't agree with that because the film actually had more to it, but it a way, i can see what this person is trying to say: this had no real plot - which is a point i agree with.<br /><br />it is self-indulgent stone at his best. he really wanted to show, not only how war leads to death, but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive. unfortunately, the film seems to over "glorify" this aspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne, grand-standing, oscar-hunting "let's create an enduring image" for my liking.<br /><br />the problem i have with stone and other film-makers of his ilk is that they fail to understand this simply concept: depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is does not prove or even reflect on whether it was an unjust or immoral war. we have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with iraq. in case you're missing the point, let me put it to you bluntly: if you saw how truly bloody the second world war was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers, would you think it was an unjust war? if that fact alone doesn't convince you that it was an unjust war, then why should depictions of the horrors of vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that instance. <br /><br />personally, i do not support america's decision to go to war in vietnam, but i certainly don't subscribe to the "this war is wrong because people died and suffered" theory. i don't think that motivations are always wrong by default, just because war in itself is terrible.<br /><br />this says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big "twist" was a bit stupid. however, this is not stones first oddball departure. wall street was a magnificent film, up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful "wrong turn." jfk is probably one of the few films stone did that actually ended very well.<br /><br />but it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around. and this is why i gave it such a low mark. it was virtually story-less and ultimately boring - unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy.
