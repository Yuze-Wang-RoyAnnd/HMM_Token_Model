this has to be one of the most outrageously stupid movies i have ever seen in my entire life. just when i think i have seen the stupidest scene in history, along comes an even dumber and more bizarre scene. i think the transvestite poodles did it for me, or better yet, her talking tongue...or perhaps the guy getting the virgin mother statue mounted to a jeep windshield caught in his throat. decisions, decisions...
