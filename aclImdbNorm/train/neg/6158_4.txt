once upon a time in the mid 1990s i used to write for doctor who fanzines and the whole of fandom was holding its breathe about the new american produced doctor who tvm . as soon as it was announced that the doctor`s arch enemy the master was going to be played by eric roberts everyone scratched their heads and exclaimed " who is eric roberts ? " . i should point out this was before the imdb came online when all you had to do was type in a name into this website to their resume , but one helpful soul wrote into a publication i wrote for to explain that eric roberts was best known for a role where he starred opposite f murray abraham , the film was called by the sword and was about a fencing school . actually looking back now roberts is best known for the pope of greenwich village and runaway train but that didn`t stop the person putting the boot into both roberts and by the sword and his mind was made up that this american master with his southern drawl was going to a debacle . strangely most fans were furious about roberts playing the master but after they saw the doctor who tvm a great many fans ( myself among them ) thought roberts performance was the best thing about the disappointing american production <br /><br />yeah i`m digressing but by the sword was a film that i wanted to see simply because it was the first time i`d heard the name of eric roberts but i didn`t get the chance to see it untill this weekend and i was fairly disappointed with it . i know nothing about fencing ( everyone else on this page seems duty bound to mention if they fence or not . i don`t fence ) so i don`t know how accurate it all is , but as mentioned the film feels somewhat anachronistic even if you saw it on its release in 1991 , the hairstyles seem a few years out of date along with its mixed teenage cast doing a little dance routine that makes you wonder if it wouldn`t have worked a lot better if it`d had been produced by jerry bruckheimer in the mid 1980s . you could argue this would have meant the relationship between max suba and alexander villard being off centre for most of the film but i wasn`t convinced about their love/hate relationship and abraham and roberts have given much better performances before and since by the sword
