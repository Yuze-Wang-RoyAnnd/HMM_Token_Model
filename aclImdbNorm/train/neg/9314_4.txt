well...overall, this movie was pretty much worthless, and it's basically a horror movie that ended up being more of a comedy. i just rented this movie last night when me and my friends went to blockbuster looking for a scary movie. this definitely wasn't what we were looking for, but it satisfied us for humor. the actors in this movie (especially brandon) are so fake that it's funny. and especially that tracy girl whenever she's in the boarded up room telling the clown to go away. they show almost no emotion and it's just so obvious that they're acting. and also when the clown is looking through that black box paper thing and grabs mark, he doesn't even look like he's scared even though the clown like grabbed him and started attacking him. and seriously, would you just be jogging if you were being chased down? i'd be sprinting for my life! (even though anyone could probably outrun that clown because he's like 300 lbs.) not to mention that the effects aren't that great, like whenever the clown chops off susan's head in the forest, then whenever he throws her head into the boarded up room with denise and tracy whenever denise throws the head back over. also like in the previous guy's comment, the beginning makes absolutely no sense and i don't even see why it was even included in the movie. so what, was this movie made in 2003? the music made it sound like it was made in like the 1980's, and the camera-ing(?) doesn't even really look professional. half of the time, it seems like the camera can't even stay steady when it's suppose to be. overall, i'd have to say i enjoyed the movie. i wouldn't recommend it though if you're trying to find something to scare you, but if you're looking for something to maybe make fun of or get a laugh out of, i'd recommend it for sure.
