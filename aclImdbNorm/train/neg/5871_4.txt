for me the only reason for having a look at this remake was to see how bad and funny it could be. there was no doubt about it being funny and bad, because i had seen "voyna i mir" (1968). shall we begin? here we go...<br /><br />robert dornhelm & brendan donnison's pierre bezukhov - a lean fellow that lacks the depth of the original; robert dornhelm & brendan donnison's natasha rostova - a scarecrow, her image can cause insomnia; robert dornhelm & brendan donnison's andrej bolkonsky - an ok incarnation which, like the lean fellow (cf. above), lacks depth of a russian soul and "struggle within"; robert dornhelm & brendan donnison's napoleon - a rather unimpressive leader; robert dornhelm & brendan donnison's prince bolkonsky - a turd with an english face; robert dornhelm & brendan donnison's count bezukhov - a spineless freak-show...<br /><br />the rest of the characters are not much better.<br /><br />the movements of the actors and the way they look and speak are often atrocious. they behave like modern eu citizens dressed up for a one-day masquerade. it all looks cheap and never comes close to the standards of our russian men and women of the early 19th century.<br /><br />a good piece of entertainment to scrutinize and make fun of. we had quite a few giggles in our office when remembering this modern product, which had been shown the previous evening on our tv.<br /><br />"user rating: 8.0/10 (29 votes)" - i guess, many young people have never watched our film ("voyna i mir" 1968) or have weird sense of "tarantino-spielberg" quality. remember the scene when our hussar is saving his friend, turns around, shoots, and the bridge goes boom? looks like a cgi explosion.<br /><br />there is neither sense nor craft to make a better version of the novel, which was screened properly in our country once. but i would be happy to watch a russian remake of "gone with the wind". hey, directors, wake up and get busy with that, instead of spoiling our classics.<br /><br />now back to common sense. jokes aside. what i mentioned above is nothing new, though deadly exaggerated.<br /><br />to make foreign actors trying to pass for russians (while participating in very serious epics and dramas) is a rude mistake and the filmmakers are making this mistake again and again. of course it results in numerous laughs - especially clemence poesy is uncomfortably ridiculous and her dancing and singing makes a russian viewer think: "this sucks so much that it's funny!").<br /><br />in order to say something new, i'd like to mention the pace of the movie. to my mind, this new version is very patchy. the narration and the scenes are not naturally flowing - they stagger and pop up like in a modern video. again i have to remember our "voyna i mir", where the action is so natural and the narration is so easy that you simply sit back and enjoy "going with the flow".<br /><br />i thought that maybe the borodino battle would be great (to somehow rehabilitate numerous drawbacks) but it has turned out to be no match for the war scenes filmed in 1968.<br /><br />there should be something good in this movie after all. and there is. the actors seem to be trying hard to make it all work. they did not have a chance from the start but they still joined "the losers' team". plus 1 point for that recklessness. it makes a russian viewer uncomfortable - some scenes are ironically ridiculous though they are intended to be dramatically powerful and the actors are doing their best. it all evokes pity, and sometimes - fits of laughter.<br /><br />what i still like about this serial is the last part of it. it shows very vividly how everybody gets his or her "salary and taxes". besides, judging by the movie trailers i thought that the film would have an adult sex scene, which would definitely kill the whole project. but, fortunately, it does not have such rubbish. and that's a big plus.<br /><br />"voyna i mir" is no "harry potter" and nowadays even we, here in present-day russia, do not have enough craft to film it properly. do i have to say that the moral quality of our life has deteriorated immensely? fortunately, a proper film was screened during our soviet times. the american version of the 1950s was justified to some extent - ours did not even exist yet. there were extenuating circumstances then.<br /><br />4 out of 10 (1 point is given from the start, 1 point goes for the recklessness, and 2 points for the last part of the serial. thanks for attention.
