tyrannosaurus azteca is set during the sixteenth century where famous spanish explorer hernando cortes (ian ziering) has landed in mexico with six of his best men including lieutenant rios (marco sanchez), they intend to claim the land in the name of the spanish & maybe steal some gold too if the opportunity arises. within minutes they have their first sight of local aztec savages, within minutes after that cortes & his men are captured & held prisoner. if that wasn't bad enough it turns out that a couple of tyrannosaurus rex live there & like to eat the locals, in an effort to win their lives the spanish offer to help the locals get rid of their monster problem but with various hidden agendas & ulterior motives it's not just the dinosaurs they have to watch out for...<br /><br />directed by brian trenchard-smith (who, coincidently, made one of my all time favourite exploitations films turkey shoot (1982) which i throughly recommend to one & all) & also more commonly known under the spoof sounding title of aztec rex (the title was changed by the sci-fi channel when they aired it maybe as the original title tyrannosaurus azteca sounds like it might be a foreign film) this is yet another idiotic & cheap looking sci-fi channel 'creature feature' & that's all you need to know really. based on & around the real spanish conquistador cortes during his expedition to mexico the film definitely doesn't strive for historic accuracy although i will admit that the story tries to do something slightly different here but ultimately tyrannosaurus azteca is still just a 'creature feature' with a bunch of people running from some poor cgi computer graphic of a monster despite it's period setting. not too sure what else i can say, despite being set centuries ago the usual clich'es are here, the character's are the usual cardboard cutouts, make stupid decisions & the selfish one, the heroic one, the backstabbing one, the faceless victim who exists just to get eaten & the pretty woman are all here & easy to spot. the film is predictable, silly, dull & doesn't really entertain on any level although it does move along at a decent pace & there's one or two half decent moments of gore if that sort of thing interests you. the story isn't that good & has plenty of holes too, this is also the sort of film that you will have completely forgotten about within a few days.<br /><br />now i have seen & commented on plenty of sci-fi channel 'creature features' & usually the cgi computer effects are terrible & while tyrannosaurus azteca doesn't exactly buck the trend i will admit there are a few effects shots which look alright but then they are usually ruined by an absolutely awful effects shot straight afterwards. there's a few decent gore effects here too, there's a cut out heart, a guy's leg is bitten off, there's some blood splatter, a cool shot of a guy left holding his own intestines after he has been attacked by the dinosaur, there's a few dead bodies seen & someone is stabbed with a spear. the t-rex gets to eat a couple of people too. the production values are really cheap, the aztec set looks like one of those theme park attractions made from styrofoam & those spanish men must have been imprisoned in the worst enclosure in cinematic history with the fence supposedly keeping them in lower than a mans waist, they could have simply stepped out of it & run away it was so low.<br /><br />with a supposed budget of about $900,000 i can't see where the money went, shot in o'ahu in hawaii in apparently fifteen days. the acting isn't great from no-one i have ever heard of.<br /><br />tyrannosaurus azteca really isn't any better than any other cheap sci-fi channel 'creature feature' despite an almost interesting & unusual premise, that basic statement should basically be enough for you to decide whether you will enjoy this or not (at a guess probably not).
