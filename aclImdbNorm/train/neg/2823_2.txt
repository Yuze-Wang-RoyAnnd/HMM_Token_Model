well, tivo recorded this because of angelina jolie. it had 2.5 stars. it seemed promising. it went downhill fast.<br /><br />there is much overacting, even from angelina. she's about 20 and playing a 16 year old. there are three characters that are supposed to be italian. everyone else is italian- american. the native italian accents were good, i thought. the young male lead is cute, my wife says. everyone else in this movie is a fat italian woman. even the men.<br /><br />i should have known that when dick van patten was cast as a randy doctor, that that was a bad sign. the two couples chasing their kids around are like the four italian stooges.<br /><br />my wife would not let go of the remote. hopefully she was not taking makeup, clothing or decorating tips. it was a sick and twisted combination of hideous and garish. it was hidegarishous.<br /><br />cutting off my left ventricle was not sufficient to distract from the pain of watching this movie. if this movie shows up on your tv, do yourself a favor and ram your head through the tv screen instead. you'll be glad you did. the only movie i've ever seen that was worse than this was "hamburger: the movie". or maybe "deadly friend".
