after waking up at 3:30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep, i decided that i may as well be entertained while i suffered from sleep deprivation. this movie was on hbo and i decided to watch it. what a mistake!<br /><br />here is the plot (potential spoilers, if you even care) : a neurotic man with an addiction to candy (josh kornbluth) works as a temp for some ridiculous company. suddenly, he is offered the chance to "go perm," which seems to be the favorite catch-phrase of this movie. but with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp, josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he doesn't want to do it. he hopelessly bungles several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt. his inability to send several "very important" letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious, but is merely stupid. josh meets and deceives a lawyer woman and they wind up in bed together (obviously a fantasy of josh's in real life, as such a thing would never happen). a bunch of other stuff happens, but it's too trite and inane to go into now.<br /><br />despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy, i only laughed twice during it; the first time was the opening shot of josh kornbluth (my initial reaction was one of stifling fear) and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman (yeah, right). josh kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying-looking person i have ever seen in my life. he is an unattractive, overweight, balding jewish man who i am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women. i do not at all sympathize with josh's character. he is lazy and unmotivated and i just don't appreciate the failed attempts at humor. skip it, even if your life depends upon it.
