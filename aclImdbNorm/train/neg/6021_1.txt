i cannot believe that they managed to spend us$17million on this film. spectacularly bad acting, egregious scripting and effects that you could do on your average pc, unbelievable plot contrivances...a reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess a major job at the un? what? not only that, but the message of this film is so unsubtle that you come out feeling as if they've tried to batter you over the head with a full size crucifix. all this movie will do will preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money. if the makers of this film really wanted to sway people to christianity and show what it means to truly believe, they would have used the money to help people truly in need. now, /that/ might have swayed some people into actually listening to them.
