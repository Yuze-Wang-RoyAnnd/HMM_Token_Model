i do not fail to recognize haneke's above-average film-making skills. for example, i appreciate his lingering on unremarkable-natural-day-lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. however, regarding the content of this film, i am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination-submission relations or feelings (and/or bdsm practices). the problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by walter (i don't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way, which is understandable; i mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy, or as if he was a monk, come on!). i mean d/s is not something new in the world and i think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something "freakish" or pathological; it isn't. in general, films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times.<br /><br />so, for me, i feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film, worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories (isn't it nearly embarrassing?), and that does not really relate with real-life lives and experiences of those engaged in d/s relationships (personal experience, forums, irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this).
