it's amazing to see how nikhil advani manages to attract people to the theater till the very day of the release. i mean..... look at the cast here , the promotion is superb, good enough songs and the trailers are fine. this makes it a house full on the first day, but it's only when people go and see the film they realize that there is no way their money is refundable. house full the first day , the movie is out the next week. <br /><br />this film, inspired by 'love actually' is what they say, didn't manage to handle the whole cast well. they tried to put in big stars but ended up by not even managing to bring out even an average performance by any one. the stories are hollow and cheesy, so the audience can't connect with any single one of them. it's a big disappointment to all those who like big stars or for that matter nikhil advani after his big success of 'kal ho na ho'.
