to heighten the drama of this sudsy maternity ward story, it's set in a special ward for "difficult cases." the main story is loretta young's; she's on leave from a long prison stretch for murder. will the doctors save her baby at the cost of her life, or heed her husband's plea for the opposite? melodrama and sentiment are dominant, and they're not the honest sort, to say the least. for example, just to keep things moving, this hospital has a psycho ward next door to the maternity ward, and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander about stealing babies.<br /><br />there are just enough laughs and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a warners film, mostly from glenda farrell, who swigs gin from her hot-water bottle while she waits to have twins that, to her chagrin, she finds there's now a law against selling. an example of her repartee: "be careful." farrell: "it's too late to be careful." aline macmahon is of course wonderfully authoritative as the chief nurse, but don't expect her to be given a dramatic moment.<br /><br />the main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby turns anyone to mush. even given the obvious limitations, this film should have been better than it is.
