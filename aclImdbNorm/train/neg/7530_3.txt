i found this movie boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried, shallow "upbeat" ending that didn't ring true to the overall story. following these characters through a weekend of awful events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news just isn't my idea of a watchable, interesting movie and i got very tired of its "one note" theme and couldn't wait for it to end--in fact i almost stopped about halfway through. the whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering, and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant, though the acting was good. a small movie with small ambitions and small appeal--sorry, but it just didn't make it with me, and i love good, small films! this one just didn't jell, though i kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would. i was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on their "year's 10 best" list. i'd strongly recommend watching "the house of sand" instead--now there's a good, small film!
