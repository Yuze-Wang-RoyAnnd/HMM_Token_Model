i will probably always go to see a woody alleb movie, as one never knows when he just might make a real return to his past greatness. just one or two great moments or lines could make it worthwhile. sadly however this film just does'nt make it on any score. saying thar actually makes me sad and even a little guilty. i'm sure my reaction is much like a lot of other fans of woody, but what can one say? it's probably time for him to concentrate on his clarinett, which in my opinion, he is rather quite good. saying all of this, i'll still probably go to any new film woody may come out with in the future. there's always hope and i'll continue to love and respect the woody!!
