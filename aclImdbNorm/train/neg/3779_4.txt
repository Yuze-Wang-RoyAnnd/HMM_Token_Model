even though an animated film it really bored everyone under at least 6.<br /><br />as a grown up who grew up in an area with wild horses and native americans, it felt this was a combination of pc mixed in with too many fantasy films created by people who never lived in the area they filmed about. talk to those who have lived on horse back, most treat their animals like family members, regardless of background. regardless of background we have dealt with good and bad breakers of wild horses. i had to explain that was a real life issues to us vs the movie makers views to children who were surprised to see how pc showed a world different than what they knew in reality.<br /><br />this dreamworks break from the normal disney or dreamworks fare of cute talking animals burning up the screen was nice from the older viewer point of view. but if you live in an area similar to what is shown, you may end up answering questions.
