seven pounds: emotionally flat, illogical, morally disturbing<br /><br />the movie was distributed in italy as "seven souls". i was curious about the original title and, after some research, i found out that it refers to shakespeare's merchant of venice, where the usurer shylock makes a terrible bond with the merchant antonio, who will have to give him a "pound" of his flesh, in case he is not able to repay his debt. whereas the italian translation makes ben's plan something deeply human, characterized by human sympathy, the original one, though cultivated enough to remain unperceived by anyone, makes it, just in its reference to the flesh, something cold, rational, deep-rooted in the physical side of man. unfortunately, i think that the real quality of ben's plan is revealed by the original title: it'a a cold machination, aimed at "donating" parts of his body, but lacking any authentic human empathy, at least the audience is not given the chance to see or perceive any pure relation of souls within the whole movie. the only exception is the love-story with the girl, which seems to be a sort of non-programmed incident, to which ben yields, but incapable of conveying true emotional involvement. i really didn't like the idea at the core of the movie: the idea that a person, however devoured by the pain for the death of his beloved and of other people he himself has caused, takes the resolute decision to expiate his sense of guilt through suicide: besides being improbable, it makes no sense. i would have liked, and i think it would have been more positive if, in the end, ben had decided to abandon the idea of committing suicide and go on living, thus helping those same people, and maybe many more, just standing near them, and helping them through his presence. he wouldn't have saved their lives miraculously, of course: this would have probably caused more suffering, but i think it could have been more constructive from a human, and moral point of view. there are many illogical and disturbing things: the initial reference to god's creation in seven days (which, by the way, according to the bible, are six!): what does it mean? and what about a woman suffering from heart-disease which prevents her from running and even from singing without feeling bad, who can have normal sex with a man who, feeling, as it should be, destroyed by the death of his wife and having donated organs and pieces of his body, doesn't seem to feel so much tried, both emotionally and physically, from his impaired condition? the movie is saved by good acting, but all the rest is pure nonsense, not only from a logical point of view, but also from a human and emotional one.
