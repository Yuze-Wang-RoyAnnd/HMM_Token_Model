i can't believe i am so angry after seeing this that i am about to write my first ever review on imdb.<br /><br />this disney documentary is nothing but a rehashed planet earth lite. now i knew going into this that it was advertised as "from the people who brought you planet earth," but i had no idea they were going to blatantly use the exact same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary mini-series. i just paid $8.75 to see something i already own on dvd. shame on disney for not warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here (save a james earl jones voice-over and 90 seconds of sailfish that i don't believe were in planet earth).<br /><br />but the biggest crime of all, is that while planet earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecologic change, disney took that story and turned it into family friendly tripe. after the male polar bear's demise, they show his cubs grown significantly a year later, and spew some garbage about how they are ready to carry on his memory, and that the earth really is a beautiful place after all. no mention of the grown cubs impending deaths due to the same plight their father endured, no warning of trouble for future generations if we don't get our act together, nothing. just a montage of stuff we have already seen throughout the movie (and many times more, if you are one of the billion people who have already seen planet earth).<br /><br />i have never left the theater feeling so ashamed and cheated in my life.
