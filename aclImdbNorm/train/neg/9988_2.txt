cameron diaz is a woman who is married to a judge, played by harvey keitel, whose life is fine until an ex shows up and things get a little complicated.. while i was watching this movie there were several times i asked myself why i was doing so..because the movie is so ridiculous and blah and poorly scripted without any believability. nor does the audience really car what happens..even the lovely cameron can't save this one on a scale of one to ten..2
