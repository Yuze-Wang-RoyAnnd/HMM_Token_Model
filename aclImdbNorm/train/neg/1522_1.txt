you should know that i am the type of person that watches even the worst of movies to the finish, often out of sheer morbid curiosity. i even watched leprechaun to the end before giving in to the temptation of tearing out my eyes and stamping on them. you should also know that this movie was in my vcr for less than half an hour before i made a frantic leap for the stop button and dashed back the rental store just to put as much distance between me and it as possible.
