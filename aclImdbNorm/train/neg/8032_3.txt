this had a great cast with big-name stars like tyrone power, henry fonda, randolph scott, nancy kelly, henry hull and brian donlevey and a bunch more lesser-but-known names with shorter roles. it also had technicolor, one of the few movies made with it in 1939.<br /><br />now the bad news.......regrettably, i can't say much positive for the story. it portrayed the james boys in a totally positive light....and hollywood has done that ever since. why these criminals are always shown to be the "good guys" is beyond me. this film glamorizes them and made their enemies - the railroad people - into vicious human beings. the latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous. well, that's the film world for you: evil is good; good is bad.<br /><br />hey hollywood: here's a news flash - the james boys were criminals! really - look it up!
