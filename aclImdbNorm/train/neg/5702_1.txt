what a disappointment! i hated the mummy but this one was even worse! it was very tiring and unbelievable and at a certain point i found myself sighing and yawning all the time. i can't believe that people actually liked this movie. the role of nicholas cage wasn't very convincing. the whole movie felt like a grand tour around america's most wanted buildings. the never stopping flow of hints and combinations wasn't very convincing either. i stopped paying attention around 30 minutes. what was supposed to be a happy night out became a total disappointment. what a drag... i guess i've just seen too many movies to enjoy national treasure.
