what is most striking about this semi-musical set in 1920s berlin is the marvelous cinematography and editing. it's top of the line from first national in these departments. the story is mildly engaging and similar to the plots of miller's other two films (sunny, sally) where working girl is romanced by rich boy with family disapproval, complications and final clinch. all the four musical numbers are bunched at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without any further musical buoyancy. miller sings parts of i think of baby and reprises because of you. there are also don't ever be blue and though you're not the first one.<br /><br />miller here is very engaging and delightful, quite reminiscent of irene dunne in manner and delivery. sad she does not dance as that is her forte. sally remains her finest film, with this trailing as second and the rather poor sunny a vastly inferior runner up. her life was tragically cut short by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable. it's worth visiting these films though to see ziegfeld's top star of the twenties.
