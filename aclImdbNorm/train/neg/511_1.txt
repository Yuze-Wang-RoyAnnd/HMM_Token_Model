i was one of quite a few extras in this big bomb. i just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at a.i.r. as it was know as back then.thank goodness my scene in in the first few minutes of the movie and i don't have to sit through the whole thing. it was more of a big party than a movie set but hey, the pay was good.attention to detail was not a strong point for this one, but who was going to know.the funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to the what was close to normal speed.a lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed i suppose to shave cost and time.but every one was having such a good time who cared!
