ok hollywood is not liberal.<br /><br />obviously i'm lieing because it is. im a conservative but the politics i will leave out of my opinion of the movie. this movie was anti bush, anti middle east , anti big oil propaganda but that is not why it was bad.<br /><br />fist off i will give credit where credit is due. i saw this film opening night because i happen to like these kinds of films and am a political science major in collage. the cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as i could tell very good.<br /><br />the plot was impossible for me to decode however. i have been tested and have an iq of 138 but no matter how hard i tried there was no way i could piece together the story line of the movie and what characters where doing what.<br /><br />the story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organized.<br /><br />unless this is one of those movies that is meant to be watch many times to get the full depth pf the story, which it very well may be, i have no idea exactly what was going on.<br /><br />which makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism then make your argument impossible to critique! if you cant dazzle them with brilliance, then baffle them with bull s.
