this whole film should have lasted 45 minutes - maximum. although an interesting concept/theme, it really did not develop as a story. once the initial idea of a brave (stupid?) bomb disposal expert (cowboy?) are introduced, and this happens very early in the film, the rest is repetitious. characters were not explored, and aspects of the location and politics were ignored. there was some nice insight into the appalling difficulties faced by troops in such a foreign environment, and the difficulties in differentiating between friend and foe. but the way in which the unit operated stretched belief! individual performances were good, and special effects were adequate, but not enough to overcome the basic lack of content.
