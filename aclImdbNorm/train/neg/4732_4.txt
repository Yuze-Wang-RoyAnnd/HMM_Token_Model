if i write a review about a movie, maybe it will stick with me... but generally i expect that i will have forgotten i've seen this one a mere two weeks from now. so why bother? because again i find myself watching a low-rated movie that was fun to watch. i didn't expect i'd to be able to stay in the room while it was on.<br /><br />it wasn't great, but at least it was not unbearable... not a comedy of errors which always makes me cringe. it was just sweet fluff... and if you can't take it, stay in the locker room boys. i agree with those who defend this movie because it is sure to please its targeted demographic, and won't be a total bore to an adult.<br /><br />it offers a few good chuckles here and there, but nary a side splitter. sure it is silly and only mildly entertaining, but at least it doesn't suck (as so many have said it does). maybe those folks are afraid of their sensitive sides? <br /><br />i have a tendency to grade on the bell curve, so a 4,5 or 6 is actually an okay all-around rating in my book. giving it a 4 makes sense and will bolster its rating at the time of this writing. giving it a 1 or a 10, as most have done thus far, makes the rating numbers meaningless. i cannot believe how strongly people feel one way or the other about this forgettable fluff (or that i am even bothering to write about it). am i missing something? <br /><br />anyway, it should be noted that emma roberts performs her role as clairedycat quite convincingly. ariell kebbel often written into b*ch roles does not disappoint when her character gets her due. you might also recognize bruce spence playing leonard, though his role is ancillary.<br /><br />surely you can miss this one if you are an adult. but, if there is a pre-teen girl in your life, rent this movie for her... and be prepared not to hate it (you might even enjoy it).
