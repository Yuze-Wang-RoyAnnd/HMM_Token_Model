and when i watch sarah silverman, i get the same results. i love quirky, irreverent humor. but this woman is so darned b-o-r-i-n-g, annoying, and yawn-worthy. she's also totally lacking in anything whatsoever humorous. the deadpan way she tries to deliver her lines is just dead on arrival because she's just not funny. i watched two segments of her program and was ready for novocaine.<br /><br />geez, my kid (age 19) saw her promos on comedy central and said she was a "dumb chick." i thought that was a compliment. the one where she says "watch my show or i'll kill my dog," is actually believable. i know she's a wanna be comedienne. she just comes across as a warped nut-case. i just don't ever want to see her around my dog.
