this movie is not as good as all think. the actors are lowlevel and the story is very comic-like. i respect fantasy but lord of the rings is fantasy...conan..is fantasy...this is just normal hk-lowprice-entertainment...why did they include this splatter-tongue, it makes everything worse. the only good thing is the cinematography and the cutter's job.
