i think i should start this in saying that nearly any style of work can be entertaining in parts. the true test is whether it is good from start to finish, which is the reason i gave the analogical title for this review. most of us would agree--even those like me, who enjoy reading many blogs--that blogs can't compare with good novel writing for a number of reasons. likewise, fem can't compare with good film making for a number of reasons, and i actually believe it's a poor example of independent filmography. from start to finish, fem feels like a pieced together vlog. (heck, even myspace gets some pimping.) if i wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15--i don't--i'd go watch it. fem, while certainly grittier than the bubble gum atmosphere of the aforementioned media, is so personal that it is without an interesting story. it's like watching the mundaneness of life, which i think most would agree is very naturally boring. and yet the creators of fem want us to applaud it, their very postmodern film about making a film. cue my yawn.<br /><br />ultimately, i come away not caring the least bit about any of it. i'm shocked that i'm actually interested in taking time out to write this review, even. it's not that fem is downright bad, because it isn't; it has a few moments where i crack a smile or think that maybe--just maybe--something of interest is about to happen. it's rather that it's just downright...mediocre. i feel so indifferent about it that it's almost fitting of an oxymoron: passionate indifference.<br /><br />i hope the creators/"actors" in the film get out of debt from their efforts. they'll probably need it for when one of them moves out and moves on with life.<br /><br />see this movie if you've got time to waste and nothing much you want to do; otherwise, pass it by, and don't worry that you've missed some great, undiscovered talent. you really haven't.
