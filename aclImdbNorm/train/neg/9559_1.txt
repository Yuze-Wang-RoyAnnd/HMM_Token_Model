i'll try to use words to describe this on.... <br /><br />i saw the original, which was good in its own way, but back then i should have feared a sequel.<br /><br />and i was 'afraid' when i picked this one up, but now that i've seen it, i have to say, it's even worse then i thought. why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin. <br /><br />let's start with the actors;they aren't all that good, but it has to be said, some make heads turn by being just plain awful. but what can an actor do with a script like this one. it's trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed, any form of story is gone and any attempt of actually coming up with something that hasn't been done before, fails miserably. in a futile attempt to get it up-to-date, they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole 'big-brother' theme , but that has been worn out ages ago and offers nothing but a filler for between the beginning and the end. an attempt was made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the '83 original, but it just ended up being plain funny and sometimes a bit sad. in conclusion, if you have nothing , and i mean nothing , to do... go watch it, or play frisbee... with the dvd.... by yourself. it'll offer you the same amount of fun.. i promise
