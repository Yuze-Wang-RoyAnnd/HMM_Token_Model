writer-director tony piccirillo adapted his own play about a straight man, recently widowed, learning in the last three weeks he is hiv-positive; he tracks down the one homosexual partner he ever had, brings him to an apartment and ties him up, forcing a blood test on the guy and promising bloody revenge if the results come back positive. intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it plays out. james marsden's captive is realistically cynical and snotty, but the actor's own artificial mannerisms are disconcerting--it's like watching a roadshow version of tom cruise. scott speedman has to work harder with the more challenging role, but his personality-turn from shy guy to kidnapper-on-the-edge isn't convincing, and neither are the conversations the two men have. marsden's gay party boy isn't apathetic, of course--he's momentarily sympathetic to speedman's plight--but he doesn't react or behave the way any homosexual man would in this circumstance. the movie isn't a cop-out, exactly, but it is a fraud, handicapped further by the bad editing, the poorly-conceived flashbacks, the low-budget production, and the big finale which smacks of silly pretension and soapy melodrama. *1/2 from ****
