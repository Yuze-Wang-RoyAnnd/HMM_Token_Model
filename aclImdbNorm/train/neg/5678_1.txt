this would have to be one of the worst, if not the worst, movie i've ever nearly seen. (i couldn't watch it all the way through). purely and simply it's gratuitous violence just for the sake of it and the ridiculous story line only adds to the lacklustre and incompetent filming. sick. and only suitable for those with a love for manic mutilation. after murdering several hundred men, women and children, seed is finally caught after effortlessly killing several more police officers that finally get a tip as to his whereabouts. he's sentenced to death by electric chair and miraculously survives! buried alive, he digs his way out and plots revenge against those that put him away and flicked the switch. needless to say, more gruesome murders ensue...
