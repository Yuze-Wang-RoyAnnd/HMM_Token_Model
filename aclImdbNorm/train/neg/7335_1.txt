this is possibly the worst version of the play i have seen - several times on stage apart from the movie.<br /><br />a very nice idea for the set up - the american south can give a credible backdrop for the extreme reaction round hero's supposed misdemeanour.<br /><br />but the execution! widdoes is a very mannered beatrice giving a particularly poor performance. waterston, a fine actor, is not much better as benedict.<br /><br />the poorest performance is in the role of don john - it makes keanu reeves look good. perhaps the desire to make it a caricature along the lines of the villain who ties the maiden to the train track fits with the keystone kops capers of dogberry and his men - but the acting makes you want to cringe.<br /><br />successful set-ups include the scene where they fool benedict into believing beatrice loves him - were the acting competent it would be superb. but the use of the river and the visual humour of benedict moving closer is well produced.<br /><br />overall i had to force myself to keep watching but it certainly didn't keep my attention.<br /><br />very disappointing.<br /><br />with respect to latter comments above i am nearly 40. i've been watching stage and screen productions of shakespeare for over 2 decades. might i suggest when trying to defend your friends you speak to the piece rather than attack other reviewers when you are so inadequately armed in terms of fact. i can assume though, from your distaste regarding youth, that you are of sufficient age where the mannered acting of bygone days is more to your taste.<br /><br />my personal favourite pairing was rylance and mcteer on the london stage. unlike widdoes, mcteer, a skilled and charismatic performer, can act.
