i enjoyed the feel of the opening few minutes, but 20-minutes in i was liberally applying the fast-forward button. far too many shots of stewart (michael zelniker) walking from room to room, down hallways, through doors and down the street, and as many shots of him looking pensive and confused. gave me the impression that the story had originally been meant as a short (20-30 minutes), and then stretched into a feature as a labour of love between director grieve and star zelniker (they co-wrote the screenplay).<br /><br />it might have been more entertaining if any of the characters had anything to say that i hadn't heard said in many other films before, or if the ending wasn't - disappointingly - the one i had predicted three minutes into the film (atypical for an independent/smaller studio film). at least its heart was in the right place - it wasn't your standard formulaic hollywood manipulative nonsense.
