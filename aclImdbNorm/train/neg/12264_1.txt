you get 5 writers together, have each write a different story with a different genre, and then you try to make one movie out of it. it's action, it's adventure, it's sci-fi, it's western, it's a mess. sorry, but this movie absolutely stinks. 4.5 is giving it an awefully high rating. that said, it's movies like this that make me think i could write movies, and i can barely write.
