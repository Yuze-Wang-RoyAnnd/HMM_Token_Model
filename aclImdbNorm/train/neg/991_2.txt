if you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault, then this film is not the film that you want to watch. it was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back. spoiler: rosario dawson turns the tables on her assailant. instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorts to using vigilantism. she in essence nullifies the judicial system. the film "the accused" was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins. what the "descent" does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence? is victim any better that the accuser? no!!!
