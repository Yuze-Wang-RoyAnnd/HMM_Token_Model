i don't know where to begin. tara reid needs to be stopped before she's put in another movie. stephen dorff looks like he got his character's motivation from val kilmer in "top gun". slater sleepwalks through this dreck. the direction, editing, sound (do we really need a heavy-metal video in the middle of a gunfight?), costumes (bulletproof vests with muscles on them), and hey, there's no discernible plot either. it amazes me that no one attached to the project stopped and said, "hey guys, this just doesn't make any sense, let's start over". hopefully slater's career can rebound from this disaster.<br /><br />hands down the worst film i've ever seen.
