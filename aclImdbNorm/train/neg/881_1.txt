thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called german independent series, four for venice is not only awful, but really awful. so awful, that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cash.<br /><br />nick and charlotte is a married couple who reached an agreement of having sex only on tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession. eva and luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth, where eva works as a waitress and luis, an artist. nick indirectly causes eva to lose her job as an waitress. luis and charlotte had an affair at the back of eva and nick. luis cheated on eva by lying to her that he would be flying off to london to do something related to his artwork, but the fact is, he is flying off to venice with charlotte for an adultery holiday. eva kidnapped nick and dragged her 2 kids along to venice for confrontation. the trip to venice ends up both nick and eva falling for one another.<br /><br />the presentation of the journey from germany to venice between nick and eva marks the failure of the comedy. it not only look senseless, but also draggy. in the film, nick try to seek help for several ways, but it ends to no avail. it is either the strangers around him who acts like morons, or they are just simply dumb.<br /><br />the comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story. while some of the problems that can be solved with common sense, no one in the film are using common sense to solve the problem. they prefer to go through one big round to solve the problem.<br /><br />it fails so bad, that even the beautiful sceneries in venice fails to pull up the reputation of the film.
