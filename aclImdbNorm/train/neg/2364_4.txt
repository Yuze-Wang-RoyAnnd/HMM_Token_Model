"freddy's dead" did the smartest thing it could've done after the disappointment of the fifth film. it started from scratch. sure, this "final" film in the saga is silly but at least it's original. some of the visuals are even a bit breath-taking. and the story of freddy's kid (lisa zane) returning to town to face her evil father is unique.<br /><br />overall, the movie is nothing but another cartoon made to get kids in the theater. it has a bunch of good actors (zane, yaphet kotto, and lezlie deane) who basically look dumb and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter. it's one-sided, it's a magic-trick, and, in the end, it's nothing but goofy, childish entertainment.<br /><br />
