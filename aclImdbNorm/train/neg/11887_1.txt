the world may have ended. unfortunately this film survived as yet another testament to canada's inability to make movies that go beyond the execrable. maybe it's because all our really good people (norman jewison, martin short et al) go to hollywood.) in fact it's too bad short wasn't cast in this apallingly pretentious and banal film. he might have given it some credibility. the canadian government should realize --- and this movie is a magnificent example --- that shovelling money into the trough does not result in good cinema. if the people lapping up these public funds had had to compete, they might have been forced to come up with something worthwhile. as it is they have produced yet another snickering embarassment.
