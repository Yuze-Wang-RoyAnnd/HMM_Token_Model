just finished watching american pie: beta house and i gotta say, this was such a garbage pile of crap. the first 3 american pies were hilarious, the last 3 were a joke and should not have been called american pie.<br /><br />as you figured out from the title of the movie, beta house, is about a fraternity, freshmen, girls and, the most original part of them all, falling in love. of course, the guy that has his way with the chicks is stifler, who, along with his mates, tries to complete another apparently impossible task. it was unrealistic and super fake. its just really predictable and the plot is so weak. both sides of the college battle to see who gets the whole thing (something like that) to sum it up: awful acting + dull script + wrong use of the american pie franchise = total waste of time! this movie is unbearable. i give it a two out of ten, although most of it sucked there were lots of nudity and pretty girls, like 2 funny scenes :)
