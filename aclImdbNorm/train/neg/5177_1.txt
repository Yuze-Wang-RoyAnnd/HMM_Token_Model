this is so bad, so very very bad. the acting is the biggest joke in history. don't even bother to see it, i did ff it after 20 min and it was just as disappointing in the end as in the beginning... i really don't understand peoples taste, i'm a horror movie fan and i'm not fastidious but i do have a limit! maybe it was a quarter of a star better then the beginning of the hoast but that's it. so i recommend you don't waste the 15 minutes you'll be able to watch. i mean the acting is better done by monkeys. and the big brother with the parental role is just awful. don't they pay characters in c-movies? no i must say it's not the first time i think a horror movie is bad but it's absolutely one in my down ten movies and it will be charing places with portrait of a vampire, cabin by the lake, the hoast!
