and forget this. completely. if you really need to see madonna act, rent "body of evidence", at least willem defoe is in that one.<br /><br />in this film, while the sets are beautiful, you may want to mute the dialog. you won't miss anything. bruce greenwood is wasted, jeanne tripplehorn is a prop, and madonna is so awful, it becomes amusing. why they had to butcher the original film into this mess, i will never know; guess they thought it was "bankable". madonna, as an actress, certainly is not.<br /><br />if you rent the original film from 1979, though, you will enjoy it, and the actors in it can actually act. 1/10.
