this film has so little class in comparison to strangers on a train or even, accidental meeting for that matter, that despite plot similarities i wouldn't feel right in actually comparing this to either of them. the yancy butler character came across as such a dopey dimwit i was too embarrassed for the writer and director to continue watching.<br /><br />i don't enjoy many lifetime movies but feel compelled to watch one every now and then in the interest of promoting harmony at home. i often groan silently but this film caused me to protest out loud, stand up leave the room and walk around the house mumbling to myself, before i returned to my normally favorite chair to subject myself to more torture.<br /><br />dean morgan, rochester, ny
