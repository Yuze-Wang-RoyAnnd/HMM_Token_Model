for a fan series, i must admit that hidden frontier is not at all that bad. but, reviewing this series can not be based on whether it is a fan series or not. the initiative in itself is commendable. the creativity as well. i reckon these are people with ordinary jobs, and a big enthusiastic heart for star trek. but, doing all this work. pulling all these resources. taking all this time, and still all those flaws.<br /><br />first of all the acting, and the lines are awful. for most. the dialogs belongs in a 70's military show, not in star trek. the captain (mr squinty) looks like he is about to burst into laughter anytime. and most characters are just reading their lines. the directors should be aware of the fact that "retake" is not just a word in the dictionary. but i also guess that the series are made in the manner of "two takes frakes", who directed many of the tng episodes and movies also, i could not help but think that most of the actors are typical trekkies. without going any deeper into that assumption.<br /><br />my biggest concern regarding the whole project, is the quality of the releases. when they first decided to spend so much time, and resources on this series - why didn't they make it available in decent quality? using the quick time format, with low low resolution is a waste of talent. even the "higres" episodes is considered bad quality compared to the standard quality series are released in. using xvid codec, with a larger resolution and file size would have improved the experience massively. if band with problems was the issue, setting up a torrent tracker would have solved that.<br /><br />let's hope the crew decides to brush the series up, and perhaps release it on dvd, giving it the quality the project deserves.
