although a film with bruce willis is always worth watching, you better skip this one. i watched this one on television, so i didn't have to plunk down cash for it. lucky me.<br /><br />the plot develops slowly, very slowly. although the first 30 minutes or so are quite believable, it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end. it is highly questionable, if a seasoned soldier like lt. waters would disobey direct orders. and even if he would, if the rest of his platoon would. they know he puts them in direct danger, and they know they will certainly die if they follow him, but what the heck, he is our lt. so let's do what he says (despite the direct orders, remember).<br /><br />still, there are some nice scenes in this movie. they somewhat save a village, where the total population is being massacred by the rebels. well, they save a dozen villagers or so, the rest was already killed. the strange part of it, that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind. they rather go on foot. maybe because the roads are unsafe, but there was no explanation for it. anyway. i think this was what earned the movie the one point i gave it.<br /><br />what made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves. only near the end they loose a few comrades. and that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more. can you believe that?<br /><br />they fight of an army of so many, kill hundreds of them, and only loose a few of themselves. and they have rounds and round of ammo. never run out of it. grenades and claymore mines, an m60 machine gun and even an rpg. where do they get this stuff. carrying it around or what? they even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels. and this laptop has a battery which goes on for days. really? who think up this crap.<br /><br />i guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots, you give this movie a high rating. if not, skip this one. it saves you time.
