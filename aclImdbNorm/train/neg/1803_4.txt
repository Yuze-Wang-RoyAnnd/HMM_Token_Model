here is one of those educational short films made to learn the unknown people out there about facts of life. this time the target audience is preteen girls, the fact of life is menstruation. this animated film, created by walt disney pictures, apparently with some sponsoring from kotex.<br /><br />it starts with explaining how hormones make you grow and develop. with the help of animation and a female narrator it shows us how the body, especially the ovaries, uterus and vagina, work and why this all leads to menstruation. it is almost amazing, becoming the comic note here, how the subject of sex is avoided. even the word is never mentioned although "furtilized" will pass once. i don't really know why i saw this, but since it is one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent time, you might want to give it a try.
