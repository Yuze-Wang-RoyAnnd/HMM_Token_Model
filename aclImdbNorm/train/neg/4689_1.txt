truly awful film made by cinematographer-turned-director ted tetzlaff. decent enough looking film but for a time-bomb movie totally devoid of any tension whatsoever. ford, as someone put it here, sleepwalks though this one with his characteristic smirk. there are some details thrown around- canadian ex-army or raf, defused bombs in the war, his wife is leaving him- but none of these back stories add up to much. the bomber himself is a complete mystery. why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines? for that matter, what time period are we talking about here? wwii or postwar?? i assumed the latter which makes bomber's motive even more salient. generally, though, just a horrible film. there are plenty of good time-bomb flicks to skip this one. watch any episode of "danger uxb" for a more exciting time, at about the same running time.
