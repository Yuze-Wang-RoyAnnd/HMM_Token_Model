blue monkey (1987) or 'invasion of the bodysuckers' as it's known here in the uk was a pretty boring horror movie about an old man who gets bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plant!!!! the man gets rushed to hospital, where this worm like creature comes out of his mouth, of course this transforms into this insect monster and proceeds to go on the rampage!! despite steve railsback and john vernon being in the movie, i found it to be boring, with a flat predictable storyline, un-interesting characters, cheap special effects and lack of action!!!! horror fans don't really need to track this rare movie down, you wont be missing much trust me!!! i give this movie 2/10.
