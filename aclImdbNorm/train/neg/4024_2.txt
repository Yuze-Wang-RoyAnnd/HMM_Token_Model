this movie is just plain terrible. poor john savage had to stoop this low in order to be in another movie. he stars as a rare type of vampire that is to help a lady that looks like a washed out and thrown in the streets hooker that is a dancer at a local strip club. she acidently tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires as they get carried away making out on the floor of the dressing room. savage is then assigned by a short leader of this rare vampire breed that looks like a cross between 80's punk rock and one of the olsen twins with purple hair. this movie just gets all to crazy with savage rapping and dancing with a midget with a tattooed spider on his head, also one of the rare. he quotes the elephant man and jimmy durante and i just had to laugh. this just gets rediculas. and then the most gross special effects that they could come up with is corri throwing up her organs and pulling them out of her mouth. and you can tell that that is all to fake. her son doesn't know what to do with his moms new identity and becomes more of a pest than an object of serenity. i enjoy a good vampire film, believe me i do but i just hated this one. even the photography stinks, in and out blurs with the camera switching this way and that trying to make it look like the vampires move to fast for the camera to keep up and then the camera turns all to bright in the scene of savage chasing the son of corri around till he blinds himself. avoid this one!!
