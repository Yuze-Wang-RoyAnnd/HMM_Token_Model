this movie has got to be one of the worst i have ever seen make it to dvd!!! the story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that i highly caution parents on.... but the story line is like a loose cannon. if there was such a thing as a drive thru movie maker-this one would have sprung from that.it reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were put out in the 1960's, poor script writing and filming. <br /><br />the only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver. the rest of the film, could have easily been made by middle school children. i give this film a rating of 1 as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated. my advice-don't watch it!!!
