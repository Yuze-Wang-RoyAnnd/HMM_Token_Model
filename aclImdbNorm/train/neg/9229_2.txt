this is a movie about making a movie. such movies may be entertaining, but they need some substance, to do so. it did not happen here, i am afraid. mr coppola did not inherit his father's skills, unfortunately (neither did his sister, who can however make movies which one might watch).<br /><br />i do wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews. <br /><br />let's see: the lead male actor, supposedly a director, is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same pitch whatever he says, the lead female actress has an expression on her face that never changes, the plot is totally segmented in bits with perhaps one single connecting element, the movie within the movie idea must be more stale than paleolithic rocks... would that be enough?<br /><br />i regretted every single moment i watched this movie. a walk with the dog is far superior entertainment to this unbelievably lame movie. it's as if a francois truffaut plot were directed by dick cheney...<br /><br />brazil, some other classic sf movies? you must be really joking...
