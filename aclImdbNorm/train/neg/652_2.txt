i think it was an overrated pg-13 crap! at least brittany snow's performance was good and some others like idris elba were good too, but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing. the killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too. the deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginals. the movie was very boring too and very overrated. it wasn't suspenseful at all, i almost fall asleep. its another bad pg-13 remake, its really a dreadful movie imo. the ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring. the movie is pretty slow too. overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe brittany snow i think she gave a good performance and idris elba too, but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake. well thats just my opinion. i gave it a 2/10.
