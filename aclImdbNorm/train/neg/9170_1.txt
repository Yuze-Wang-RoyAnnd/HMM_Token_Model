the question, when one sees a movie this bad, is not necessarily, "how did a movie this bad get made?" or even, "why did i see this awful in the first place?" but, "what have i learned from this experience?" here's what i learned:<br /><br />- just because the "rules" of horror movies have been catalogued and satirized countless times in the last ten years doesn't mean someone won't go ahead and make a movie that uses all of them, without a shred of humor or irony.<br /><br />- if your movie has to be described as **loosely** based on the video game, you have script problems.<br /><br />- the black character may not always die first, but the asian character does always know kung-fu.<br /><br />- while you may be proud that you figured out how to do the "the matrix effect" on a budget, that doesn't necessarily mean you should use it over and over again ad nausea.<br /><br />- being ron howard's brother does not guarantee choice roles.<br /><br />- whenever a scene doesn't edit together, just use some footage from the video game, no one will notice.<br /><br />- if your cousin's rap-metal band offers to write your movie's theme for free, politely decline.<br /><br />- zombie movies are not about people killing zombies. they're about zombies killing people, preferably in the most gruesome way possible. that's what makes them scary.<br /><br />- white people who can pay $1600 to get to a rave deserve to die.<br /><br />- if you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know. anything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks, "what was that?" or, "where are we?"<br /><br />- bare breasts are not horror movie panacea.<br /><br />- a helicopter boom shot and a licensing deal with sega magically transforms your movie from "student film" to "major studio release". try it!<br /><br />- just because you can name-drop all three "living dead" movies, that does not make you george romero. or even paul w. s. anderson.<br /><br />i've seen worse movies, but only because i've seen "mortal kombat: annihilation."
