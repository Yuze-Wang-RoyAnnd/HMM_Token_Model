this film is so bad it simply defies reality. the filming is grade school material at best, the acting is pathetic and the director should forever be banished from film making in any form. so bad it can't even be watched as comedy such something along the lines of showgirls. the only thing this dvd had going for it was the cover art. <br /><br />all i can write to those of you who haven't had the misfortune to witness this is to please do yourself a well deserved favor in advance and don't waste your time or your money on this piece of garbage. if you want to see a movie for the comedy aspects, there are many other more worthy in such a realm than this trash.
