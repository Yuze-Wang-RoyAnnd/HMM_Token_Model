what's wrong with this film? many, many things. the editing tries too hard to look good, and does nothing but confuse the viewer whilst also supplying him/her with a powerful headache. the plot is muddled and obviously prolonged from what started as a short (story or film). the plot only makes for less than ten minutes of good story, and this is just stretched out painfully until it reached the minimum length for a feature film. we all know what happens to things when we stretch them, right? exactly. they get thinner. in the end, the plot is just so paper-thin that you might even miss it, if you aren't paying attention, which is hard to do when watching this movie. the acting is not even slightly impressive. the characters are poorly written and dull, uninteresting. one of the worst things that are wrong with this film is that apparently, whoever was in charge of the score/soundtrack had no idea what the movie was, or what it was supposed to be about(not that i blame him, i couldn't figure it out either). as a result, half of the music in the film doesn't fit the scenes at all. also, what was with all the sexual undertones between eliza dushku and the main character? naturally, this was in order to attract young males, but it was just so cheaply done. and did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film? on any conceivable level? at all? the two creepy guys didn't seem to have anything to do with the film at all, they were just there in order to have some chase scenes. i doubt anyone would really enjoy a film so poorly put together and such a shameless and awful hollywood-like attempt at a somewhat interesting idea. but i digress. i recommend this to teenagers with low attention spans who don't mind a really bad horror-thriller as long as there's some sex and gore in it(although that may only be true for the killer cut, which i saw). 1/10
