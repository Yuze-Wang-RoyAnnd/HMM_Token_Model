i'll admit i've only watched a handful of episodes, but each one seemed completely different from the next. it seems after the first season, the producers decided to completely retool the show, drop characters, introduce new ones, and rewrite the entire show dynamic.<br /><br />as you have probably surmised already, the show is about quirky, unpredictable teenager holly (amanda bynes) who moves in with her high strung sister valerie (jennie garth) in new york city. decent enough premise: odd couple + fish out of water + high jinx.<br /><br />while i miss the sitcoms of yore, this show unfortunately misses the mark on funny repeatedly, and it's sad because they have some decent talent.<br /><br />on top of everything, they insisted on changing the show (val was living with a cast regular bf one season, then he was suddenly gone, so she opens a bakery? what?) when things change that drastically, you get the feeling that even the *show* knows it's bad. i mean, completely new sets, characters written off and new show regulars!<br /><br />on a side note (this is just nitpicking), i know this is a television show and not real at all, but val and holly end up living in a huge loft duplex (there are stairs) with a terrace... in manhattan! are you serious!?
