i've been reading posts here concerning wonder woman's costume for this tv movie. it should be pointed out at the time the movie was made, she wasn't wearing her traditional outfit. the producers were actually sticking to the comic book writer's conception of ww for the early seventies.<br /><br />as for the movie itself, i have to agree with many of the other posters here. snoozefest! i was a kid when it appeared on abc in 1974, so i was at the right age to have appreciated a movie about a comic book hero. yet i was so "engrossed" with the plot, i stopped watching it three quarters into the movie.<br /><br />of course, i wasn't at the right age to appreciate cathy lee! :-)
