how can you tell that a horror movie is terrible? when you can't stop laughing about it of course! the plot has been well covered by other reviewers, so i'll just add a few things on the hilarity of it all.<br /><br />some reviews have placed the location in south america, others in africa, i thought it was in some random island in the pacific. where exactly does this take place, seems to be a mystery. the cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men, and a man who looks like a young frank zappa banging the drums... the devil god is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyes.<br /><br />one of the "freakiest" moments in the film is when, "pablito" find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that i assume is blood, starts screaming for minutes on and on (that's actually funny), and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and "pablito" kicks it a bit for what i assume is "shits n' giggles" and the eyes actually move...<br /><br />but, of course, then the "freak" is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just bad...<br /><br />i hadn't laughed like this in a loooong while, and i definitely recommend this film for a sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do... grab a case of beers and start watching this film, you'll love it! if you are looking for a real horror or gore movie, though... don't' bother.
