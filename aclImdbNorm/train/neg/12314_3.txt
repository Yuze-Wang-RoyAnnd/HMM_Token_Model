maybe i'm really getting old, but this one just missed me and the old funny bone completely. surely there must be something powerful wrong with this irishman (that's me, schultz!). lordy, lordy what i would give to see the light! firstly, that phil silvers manic energy, wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life, if you will. although it is possible that the series, first titled: "you'll never get rich" (1955-59*) could have gotten on the cbs tv network with someone else in the title role of sgt. bilko, it is very hard to picture any other actor/comedian in the business wearing those master sergeant's stripes.<br /><br />such a strong identification is inescapable, though not the same sort of career-wrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys, like clayton more("the lone ranger"), george reeves ("the adventures of superman") and charles nelson riley ("uncle croc's block").<br /><br />one major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950's tv screen to the 1990's movie-going public is our collective memory. without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals, and their numbers were surely considerable; even a large segment of the young had seen bilko reruns in recent times. it was obvious that the new film and the source were miles; or even light years apart.<br /><br />so as not to be thought of as a totally square, old grouch please let's consider some other points.<br /><br />right here today, the 14th day of november in the year of our lord 2007, let me swear and affirm under oath that i have been a steve martin fan for nearly 30 years, furthermore, i've enjoyed the wit and talents of bilko '96 co-stars dan akroyd and the late phil hartman. after all, it was the talents of guys like this and so many others, alumni of "nbc;s saturday night" and "second city tv" that kept the last quarter of the 20th century laughing. but a bilko re-make; it just didn't click.<br /><br />perhaps if the film had been made as a service comedy (always liked 'em!) but without the bilko show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby, old guys like me.<br /><br />so, we've already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately, what's next? howse about somebody doing hal roach's world war ii army comedy series of sergeants doubleday & ames and tv's 1st cartoon series "crusader rabbit"? remember where you heard it first! poodle schnitz!
