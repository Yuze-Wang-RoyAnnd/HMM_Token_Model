warning:it contains spoilers. if a movie starts with a sex scene then it's a bad movie. (see for example 300). this one confirms the above lemma. the second scene constitutes the spinning center of all the action. the fact that we know the end makes the movie boring. even more, other plots are revealed as the story goes back and forth several times. and this made more frustrated. to compensate the consequent lack of suspense, we learn more and more about how unbalanced are the characters. and oh yes, they have lots to show. andy (p.hoffman), for example, is a drug addict, more?, he is cheating his wife, more?, he plans to rob his father, more?, his wife is cheating with his brother, more?, he doesn't regret his complicity to his mother's death, more?, he is a serial killer, more? etc etc it's not enough space to write here... i wonder how could he have a top job. and why his wife didn't leave him before. on the other hand i enjoy much the performances of the actor hoffman.<br /><br />even here psh saves what is left from my 7$ spent for this absurdity. why absurdity? because it doesn't have sense, why should i care for the despicable characters? another broken lemma is that a movie should have a sympathetic( at least pleasant) character. <br /><br />also it's a lot of sentimentality, for example we are supposed to care for the sufferance of the widowed father without knowing anything about the parents'lives before the crime.
