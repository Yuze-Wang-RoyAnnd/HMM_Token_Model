this time we get a psycho toy maker named "joe petto" (get it?) who makes living, evil toys that kill people. he goes after the family who has the bad luck of just simply living in the same house where he and his mutant robot son "pino" (again, get it?) used to live.<br /><br />easily the worst (and hopefully [presumably] the last) in this semi - series, this one and the previous one look like soft core porn movies, but without the sex and nudity. it's kind of like a low rent hybrid of "halloween iii", "puppet master", "dolls" and bad home movies. supposedly in 2000 they started to do a sixth chapter in the series, but it was abandoned and never completed. we can all only hope that it stays that way...<br /><br />1/2 a star out of ****<br /><br />
