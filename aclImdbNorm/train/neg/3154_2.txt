look, there's nothing spectacularly offensive about this film, it's just boring. it's a typical rom-com with an ending you can see coming before you've seen so much as the trailer. the key difference is that the classic rom-coms tackle their stories with wit and a lack of pretension. this movie has no pretension but it really has no sense of movement, you feel as though you could get up and walk away at any moment. the production of the movie also has the feel of a debut movie made about fifteen years ago. i'd recommend re-watching a classic movie like when harry met sally instead of this shallow imitation. oh, one other big problem...no chemistry. if you're used to seeing michael looking all cute as vaughn in alias, you're going to be seriously disappointed with the way they've made him look here.
