i watched written on the wind starring rock hudson,lauren becall,robert stack & dorothy malone- robert stack was terrible- just bloody horrible- he was supposed to be a charming jet-setting millionaire- instead he came off like a jerk from the word go- the plot was stupid and overwrought and the 3 "romantic" leads had no chemistry. somehow dorothy malone won an oscar for best supporting actress- although her campy tramp character was boring- think the older sister from splendour in the grass filled with malice and bitterness and lacking charisma. director douglas sirk has the entire cast overact their way through dialogue that felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes. had a cameo by the actor that played the chief on get smart
