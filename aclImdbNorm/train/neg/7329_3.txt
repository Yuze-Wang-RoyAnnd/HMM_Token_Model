after viewing this film, i felt the compelling need to vent a bit of my frustration. selma blair is a fabulous, currently underrated actress and max beesley was rather charming in "kill me later". the story, while not exactly original, certainly showed some promise. none of that mattered though...at all.<br /><br />i don't know what her deal is, but director dana lustig has virtually no talent whatsoever as a director. she slowed footage down, sped footage up, reversed footage, used awkward camera angles, used annoying color filters, made a zillion quick cuts, jumped back and forth in the timeline and topped it all off with an obnoxious "modern" soundtrack of blaring junk. i can't remember the last time i saw such an incompetent job of directing a film. her ego must be huge to toss out the acting and story and put her direction front and center for the audience members to take notice of. it is crammed down their throats.<br /><br />there are a couple of good scenes in "kill me later" which show what could have and should have been. unfortunately, just when things would start to show promise, ms. lustig would dig into her bag of film school tricks and jumble things up again. it's a shame because blair and beesley had good chemistry and you could tell that the film really had a good heart. 3/10
