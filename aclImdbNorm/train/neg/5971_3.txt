i was talked into watching this movie by a friend who blubbered on about what a cute story this was.<br /><br />yuck.<br /><br />i want my two hours back, as i could have done so many more productive things with my time...like, for instance, twiddling my thumbs. i see nothing redeeming about this film at all, save for the eye-candy aspect of it...<br /><br />3/10 (and that's being generous)
