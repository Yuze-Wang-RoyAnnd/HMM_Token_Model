it's a bad, very bad movie.<br /><br />well, for people a real realistic movie is a good thing. for me it is not. life is also predictable, bad, nasty, trivial, senseless, sometimes. maybe that's the reason for people say that this film is real.<br /><br />too many common places: you're black, you're a criminal, you're doomed and cursed, whatever you do you'll end up by shooting or being shot by someone; don't let the kids play with the weapons, it could be dangerous; and then there are those who go to the church, and then they are good, very good...<br /><br />before this one, i hadn't seen such a bad movie. that's perhaps the reason for i never noticed how important the photography itself is important in a movie. in this one, every scene shot in daytime, outdoor, is clearly and annoyingly blue. they didn't even care to correct the colour balance. oh! i've "rated" more than 300 movies in this database so far, and this (3/10) is my lowest ever.
