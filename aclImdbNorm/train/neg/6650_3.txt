i think this would have been a much better film if the cajuns had been portrayed in a more believable light. my family is from the southeast region of louisiana and i live in southeast texas (about 20 miles from lake charles). i have never heard the people i grew up around talk like these folks did. the cajuns were portrayed as backwards rednecks. most of the cajuns i know are well educated, proud people and don't sound uneducated at all when they talk the way these people did. all in all it was an ok movie, with great scenery and music. i understand that the writers were from lake charles, and have knowledge of the area, but for the love of all things cajun, please have the actors study the language, live amongst the people you are portraying and get an all around understanding of how they are before you go trying to act like them. in my opinion, when the actors make you believe they are that person, it's a much more enjoyable movie!
