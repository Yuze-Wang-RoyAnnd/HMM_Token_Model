***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** when i saw a preview for this movie i thought it was going to be atleast a slightly admirable storyline. but as most superstation original movies i was left disapointed. this gullible family ends up driving through this "deserted" town to take a brake and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their donig and finds out they all eventually disappear, the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what the heck is stalking them. their are more gaps than i can count and they don't explain anything that happens how or what. it ends where the family gets in a car accident and get posest or brainwashed or something( which is never explained). the next thing you know ur hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you completely confused.
