lee hosted the 100 years of horror for ted newsom and was talking about filmic werewolves. he said something to the effect that his only brush with lycanthropy was the howling ii, then he quipped, "the less said about that the better." indeed he was right as this film may very well be the worst in his entire catalog of screen performances. the first howling by joe dante was a groundbreaking werewolf film with its incredible special effects and its campy sense of style and subject matter. it was a film to be taken seriously. like other good original films, filmmakers for some strange reason thought that even more campy sequels were needed rather than what worked the first time(see chud then chud ii to illustrate this point). this film is miles and miles away from the first on every front. there is absolutely nothing scary about it. it looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the major scenes. lee is the only actor in the film worth mentioning(okay, i'll cede ferdy mayne too). lee looks embarrassed as he says inane dialog and does ridiculous things(check out that ending with him and stirba). lee looks incredibly tired and knows what dreck this is which is a tad more insightful than the two leads who leave america to go to romania. the story isn't really worth examining here, and you can bet there is very little story worth mentioning when you have to have stephen parsons and his band babel play through much of the film in the beginning and the ending with that dreadful noise. sybil danning is here and, yes, she disrobes once and then we get that scene showed again and again and again - one reviewer said 17 times(i counted ten - but might have been so bored out of my mind by that point). i gave the film three stars, but it really deserves a zero - the three i gave it are 1 for lee and two for ms. danning's contributions. yuck!
