yikes, it was definitely one of those sleepless nights where i surfed the channels and bumped into this stinker of a movie. for some of the names in the cast, i'd expect a much better movie. i'm almost embarrassed to see oscar winner f. murray abraham being reduced to such a horrible part. i hope the money was worth it. and the students, they talked about fencing like they were talking about survival in a war or through a horrible disaster. i mean, i've fenced, it's a fun sport, but i've never been that intense. the only reason i even watched this entire movie was because the remote fell under the sofa and i was too lazy to get it back.
