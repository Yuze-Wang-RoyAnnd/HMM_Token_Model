it seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive (maffia-like) character of russians, or at least of those russians able to travel outside their big country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in england; and that british police is so inefficient that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air. in addition, nicole kidman and the supposed russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere, probably spoken by aliens in the ural mountains, but far to be the russian one. so nicole, if you really want to talk russian, kindly go to moscow or st. petersburg and keep yourself busy learning russian language grammar and its pronunciation.
