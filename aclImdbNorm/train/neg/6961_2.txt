i completely agree with the other comment someone should do a what's up tiger lily with this film.<br /><br />it has to be one of the worst french films i've seen in a long time (actually along with brotherwood of the wolves, 2 horrendous films in a much too short period of time).<br /><br />it's really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun. antoine decaunes in particular and jean rochefort being among my darlings, i was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor film.<br /><br />lou doyon is quite bad, as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they don't necessarily give you talent.<br /><br />avoid this film, if you want to laugh watch an alain chabat instead or some nice period piece full of fun like la fille de d'artagnan.
