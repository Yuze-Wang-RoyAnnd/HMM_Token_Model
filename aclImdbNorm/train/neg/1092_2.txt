well, i suppose the good news concerning william winckler's 2001 opus, "the double-d avenger," is that it manages to unite three of russ meyer's mammarian marvels--kitten natividad, haji and raven de la croix--in one picture. (i can only assume that lorna maitland, tura satana and babette bardot were busy the week they shot this thing...or else managed to see a copy of the script in advance!) the bad news, though (and there's plenty of it), is that this film--if it can even be called that, having been shot straight to video--is a complete misfire, a total abortion, an out-and-out atrocity, an absolute abomination, and truly one of the worst pictures that i have ever seen. look no further for the lamest superhero movie ever made! the plot here, such as it is, deals with kitten gaining superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in south america to cure her breast cancer (oy), and later battling a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in l.a. too bad that every lame boob joke trotted out falls completely (you should pardon the expression) flat, that there is zero actual nudity in the film at all (other than some old photos of kitten in her heyday), and that some shaving cream and a papier-mache boulder are the sum total of the special fx. the meyer gals here are a bit long in the tooth/saggy in the chest, to put it kindly, although sheri dawn thomas, as bikini girl ooga boobies (!), does manage to, uh, stand out nicely. so why have i given this juvenile, unfunny, failed embarrassment of a movie 2 stars instead of 1? to be succinct: joe bob briggs. his voice-over commentary in the special features of the dvd i just watched is absolutely hilarious, especially when he pulls out around 100 synonyms for the word "breast" from the 1,000+ on his web site's "canonical hooters list." the man is a national treasure, and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a disc to coaster status!
