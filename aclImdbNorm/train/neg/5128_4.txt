this early b entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young gene tierney on the ads and posters, but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her, riding in a hollywoodized camel train. previously, we've set up george sanders and bruce cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along, but must rally in the face of attack. i've seen sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn. however, bruce cabot's allure is pretty much a mystery to me - he's base and unsubtle in comparison, but i've always felt he'd just emerged, smiling, from under a car, covered in grease and a sixth grade education. some people like 'em that way, as did gene's gypsy queen character. this is an action adventure filler, tho, and just as we've been warned of invading locals with guns, ready to sabotage and attack the brits in their land, there is a final gun battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of all. this feature requires nothing more than your barest attention on a saturday afternoon, a programmer that made whatever else it was paired with better. it was almost more interesting identifying the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by dorothy dandridge in one of her first roles. a two or two and a half stars out of five.-mdm
