yet another british romantic comedy which audiences all over the world seem to have a ravenous appetite for. this feeble effort is an unintentional parody of the genre - all the classic clich'ed scenes are here from ridiculously elaborate misunderstandings to running after departing trains to declare one's love. the characters are one-dimensional caricatures save for love-hewitt who manages to bring some cohesion to the film. things threaten to spiral out of control in the plausibility department as the film progresses; our good-natured suspension of belief finally comes crashing down during the preposterous ending. if you're looking for a bridget jones, notting hill kind of experience you won't find it here.
