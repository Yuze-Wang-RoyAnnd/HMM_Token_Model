utter dreck. i got to the 16 minute/27 second point, and gave up. i'd have given it a negative number review if that were possible (although 'pissible' is a more fitting word...). unlike the sizzle you could see and practically feel between macmurray and stanwyck in the original, the chemistry between dumb ol' dicky crenna and whats-her-face here is just non-existent. the anklet becomes an unattractive chunky bracelet? there's no ciggy-lighting-by-fingertip? and i thought i'd be sick when they have a mortified-looking (and rightly so, believe you me) lee j. cobb as keyes practically burping/upchucking his way through the explanation of his "little man" to mr. garloupis. no offence to the non-sighted, but it looks as though a posse of blind men ran amuck with the set design of both the dietrichson and neff houses. the same goes for those horrid plaid pants that phyllis wears. and crikey, how much $$ does neff make, that he lives overlooking a huge marina? this, folks, again, all takes place in the first 16 and a half minutes. if you can get through more of it, you have a much stronger constitution than me, or you are a masochist. but please, take some alka-seltzer first, or you will develop a "little man" of your own that may never go away. proceed with caution, obviously.
