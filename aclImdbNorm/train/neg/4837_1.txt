i went to see this movie simply to see what all the hype is about, and i was as disappointed as surprised about how it got 6(?) oscars and 7.9 rating on imdb as of today.<br /><br />kathryn bigelow should be the luckiest director ever to win the best picture and best direction oscar for this sort of a really really bad movie and i wonder why? did the totally unrealistic 'cowboy' bomb disposal-man storyline mean anything to somebody that i failed see? why did i keep getting the mental image that this movie was a remake of some old bad western movie about a cowboy doing 'brave deeds' in the wild wild west infected with 'evil' red indians; but just that it was set in a different background this time? was it given the oscars because the director being ex of james cameron, and made it a nice underdog (gossipy) story for day time tv shows to munch on? or was it some sort of emperor's clothes syndrome - where most people realized it was junk but just couldn't say so because others didn't seem to be saying it out aloud?<br /><br />and finally what was with that sniper scene where they showed the shell casing dropping in high-resolution-super-slow-mo as if to convey a 'deep message' or something? something in the lines of 'eod guys make good snipers all of a sudden and they will get the filthy terrorists all the time'? was it just me who felt like there were so many bits and pieces here and there in the movie squeezed in for no apparent reason? and you can get the oscars for editing and directing for that??<br /><br />if you haven't seen this yet, don't waste your money on tickets. wait till they run it on tv in a few years. you are not going to miss much.
