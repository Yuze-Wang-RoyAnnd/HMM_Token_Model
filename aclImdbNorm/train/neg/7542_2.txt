this movie is suppose to be a mysterious, serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. however, 30 minutes into the movie, it turns into a funny, unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. i can't imagine anyone not laughing when cage randomly karate kicks that blonde girl or when he "bear" punches that old lady. the lines, characters, and acting are all poorly done from the get-go. i've always liked nicolas cage as an actor, but he has made some terrible movies this year; this being by far the worst one (yet...).<br /><br />i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense story-gripping thriller. if you really want to enjoy this story, go rent the original. however, if you intend on watching it, get ready to laugh at some of the lines and end scenes rather than taking them seriously; that's the only way you enjoy this film.
