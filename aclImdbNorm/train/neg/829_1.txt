i heard about this film and knew it wasn't real good. but i started watching the film (on my film-channel)and was interested. this could be a really great, darkly black satire on todays morals in media. the small featurettes on every contestent were good. it build up to something i wouldn't wanna miss. but when the so called show starts everything becomes implausible, cheap and rather silly. here's where the writer should have added something that would make people think. but instead it's wrapped up and assuming people are this dumb.<br /><br />the ending is so bad i give it a 1. even if the film starts of promising.
