i have been an environmentalist for years and was really looking forward to this show. i had it set to record all episodes because i thought i could really learn some great new things. i probably could if i could get past rachelle.<br /><br />i'm sure a lot of this is staged to seem like a reality show and appeal to that class of viewer. it doesn't work for someone who's really interested in improving the planet.<br /><br />this show should be called nagging with rachelle.<br /><br />since ed is such a great font of information, maybe a second show that's really serious about the environment would be a good idea. dumbing things down is not necessary for some of us. <br /><br />i no longer record episodes or watch the show, but do let me know if a real green show may be in the works.
