this is one of the worst b slashers i've ever seen in my life. the ending is something you have to see to believe.<br /><br />the movie starts with harry standing and phillip standing sitting on the stairs with their mother watching their father come down the chimney while dressed in a santa suit. he puts the presents under the tree, eats the cookies and milk and then goes back up the chimney. phillip goes to bed but harry comes down only to find his father dressed in a santa suit sexually pleasuring his mother. then, harry goes up stairs, smashes a snow globe, grabs a shard of glass, and cuts himself.<br /><br />then you move on to the present. you see harry. he is a lonely man who sleeps in a santa suit and watches little kids through a pair of binoculars. he has two books. one book for good kids and the other for bad kids. he writes down everything they do in these books. the guy is a creep. he also works at the jolly dream toy factory. his brother phillip has a family and two kids and lives in a nice house.<br /><br />when harry finds out that his boss only cares about profits, he goes and collects all the toys and delivers them to a few kids. then, he travels to a church and kills 4 people. then he goes to another house and puts presents under the tree. the kids catch him but they go back to bed. so, harry goes to the bedroom and kills the father and leaves.<br /><br />as he is walking towards a house, a bunch of kids spot him and run up to him. the parent's are nervous and try to get their kids to come back to them so they don't get hurt. how do they know that harry is the killer? sure, you have to be suspicious because you never know who it could be. harry gives the kids presents and the father pulls out a switch blade in an attempt to stab him in front of the kids.<br /><br />when harry runs off, the townsfolk light torches and follow him to kill him. they don't even know that he is the killer. when harry reaches his brother's house, his his brother and him have a little talk and phillip strangles him. he only loses consciousness. phillip loads harry back into his van. when harry wakes up, he takes off.<br /><br />the ending is something i could not believe. once again, you'll have to see it to believe it.<br /><br />one thing that bugged me was the black santa. that's right, the man in the santa suit they saw was a white man. so why did they bring in a black man?<br /><br />skip this and see silent night deadly night and santa's slay. you'll get your money's worth seeing those two films. they are better than this pile of garbage! i give this movie 1 star out of 10. wish i could give it 0 stars cause that is what this movie deserves.
