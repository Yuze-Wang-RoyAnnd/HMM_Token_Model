letting the class watch this in english was a bad idea. films that are serious and more educational can have an effect, but it appears this one didn't have any effect whatsoever on the class - whenever the teacher left, conversations quickly started - and i didn't hear the words "shakespeare" or "tempest" being used at all. and when you look at this, it is easy to see why. the acting is nothing special - everyone seems bored to bits, just reading from the page without a care in the world. shakespeare always did prefer expository dialogue to action and death, but i just couldn't understand a word anyone was saying. the costumes aren't too bad and neither are the special effects - the class may not have loved the film, but they weren't exactly taking the p*ss either. but it is hard to joke at a film that is devoid of any sort of inspiration or joy. the scenes on the ship at the start of the film weren't too badly done - though the rain looked a bit unrealistic, everything else was done well and good. but where were the severed heads and exploding masts? where was the death? where was the inspiration? the character of ariel would have been taken a lot more seriously had he been wearing clothes - but as all was on show, he was just another excuse for a joke. this film is not in any way appealing to either sex. the women and girls won't have any romance or comedy to enjoy, and there is an abundance of naked men and lack of action or death that will put most men and boys off. the tempest wasn't badly done, but this felt like something the producers had to make, not something they wanted to make. and the general boredom and lack of inspiration show. 3/10
