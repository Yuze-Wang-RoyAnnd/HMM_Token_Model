nikolai gogol's story "viy" has been filmed again and released to home video in the us via faith films.<br /><br />the original story concerns a priest who has to watch over the body of a witch with only his faith to protect him. greatly expanded and set in america, though clearly filmed in russia (the houses,clothing and furnishing are all wrong despite the english signs), this is an odd film that doesn't really work.part of it is the weird setting that tries very hard to be backwoods america but clearly isn't.there are also some weird, intentionally oblique moments as the main character being a reporter at the start and a priest a short time later. i'm not sure why they did that, even after watching the making of piece on the dvd) the other problem is the dubbing which is beyond awful. its done in such away that everyone speaks when their lips are not on camera- or if they are the voices don't even remotely match the lip flaps. i don't know if its faith films fault or that of the producers who made the film hoping to dump into the west (revealed in the making of piece).<br /><br />the film isn't very good. as i've said it has all sorts of technical issues that just make this an odd ball curio. despite some really good looking horror images the film never works as a horror film. as film to engender faith its much too confused in this retelling to amount to make anyone feel anyone closer to god.<br /><br />given the choice i'd give it a pass, even at a bargain bin price. my advice would be to find the 1960's version of the tale called viy which will bring both some shivers and some understanding about a belief in god.
