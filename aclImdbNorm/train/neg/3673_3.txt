william hurt scuba diving scientist??? us agents running the investigation abroad? the sick contaminated man kicking butt after falling 20 feet on his back and running away? sniper missing and not killing hurt (just wounding him) but the second "kill" shot is dead on ? waste of time. to compare this to falling down as other reviewers did is ridiculous. oh and by the end of the movie they decide to start wearing gloves on their hands except for the "evil" agent and hurt decides to kill him by giving him the "virus handshake". what? btw...when did imdb require 10 lines of text? i'm just babbling here. doesn't this just dillute the content of reviews if you are required to have x amount of lines?
