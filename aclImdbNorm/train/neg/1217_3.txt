its christmas eve and lazy and submissive housewife della (kim basinger) receives some violent threats from her troubled and abusive husband. leaving her twin children in bed she ventures off into the night for one last shopping spree at the local mall. its busy there and finding a parking space is nigh on impossible, della takes umbrage at one motorist who parks in two spaces, she leaves them a note saying as much. returning to her car after visiting the shops she is confronted by some yobs, yup the owners of the car she left a note on, they are very angry and want some fun with her, a kindly security guard steps into assist her, but things get out of hand and the guard is shot, della flees with the now murderous yobs in hot pursuit, they shoot at her, she looses control of her car and crashes, quickly grabbing her toolbox from the trunk, she hides in a deserted building site, but is soon caught, just before they try to rape and kill her, from her magical toolbox she produces a wrench, wounding their leader "chuckie", she manages to escape again into the nearby woods, in the fracas one of the gang is killed, it just happens to be the black guy here the night gets worse for all involved as a deadly game of cat and mouse ensues. a similar plot line to eden lake drew me to this, but that is where the comparisons end. this is a brainless and dumb film, shockingly scripted and horribly acted by all involved, the doe eyed disney-esquire twin kids are horrible to watch, but its lukas haas as chuckie, that must take the plaudits in the bad acting department, although he is given a run for his money by the equally awful husband. as a film its plot line is completely telegraphed all the way through, even in the set up early on della's cell phone goes dead and then in the shops her credit card has been cancelled by her hubby and she has no cash and its christmas eve, now where could they be going with this i wonder??? the only surprising part of this $hit is when after killing all the clich'ed bad guys with the contents of her magic toolbox, she demands chuckie to f@ck her, if my jaw had not already been on the floor at this films awfulness, it would surely have dropped and smashed on the floor. even the ending is messed up, all the feminist grannies wanting their pound of flesh are left utterly disappointed.. i didn't think i could be further disappointed, but then i saw that guillermo del toro produced this dreck
