pretty incoherent movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s superficially hippie religious cult, who fights them sixteen years later. the man has a child with one of the other cultists, who during a raid by the police is hidden away, and taken by another man named hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river. the cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town. it's hard to keep track of who characters are, or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place. the leader gets paroled sixteen years later (i got that from the box - i missed the amount of time in the movie). nobody is made to look any older, not noticeably, anyway.<br /><br />one murder is done with a large circular logging saw, others are done with knives or a crossbow. i never heard the title character's name mentioned in the movie, but he's the one who overacts the most, hooting and hollering.<br /><br />the movie is patched together pretty poorly, with voice-over helping (not much) to explain what is going on. some of the sound effects were pretty bad. a man is getting punched, and we hear the sound of a whip cracking. a woman fires a gun, and we don't hear it fire, but hear a ricochet instead! it doesn't seem to have been done for comical effect.
