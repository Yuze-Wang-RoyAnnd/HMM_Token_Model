i had never heard of larry fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing, he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor. like many others on here, i don't know how to categorize this film, it wasn't scary or spooky so can't be called a horror, the plot was so wafer thin it can't be a drama, there was no suspense so it can't be a thriller, its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the blair witch project. people who liked this film used words, like "ambiguity" and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasn't there. like the blair witch, people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying. this movie actually started off well with the family "meeting" the locals after hitting a deer. it looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes, (well over half the film), nothing happened, the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining. it was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie. finally, when something does happen, its not even clear how the father was shot, how he dies, (the nurse said his liver was only grazed), and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects. the film is called wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way, the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied, i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but i wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself. it didn't.
