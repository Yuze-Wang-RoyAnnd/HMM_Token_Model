here's yet another blasphemous european story in which they blast the religion of their country. (these atheist filmmakers are relentless.) here we see a brutal blasting of catholics and/or the catholic clergy (and i am not catholic).<br /><br />this won actually won an academy award for bes foreign film. that's probably because the story made catholics and religious belief in general look extremely weak. one of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else. he's portrayed as nothing but an idiot. no wonder the secular- dominated academy loved this movie.<br /><br />also, there is some overacting fool who plays a guy who renounces his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters featured in the story. the daughters take turns seducing the "seminary" student (who states he studied for six years but says he's an agnostic!). i mean, how blasphemous is this film??!!!<br /><br />this is a disgrace and another excellent example of the secular-progressive bigotry of the film business, worldwide (not just hollywood).
