i just finished watching guinea pig - devils experiment. i have to say that this movie, although having very good fx, better then i expected, was not a good movie. i honestly cant say that i enjoyed this movie at all. of course it is effective in its way of being a shocking, realistic, twisted 43 minutes of torture, but i found it to be very boring (and not as gory as i hoped). and also i found that the torturers were very annoying, when they talked and loughed trying to sound tough all the time, that ruined it even more (and im sure there's some people out there who will agree with me on that one). i have now seen guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and the best one out of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 - flowers of the flesh and blood. i wont say much more about devils experiment, other than great fx, descent acting from the girl, annoying fu**ing torturers, overall i give it 4 stars on account of the fx cos they are awesome.
