"whipped" is one of the most awful films of all time. it is a mean, hateful piece of garbage that had me forcing myself to stay in the theater more than any other movie of 2000, besides maybe "the grinch." it is not, as people have called it, an insightful portrait of modern relationships. that would be a little film called "high fidelity." whereas that movie was honest and sympathetic, "whipped" is hostile, cynical, misanthropic cinematic poison. avoid this like so many plagues, unless you want to see how truly bad a "comedy" can get.
