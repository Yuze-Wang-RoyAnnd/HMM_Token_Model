i wish i'd known more about this movie when i rented it. i'd put it in my queue on the basis of heather graham and her strong cred as an actress (imho). while parts of the movie were charming, much of the movie felt contrived, undeveloped, or otherwise just boring or predictable. not to mention the ick factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple... i don't care how big a part of the story line that is, it still felt a bit, um, gross. and charlie, for a zoologist, she certainly doesn't seem to be very attuned to signals from other homo sapiens. what was it about her (besides her hotness and some common interests) that made gray fall for her? the story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth. high points - molly shannon (although i do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion), the cabbie in drag, and the dance sequences (if sam & gray were such great dancers, i wish we'd seen more of that, as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie). could have been better.
