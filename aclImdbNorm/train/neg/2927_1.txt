somewhere, out there, there must be a list of the all time worst gay films every made. one's that have overlong camera shots of the stars sitting and staring pensively into space, or one's where they focus unbearably long on kitty kats eating spaghetti. this motion sickness picture is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love and swim and get stuck in grottos and one of them has a depressed mother and another has no mother and they talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then break up and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then gets out and there is a lot of fast forward and rewind and there are long pensive shots of one of them looking into space or just sitting and doing nothing. i think it's some sort of gimmicky film making technique or maybe it's that the film is so bad they have to fill it up with long, wasted shots because otherwise if they had to rely on plot or story the film would be about 14 minutes. don't get me wrong, this is about the 30th gay film i"ve watched in the past 6 months and some of them (most of them) have been very formulmatic, predictable and boring but this is one is really a terrible waste of time. the best one so far was "beautiful thing". so, i watched this and after the very first opening shot which lingered and lingered i thought "oh, no, its going to be creative sinny mah" but i gave it a chance and watched it and then when it ended i tossed the dvd in the trash. sorry i didn't like it and if you did, sorry if i offend.
