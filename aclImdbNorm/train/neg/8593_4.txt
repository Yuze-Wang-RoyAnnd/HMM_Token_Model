well, i finally saw it. i didn't go when it first came out because, well, frankly, i was afraid. afraid of how bad it might be, or how disappointing. while not as bad as menace, and better than clones, it wasn't particularly memorable, or satisfying.<br /><br />i was 11 years old when i saw star wars. i still remember sitting in the theater. from the opening crawl to the final credits it was a movie experience i'll never forget. a timeless story of the bored farm-boy who just knows he was meant for more, saving the princess and the galaxy from the evil menace while being mentored by the wise wizard, the rogue pirate and the various comic relief--all in a space-opera setting.<br /><br />and that's not to chastise lucas for using an old formula. it's an old formula precisely because it works. and to his credit, he gave it new twists that made it very special.<br /><br />then came empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale. darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time. the great villain, vader was luke's father. wow, no one saw that coming. of course, i'm convinced neither did lucas till it showed up in the screenplay. go back and watch star wars again. knowing what you know now, particularly in light of the first three episodes, see if it really meshes.<br /><br />which brings me to the problem i have. revenge is an entertaining movie--tremendous effects, plenty of action, some good fighting scenes. but a movie still lives or dies on its plot--the story it is telling. oh, certainly, really good acting can save a weak plot, but a weak plot coupled with bad acting--that's a burden no director can overcome, certainly not one as bad as i'm forced to realize george lucas is (the man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actors--liam neeson, natalie portman, samuel jackson).<br /><br />*****spoilers ahead******** the plot. oh my. understand, he's already handicapped by what's happened in the first two films so it's an incredible burden. one too much for him to overcome.<br /><br />first we have the sheer absurdities of the background. we have anakin being found as a child on tatooine, the product of a virginal, miracle birth--the "chosen one". well, this detail never gets remotely explained. indeed, the closest explanation is yoda's observation that maybe they were wrong. oh, well, okay then. our mistake.<br /><br />now, this same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of c3po. hey, what a coincidence that is. and he'll come back to tatooine and never know he was from there? wow! how about that. testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there, eh george? anyway, we have this bratty kid, moody, petulant, whining young adult, who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in cinematic history--the great tragedy of darth vador--the good guy who falls from grace, only to finally achieve redemption in the end.<br /><br />how, pray tell, does this happen? why, he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth. now, sure, he lives in a star-spanning civilization that treats gravity like we treat gasoline, but does it occur to the "dark one to be" to maybe check with a physician cause maybe, just maybe, this futuristic society might can do something about this problem? why, no, the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they've been chasing for two films tells him that he's got the secret to immortality.<br /><br />well, of course he does.<br /><br />sheesh.<br /><br />how can lucas expect us to watch such foolishness and be moved by it? how can anyone expect us to care? hell, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place. i wanted kenobi to kill him not because he was evil, but because he was pathetically stupid.<br /><br />oh, by the way, amidala finally dies. in childbirth. why? well, they don't know. the doctor, who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced, offers only the conclusion of "she's lost the will to live". well, oh, okay, of course she has. maybe it finally dawned on her what a dweeb she was sleeping with.<br /><br />but here we are. we have kenobi present for all this. he knows of the birth of luke and leia. knows who their father is and knows what happens to them. knows, also, the role of both r2 and c3po. and yet, in several years, as luke approaches manhood and shows up with 3po and r2 (curiously, 3po's mind is wiped, but not r2's--why????) stating "i think these droids belong to you", kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he believed to be "the chosen one" and apprentice to the emperor himself, and who just happened to be built on this very planet, says "strange, i don't recall owning any droids".<br /><br />oh good grief.<br /><br />lucas simply made this up as he went along. once he introduced vader as luke's father, sadly, the story began spinning out of control because he didn't know what the story was. the plot of episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. nothing palpatine did made any rational sense at all. and none of this ties into the story he originally told in star wars.<br /><br />it's an afterthought, and it looks it.<br /><br />i can't give this movie a high rating. it reminds me of triple x. a fun film to watch, but entirely forgettable. star wars will stand in my mind forever. thankfully, this one, and the two preceding it, will soon fade.
