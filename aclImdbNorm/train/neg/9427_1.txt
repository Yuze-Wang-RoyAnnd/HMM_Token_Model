when i rented "unhinged", i was expecting a gore movie. the box even claimed that the movie had extreme scenes of violence that were cut from the theatrical release (i now have serious doubts about this being released in the theater). after finishing the movie, i wondered how it could even receive a video release.<br /><br />the plot is as follows: a group of three young women on a car trip crash their car into a tree. these women somehow manage to make their way to a mansion, which contains an extremely sexist woman. beyond this point, the movie is mainly composed of useless scenes that are intended to make the movie long enough for release.<br /><br />one of the things that makes this movie awful is the acting. lisa munson, who plays the main character, looks as though she is reading her lines off cue cards. the others acting is bad, but not nearly as bad as hers. another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera technique. many shots are taken by cameras attached to the ceiling. this gets very annoying as the movie progresses. on top of all that, there is very little gore, which makes the box very misleading. <br /><br />don't waste your time on this one. my rating: 1 out of 10
