suppose you've been on a deserted island the last ten years. haven't heard of scream and left when halloween part 1 entered the cinema. then this movie would have been a blast and a completely new vision on the horror scene.<br /><br />at the moment, a 2.7 rating is on imdb and it doesn't deserve a that low appreciation. slashing all the way, like "i know what you did", and a who-is-it that when getting to the end convinced me of that who-and-why.<br /><br />no big surprise, just a nice flick to watch with a cola, popcorn and no urge to get a difficult plot, deep characters. if the video rental is out of the top titles, you can take it without a risk, but don't expect a masterwork. i've seen a lot worse.
