it is unbelievable that a script as clich'e and completely absurd could make any screen even the small one. the dialogue in this movie makes catwoman seem like a high culture classic. billy zane plays the bad ass harmonica playing, elvis impersonating, gunslinging, martial arts master who gambles on the life of a down-an-out former football player turned gambling addict played by the winner of nbc's craptastic show "next action star." his performance is as cold as ice and not in a cool way. the "film" takes place in vegas, and since people play poker there the writers felt it was a perfect setting for a movie about a guy trying to survive 24 hours against an omnipresent, wealthy gambler who has offered his target $2.4 million if he can make it through the day. and so the hunt ensues. a hunt reeking with unimpressive explosions, construction yard settings, shoddy cinematography, and one-liners containing the word "bet" or "gamble." the female winner is also tossed in the mix, but for what reason i have no idea. oh but don't worry "nas" fans the losers make their memorable cameos as well. the surprise ending will knock your socks off if you love predictability or plagiarism. joel silver should reevaluate his decision to sell out even more. i wish he could give me those two hours of my life back.
