alone in the dark is uwe boll's kick in the nuts to hollywood after house of the dead's punch in the face.<br /><br />if anything it proves just how much of a master manipulator boll is. after forcing artisan out of business over the flop that was house of the dead, one can only assume the normally credible lion's gate films only released aitd under contractual obligation after acquiring artisan's assets. because aitd is an even bigger example of complete lack of coherent film-making ability, plot exposition and just plain stealing poorly from other movies because it was supposed to look cool instead of because it fitted within the movie's framework.<br /><br />but then that's the point, isn't it. boll isn't trying to make a coherent film because he isn't trying to direct alone in the dark. he's just trying to manipulate hollywood.<br /><br />alone in the dark, like house of the dead, dungeon siege, far cry, bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are "announced" or in "pre-production".<br /><br />these aren't movies to be directed, but investment portfolios. every single one of them rushed into production under the pretence that the tax law boll and his investors are exploiting may be closed within the next 2 to 3 years. the more bomb projects he can release within that time-frame, the more money he and his investors can gain. why bother making a good movie when a bad movie's making you a mint anyway? the result is movies like the awfulness of alone in the dark.<br /><br />alone in the dark, like all his other movies are just a cynical exploitation of hollywood's current trend for lazy film-making.<br /><br />and to those who support boll by calling him misunderstood or the next ed wood, congratulations, by making a cult figure out of the man, you're just making it easier for him to get investors but giving him notoriety.<br /><br />for more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid=21699 as an aside, just don't ask me how he's getting his cast-lists together. unless the actors are in on the investment-scam somehow, that mystery has still to be uncovered.
