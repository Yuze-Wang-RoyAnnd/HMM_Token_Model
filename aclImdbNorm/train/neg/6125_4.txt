this is the best film the derek couple has ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you haven't seen any of the others. there are the usual ingredients: it is just as poorly acted as their other efforts, we can watch bo disrobing or auditioning for wet t-shirt contests quite frequently, the story is just laughably idiotic, and the film takes itself much too seriously. and then: orang utans in africa?<br /><br />but it has a few things going for it. bo looks great, the production values (sets, costumes, etc.) are quite good, and this greatly enhances its camp value. in a strange way it is actually quite funny, simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly.
