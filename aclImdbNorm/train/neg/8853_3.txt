in the first howling, we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized. the plot in that film made some sense; a tv reporter investigates this and attempts to uncover the truth. she ends up having to kill many of them including her boyfriend who becomes one. then she shows the world that they do exist by transforming on live tv. the special effects were just laughable in the first movie and they don't get any better in this one. whether it's the transformations or the bad puppets or the cheesy computer graphics showing the superpowers.<br /><br />the plot line isn't all that bad; they must kill the leader of the werewolves for some reason. this won't destroy all werewolves and it really doesn't end the threat from werewolves as it...they just want to kill her. i think there was some cloudy reason for this but it really gets lost in the film.<br /><br />after the film "ends" we have a 10 minute montauge of the movie we just watched and every other scene is one where the female werewolf leader rips off her top exposing her large breasts while some devo-esquire band plays to a crowd of werewolves. <br /><br />the only thing that makes this movie even watchable is christopher lee.
