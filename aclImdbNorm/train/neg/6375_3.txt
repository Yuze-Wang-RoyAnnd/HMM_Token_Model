jennifer's shadow is set in argentina & starts as jennifer cassi (gina philips) arrives there after her sister johanna dies. jennifer is left johanna's large house in her will, jennifer decides to sell the house & head back to los angeles even though her grandmother mary ellen (faye dunaway) is opposed to the sale. however strange things begin to happen, jennifer starts having nightmares about ravens pecking at her & she starts to feel very ill. after a check up in hospital it seems that one of her kidney's have mysteriously disappeared, what is happening to jennifer? is it an ancient family curse? will jennifer be the next to succumb to it...<br /><br />this argentinian american co-production was co-written & co-directed by daniel de la vega & pablo par'es & is a really dull waste of ninety odd minutes, a tedious & predictable modern ghost story that i would imagine will put more people to sleep sooner than scare them. the script by vega, par'es & p.j. pettiette is pretty slow going & tedious which is not what anyone wants, i mean i'm sure most people don't want to sit down & be bored out of their skulls. the character's are all uninteresting & fairly faceless with little or no motivation for anything they do. for instance who is that graveyard caretaker guy? how did he know about the demons? what is his interest & motivation for getting involved? i couldn't see it. jennifer herself is a pretty unlikable & bland leading lady, her grandmother mary allen is as clich'ed as they come & it's surprising that she is so obviously the villain. i mean for this sort of mystery based horror/ghost story it's surprisingly predictable & routine. there are gaps in both logic & the story which together with the terrible twist ending which isn't much of a twist i didn't like jennifer's shadow one iota.<br /><br />directors vega & par'es goes down the much used route of bleaching almost all of the colour from the picture which often renders it not too far from black and white, i suspect that they wanted to give it a period gothic feel but it's been done so many times before & often so much better that it didn't do much for me at all & just makes the whole film look dull & lifeless. there's a definite 40's period look as well, from the costumes to the interior of the large house but again it's rather half hearted & cheap looking. jennifer's shadow is well made but it's rather forgettable, it's not scary or creepy & it's rather predictable. if that wasn't enough there's no gore either, there's a few scenes of ravens pecking away at people & a beating heart but nothing else.<br /><br />with a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 & retitled to the chronicles of the raven for it's us & international dvd release this is reasonably well made but a million won't buy you too much these days & jennifer's shadow pretty much proves that theory. there are too many scenes of actor's speaking in thick argentinian accents as well, even though it might be realistic i actually like to be able to understand what people are saying. the acting is alright although dunaway overacts badly & is obviously there for the money.<br /><br />jennifer's shadow is a rubbishy ghost film that i thought was a total bore from start to finish, i would rather watch the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed-up zombies!!? (1964) again instead. a total waste of time.
