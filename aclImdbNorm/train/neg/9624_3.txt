considering the potential this move had, the reality was disappointing. while it's always nice to see jennifer aniston in a movie, even that couldn't turn this around. most of the action was predictable. the jokes were flat to mildly amusing. and the characters were not very interesting. i wanted to like this film, but it just never happened. ben stiller was hilarious in "there's something about mary". here it looks like he's just going thru the motions. if they have to lift plot points from "friends", they should have known something was wrong. the toilet humor should have stayed in the closet :-).<br /><br />watch "50 first dates" instead.
