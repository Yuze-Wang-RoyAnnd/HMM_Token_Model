there is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film: major chick davis (pat o'brien). o'brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. but he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly. in fact, he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military. he's tough when he has to be, yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he perfected in other films. his character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. o'brien seems natural in the role, and plays it in fine fashion. two things help this movie: o'brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending.
