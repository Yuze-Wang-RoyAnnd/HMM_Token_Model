alone in the dark is one bad movie and tied with deuce bigalow for worst movie of the year. i wish that was all i had to say but of course the imdb stipulates a word count and all that.<br /><br />i'm in two minds about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie. a low budget dreck like red zone cuba, monster a go go and manos. or a huge budget disgrace like gigli, superbabies or this guff. you see movies like monster a go go and manos happen because the director hasn't a clue. movies like this happen because the director is a stupid, money grabbing idiot who simply doesn't care about his audience.<br /><br />it's more shocking when you consider that uwe boll (the mastermind behind this shocking crap and already has some real garbage under his belt) has created something that only happens once in a blue moon. the really terribly bad horror film. everything about it is a mess. cheesy cgi, bad plot, insane random camera cuts and appalling soundtrack.<br /><br />alone in the dark is a dreadful movie that should be watched by absolutely nobody. woo hoo! review over. give me a bud, roll on 2006 and may i never speak of this again.<br /><br />don't watch this film.
