cannon pulled off a real visual beauty of a medieval epic that appears fascinating (except for the dragon prop). now just how did the long-gone studio known for chuck norris movies ever come up with a complete lack of knowledge in the first place? case in point: the amateurish acting and horrible plot is a sign that reviving the medieval legend is no cure for some lousy execution. they actually went on and made another cheap exploitationer featuring hundreds of lusty bimbos, just to make this look even better. for the two "barbarian brothers", they sure know how to make weird noises than becoming brave warriors so strong and bold enough to save their native land. this is the single greatest waste of potential i've seen from an "expensive" low-budget movie, and worse enough to let an axe strike through the gorgeous print without mercy. all of this followed an advertising campaign that sold t-shirts based on the barbarians! the movie alone makes a great souvenir!
