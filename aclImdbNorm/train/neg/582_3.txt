brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature, particularly the nature of addiction, which still resonate strongly today.<br /><br />as for the movie... eh. nothing special. the cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circling and circling and circling around everything, making the viewer quite nauseous. why the director didn't put a stop to this is beyond me--but maybe he was too busy trying, and somehow failing, to draw good performances from these normally excellent but inappropriately-cast actors. all in all, a weak adaptation. your three hours would be better spent reading (or re-reading) the book.
