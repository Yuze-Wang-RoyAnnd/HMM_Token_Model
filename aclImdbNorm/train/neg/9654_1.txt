the movie is plain bad. simply awful. the string of bad movies from bollywood has no end! they must be running out of excuses for making such awful movies (or not).<br /><br />the problem seems to be with mainly the directors. this movie has 2 good actors who have proved in the past that the have the ability to deliver great performance...but they were directed so poorly. the poor script did not help either.<br /><br />this movie has plenty of ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half. for instance :<br /><br />after his 1st big concert, ajay devgan, meets up with om puri (from whom he ran away some 30 years ago and talked to again) and all om puri finds to say is to beware of his friendship with salman!!! what a load of crap. seriously. not to mention the baaad soundtrack. whatever happened to shankar ehsaan loy?<br /><br />ajay devgun is total miscast for portraying a rockstar.<br /><br />only saving grace are the good performances in the second half. ajay shines as his character shows his dark side. so does salman as the drug addict. <br /><br />watch it maybe only for the last half hour.
