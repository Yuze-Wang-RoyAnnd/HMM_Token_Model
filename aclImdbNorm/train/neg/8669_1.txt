first and foremost, i loved the novel by ray bradbury. it's the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later. it was one of his best books, with, you know, fahrenheit 451 and dandelion wine. i as just hoping that this movie would be all right. it had lots of chances, with a great cast, like jason robards and jonathn pryce. and bradbury even wrote the script himself. and on top of all that, it has pam grier!<br /><br />how could it fail?<br /><br />there may be spoilers within.<br /><br />first of all, it was dumbed down. much of the horror from the book was lost as bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum. all the visuals from the book...gone. everything that made you squirm...gone.<br /><br />and then there's the acting. like a lot of movies that disney threw out in the 80s, the kids in this movie cannot act. and, this bugged me a lot, neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10. their strong friendship wasn't addressed. it was more like they were acquaintaces. <br /><br />you'd think jason robards and jonathan pryce could pull this off in their roles of mr. halloway and mr. dark. but here it's like they just don't care. all they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something. this is far from being some of their best performances. <br /><br />pam grier was fine as the witch, but the charecter of the dust witch herself wasn't well pulled off. she's a lot less evil and doesn't have the presence as she did in the book. <br /><br />and everything that was left out of the book. the ballon night chase, the marking of jim's house, the real death of mr. dark, what happened to mr. coogan on the merry-go-round, the fate of the lightening rod salesman, the real death of the witch, and oh so much more. <br /><br />and the special effects were bad, even for the 80s. the merry-go-round of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasn't really creepy, and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything. <br /><br />i could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel, but it makes blood boil. don't see this movie but read the book. it's a classic of bradbury.
