this movie makes no sense at all, there are plot holes big enough to drive enormous nypd vehicles through. the characters do not act in any plausible way whatsoever. i will put my comments in the chat board, but save your time and money, this is stupid. i can't stand when hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang equipment and uses fancy editing and cool music, and does not bother to have a plot that hangs together at even the most basic level. but it is nice to see denzel w. prevail over the man, who comes in 3 flavors, jodi foster, mayor bloomberg and capt. von trapp. there is even a sweet little kid with a video game who is nice.
