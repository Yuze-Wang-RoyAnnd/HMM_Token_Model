just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself. seriously, even if you read all the negative comments on here you will be nowhere near able to comprehend how awful this film actually is, although it has to be one of the most hilarious things i have ever seen! never bothered to post a comment on here before, but this piece of crap really warrants it. <br /><br />firstly the entire plot is ridiculous and nonsensical. brother of the lead character (either ben or arthur, i forget which is which, and frankly it's never very clear) wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is abhorrent to christians, but apparently mass murder isn't. then there's some other crap thrown in about one of the gay couple's ex-wife trying to force him to remarry her at gunpoint. this leads to nothing, but provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole "film" - "i don't make sense? you don't make sense! that's who makes sense!". brilliant.<br /><br />then there's the acting, which is just atrocious. it must be seen to be believed. my personal favourite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer woman, who is clearly reading her lines off of something, yet still managing to mess them up. enough said. the gay couple couldn't be less convincing. there's the vaguely attractive and completely gormless guy, and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon dough man of the bisto adverts. only fatter. and less talented. <br /><br />the "film" has also been filmed by someone who is incapable of holding a camera even remotely still, and the number of mistakes throughout is amazing. the whole thing kicks off with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots on. yep.<br /><br />but anyways, we all know how terrible this thing is, so i'd like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the "film" provides. <br /><br />- when the fat guy sets the church on fire and then prances like a six year old girl across the car park to make his escape. hilarious.<br /><br />- mildread! no idea what relation she is to the main characters - sometimes they know her, sometimes they don't, but she pops up in a couple of scenes nonetheless. hilarious.<br /><br />- the stoned lawyer. already mentioned her, but she's so funny she's worth another mention.<br /><br />- the evil brothers dinner of crackers that he lays on for his guests.<br /><br />- the evil brother's anti-gay potion.<br /><br />- the evil brother's cats.<br /><br />- the ending, which i won't give away because it must be seen to be believed. i warn you though, make sure you're not eating at the time!!!! the tub of lard main character/director/producer gets naked. it's foul. <br /><br />basically, ben and arthur is indescribably bad, but unintentionally the most comical thing you'll see for a long time. literally, nothing is good about this excuse for a film, the goon of a director even manages to make the opening credits into a joke by writing his own name about 15 times.
