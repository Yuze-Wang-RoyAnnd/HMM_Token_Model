(avast, slight spoilers ahead) i got this tape from my local library, which keeps a copy for obvious reasons.<br /><br />i once went to the town of matewan, west virginia, and in a little museum there i saw the schedule for the town theatre citra may 1954. movies would change at the theatre each day. as there would be no tv for another decade or so in those parts, this was much of the available entertainment in the town. "the raid" seems to have been made for towns like matewan in the 1950's. although it wasn't listed for that month, i am sure showed there some monday or tuesday night for an audience which probably wasn't too demanding. the historical raid - daring and remarkably successful - didn't seem to have been very well researched, so the movie is full of hollywood embellishments, including a loose cannon played by lee marvin. marvin uses the opportunity to practice being liberty valance. and st. albans seems to have had more yankee soldiers coming and going through the town than washington d.c. had.<br /><br />what really made me snicker was when the raiders change into their confederate uniforms. only in tacky civil war paintings do rebel uniforms look so pristine. when anne bancroft's son catches van heflin in his uniform just before the raid, i expected the boy to think it was halloween.<br /><br />and then there's anne bancroft herself. while watching the movie i actually looked on the imdb to see if there was a second anne bancroft. the then-studio contract actress looks nothing like in her later films, and has none of the presence she would later have in "the miracle worker," "agnes of god," and of course "the graduate."<br /><br />worth seeing if only 1). you live in st. albans and 2). you have a couple hours to kill on a hollywood fictionalization of your home town's biggest news story.
