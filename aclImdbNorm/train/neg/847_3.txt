the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike - but are not in any way expect for being smart - one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code. geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title.<br /><br />i honestly didn't like the style of the movie. i believe that anxiety, confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose, but what i don't get is why there is so much of it. the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all. it gives the comic book like experience. however it's visually numbing the viewer, it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs, monotonic scenes, dynamic cut, music and abrupt noises.<br /><br />the movie's storyline is very simple, most of what's going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes, mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cuts.<br /><br />i will say openly that this movie didn't meet my expetations a tiny bit.
