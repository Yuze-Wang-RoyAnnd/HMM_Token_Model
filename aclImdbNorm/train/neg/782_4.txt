outside of the fact that george lopez is a pretentious jerk, his show is terrible.<br /><br />nothing about lopez has ever been funny. i have watched his stand-up and have never uttered any resemblance to a laugh.<br /><br />his stuff comes across as vindictive and his animosity towards white people oozes out of every single pore of his body.<br /><br />i have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them.<br /><br />this guy has a grudge that won't end.<br /><br />i feel bad for hispanics who have only this show to represent themselves.<br /><br />the shows plots are always cookie cutter with an hispanic accent.<br /><br />canned laugh at the dumbest comments and scenes.<br /><br />might be why this show is always on at 2am in replay.
