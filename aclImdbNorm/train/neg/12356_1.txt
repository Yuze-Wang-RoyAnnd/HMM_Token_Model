watching this movie was a waste of time. i was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie, but i resisted. i don't know what ridley scott intended, but i learned that in the army, women get as stupid as men. they learn to spit, to insult and to fight in combat, and that's also a waste of time (in my opinion). and, anyway, what the hell was that final scene in lybia? are they still fighting gadafi or is it that it's easy for everyone to believe islamic people are always a danger?
