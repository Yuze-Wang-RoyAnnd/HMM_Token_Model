yet another "son who won't grow up" flick, and just the other recent like entries. heder in another bad wig, channeling napoleon for, what, the third time? anna faris is forgettable, as always; jeff daniels phoned this one in from another state, at least; and diane keaton...how does one become typecast this late in a career? do not bother. nothing is said here that hasn't been covered many times over. i will say this; it's about a hundred times better than "failure to launch". there are very few amusing bits in the movie, unless you think eli wallach cursing is funny. ha, ha! he's old and he dropped the f-bomb! tee, hee, hee. pitiful!
