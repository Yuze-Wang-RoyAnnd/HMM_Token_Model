the broken is part of the after dark horrorfest iii. not a slasher or filled with gore. plenty of broken glass and mirrors in this edgy thriller from france and writer/director sean ellis. a successful radiologist gina mcvay(lena headly)inters a strange world as her life seems to spiral out of control. while attending her father's(richard jenkins)birthday party, the guests are stunned when a mirror crashes to the floor for no obvious reason. things get really strange when she witnesses a woman that is the spitting image of herself driving down a london street in a car identical to her own. gina sneaks to her doppelganger's apartment and finds a photo of herself with her father. she drives away and is involved in a head on collision. then mysteriously her boyfriend is not the same; to be exact family and friends are not easy for her to trust. is gina beside herself? is she in a parallel world? her nightmares become more horrific...is she broken?<br /><br />kudos if you can figure this one out...it won't be easy. editing couldn't be any tighter. lighting is questionable. other players: melvil poupard, william armstrong, michelle duncan and ulrich thomsen.
