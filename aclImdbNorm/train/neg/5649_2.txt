i don't think this is too bad of a show under the right conditions. i tolerated the first season.<br /><br />unfortunately, this is a show about lawyers who aren't really lawyers. god forbid anybody actually go to law school based on these shows, which i had heard was the case when i watched some interviews of the show. it just made me gag a bit.<br /><br />that aside, spader and shatner, who are supposed to be the stars of the show, are the most annoying. while this might be a compliment in some situations, it's certainly not here. their constantly harassing the women on the show is funny at first. but since that's what they're doing literally all the time, i've realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get. trying to intersperse some serious, dramatic, and even tear-jerking moments in the middle of this mockery of a real show fails to compensate for the progressive loss of interest i've been experiencing trying to enjoy the show.<br /><br />alan shore's flamboyant and gratuitous "public service announcements" where he spouts off his opinions do not impress. denny crane is just annoying. i was embarrassed for him and for the writers of the show for crane's speech wearing a colonial outfit.<br /><br />i'm giving two stars because there are moments where i thought the show's attempts to deal with some contemporary issues were done with care.<br /><br />i think the show's writers became aware that the sexual harassment displayed by denny and alan was getting overbearing even to those who were more inviting of them from the start. the thing is, i don't care if the sexual harassment treatment in the show is done well, but i just felt that the writer was insulting me with artificially implanting sexual banters all over the show in the hopes that my libido will keep me coming back for more. i'm not a teenager anymore, and i think this show is promising if its goal wasn't to cater to the lowest common denominator to get ratings.<br /><br />of course, i'm writing this after i realized that it's really not gonna get much better than this. it's a shame because it's one of those shows i'd love to love.
