i enjoyed "american movie", so i rented chris smith's first film, which i thought was a documentary too. in the first minute i saw that it wasn't, but i gave it a go.<br /><br />what a dead end film. being true-to-life hardly serves you if you're merely going to examine tediousness, esp. tediousness that we're already familar with.<br /><br />i'm sorry, but will it come as a relevation to anyone that 1) a lot of jobs suck and 2) most of them are crappy, minimum wage jobs in the service sector??? i knew that before i saw the film. it didn't really provide an examination of that anyway, as while the film struggles to feel "real" (handheld camera, no music, etc.), what's going on hardly plays out as it would in the "real world."<br /><br />would an employer be so cheerful to randy when he picks up his check, after randy quit on him after 3 days when the guy said he expected him to stay 6 months?? or the day after abandoning his job (and screwing up the machine he was working on), that everyone would be so easy on him??<br /><br />a big problem is our "hero"(?), randy. this guy is a loser. not because he's stuck in these jobs, or has a crummy apartment, or looks like one. he's a dope. he doesn't pay attention or even really try at these jobs. he has zero personalty. if i had to hire someone, he wouldn't make it past the interview.<br /><br />i'm looking forward to what chris smith does next, but guys, knock off the "this-is-an-important-film" stuff. "american job" doesn't work.
