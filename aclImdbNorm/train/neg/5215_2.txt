it's the same old, "if i can't get the funding for my project, i'll inject myself" monster movie. there is nothing new here. it's a lot like the jeff goldblum "fly" movie. the man manages to keep some semblance of sanity, but eventually succumbs to the effects of his experiments. the acting is pretty bad. there are people acting stupidly all along the way, putting their lives in danger for no apparent reason. the guy keeps going back to the lab he has been forbidden to enter. then there's his relationship with a young woman and her son. admittedly, he is good looking, but he seems like a lot of trouble. it's just a pretty big waste of time. even his tyrannosaurus suit looks like it came off the rack at a star trek convention.
