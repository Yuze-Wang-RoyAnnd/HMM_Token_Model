this film was done in really poor taste. the script was really bad. i feel really sad for the late gregory peck who took on the title role of this b-movie adaptation of one of history's greatest generals. the movie was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought the japanese in world war 2. there was a scene where i almost vomited, it showed macarthur in a bunker in corregidor island talking to the troops like a seasoned politician when he comes across a wounded, one legged filipino soldier. the soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says : `no papa, no mama, no uncle sam' and macarthur gives his little pep talk that americans `would never abandon' the philippines. the scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by macarthur's words and gives him a smart salute. i mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the u.s. as the great white savior of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake. it showed that filipinos are damsels in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great americans solely for redemption. it blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions of the members of the usaffe (united states armed forces of the far east), these are filipino volunteers that were integrated in the us military during world war 2, who died side by side with the americans fighting the japanese, who walked side by side with americans in the death march of bataan and defended corregidor island by launching a guerilla offensive after macarthur left for australia with his famous `i shall return' speech. my late grandfather, a filipino world war 2 veteran and usaffe soldier was one of the many who fought the japanese with honor and love for the home country. i think this movie does not give honor to them and to the thousands of others that macarthur relied on for intelligence preparations for his famous return in the leyte gulf landing.
