a question for you : a family go to a new house and get stalked by demonic forces . which film am i talking about ? every horror film you`ve seen ? yes that`s true but that`s not the answer i`m looking for . i`ll narrow it down by saying there`s a lot of teen angst scenes . doesn`t help ? well there`s lots of bits where the characters are stalked by a creature and you see the characters through the creature`s pov . no futher forward ? okay there`s a dream sequence involving lots of blood ? could still be any horror film you say . oh gawd this could take weeks so i`ll say the film i`m talking about features loads of aussies many of whom have appeared in neighbours and home and away . yes that`s right the film is the third circle ( aka cubbyhouse ) and do you understand what the above exercise is about ? it`s about me pointing out how the third circle is absolutely no different from any horror film that`s been made
