i just saw this film tonight and i have to say that it's a mess. i love vince vaughn but he ends up more annoying that funny here and the film is more than less a remake of the crappy 80's classic " santa claus the movie" but with out the camp or the bad sheena easton song at the end. .the story is your run of the mill black sheep in the family who comes back to face his family for the holidays kind of thing but with north pole as its setting. of course fred (vince vaughn) is the family screw up who comes home after a series of set backs that include his girlfriend (rachel weisz in a cameo role) dumping him, so he comes home to face his parents and his more successful brother santa claus (paul giamatti) and wacky high jinks follow with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of anarky as well that threatens all of christmas. now if you think you know the ending of this film, i think you would be right because it's predicable to the hill. as for the acting, vince vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays but this time he ends up more annoying than likable, miranda richardson plays mrs. claus but the role is more than less one note, elizabeth banks plays santa's assistant but she's not much of a character at all other than a neurotic joke and poor kevin spacey ends up basically playing the same person he plays in the film "glengarry glen ross" but a little more anal. the only two actors who come out of this film with their dignity intact is paul giamatti, who brings a real sincerity and warmed to his role as santa claus but he looks somewhat embarrass to be in the movie and you can't blame him and rachel weisz, who manages to do a lot more with a very small role than most of the main actors do with theirs, which is a shame because both rachel weisz and paul giamatti deserved a lot better than what this script gave them.<br /><br />to put it in a nutshell, a major disappointment.
