totally forgettable. specially because of the weak acting. this is the first movie i've seen with dax shepard. to my surprise, he's been around since the late 90's. i thought he was a newcomer, since his acting was so bland. i could say the same about liv tyler. although i've seen her do well in other movies, she gave clare cooper a strange personality. liv is not the kind of actress that will give the character a fiery, emotional personality like diane keaton would be able to, but it was pretty strange to see her say her lines in whisper mode. it seemed that altogether there simply wasn't a very good chemistry going on between the actors, and i think diane keaton sensed that as well. she's a fantastic actress, but seemed just a bit over the top in this movie. it felt like she just wanted to get this movie over as soon as possible. i wouldn't blame her.
