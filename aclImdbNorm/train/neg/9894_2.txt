i missed the beginning of this film, which might account for why i disliked it so much. on the other hand i've studied the fall of the roman republic for years so i know the story. then again, that might also be the reason why i disliked this film.<br /><br />the film has more historical inaccuracies than extras. though it's so inaccurate that i don't think they made an attempt for it to be correct, in which case it can be forgiven. the odd thing is that they sometimes go to great lengths to be historically accurate that it ends up getting confusing. like throwing in antonius' marriage to octavia, and then pushing it aside two scenes later. why even bring it up if it serves no purpose for the plot and octavia is never even seen? and like calling antonius by his actual name (marcus antonius) in some scenes, and by his strange english name mark antony in other scenes.<br /><br />though historical inaccuracies aside, the film could still have been an entertaining watch if it wasn't for the leading lady. there isn't an ounce of dignity in her. she's hysterical, dramatical, and completely lacking control of herself. instead of being a clever and composed queen cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of pms. 95% of that comes from the poor acting, but 5% is also from poor script writing. far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written into the script. sometimes you weren't watching antonius and cleopatra, you were watching immature versions of dawson and joey from "dawson's creek".<br /><br />if you want to watch something about this period, watch... anything but this.
