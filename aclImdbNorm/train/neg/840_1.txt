i agree totally with the last commenter this could be the worst movie ever made .i too had to fast forward through most of this movie. michael madsen must have done this movie as a favor to someone.the picture quality is grainy all the way through .and what little plot there is,is just plain stupid .i give this movie a 1 out of 10 if i could give it a lower score i would .don't waste your time on this movie or you'll regret it.
