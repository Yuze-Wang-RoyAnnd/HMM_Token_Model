and so the great rewriting of history continues hollywood style.<br /><br />this was senseless ridiculous rubbish.<br /><br />its shocks me that such an amazing amount of money can be spent to produce what is the most contrived, poorly acted inaccurate film i have ever seen. it is appalling.<br /><br />nic cage's brief flirtation with serious acting appears to be over. i can only assume that leaving las vegas was a glitch in an otherwise litany of dreadful films.<br /><br />diane kruger proves that her performance in troy was no fluke, she really can't act.<br /><br />harvey keitel should be ashamed of himself for working on such tripe.<br /><br />only recommended for those either recovering from a recent lobotomy or people of an opinion that america invented the world.
