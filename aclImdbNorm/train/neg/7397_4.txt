i've seen this film several times in a variety of short-film festivals and it always causes me the impression that i have seen a movie trailer! <br /><br />for a school-film is very well produced and directed, but the story... well it needed something else to be a bigger and interesting film. the character named tim watcher needed some in-dept approach. this is something that lacks in some portuguese short films - the script is always superficial.<br /><br />but still... i liked this movie...<br /><br />parabens! (congratulations!)
