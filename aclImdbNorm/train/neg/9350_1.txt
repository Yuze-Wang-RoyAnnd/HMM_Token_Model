this movie was terrible. the first half hour is much like a... well, apologies for the lack of articulation, but it was simply a bad version of a clockwork orange. the first scene is almost photocopied from one of the first in clockwork! supposedly it was a tribute, as per the appearance of the clockwork poster on the protagonist's wall, however "ripoff" is the more appropriate word. the movie felt as though it was torn right from the kubrick classic, only filmed through a new director's eyes. a blind director. unfortunately when it stops its massacre of kubrick's work, the film gets even worse. as another commentator said, the deepness of this film is just shoved down your throat. arrogant, self absorbed and ultimately meaningless drivel.<br /><br />perhaps the protagonists ramblings would touch a nerve if there was any actual character development in this movie. i felt absolutely nothing for this guy. and i'm an alcoholic, so i figure that if anyone might be able to feel anything for him, it would be me. awful character development, dialogue and plot.<br /><br />the worst part about this movie is the title. for a film called "16 years of alcohol", the alcoholism is hardly a factor in the flick. see first paragraph - it was such a butchering of a clockwork orange i can't get over it. a more suited title would have been "16 years of violence," or, even better, "a clockwork banana".<br /><br />just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. if you disregard my advice and take it out anyway, drink. trust me.
