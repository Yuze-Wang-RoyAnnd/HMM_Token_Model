dr mordrid is terrifying. i would not recommend any adult or child see this unless they are rampaging murderers already. there is so much filth in this movie it hurts my yes. speaking of eyes, there are eyes in the sky, against a backdrop of stars. only the devil himself could have imagined such a wicked thing. i rented out every copy i could from local video stores and crushed them with a 5 pound crucifix. that movie should remain locked in a cellar behind the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting beasts of hell. that is where this movie belongs. i suggest if you want some scandalous entertainment, go and rent all dogs go to heaven, or angels in the outfield. those movies are worth seeing. if you want to commit a sin and love terrible movies, you need to see dr. mordrid.
