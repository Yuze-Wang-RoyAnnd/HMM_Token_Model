just the fact that the cover is a drawing, like those old b-movies should give you a warning about the quality of this movie. this is, however not a b-movie. it is a d-movie! <br /><br />there are no known actors, and the animals - wow - it is the worst data-animation ever made during the last two decades. <br /><br />you hardly ever see the scaaary sabretooth shown on the front cover. you just hear people scream, bleed and die and you occasionally see a teeth or a tiger-paw. it's so amateur! maybee worth seeing, just because it's so bad. give it to a friend and say: "this is the best movie i have ever seen, and wait for their reaction" he, he. <br /><br />the movie is to weak to give it a spoiler alert! this is a spoiler.
