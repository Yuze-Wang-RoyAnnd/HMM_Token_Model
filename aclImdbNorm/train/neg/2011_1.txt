this movie is pure guano. mom always said if you can't say anything nice... but even mom would say i had to do my part to warn others of this movie.<br /><br />i can guarantee this is the film that geoffrey rush wishes would just go away. i would hope that greg kinnear fired his agent..from a cannon for giving him the script. after this ben stiller is probably praying for someone to pitch "there's still something about mary." i have always been a fan of wes studi's, thank whatever you hold holy that he wore a mask through the film so maybe people won't identify the film with him.<br /><br />it starts of promisingly with a stylistic spoof of the cinematography of the batman films and then just loses something...like a coherent plot and half decent effects.<br /><br />the jokes are telegraphed an hour before the punchline comes, and even then they fall flat. if you want to see an effective spoof of the comic book world see "chasing amy".<br /><br />run! don't walk away from "mystery men"!
