first let me preface this post by saying that i am a fan of the original star wars movies...i don't read the books, play the games, wear the underwear or eat the cereal (if there is one). i am simply a fan of the films.<br /><br />with that being said, i struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise. taking this movie by itself, and not comparing it to it's terrible predecessors (ep 1, 2), i don't understand how you can say this is an amazing movie. for all of the terrible shortcomings in the script - cheesy dialogue, contrived scenes (ie r2 suddenly being a badass, and long cgi intense chase scenes that have little human touch), horrible acting, and noted plot holes...how is this good? there was no real internal dilemma within anakin; it just seemed like a switch was flipped and he was evil all of a sudden. i was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so (which by the way was ruined by the "noooooo!" frankenstein scene). when you bombard the screen with intensely amazing cgi effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious one-liners when more could have and should have been said, this is not a great movie. for a film with such a "dark" tone, there was too much levity in the speech of all characters.<br /><br />i close with a question: from the beginning to the end of the film, was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place?
