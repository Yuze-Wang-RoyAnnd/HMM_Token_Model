where was his critique of democratic administrations as well as republican ones? after all he did serve for 17+ years in a body of government where his influence was unwaivering. oh i forgot about the 8 years he was the 2nd in command of the most powerful nation on earth. the film is happy to show shots of a young senator gore asking why a nasa scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific paper, but fails to ask about the complicity of clinton/gore in global warming. probably too close to an election year, or maybe it would hurt the chances for hillary in '08. either way he's a political coward and party man to the bitter end. he offers no criticism of consumerism, no criticism of capitalism, no way to is the history of the industrial development which has led us to this point in time <br /><br />in the end this film was much more about mr. gore himself than about any real problems our environment faces. mr. gore if you really wanted to make a campaign film - shorten it & call it what it really is.
