if you can imagine mickey mouse as a new york street pimp, or john wayne as a communist spy, then you might believe pat boone as a juvenile delinquent on his uncle's farm in kentucky and you could conceivably enjoy this movie.<br /><br />this film is so stupid that it isn't even campy for a mid 1950s sexless love story. and the problem is that hollywood made such a big deal about pat boone's refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he won't kiss shirley jones so you cannot build any anticipation for the "screen consummation" of their love. it's sort of like watching a western in which the cowboys don't have guns.<br /><br />the story is pointless. even the title song is sung with pained enthusiasm.<br /><br />april love belongs in the worst film bargain bin along with ishtar and plan 9 from outer space.
