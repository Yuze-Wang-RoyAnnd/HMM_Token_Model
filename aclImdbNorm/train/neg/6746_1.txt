*spoilers included*<br /><br />with a title like "bleed", you know the creative juices weren't running on high when this puppy was conceived. the movie is your basic run-of-the-mill low-budget slasher movie. oh sure, it tries to be creative with the premise of the "murder club", but we learn that was just a joke anyways. okay, for those who really care about these things, the basic plot is that new girl in town starts dating her co-worker. he invites her into his circle of friends, and at a party, they tell her how they have a "murder club" and they murder people, blah blah blah. well, we learn that it was all a joke, but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage. now, the "members" of the murder club are being killed one by one. oh, and the bad guys wins and the movie ends on a downer. by that time, you won't really care though.<br /><br />in retrospect, the first 10 or so minutes of this movie make no sense. the motivation for the killings in the beginning of the movie is never explained. i would say that it was a way for the director to pad out the film, but on the dvd there are deleted scenes! i'm not sure why anyone would want to see more than the feature length version of "bleed", but apparently the people behind the dvd thought the viewers would be clamoring for more. on the box, it says there are easter eggs, but why the hell i would want to waste my time looking for extras on this movie is beyond me. <br /><br />i was expecting a bad movie, and "bleed" delivered on that front. it wasn't a fun bad movie though. everyone looks good in the movie, and there's plenty of nudity, but the acting is just awful. my least favorite character is the guy who ends up being the killer...i think he's supposed to be funny and amusing, but he just ends up coming off as a tool. i think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking garage, in a hilariously unconvincing death. heroine shoves the women into the parking garage cement pole, and the woman looks like she barely hits the thing, and she spits out a mouthful of blood, and "dies". <br /><br />for those who think that movie making is an intricate, creative process done by professionals, check out "bleed". it will change your mind, and you'll realize any hack get can a movie made. <br /><br />otherwise, don't waste your time or money on this.
