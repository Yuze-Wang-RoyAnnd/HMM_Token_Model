the one thing that occurred to me after watching this drivel, was i would never get the time i used to watch this, back again. if you want to see stacey keach and michael dorn try and earn what must have been then, the down payments on a holiday home then stay tuned. wooden acting, poor special effects, the only comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is over as soon as she has done her obligatory b-movie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie. the opportunity to have made what could have been a decent movie disappears the moment nicole eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds, whilst the police, military and joe public don't cotton on that the woman drinking coffee, dosn't use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once. she must obviously be from another planet. just where i wish i was when this movie was on.
