the original "les visiteurs" was original, hilarious, interesting, balanced and near perfect. lv2 must be a candidate for "worst first sequel to a really good film". in lv2 everyone keeps shouting, when a gag doesn't work first it's repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny. lv2 is a horrible parody of lv1, except of course that a parody should be inventive. if you loved lv1 just don't see this film, just see lv1 again!!
