ugh, what can i say other than, ugh. i rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original vampires. this movie could not have been any lamer. lacking not only in plot, but the acting is atrocious. combined with some obvious plot holes makes this movie a very hard one to watch. many times i questioned my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had jumped the shark. here's a sampling of the lamer aspects...<br /><br />***spoilers***<br /><br />professional "slayer" insists on sleeping outdoors by himself at night. he wakes up to a woman crying, sitting no more than 3 feet from him in the middle of nowhere. he immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance. she goes from crying to seducing him, and he lets it happen with obvious results...<br /><br />one of the main characters is zoe, was bitten by a vampire, but as long as she takes these "experimental pills" she got in mexico city, she's fine, although her body temperature is below room temperature...<br /><br />guard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires, hero leaves the next day. he then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left...<br /><br />...avoid this movie.
