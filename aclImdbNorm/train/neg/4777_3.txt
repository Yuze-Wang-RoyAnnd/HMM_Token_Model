the idea behind this film was a good one. too bad it wasn't written well. casting sidney poitier as the fbi agent was a good idea, and he did an outstanding job. tom berenger, on the other hand, only knows one emotion in most of his movies, anger. kirstie alley's character could have been a great one, and even showed some possibilities once, but the writer really let us down by making her role mostly a helpless female. this was completely inconsistent with the strongly independent character she was supposed to be. i don't care for alley's acting anyway. the movie should have ended about fifteen minutes sooner than it did. the director milked the cow dry before the unbelievable final action. i will keep this in my collection only as an example of poitier's performances.
