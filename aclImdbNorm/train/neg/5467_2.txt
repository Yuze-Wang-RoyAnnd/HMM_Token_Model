what to say about this movie. well it is about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and turn into delinquent students that sell more of the bad drugs to people. two of those people have adverse effects as one turns into a toxic avenger type and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the school's basement. that is about all there is to it and they stretch it out for 84 minutes. this movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever. though that is not fair, some people like troma's movies and they can watch it if they want. troma movies for me though, are the worst movies there are out there. i just watched this one out of morbid curiosity.
