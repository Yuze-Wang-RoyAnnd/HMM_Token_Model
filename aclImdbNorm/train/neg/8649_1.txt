this movie fails miserably on every level. i have an idea, let's take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east. maybe if we're lucky they'll all be shot and killed and we won't have to ever have our time wasted by them again. did i mention that i have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life? my god, i can't think of anything i've ever seen that was this bad. i'd rather watch ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film. if i ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film, i'll spit in their face and then beat them senseless. that's my two cents.
