i remember this movie when i was 13 (seems a lot of reviews are saying the same thing age 13!) with a group of school buddies. we all wanted to see billy crystal in his first movie, and fell for the typical commercial ads telling us this was a great comedy. we suffered through about 45 minutes of it, and all agreed to leave the theater. it was grotesque & tasteless, and a far cry from the ability billy crystal had to make us laugh, we were not laughing. i stumbled upon this review by accident, and decided to register just to tell the rest of the world what a rot-gut waste of film this was, now if you rent this, you deserve what you get, you've been warned!!
