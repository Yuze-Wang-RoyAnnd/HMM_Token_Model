this movie was so very badly written. the characters had no depth. they should have never made a movie of this. my 11 yr old son could write a better screenplay then hyung-rae shim.<br /><br />the only actor that didn't suck was the zoo guard. he was the only funny and believable one of the lot.<br /><br />i love movies and try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this one was up there on my lame list at number 2. number 1 being demonicus.<br /><br />for those of you who actually thought this was a good movie, you are in serious need of brain surgery.<br /><br />most of the creatures in the movie weren't even dragons...so why did they call d-war?
