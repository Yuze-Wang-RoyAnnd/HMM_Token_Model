somebody could probably make a great documentary about the jerry springer show, but this fictionalized version merely succeeds in draining anything authentic and interesting out of the trash-tv phenomenon. there are dozens of famously bad movies (e.g. "manos: the hands of fate") that show more creativity and spirit than this dreary, witless waste of film.<br /><br />seriously, why not a documentary about the jerry springer show, that would begin to answer some of the real questions like: who are these people? what happens to their lives after they appear on this show? how did the mayor of cincinatti find himself here?<br /><br />one good line: during an "orientation" session for guests: "people, i can't emphasize this enough: no weapons!"
