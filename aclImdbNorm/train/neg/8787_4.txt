i first heard about white noise when i saw the tv advert. before then i didn't even know it existed. i watched the trailer online and decided that i would go and see it. now being a fan of films like the sixth sense, i thought that this film would give me everything i wanted. it has michael keaton in it, and he rocks. unfortunately the film did not deliver. it tried to be another sixth sense or stir of echoes, and failed miserably. it has a very promising start, but the middle just drags on repeating itself, and ends with a completely poor twist which any monkey could have figured out. unfortunately like most "scary" films nowadays it relies on loud noises and bangs to make the audience jump. this film could have been so much more. it's a shame because it was a good idea.
