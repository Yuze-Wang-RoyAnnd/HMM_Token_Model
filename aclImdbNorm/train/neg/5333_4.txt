a squashy slapstick mess posing as a comedy. elvis presley plays an indian bull-riding champ who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his folks' desert-spread in arizona, where government suits have just invested in the family's herd of cattle (which is in dire need of a stud). what director peter tewksbury is in dire need of is some narrative skills, though what he lacks in assessment he makes up for in sloppy comedic montages (his social commentary isn't exactly pointed, but tewksbury does have a satiric bend to his outlandishness and there are some funny scenes). despite colorful supporting turns by katy jurado and joan blondell, the general wackiness gets way out of hand, and there's too much hoopin' and hollerin' to sustain much interest. as for elvis, he's loose and frisky throughout--and while it's nice to see him having fun on-screen, one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point. this shambles of a picture has a distinct what-the-hell feel to it, and though spirits are high, the returns are mostly low. *1/2 from ****
