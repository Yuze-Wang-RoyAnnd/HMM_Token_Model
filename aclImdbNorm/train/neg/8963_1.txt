the killings in this movie isn't that bad, but for sure the movie is. it's even worse than that. it's not even worth the wear it might cause when you slide it into your dvd-player.<br /><br />not even the wear it causes on your shoulders carrying it from the dvd-store, not to speak of the money and time you spend renting and watching it. horrible.<br /><br />it's beyond understanding how anyone could say anything positive about this movie. it was just a bare masochistic tendency of mine that caused me not to stop watching, add to that the group pressure from my co-watchers.<br /><br />the manuscript is awful, the directing even worse and the acting is plain despicable.<br /><br />i hope you don't see this as a spoiling your fun, i'd rather see it as a fair warning: do not waste your time watching this garbage!
