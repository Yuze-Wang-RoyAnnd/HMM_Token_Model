i though this would be an okay movie, since i like zombies and horror movies in general. but i did not think it would be such a piece of sh!t like it was. the only zombie in the movie is at the beginning and he gets ran over by a god damn car!!! the movie looks to be written by a porn director and filled by porn actors, i wouldn't ever call them actors! the costumes seems to be stolen from a local school play. its seems like a road movie with almost no monsters. there is no fun at all in this piece of sh!t, only horror, but not in the way the director intended. i would rather be raped by a pedophile than see this movie ever again!!! ugh!
