**spoilers below!!!**<br /><br />cabin fever has my nod for worst film of the year...that i've seen that is. this movie is straight garbage! there is so much wrong with the film you can't help but be amazed at how bad it really is. this movie had so much potential to be good, but ultimately made nothing of it. the characters were as dumb as one can be; for the entire movie you're just asking yourself "why would you do that?" or "what's your point in doing this?"...this is how illogical and stupid the characters are. we get no background into them, so naturally you really don't give a rats as$ about their fate...you could only laugh at their stupidity. <br /><br />- the 'slut' (marcy) for instance... was she that horny that she had to sleep with paul (rider strong)? there was no point in that....its almost as if the filmmakers needed a excuse to give her the virus so voila! ugh. <br /><br />- would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from the faucet of a cabin without looking at it first?<br /><br />- why didn't bert just shoot the sick guy from the start? movie would've been over that way....besides, they ended up killing him anyway.<br /><br />- why did it take them so long to finally decide to leave the cabin, even if they had to walk? 'no, i'll just wait until 2 of my friends are infected (one a blink away from death) to finally opt to walk outta there.<br /><br />- what was exactly the reasoning behind paul's attempt to fish out the body of the hermit, only to fall in the contaminated reservoir and get infected with the virus? pure stupidity!<br /><br />i swear, common sense was not a friend, much less an aquaintance to these idiots. i don't think there has ever been a worse ending to a movie. in the beginning the kids ask the hick store cashier what the rifle was for, and he replied that 'its for the niggers'. in the end of the film, 3 young blacks (dressed in baggy clothes, one of them in a du-rag no less) go into the store....come to find out that the cashier was cleaning it for them to be used for hunting. then, he proceeds to give them all pounds and handshakes and joke around with them as if they're his homeboys.<br /><br />okay, what the hell was the point of that?!?!?!? how tasteless can one be, what were the filmmakers thinking putting that in the movie? i as a black man was of course offended by the initial 'nigger' comment. it was a tasteless, pointless remark. my question to the filmmakers: what was the point of the ending with the black kids? was that to force me to forget about the initial racist comment made earlier? to smooth things over with black viewers, by making a joke out of it? well, i for one, did not find that pathetic attempt at humor funny in the least bit. the whole movie was a joke....a pathetic attempt at filmmaking that shouldn't be given the time of day. peter jackson really thought this film was that good? what film was he looking at? <br /><br />zero * out of **** stars....if i could give it a lower rating i would. please, fellow imdb'ers, don't waste 1 1/2 hours of your precious life watching this abomination of a 'movie'. this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen.
