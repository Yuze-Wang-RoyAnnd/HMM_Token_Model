this mini-series is actually more entertaining than some others with much bigger budgets and grander aspirations. sotd falls somewhere between "kung-fu" and "h r pufnstuff" on the entertainment spectrum. if it weren't so long (nearly 3 hours) i think that kids would like it quite a bit. it's got adventure, action, "cliffhanger scenes", and not too much romance or other "icky" stuff. when you're young, you're not too critical of flexing rubber swords, campy acting, and scenes that are repeated. (at least two scenes are repeated identically in the movie, just as was done in old-time serials in order to bring the audience up to speed.) finally, kids are usually more accepting of american english dialogue coming out of the mouths of asian actors. (not to mention the fact that several of the leading roles are played by non-asian actors.) <br /><br />i was going to give this movie three stars, but i felt like the director, producers, and cast deserved some extra credit for at least carrying through on the project. this movie is not art, but, like painting your house, it actually took some time, effort, and discipline to get it made.<br /><br />overall, not a recommended use for your time, but it might keep the kids entertained while traveling in the mini-van.<br /><br />oh, yeah...hey, imdb! "dialogue" is the preferred and traditional spelling. your spell-checking seems to think that "dialog" is the proper spelling. while "dialog" is acceptable, both webster's and the oed consider it an alternative form.
