i can't understand all the hype about this movie. ok, if you like cheap splatter, you will love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors - don't watch this. personally i really disliked the actors in this movie, they seem to be hired straight from the street. the dialogs are completely flat and you always know what's coming up next. the overall quality of this movie lacks of the supposable very low budget. when we saw this movie (me and 3 other people) we all had in mind, that this movie was made by some people who needed to do this, just to get their graduation at a film school - with the lowest effort. another issue that really lessens the whole experience is the bad cam (very shaking) and the bad sound, the whole movie seems to be recored with a single microphone.
