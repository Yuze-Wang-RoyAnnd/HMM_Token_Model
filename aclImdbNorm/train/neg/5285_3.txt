somewhere, on this site, someone wrote that to get the best version of the works of jane austen, one should simply read them. i agree with that. however, we love adaptations of great literature and the current writers' strike brings to mind that without good writers, it's hard for actors to bring their roles to life. the current version of jane austen's persuasion shows us what happens when you don't have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation. this version does not compare to the 1995 version with amanda root and ciaran hinds, which was well acted and kept the essence of the era and the constraints on the characters (with the exception of the bizarre parade & kissing in the street scene in bath). the 2007 version shows a twitty anne who seems angst-ridden. the other characters were not very developed which is a crime, considering how austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen understatements. the sequence of events that made sense in the novel were completely tossed about, and mrs. smith, anne's bedridden and impoverished schoolmate is walking around in bath - - twittering away, as many of the characters seemed to do. the strength of character and the intelligence of captain wentworth, which caused anne to love him in the first place, didn't seem to be written into the rupert penry-jones' wentworth. ciaran hinds had more substance and was able to convey so much more with a look, than p-j was able to do with his poses. all in all, the 2007 version was a disappointment. it seemed to reduce the novel into a hand- wringing, costumed melodrama of debatable worth. if they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances into austen's work, they should have done what they do with adaptations of shakespeare: adapt it to the present. at least "bride & prejudice" was taken out of the historical & locational settings and was fun to watch, as was "clueless". this wasn't persuasion, but they didn't know what else to call it.
