i don't know what the oscar voters saw in this movie, but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture oscar. all i know is that fortunately there was gene kelly to play in it or this would have been twice as bad as i believe it is. first of all, i don't think leslie caron was really fit to play such a role. she isn't that talented, she isn't a great dancer and she's not good looking at all. it's a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if leslie caron hadn't been in this, it might have made a terrific movie. the story was intelligent, the directing wasn't bad, and, as i said, gene kelly was pretty good. now i'm not saying all this stuff about leslie caron just to criticize her, i'm just saying it because i think that's what the worse part of the movie is. she's probably a good actress but i can't tell because i haven't seen her in anything else but i think she was pretty bad in "an american in paris". so if you want to see it, go ahead but i'm telling you, you're way better off watching "singin' in the rain".
