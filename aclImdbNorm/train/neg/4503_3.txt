i admired rob marshall for chicago, but memoirs of geisha turns out to be yet another failure of combing western and asian arts. overall, the scene is beautiful, but after restless emphasis on exoticism-oriented scenes some might just find himself fed up with them. the excessive cherry blossom was, frankly, overdone. it's probably the cultural difference of perception here: the ultimate beauty is not the showy type, as truly beautiful geisha would not be the over westernised pumpkin in the movie. <br /><br />some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest flaws. as a taiwanese, i have no doubt the actress are great. an actor/actress can play any kind of role when he/she can look like it. gong li is great, but the power of emotions that she showed in this movie had not been translated into japanese style. all i saw was a bittersweet and jealous chinese woman. michlle yeoh, one of my favourtie actress, did not even look like a japanese. some comment has mentioned the peculiar delicate, feminine characteristics of japanese women, with which i can't agree more. these are so delicate that i assume not even all modern japanese actresses are eligible for the roles in geisha, let alone the two chinese and one malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know japanese culture that much.<br /><br />geisha is a good shot for arousing the curiosity of american audiences. but it would be an insult for the movie itself and for art alike if the movie wins the oscar for best costume, best director or best picture.
