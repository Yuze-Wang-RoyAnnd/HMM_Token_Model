i happen to have bought one of those "legacy of horror" 50 movie pack collections and would you believe i'm still looking through them to find a good horror movie in it. sometimes you find an enjoyable yet campy one like the devil's messenger or the devil bat, or one of the great alfred hitchcock's films (some aren't horror however and are only on there because hitchcock directed some horrors and suspense) but other times it seems that they put movies like the island monster and this on because they can't accept the fact they would easily be forgotten and should be for that matter.<br /><br />so we open up to sort of a westing game idea. the rich yet cruel and abusive father played by carradine (the one standing feature of this) has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who he still hates. carradine gives a good enough performance as always, but he's left mainly in a voice recording and flashback sequences leaving us to sit through the mediocre/terrible performances. the rest of the cast either overacts or underacts in scenes. given this was an independent film of the 70's the lighting and effects are pretty limited. it's hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer can't see what's happening that well in some scenes. some actors like the servants igor and elga give an effort at least and i'm ashamed to admit kind of left me chuckling at the end mainly for the sheer stupidity but still with some very minor happiness that they pulled some version of a twist to an otherwise pretty obvious who-done-it but not enough to enhance the quality of the film. you aren't meant to like the characters as they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic, but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many unwatchable. the death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there. it proves that you would probably enjoy the 20 movie pack "chilling" containing films like house on a haunted hill, little shop of horror's with jack nicholson, and night of the living dead over it. this is best avoided.
