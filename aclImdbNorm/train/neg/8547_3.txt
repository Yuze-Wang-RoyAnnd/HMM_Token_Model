this was a fairly creepy movie; i found the music to be effective for this. the photographs mario took of the village were also unnerving. however, i had three problems with this film. one is that the lighting was very dark so some of the time it was hard to tell what was going on, but this may have just been my copy. the second is that the very beginning is not explained very well and i'm still not sure what was going on there. the third problem is that i didn't understand the ending, but apparently some people do. of course there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things, and the male lead is very 70s. all in all, watchable but not even close to being a favorite.
