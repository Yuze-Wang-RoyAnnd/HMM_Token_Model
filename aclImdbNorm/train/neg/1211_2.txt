the only redeeming qualities this movie has are the fairly original death scenes. other than that this movie is a big dud. we have kim basinger, the beleaguered housewife slowly meandering thru the local mall for the first 30 min. of the movie, which added nothing. then the movie picks up a bit as she has a confrontation with 4 punks who took up 2 parking spaces on this busy xmas eve. they begin to chase her after offing the local security guard who tried to help her. from there this movie gets worse, way worse. i know its only a movie and you've gotta go with the flow but she's got about a 5 min. headstart and she can't hide or find someone to help her. instead she drives to a half built subdivision beside a forest. in typical fashion she does everything she can to allow her followers to easily track her. but now she turns into one tough mofu. you get the point. do not under any circumstances buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this type. it's so illogical you'll be questioning every scene. it is embarrassing for basinger and craig sheffer and the rest of the cast, as well as the consumers.
