this is just a bad movie. with what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better. it almost were. with the heroine beautiful almost like salma hayek, hero fighting almost like jackie chan, battles and duels almost like in crouching tiger..., music almost like in, say, conan... etc. almost. but in the end it's just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it. maybe apart of john rhys-davies flying in duel like those warriors in hero or before-mentioned crouching tiger... i am really ashamed of poor old john. he is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better. so as you - so if you still have a chance just watch something else.
