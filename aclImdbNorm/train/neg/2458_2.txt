i cant describe how terrible this movie is. am i the only one here who finds the way its animated totaly disgusting? the men of rohan look 100% fake with their poorly colored hair, that doesnt even come close to matching what the actors look like. the orcs looked terrible. why does gandalf walk with a bad limp? why cant they pronounce things correctly? saruman isnt aruman. there were other what sounded like terrible pronounciation*sp* of tolkiens characters. all and all im glad the studio who made this pulled the plug out from the sequal, it was just a terrible terrible adaptaion. go watch the hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon of tolkiens work. hell, even the cartoon version of rotk is better then this dribble. 2/10
