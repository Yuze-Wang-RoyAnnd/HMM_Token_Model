this movie is now my gauge against which all other movies will be compared...as in, "was it as stupid as revolver?" i too was in the toronto international film festival audience last night where a room filled with over 2000 people walked out in an eerie silence after being absolutely dumbstruck by 2 hours of sheer nonsense. jason stratham would have been amazing if only he had a purpose. within the first 10 minutes he's given a proposition by andre 3000 and big pussy (of soprano's fame) which makes no sense at all! then there's some shooting and then there's ray liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs, then there's some animation, ray liotta's naked butt, lots of shooting, teeth gnashing, art house wanna be pretensions and more of liotta's embarrassing body that elicited laughs at every showing...which i'm not quite sure was the reaction he was looking for...not 5 times anyway. everyone in this movie thinks they're smarter than the average bear and guy ritchie thinks he's yogi bear incarnate. the story lines might have went nowhere but the posturing was outta sight! the only way this movie could have been worse is if madonna herself was in it.
