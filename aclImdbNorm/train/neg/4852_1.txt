i saw this movie once, and i thought it was ok. then my friends at work said "watch it again, it's better". so i did. and to my surprise, it was worse on the second time! there's a word limit, so i'm going to get the ball rolling here.<br /><br />-the bombing scenes were all so stupid. why on earth would anyone wait to trigger the explosion??? -none of the characters here are even remotely likable. not on the first time, not even the second.<br /><br />-oh, and last time i checked, a car does not explode from a single gun shot, nor can a fire that huge be put out with a tiny fire extinguisher... did the above 3/10 viewers actually watch the movie??? -the camera is so shaky, i can barely tell what is going on. that opening scene with the robot had my stomach off-put, the rest of the movie was not much better.<br /><br />-the sniper scene. the mcmanus brothers (from "the boondock saints") would roll their eyes, it was so stupid. first off, why did the guy plant his gun where one person had gotten shot? furthermore, why would he spend that much time cleaning the bullets, reloading, aiming and not get shot, when there was so much chaos going on around him? -sas types running instead of staying and fighting back?????? huh????? are the soldiers... gay...??? i didn't mean to sound homophobic, but honestly, that scene was so ridiculous.<br /><br />-too long for its own good, yet too short for the amount of material crammed into it. bigelow seems to think that the more action, the better. looks like she is wrong- the movie is full of superfluous action scenes thrown in there to distract you from the lack of a central plot. i know watchmen is longer at 163 minutes, but at least that movie didn't drag. this movie, on the other hand, does, and for it, feels longer.<br /><br />the only good thing was renner, who was satisfactory at best. but do yourself a favour, just skip this, and don't give into the hype.
