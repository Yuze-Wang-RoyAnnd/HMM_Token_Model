that's right, you heard me this movie is a freaking' abomination. first off, the band, who the hell is going to go see or listen to a band called "the naked brothers band"?!?! not only is the name terrible but so are the musicians, they can't even play anything! also, the lead singer sounds more girly than geddy lee, and even more his voice is horrible! not only are they terrible musicians but they're terrible actors. led by a crappy director and thin plot, this has got to be the dumbest movie ever. i wish this website would let you use a vote of zero or below out of 10, because giving this filth a 1/10 is being way too generous.<br /><br />i'm not sure that you can call this a comedy film. if you're looking for comedy with music, go to that "weird al" yankovic guy 'cause he does it a whole lot better than these untalented tweens.
