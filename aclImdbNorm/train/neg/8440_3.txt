for those fans of laurel and hardy, the 1940s and beyond were a very sad time for the team. their contracts with hal roach studios had expired and now they were "free agents"--able to work for any studio who offered them a job. unfortunately, fox, rko, mgm (without roach) and even a french film company who hired the boys had absolutely no touch for their comedic talents. plus, stan and ollie were a lot older and seeing these geriatric men taking pratfalls seemed sad, not particularly funny. stan looked very ragged and ollie's weight had ballooned up to the point where he could barely walk--and so it made me feel uncomfortable laughing at their very, very sedate antics.<br /><br />in addition to their age, this particular film suffers because fox studios oddly cast them in a supporting role and created a parallel plot involving a young couple--something that reduced their time on screen and turned them into insipid "hangers on" instead of just being themselves. a cute and cuddly stan and ollie is very foreign to the old laurel and hardy of the 20s and 30s--and just seemed awfully strange and suited them poorly.<br /><br />now even with their age, this could have been a decent movie if it had been given decent writing and if it appeared the studio cared--and it's quite obvious they were using the "b unit" here--with, at best, second class support. in particular, there are very few laughs and the last 10 minutes of the film is simply dreadful--relying exclusively on a sloppy rear-projected screen for the stupid chase scene--which might just rank as one of the worst of its kind in film history.<br /><br />for mind-numbed zombie lovers of laurel and hardy, it's probably a film they will love. but, for lovers of the team who are willing to honestly evaluate this film relative to their amazing earlier films, it simply comes up wanting indeed. in fact, of all their full-length films pre-1940, i can't think of one i liked less than dancing masters. unfortunately, of the post-1940 films, this might just be one of their better ones. sadly, it got a lot worse--with wretched films like the big noise and nothing but trouble. i just wish the boys had just retired after saps at sea.<br /><br />finally, i wonder if all the generally positive reviews for this film on imdb might reflect the reviewers' love of the team more than it's an indication that this is a good film? for an audience who are not already in love with the team, i don't know how this film will do anything but bore the audience--it certainly won't convince anyone that laurel and hardy were comedic geniuses. but even comedic geniuses need material worthy of their talents.
