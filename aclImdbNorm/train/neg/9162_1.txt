the only reason that this movie is rated a 1 is that zero is not one of the selection options. with a plot thinner than depression era cabbage soup, horrific acting, and special effects that look like they came out of the "thunderbirds" tv series, it is amazing that widmark didn't kill the director for putting this black mark on his resume. even by 1950's standards, the special effects are atrocious, except for a couple of underwater submarine sequences. i can only assume that it was nominated for best special effects because, except for 20,000 leagues under the sea and them!, there wasn't anybody else doing effects. it was certainly no contest for disney that year if this was their only competition. i wouldn't recommend the film, even for hard core submarine movie buffs, as the most realistic scene on the submarine was limited to one shot where seawater can be seen dribbling down the up-raised periscope. there are other, much better, sub films that you can enjoy from this era, like the aforementioned 20,000 leagues or torpedo run.
