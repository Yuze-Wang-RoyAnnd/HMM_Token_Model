well, because i'm a musician i thought, maybe i'll check this movie out on tmc, nothing else good on. one of the worst mistakes of my life so far, and it's only half done. i seriously thought it was one of those soft core movies with crappy plot and crappy acting, crappy filming and crappy effects. but nope, i don't even get the pleasure of that. even the "musicians" weren't very good. i was hoping for maybe some laughs, but i wasn't sure if they were attempting to throw in one-liners or not. but now i have to sit here and watch the rest just until pulp fiction starts. or maybe something better. and now i get to sit here typing until i have 10 lines
