ok now, lets see. what was funny in the first movie? i know, people with funny accents, people falling into the water, silly boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams. in this movie they have twisted the accent part to the max, no good. a whole a lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons, no good. boatcrash, check. funny comments between the two teams, they tried but failed. also, there are too may personalities they are following in this movie. this film should be about what is happening on the water, not on land. i am sorry to say that there is too far between the funny parts and the sponsors of the film are exploited to the max. no good. all in all, i give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts.
