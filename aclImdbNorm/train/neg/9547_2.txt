a below average looking video game is turned into some sort of conspiracy to have the next terrorist discovered in the usa backyard. welcome to the lunacy of cheaply made direct to video movies. its full of no-name actors and actresses with little valuable plot.<br /><br />anyway, this strange game goes on and our "hero" bets real money and does good at it. it is sort of like gambling, except the gambling part is gone and it sucks. instead its an online game with little real value and you get authorities on your tail if you do good.<br /><br />what makes it even stranger is that two strange computer programs battle it out somehow and all is saved in the end. i will leave the viewer to see how it all comes to fruition.<br /><br />overall, not even worth a $1 rental. borrow it, please.
