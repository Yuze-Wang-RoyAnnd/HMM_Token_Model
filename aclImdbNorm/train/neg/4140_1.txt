as you may or may not have heard, there is no actual fighting between vampires or zombies in this film. one may then ask why the title suggested such a thing, but really it's kind of appropriate because nothing else about this film made any sense either. there was absolutely no story or plot, just things happening. the acting was incredibly bad, worse than safeauto commercials bad.<br /><br />not only were there no fighting between vampires and zombies but i think there was only one scene with zombies even in it. their make up looked as if it were applied by an 8 year old girl. the scene was totally random and out of place and featured one of the characters fighting the zombies off with a hedge trimmer (i'm not kidding) but they used chainsaw sound effects.<br /><br />this was undoubtedly the poorest movie i've ever seen in my life. the only circumstance that i wouldn't totally ridicule every person responsible for production of this film is if i learned that it was produced entirely by 11 year old's.<br /><br />really though, even with all of the criticism i offer here, i'd suggest watching this movie solely based on the fact that it may very well be the worst movie ever, and because of this is quite comical. even just counting the flaws in it should keep you entertained.
