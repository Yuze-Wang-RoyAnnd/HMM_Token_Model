don't waste 90 minutes of your time on "fast food, fast women." it's annoyingly episodic script with three story lines patched together is laughably bad due to predictable writing, horrific acting, and even bad music. i found the anorexic main character upsetting to watch every time she was on screen. she needs the fast food.<br /><br />spend the 90 minutes you'd devote to this turkey doing something more exciting...like trimming your toenails. you'd have more entertainment value.<br /><br />the only redeeming thing about this film is louise lasser, but she deserves much better than this tired script. it's as impotent as the elder guy she courts in the movie.<br /><br />viewer beware!
