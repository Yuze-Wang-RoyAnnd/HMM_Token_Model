what is interesting is that the acting; was not bad, just not enough. it was rather lame., special effects nor the lines were the single culprit for this failure. standing alone they weren't horribly bad, but put together was a tragic move. the show seemed long winded and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed the movie along, but it failed totally.<br /><br />much of the blame for this disaster was put on special effects.don't believe it, they were kinda cool. appleby was not the best choice for this endeavor. though she may have been all they had to chose from with a bit of fan recogniton. an experienced actress would have brought something to the part, like appleby never did. scfi puts out some really good original movies, it's just too bad that this failed so drastically.
