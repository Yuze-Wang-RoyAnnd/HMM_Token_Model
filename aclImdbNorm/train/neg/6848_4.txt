i must say that i am fairly disappointed by this "horror" movie. i did not get scared even once while watching it. it also is not very suspenseful either.... i was able to guess the ending half way through the movie... so.. what's left?<br /><br />"the ring" is a trully scary movie... i wish other movies would stop copying from it (e.g. the trade-mark: long hair). please give me some originality.<br /><br />will not recommend this movie.
