what is this ? a low budget sex comedy ? anyway it describes perfectly the people in spain. they could come up with a better idea, i mean they do this kind of movies since the 60s.. and people like them ! this is neither a teen comedy nor a family one (you can't let your 12 year old watch 2 guys in bed kissing, he'll never want to go to spain). this should be rated "r", because only people 35+ seem to laugh watching :s i'm truly disappointed, maybe i don't like gays (which is quite an important part of the movie).<br /><br />foreign humor is awful in films (except kusturica), stick with doing dramas! if you want a new comedy try talladega nights
