this is a poor film by any standard. the story in match point had a certain intrigue, and the direction and writing a certain fascination (woody allen mixing his own culture with that of the classic english murder and exploring what can be done with it).<br /><br />scoop, however has none of this. it is poorly written, the two leads are hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest at all. the genre that it spoofs requires at least some sort of subplot with witty explanations and tie-ups (why are tarot cards and keys kept under french horns in locked rooms?).<br /><br />allen's delightful and witty versions of various hollywood genres (curse of the jade scorpion/purple rose of cairo etc) have given us so much pleasure over the years. even hollywood ending had a great central idea. sadly his inspiration has deserted him this time.
