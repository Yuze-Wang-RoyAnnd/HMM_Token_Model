as far as i can understand, tiw watcher is the first work of a young director. my doubt is if this is the work of a regular guy who happens to love films or if this is the work of a cinema student, since there is a reference to oporto school of arts in the final credits.<br /><br />nevertheless, director ricardo pinho demonstrates with this movie a total unawareness of some basic notions about cinema. what is a movie? how to tell a story? it doesn't matter, for the novice director. one of the first things you learn in school when you're studying cinema is how to tell a story. you learn that, just like in novels, in movies you should also construct your story in three acts: the introduction, the development and the conclusion. you learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax. you learn this is valid for a 3-hour-epic, for the regular movie, for a short film and even, believe it or not, for a 30-second commercial. you also learn there can be levels of subtleness in your approach to the academic structure and that, ultimately, you can even deconstruct it.<br /><br />in rough terms, tim watcher introduces us its main character and then, the movie ends - the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in jeunet's am'elie. there are no second or third acts in tim watcher. this is not a parody or an art film, thus you can't even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure. you are expecting to be told a story, and it doesn't happen. worst than that, tim watcher defines itself as a warning; and one with no real purpose. it doesn't make a point, or at least, not a valid one. its point is childish, with a sense of vengeance. the situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is manichaean.<br /><br />i was expecting a lot more from this short. the movie opens with a rather good-looking credits sequence and you quickly realize you are watching something with better production values than the regular portuguese short film. i don't know the budget for this movie, but judging for the thanks-list in the end credits, merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country where's difficult to have doors opened to young filmmakers.<br /><br />tim watcher seems to be an exercise in style, color and carefully chosen plans, combined with a fine score. that's all. there's nothing else. there's no plot. and that's a shame because it feels like a waste of production values. hardly, you can see in the regular portuguese short such diversity of locations and so many available extras to enrich a story.<br /><br />as absurd as the comparison may sound, i must refer the bmw shorts as a fine example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely conditioned to product placement and over-the-top stylish cinematography.
