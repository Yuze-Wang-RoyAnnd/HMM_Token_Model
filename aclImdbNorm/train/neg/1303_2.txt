edward montagne's tattooed stranger is supposed to play like a crime thriller with a little film noir mixed in for flavor. instead, it's a poorly acted, witless look into low budget and uninspired film making. the plot is absurd and the acting excruciatingly stiff and amateurish. john miles, who had a rather thin resume in the industry, grins and guffaws throughout, and everyone else acts with the same verve as characters in a government-made filmstrip about driver safety. the movie anticipates shows like 'leave it to beaver' and 'father knows best' in its unnaturally wholesome view of new york in 1950. why, the viewer doesn't even get to see anyone light up a cig until some shapely woman is interviewed in a flophouse halfway through the movie. the only thing the movie has going for it (besides its brevity) is the excellent location shots coordinated by william steiner. the low budget of the film works in the cinematographer's favor, as the viewer is treated to well-framed shots of new york city's interiors and expansive exteriors. unless you wish to enjoy the film for the choice of settings and camera angles, i suggest watching practically any other movie.
