always enjoy great films which deal with the super-natural and the deep thoughts of the spiritual world. however, this film just turned me off as far as its production and direction. there is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story has to tell; all i can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen. the actors, namely: mark addy, thomas garrett, gave an outstanding performance in his native land england, and we have seen him in "still standing" a tv series. heath ledger, played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in "brokeback mountain",'05, gave a great supporting role. shannyn sossaman, (mara sinclair), did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith. don't waste your time, you will be sorry!
