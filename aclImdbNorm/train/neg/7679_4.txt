snow white, which just came out in locarno, where i had the chance to see it, of course refers to the world famous fairy tale. and it also refers to coke. in the end, real snow of the swiss alps plays its part as well.<br /><br />thus all three aspects of the title are addressed in this film. there is a lot of dope on scene, and there is also a pale, dark haired girl - with a prince who has to go through all kind of trouble to come to her rescue.<br /><br />but: it's not a fairy tale. it's supposed to be a realistic drama located in zurich, switzerland (according to the tagline).<br /><br />technically the movie is close to perfect. unfortunately a weak plot, foreseeable dialogs, a mostly unreal scenery and the mixed acting don't add up to create authenticity. thus as a spectator i remained untouched.<br /><br />and then there were the clich'es, which drove me crazy one by one: snow white is a rich and spoiled upper class daughter - of course her parents are divorced and she never got enough love from them, because they were so busy all the time. her best girlfriend, on the other hand, has loving and caring parents. they (a steelworker and a housewife) live in a tiny flat, poor and happy - and ignorant of the desperate situation their daughter is in. the good guy (= prince) is a musician (!) from the french speaking part of switzerland (which is considered to be the economically less successful but emotionally fitter fraction of the country). he has problems with his parents. they are migrants from spain, who don't seem to accept his wild way of living - until the father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bed.<br /><br />and so it goes on: naturally, the drug dealer is brutal, the bankers are heartless, the club owner is a playboy and the photographer, although a woman (!), has only her career in mind when she exposes snow white in artsy pornographic pictures at a show.<br /><br />this review doesn't need a spoiler in order to let you add these pieces to an obvious plot. as i like other films by samir, e.g. "forget baghdad", i was quite disappointed. let's hope for the next one.
