this movie is nothing but a religious tract promoting classic hinduism and new age occultism dressed up with western images to be swallowed by those who are ignorant of foundational religious comparisons. basic tenants of hinduism contain elements of reincarnation. (some of the characters appear both in the present time and also in the 1600's) obviously reincarnated. god is an impersonal force. animal life and plant life are all the same. (this is pantheism). redfield has tried to mix eastern mysticism with western christianty. his attempt at syncretism may fool or confuse those who are not seekers of truth but this movie is a feeble excuse for any ultimate reality. as the ad in the old berkeley barb used to say for $10.00 will show you how to start your own religion. as one famous prophet has said, "use the force luke".
