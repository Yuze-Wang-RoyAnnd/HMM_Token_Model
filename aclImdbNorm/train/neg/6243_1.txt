don't drink the cool-aid.<br /><br />this is an opinion piece disguised as a documentary. and to title it as a "truth" is just plain crap. the debate over global warming is far from over, and will only be over when the eco-zombies start acknowledging the mountain of evidence contrary to their beloved theory. just google "global warming" and "hoax" or "junk science" and you will find a river of information refuting nearly every link in the chain of logic that gore sites. the reason it is so important for people to educate themselves is the disastrous economic impact that global warming prevention measures would have. wake up people. anyone with a computer, a little time, and some common sense can find many many reasons why this theory is not even close to credible. don't just read articles that support your present opinions, read everything you can find. there is no in-depth analysis to make, really. there is simply too many alternate possibilities and counter-evidence for the theory to have even the most basic level of scientific credibility. it is so uncredible, in fact, that it may be the single biggest hoax in the course of human existence. it's time for people to start speaking out against this kind of propaganda, and it's time for people to admit to themselves and others that you can be a both a conservationist and recognize the glaring conclusion that global warming hysteria is a big lie.
