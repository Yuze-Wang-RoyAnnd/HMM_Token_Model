i being of puertorican descent, had mixed fillings about this "documentary". first i was offended that ms. perez compared senor campos to che guevarra. also just a point of fact,mr. john leguzaimo is not of puertorican descent.his parents came from columbia. whomever did research on this was not very accurate. i feel that the future of our race rests on education. this message should have been resounding throughout this film, education is our road to freedom and power i think any future endeavors of this production team should make this their focus.in my opinion,this film swayed toward an anti-american sentiment.
