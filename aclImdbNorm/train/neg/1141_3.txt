having low expectations going in, the opening new footage (clocked at over five minutes) of 'husbands' came as a pleasant surprise. i won't say the new footage was grade a material, but it provided a very solid foundation for what "could have been" a good all-original film.<br /><br />unfortunately, this was put together in 1955, during a time of one day shooting schedules. after the new footage, jules white decided to just thumbtack stock footage from 'brideless groom' into this short, making for a not-so-smooth story transition, which jules and felix adler try to remedy with a quickie bit of new footage at the end, giving us the old, worn-out ending of the boys (moe & larry in this case) getting shot in the butt.<br /><br />3/10
