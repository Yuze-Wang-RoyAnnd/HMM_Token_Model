-might contain spoilers... but believe me, this movie spoils itself from start to finish.<br /><br />i walked into this movie with high expectations. it was my own fault. i had put too much stock in steve carell's record to date. 40 year old virgin... little miss sunshine... the office. and i also made the mistake of coming to imdb and seeing a 7.5 user rating before going to the movie. it's always been a very good predictor in the past, but something is definitely off lately. the last time i felt this embarrassed and in this much pain in a movie theater was watching "blue steel" in 1990.<br /><br />this flick fumbled from start to finish. the script was flunky material. awful writing all around. "murderer of love"? "love is an ability"? whoever wrote this crap suffered from the same affliction that struck american beauty's writer(s)... trying waaaaayyyyyy too hard. the entire flick was peppered with three's company'ish moments like the awful and contrived shower scene. or the pointless/confusing aerobics scene. or the awful laundry room scene. right when you think something serious and/or real is about to happen, they toss in one of these terrible moments. and it happens over and over and over again.<br /><br />and what's with carell's character? the guy meets some lame broad at a book store and is suddenly head over heels in love? let's face it. their conversation sucked. they both should have said their goodbye's after a few minutes. pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune of watching this movie.... carell's character is trying to say something which is absolutely random and un-funny (i think the exact line was "this one time when i was a kid"... that's it. seriously), but both are laughing so hard that coffee is about to spout out of their noses. the actors themselves looked like they were in pain, wondering why they're being directed to do what they're doing.<br /><br />back to the imdb thing... you guys need to figure out a way to keep a movie's promotional team off this site. i know it's impossible, but it's painfully obvious the first 20 or so ratings/reviews were either posted by 12 year olds, or by flunky's hired by the studio. check out the family stone's rating... if that's a mid 5, then this absolutely has got to be a 2... and that's pushing it.
