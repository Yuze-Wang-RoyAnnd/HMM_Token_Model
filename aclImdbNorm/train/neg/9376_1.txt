while watching this movie i got sick. i have been grewing up with pippi and every time was a real pleasure. when my wife came to sweden she was looking at the oldies and had a real good laugh. but this american version should be renamed and never be shown again. it is terrible from beginning to it's end. how can they manage to make it soo bad. well i guess someone blames the translation ha ha ha.. but they are never close to pippi. may this movie never been seen again and never sent out on a broadcast. burn the movie and save the kids. if you want to look at pippi then look at the original movie and have a good laugh. we love pippi inger nilsson, sorry tami erin you will never stand up to be pippi.. oh yes.. when read the "spoilers" explanation, "'spoiling' a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film." well i guess the director stands for this... you are looking at this movie at your own risk.. it is really a waste of time...
