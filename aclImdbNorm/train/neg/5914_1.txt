this movie is truly boring. it was banned in chinese cinema and i can see why. it's not because it's critical of the communist regime but simply because the movie is of such low quality. i would never want to pay money to watch this. i love movies from chen kaige and zhang yimou and i am disappointed such a poor movie could come out of china. it totally seems to ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the movie for himself. the shots of a person standing there doing nothing for up to a minute are hilarious and there's plenty of them. the cinematography and video quality are unbelievably bad. i looked this film up on the net and it seems like people actually like this film. the only explanation i have for this is that some film buffs think that if a film is not in english it is automatically good. i can't see any reason why people would like this. this is not an art film it's of waste of celluloid.(that's if they actually shot it on film , which they didn't)
