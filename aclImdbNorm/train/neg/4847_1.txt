as usual, i am making a mad dash to see the movies i haven't watched yet in anticipation of the oscars. i was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley. i can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has. there is no story!! a group of guys meander around iraq. one day they are here diffusing a bomb. tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside, by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire. no wait here they are back in bagdad. there is no cohesive story at all. the three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures. by that i mean, we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying. we have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe. and then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn't follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers dvds. what do you think is going to happen??? well, do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn't follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways?? why yes! do you think the iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy? why yes! there is no story here. the script is juvenile and predictable! the camera is shaken around a lot to make it look "artsy". and for all of you who think this is such a great war picture, go rent "full metal jacket", "deerhunter" or "platoon". don't waste time or money on this boring movie!
