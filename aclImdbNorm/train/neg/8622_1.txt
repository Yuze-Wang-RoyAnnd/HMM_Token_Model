since crouching tiger hidden dragon came along, there's been a lot of talk about a revival of the hong kong movie industry. don't believe it. the people now making movies in hk give new meaning to the word crass. running out of time 2 is a perfect example. ekin cheng is the name draw, here, but he spends most of the film just grinning idiotically and flipping a coin. he flips the coin over and over and again and again. why? who knows? sean lau plays a cop who chases after the coin-flipping pretty boy. but once again: who knows why? there's a pretty actress in the female lead who runs some sort of company and she has to pay a ransom or something but she mostly just looks like she would rather be at a spa or shopping centre than in front of a camera. nothing makes any sense. there is no action. there is no sex. there is no comedy. all there is is a name: ekin cheng. and you know what? who cares?
