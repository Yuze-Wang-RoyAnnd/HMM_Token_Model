the revolt of the zombies is not the worst movie i've ever seen, but it is pretty far down on the list. when an expedition is sent to cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after world war i, one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions. and he succeeds, at least at first. a love triangle complicates the story some.<br /><br />this really was a tedious movie, with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who weren't. the dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable (not the zombie part of it but parts related to the "romance"). and while i am not any student or expert on cinematography, the camera work didn't seem to help the film much either.<br /><br />while i have seen a few movies that are worse, this is unlikely to please anyone. it's bad, and not in a so-bad-that-it-is-good kind of way.
