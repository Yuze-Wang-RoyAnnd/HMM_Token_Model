i watched this movie yesterday and was highly disappointed.<br /><br />heather graham and tom cavanaugh basically had to carry this awkwardly unbelievable script for five hours (or however long it actually was). from the beginning, every single element of this movie is unbelievable. this movie made me chuckle several times, but they were mainly out of shock that the director/writer actually expected us to believe the many messy scattered elements that attempted to piece this movie together.<br /><br />the movie's focus is gray (graham) and her issues with intimacy. things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly way too much in common.<br /><br />interesting, intriguing. however, instead of unraveling this story into something believable and palatable, the director keeps taking gray into these ludicrous twists that never actually make any sense at all. being an lgbt individual, this movie seemed to echo what all heterosexuals think we go through in the coming-out process. (i'll be insulted if the writer's queer.) had it not been for the cute chemistry between cavanaugh and graham (which, by the way, was understandably forced), i would give it a negative 3 stars.
