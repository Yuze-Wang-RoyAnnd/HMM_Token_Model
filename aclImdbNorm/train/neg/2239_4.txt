the plot has already been described by other reviewers, so i will simply add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see gabrielle drake in all her undoubted glory.<br /><br />miss drake has to be one of the sexiest, prettiest examples of "posh totty" to have been committed to celluloid. of her era and ilk, only the equally exquisite jane asher comes close. what was it about actresses with musical brothers? (nick drake and peter asher) for those who like me have admired gabrielle, her scenes in this movie will not disappoint. she has a magnificent figure and none of it is left to the imagination here.<br /><br />as a whole, the movie is very poor and being of its time, very cheaply made. the song that covers the opening credits seems to go on forever and is appalling.
