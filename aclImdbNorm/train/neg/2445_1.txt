hello, can anybody hear me? i don't know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow viewer of this movie: join the fanclub! this movie was so unbelievably bad i couldn't stop laughing when i saw it. i think it's a must see, it's bad in a nice way. every cliche ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here. i'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this movie, but it should be in the top 10 of worst movies ever made.
