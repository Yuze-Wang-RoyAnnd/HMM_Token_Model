this is an attempt, by both author edgar rice burroughs and filmmakers, at an arabian "tarzan of the apes". but, this desert-set film shows none of the majesty present in burroughs' more successful jungle adventure. the focus is on the love between handsome english noble jon hall (as "el 'lion" chatham) and exotic arab beauty kathleen burke (as "princess" eulilah), with revenge happening to coincide with their urge to merge. the opening states that, although guilty of conduct unbecoming, the lad's mother is living - but, she never re-enters the picture. unfortunately, "the lion man" has deteriorated, and is looks like it's missing footage.<br /><br />*** the lion man (1936) john p. mccarthy ~ jon hall, kathleen burke, ted adams
