i honestly can't believe what passes for entertainment now. death (and making fun of death), violence, sexual innuendo, adults threatening children, crudeness, alcohol abuse by minors, drug theft, dysfunctional parents, babysitter from hell, stereotypical jokes about african americans, police and fat people, and kids sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night - yup, sure sounds like a kids movie to me - not!!! add to that the dark and scary elements - a dead woman possessing and turning into a house and keeping her loving husband a prisoner inside for over 20 years, and also terrorizing an entire neighborhood - how sweet for kids. parents - is this really what you want your kids to be watching - is this what you want to teach them about life?!<br /><br />this movie is too scary for young kids, and i'm afraid that teens today may be living some of this movie scenario - so why rub it in their faces? as for an adult audience - you won't find it scary or amusing - just boring, contrived and predictable. and the characters are just wrong - clueless parents, ignorant police, stupid and annoying friends, nasty and manipulative babysitters, and beer drinking/womanizing boyfriends. what great material for kids - does this really sound like a children's movie to anyone? even the computer animation and good voice work aren't enough to redeem this terrible flick. save your money, save your time, and save your children's minds - go rent ice age, monsters inc., the incredibles, shrek, a bug's life - any of them are way better than this horrid film. spielberg and zemeckis - shame on both of you for making such a disaster and then billing it as a children's/family movie!!
