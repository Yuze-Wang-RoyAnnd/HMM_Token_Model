minimal script, minimal character development, minimal steady camera. maximum stretched scenes, maximum headache inducing jerky zooms, maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing. up until the time flashes on the screen of 12:01pm, you can fast forward and miss nothing, since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing. to be fair, the movie does have some string music that was interesting, so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this. unfortunately that was not to be, and what should have been a twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief. forget about "trigger man", i know i am trying to. - merk
