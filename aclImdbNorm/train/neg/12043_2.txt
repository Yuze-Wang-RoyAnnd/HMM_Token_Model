i like brad pitt enormously. he is an actor with brains and wit, not to mention face, pectorals and all the rest. since i saw him in "thelma and louise" a thought has been bothering me, who does he remind me of? "troy" did it for me. he is the new brigitte bardot. the differences are obvious of course. male, american etc but brigitte bardot comes to mind nonetheless. he is so beautiful that he is at his most effective when he plays against it. "kalifornia" "12 monkeys" "fight club" "snatch" his self deprecating humor makes him human, almost accessible. fortunately "troy" will soon be forgotten. only still photographs with pitt, semi naked in ravishing sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans. strange, "das boot" is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th century. what is wolfgang petersen doing directing this? well, i suppose it would be very hard to say no at the chance of working with the new brigitte bardot.
