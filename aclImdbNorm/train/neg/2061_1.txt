the only film i've ever walked out on. amazing, since i paid for myself and my date and i'm really cheap. but my brain couldn't stand any more of the dreck being piled on, particularly since i could have written funnier material while tie up and gagged.<br /><br />from the beginning to the end this film offends. worse, it ain't funny. it wasn't funny then, and it sure ain't funny now. but even worse, is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart, sophisticated comedy. it's juvenile, really sophomoric script and ideas began an era (which continues to this day) where cheap laughs, and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in film.<br /><br />sexual olympics? what high school kid hasn't thought of that? the beginning of the end.
