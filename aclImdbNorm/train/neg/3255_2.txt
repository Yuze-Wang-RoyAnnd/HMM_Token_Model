i saw this film in its premier week in 1975. i was 13 years old and at that time i found it adequate and somewhat fun. i then came to discover the world of doc savage through the bantam novels of the old pulp magazine stories. i had no idea before any of this of the realm of doc, but i fast became one of the most avid doc savage fans you could ever meet. i read (and still own) all of the bantam books, i started going to comic book cons (along with star trek and doctor who and all manner of geeky fat kid events) and had a wonderful time with each adventure i took with doc and the original fab 5. philip jose farmer's book - the apocalyptic life of doc savage became a bit of a bible for me and to this day i have very fond feelings regarding my doc phase. in so saying i have to admit now years later that this film really missed the boat. it is a film that did not know what it wanted to be when it grew up. the screenplay was infantile and bore little resemblance to the pulp story. these stories from the 30's were short and if one looked at lester dent's (aka kenneth robeson) outline for writing them, they broke down into perfect 3 act dramas that screamed for screen treatment. one would have thought that with george pal and michael anderson at the helm, it would have turned out better. the spoof elements miss the target and the more serious moments almost get there, but then fall short. it is interesting to watch though in that they hired second-string character actors (guys that had really been only bit players and extras before this film) who all acquit themselves very well. paul gleason of course has gone on to be a fine utility player in all facets of entertainment and bill lucking is a television perennial. all the rest have fallen off the map sadly. i do wish to own a copy of this film as it is the only movie version of my hero, but i fear i will not watch it much as it is too painful. i would say 0 but i give it 2 out of 10 instead for some of the period art direction (doc's answering machine at the end was a nice touch) and the cast of 3rd stingers getting a moment in the sun.
