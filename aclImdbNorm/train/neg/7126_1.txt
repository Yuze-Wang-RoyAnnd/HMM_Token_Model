i mean, i thought i heard this dialog in the movie, but it was so bad and out of place that i can't really believe it. i was laughing so hard at what must have been the worst writing and acting in human history, i was seriously worried that i might have a heart attack and die right there in the theater.<br /><br />so this is the scene i am talking about, the "hero" just watched his brother crash and his brothers car exploded right there just feet away from him (the hero). the "hero" was throwing the expected "fit" at seeing something so tragic and people were trying to hold him back from running into the burning car.<br /><br />in the middle of his fit and his uncontrollable rage/emotional break down he says "i am so sad" - he said that right? am i crazy?
