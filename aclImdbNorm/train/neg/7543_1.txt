a trooper is on the side of the road making sure every1 is obeying the speed limit (doing his job); he then pulls over a woman who appears she is a mother (there is a child in the back seat); he then is telling her what is wrong and bam...they get killed. okay, this is the start of what i personally thought would have been a good movie. when i was watching this movie in the theatre i was with some friends. this was our first night out after the summer so we wanted to go and see a good movie. we all decided to see a suspense/thriller that looked good to everyone in the group...this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. not only did i waste $7.oo on a movie ticket, but i had to sit through torture for the brain. this movie started off with mystery and suspense and i seriously thought "this cant be bad"...i was so wrong. the whole problem with this movie is that it makes no sense; even if you can get passed the bad acting, the "not so scary" storyline, and the over all horrible mess this movie was, you will still be puzzled. it's not because you're not smart enough to understand it, it's because no human with a brain could comprehend what this stupid movie is about. right now you may be thinking "oh man! i have to watch this movie just to see if it's as bad as this person says it is". get that thought out of your head right now!!! i'm trying to save you the trouble of watching this movie by telling you that it is so bad that there is no point in even considering seeing it. please people don't make the same mistake i did thinking that this movie has potential...it doesn't. i give this movie 1 out of 10 (if i could give a zero i would), and i do not recommend anyone to ever see this movie, you'll be saving yourself many sleepless nights trying to think w.t.f. that freaking movie is about.
