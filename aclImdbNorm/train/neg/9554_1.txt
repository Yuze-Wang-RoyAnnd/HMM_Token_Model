this is the worst, and i mean the worst computers based movie i have ever seen. the whole plot is totally unconvincing and full of stupidity. <br /><br />i mean...<br /><br />the guy in this movie can actually speak with computer as a real person. now you probably think this must be some super cool high-tech computer, well , it is, but he does it also with other very poor and weak computer which does not even have graphic interface.<br /><br />and the main idea how to overload the "super" computer by connecting to it via computer game on the net is really stupid. my mobile phone will shut the lighting down to preserve the energy but apparently this genius computer cant decide whether to use its resources to deal with national security threats or to load computer games.<br /><br />there are also some other bad things about it but i just don't have time for this.<br /><br />i just cant believe someone could actually record movie stupid as this
