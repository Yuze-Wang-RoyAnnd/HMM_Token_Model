well i don't know where to begin. obviously this was a made for tv movie, so my expectations were low. i was pleasantly surprised by the overall direction of the second hour, but anything before or after that seemed to be a paint by the numbers sort of movie.<br /><br />and talk about bad chemistry between the tow lovebird detectives. ..<br /><br />i would go more in depth, but this movie doesn't really deserve it. grade: d+ (imdb rating 3/10)
