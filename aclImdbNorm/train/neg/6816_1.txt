i have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budget films, so that was not my problem with it. my problem with it is that i felt like i was watching my next door neighbor's home movie. imo everything about it just seemed like a guy wrote out a quick story, grabbed a camera, and started shooting. i understand how hard this must be to do effectively, but when i pay to rent a film, i expect to feel like i am watching some type of professionally made movie.<br /><br />john schneider has a huge resume, is a great actor, and was fine in this film. the other people in it were not. i understand how it must be fun, and cheaper to use friends, and relatives as the cast, but it doesn't make for convincing acting. it seemed like the way it was shot, he was trying to give many of the scenes a more interesting look, but when the writing, plot, and acting are there to begin with, that type of style isn't necessary, and it is a distraction.<br /><br />also on a technical level, it had digital artifacts all over the place. in the first scene of all of those fine cars, when they did a slow scan of them, they appeared to jerk back and forth just a little bit. the problem isn't in my viewing equipment, (benq pe-8700 84" diagonal) but somewhere in the production. i've never seen that kind of artifact in a professionally made film before. then there was the sound. it sounded like they didn't do any voice-overs, which may be o.k. unless it sounded like the track in this film. it sounded like the built in microphone on the camera.
