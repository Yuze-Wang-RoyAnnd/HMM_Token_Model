this movie had the potential to be far more than it was. but it not only fails to deliver, it brings up nauseous self righteous preaching at the same time.<br /><br />john cusack is even flatter than he was in midnight of the garden of good and evil. the difference is that this time he is supposed to have an southern accent, which he noticeably loses several times each scene.<br /><br />al pacino does his shtick but seems to be walking through this film and collecting a paycheck. he's good as usual but hardly standout.<br /><br />supporting cast -- throw in female romantic interest which added little, if anything, to the story. speaking of the story, a convoluted "who really cares" tale where cusack is the self-righteous mayor's boy who just has to search for "the right thing" to be done.<br /><br />people don't act this way. cusack's character loses all credibility at the end, of which without revealing it, is preach and nauseous. the final scene makes the penultimate silliness seem profound. it's also completely inaccurate but i won't get into law.<br /><br />this is a bad, by the numbers movie. it seems interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it's really a preachy, proselytizing, self-righteous film for the last hour. better off with mindless crap than this pile of junk.
