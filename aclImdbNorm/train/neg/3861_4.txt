i'm not a big fan of rom/coms at the best of times. a few have been quite good (check of dream for an insomniac), but this one is just more of the same but less.<br /><br />with a running time of 100min, i expect more than 1 laugh every 30mins. the only real belly laugh are when male strangers and friends instinctivly help out lee's character.<br /><br />all i can say is avoid. i gaurentee there is at least 10 other movies on the shelf that deserve you $$<br /><br />3 of out 10 (and only cos i'm a big lee fan)
