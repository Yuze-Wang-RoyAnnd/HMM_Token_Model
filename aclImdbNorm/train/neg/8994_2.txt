this movie is a prime example of squandering great resources in a film. you've got future snl and sctv stars in their prime, such as john candy, chevy chase, laraine newman, al franken,tom davis and joe flaherty essentially making 70 minutes of coarse, uninspired fart and racist jokes. the concept of a network from the future subverting society could have really been taken to some interesting extremes, but instead right out the gate, makes a lame, juvenile proctology joke and stays in that vein of humor the whole way.seek out the earlier and much more subversive and witty groove tube or the later, hilarious kentucky fried movie. this movie is only for those who want to see a time capsule of bad 70's sketch comedy movies.
