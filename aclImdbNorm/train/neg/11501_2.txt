a romanticised and thoroughly false vision of unemployment from a middle class "artist" with a comfortable upbringing... it is clear that the writer-director never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience of it. if you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story, unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers, have no anger, no fear, no frustration, etc. all the characters live trough the day by carrying pranks, boyish jokes. they do never look for work, the do almost never experience rejection or anguish, etc. living on the dole is just about like a summer vacation from school... ridiculous. specially if you compare it with contemporary masterpieces from the likes of ken loach, etc.
