complete waste of time.... this movie is not comedy, it's not drama, it's not romance...not even teenage comedy at least!!! story... it should be some turn-over one end... but it's so disappointing! when movie has a turn-over on end i expect that turn-over to make movie even better (exp. "fight club") but this turn-over makes movie even worse.... when i watch teenage comedy, and i don't do that very often, i expect lousy jokes and bunch of nudeness... jokes are too lousy and there is no nudity... you got only one....very good looking i must admit... girl, and that's that! and she's fully dressed whole movie! acting is bad... like soap series... don't waste your time! there are porns with better story and acting!<br /><br />(sorry on my bad english)
