i saw this film under the title of "tied up". in general i have enjoyed dolph's movies, so gave this one a try. it wasn't worth it. i have read some of the previous comments about the box enticing viewers. don't be fooled. this is a poor film at best. the acting is nonexistent. the plot, what little there is of one, is very predictable. the movie in places seems to be chopped together. this one just plain stinks the place up. not even worth the price of a cheap night rental. as a bit of a dolph fan, i kept waiting to see him in action. by the end of the movie, you will still be waiting. best to avoid this film, and spend your time watching almost anything else.
