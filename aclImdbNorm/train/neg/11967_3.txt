considering the risk of showing same-sex relationships before the late 1980's, personal best could have done better to play the same-sex relationship between hemingway (chris cahill) and donnelly (tory skinner) as a more than experimental phase of cahill's life.<br /><br />it seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the same-sex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers. also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole. this random scene had very little relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie. i suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie (the 1980 oregon track and field competition).<br /><br />this review may seem harsh, but it is the truth. the exploitation of young muriel hemingway's body and the same-sex relationship ruined any credit that i would have given to this film.<br /><br />pepper thompson
