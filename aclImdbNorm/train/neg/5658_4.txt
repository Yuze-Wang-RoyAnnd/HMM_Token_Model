"laugh, clown laugh" released in 1928, stars the legendary lon chaney as a circus clown named tito. tito has raised a foundling (a young and beautiful loretta young) to adulthood and names her simonetta. tito has raised the girl in the circus life, and she has become an accomplished ballerina. while chaney gives his usual great performance, i could not get past the fact that tito, now well into middle age, has the hots for the young simonetta. although he is not her biological father, he has raised her like a daughter. that kind of "ick" factor permeates throughout the film. tito competes for simonetta's affections with a young and handsome 'count' luigi (nils asther). simonetta clearly falls for the young man, but feels guilt about abandoning tito (out of loyalty, not romantic love). the whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and i find it amazing that no one in the film tells tito what a stupid old fool he is being (until he reveals it himself at the end). the film is noteworthy only because of loretta young, who would go on to have a great career. while i adore chaney's brilliance as an actor, this whole film seems off to me and just downright creepy.
