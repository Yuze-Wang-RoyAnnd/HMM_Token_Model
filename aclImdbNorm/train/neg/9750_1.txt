the film, a universal release of a protelco-mlc production, is a boring retelling of the theory of breaking down the molecular structure of an object, capturing it in a cell as "pure energy," and then sending it back complete to a "target area." there is no explanation why this is necessary, but professor paul steiner (played by pock-mocked actor bryant haliday, "devil doll") thinks it's something to dedicate his, and his assistants', pat hill (mary peach) and chris mitchell (ronald allen), lives to. <br /><br />during an experiment before noted dutch scientist "lembach" (gordon heinz), his machine fails due to sabotage, so he has himself "projected" by his secretary, sheila (tracey crisp) to seek revenge. of course, she screws up and he comes out looking like a "pork roast" with the power to electrocute people. <br /><br />with this new-found power, he manages to zap some cockney idiots, a security guy named latham (derrick de marney) and his lab boss, dr. blanchard (norman woodland). he also is able to break into a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat, as well. <br /><br />in the end, though, despite hill and mitchell's attempt to help him, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. on the whole, a completely pointless movie with no message at all. <br /><br />also one of the most depressing color films you will ever see.
