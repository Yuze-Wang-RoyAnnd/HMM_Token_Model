hey,<br /><br />if your going to make a documentary about leonard cohen try making it about leonard cohen! this is filled with only enough leonard to anger the viewer who will be left wondering why they are listening to all these other singers (some of them questionable) talk about themselves. puleeze....sounds like them reliving their diary entries in junior high - who cares about you, what about leonard? guess what people, if you "do something" worthy maybe someone will make a documentary about you. i found particularly insulting the parading of u2's members as if that would add credibility to this movie - not. leonard doesn't need bono or the edge talking about his spirituality. what would have been nice would have been for the filmmakers to embody some piece of his spirituality through the film. gee, what a concept! i will give props to rufus wainwright and jarvis cocker for their covers of cohen tunes - the rest of the performances were a bore and some were unbearable.<br /><br />cohen fans, don't say i didn't warn you!
