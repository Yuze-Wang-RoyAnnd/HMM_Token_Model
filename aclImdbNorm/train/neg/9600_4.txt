very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story, but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice, gruesome make-up effects. daniella is a beautiful twenty-something girl, carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13. nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing she's the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf. she kills her brother-in-law during a nightly encounter and gets submitted in a hospital. she escapes again, however, and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives, doctors and relatives. it's all pretty to look at and listen too (really great soundtrack), but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast. luckily enough, leading lady annik borel rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire. the film is too long, too weird and too forgettable. the biggest surprise comes at the end, when suddenly and out of the blue, director rino di silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts. yeah, right...
