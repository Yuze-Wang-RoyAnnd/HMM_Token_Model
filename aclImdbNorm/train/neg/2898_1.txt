wowwwwww, about an hour ago i finally finished watching this terrible movie!!! i wanted to turn it off within the first like 10 minutes but i figured i'd give it a chance because it just hadddd to get better. or at least have some redeeming qualities, like i figured at the very least it would be a make you think type movie, or like really intelligent, or very well filmed or something...needless to say, that was not the case and i wasted about an hour and a half of my life. im not even going to get into why its terrible because its a waste of my time to explain that this "may contain spoilers"...imdb, you should calm down on the spoilers thing and pay more attention to making sure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved somehow in the movie or anything else like that. i thought it would be humorous after this terrible film to come see hoe bad the rating would be and i was very very shocked to see the fairly high ratings...all the ratings with about 7-10 stars clearly must be about some completely different movie... im still a big imdb fan, but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee like a 3.
