basically this is about a couple who want to adopt a second child. at the adoption agency they meet a mouse (stuart) and they decide to adopt him. if you think that this is stupid, hold it, because it's getting worse.<br /><br />stuart arrives to his new home, where he is treated like a human child. (spare me!) the rest is pretty much the usual clich'e, about family problems, jealousy from the elder "brother", and at the end all issues are resolved and they are all a "happy family". boring and worn out as this is, it is also shown in the most blunt and unsophisticated way.<br /><br />i don't know if the director believed that he was being creative by introducing a mouse to the clich'e, or he was just trying to fill in minutes, but he only upgraded the clich'e from boring to abhorrent.<br /><br />then why i gave a 3 and not a zero? because of the family cat, who loves stuart as much as the "brother". and because of some funny gigs, where stuart makes good use of his small size.<br /><br />on the overall i believe that the film would work reasonably well if: a. stuart was a pet and not a "sibling". b. it had kept to the funny gigs, like stuart trying to outwit the cat, and had left out boring clich'es which don't even match with anything else.
