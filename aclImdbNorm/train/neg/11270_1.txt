i have seen bad films but this took the p***. made no sense, and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds, oh and i think one has a low sperm count. its that good. a welshman plays a sweary cockney. a posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy, and some lesser lights play dim tarts.<br /><br />and there are some russian gangsters. oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs.<br /><br />avoid this film like the plague.
