although i had some hopes for this film, particularly since i enjoy the acting of jason segel (freaks & geeks, undeclared) so much, i must say it was one of the worst films i've seen in recent memory (loser and dr t and the women are also on that list).<br /><br />yes, there were a couple of laugh out loud moments, although the movie could have been so much better. the premise was not bad- scam artists cheating their way through college meet their match when they're discovered by someone with a proposition for them. the problem is that the characters were all so unlikable, that i didn't care about any of them. the blackmailer (played by talented jason schwartzman) was such a psychopath that it wasn't that funny to watch him- he wasn't deranged in a particularly funny or charming way, he was just a crazy loser, who was actually rather dangerous and not fun to watch. the editing of the movie was hard to follow-- it kept cutting between fantasy and reality and it was often unclear which was which. only two or three of the gang's scams were really shown, you just had to take it on faith that they were indeed scam artists-- showing their schemes would have made for a better movie. the so-called love story was absurd and unbelievable, in fact it was silly and poorly written and directed throughout. i could go on about the movie's shortcomings, but you get the idea. not worth the $4 rental or the gas it takes to drive to and from the movie store to rent!
