in theory, 'director's commentary' should have worked. the talented rob bryden plays peter delane, a former television director recounting his experiences behind the camera. amongst the programmes he is alleged to have worked on are 'bonanza', 'flambards', 'the duchess of duke street', and 'the bounder'. his commentaries are not the least bit informative, due to his habit of wandering off the point.<br /><br />but in practice, it failed dismally. it is a one-joke show, and the joke is not particularly funny. the scripts are completely lacking in wit, and bryden fails to convince as an old man. whenever stuck for anything amusing to say, which is like every five seconds, he issues a hissing laugh. rather than being amused by delane, you want to shoot him. if senile old men strike you as hilarious, then this is for you.<br /><br />it didn't help that the shows mocked were, with the exceptions of 'mr & mrs' and 'crossroads', rather good. for the joke to work, they needed to be really dreadful such as 'charlie's angels', 'o.t.t.', 'telly addicts', 'neighbours', and 'new faces'.<br /><br />the show tanked big time, so thankfully we are spared the horror of future editions. wouldn't it be deliciously ironic if 'director's commentary' were someday itself the subject of a spoof?
