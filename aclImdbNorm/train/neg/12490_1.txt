i own this movie. i bought it for $3.99 at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some "indie"" type movie research since i had just finished my own feature and was editing it. now when i feel down about my skills as a first time director i just sit down with a plate of cookies and severed. within minutes i feel great!!!<br /><br />i hate to down talk another filmmaker so i'll just use constructive criticism. 1. find good actors. take the time. it really helps. 2. when shooting video, over light your scenes and darken in the computer later on in post. 3. closeups are better for video. 4. when an actor enters a scene, wait a bit before<br /><br />having them speak so that we know what's going on and who's talking. 5. never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it. damn well worth the $3.99<br /><br />the true horror would be getting the reviews severed has here on imdb. and you have to give these guys credit... they did get distributed.
