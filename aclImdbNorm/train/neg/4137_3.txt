i have a high tolerance level for crap, so i was looking forward to this. it did not disappoint. apparently based on sheridan le fanu's classic carmilla, it follows a father and daughter hunting a female vampire who, luckily, happens to be travelling with them. then we have santa claus (or the general, as he likes to be called here) running over random zombies. did i mention there was a zombie outbreak? the dead are returning to life but nobody seems too concerned. we have construction worker zombies, soldier zombies and even st.trinian schoolgirl zombies. apparently santa claus is looking for his daughter who has been turned into a vampire. oh wait there are no vampires, the girl is in a lunatic asylum and carmilla is her nurse, or is she? the zombies are back and santa's mad. lesbian sex, i like vampires and i like zombies but i especially like lesbian sex. nothing like some simulated cunnilingus to get the juices flowing. when are we going to see vampires fight zombies? is she a vampire or is she a lunatic? or both? is carmilla a hot sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse? more cunnilingus, you can never have enough cunnilingus. here come the st.trinian zombies. chainsaw time!! more lesbian sex then the zombies kill and eat the vampires. i guess the zombies won, or did they? plot? who needs a plot when you've got lesbian vampires and schoolgirl zombies? and cunnilingus?
