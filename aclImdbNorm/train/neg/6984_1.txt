this movie was promising: my favorite actor in a historical drama during the independence war. it had memories from "dances with wolves" for the big prairies, indians, military fights & from "barry lyndon" for the british & candles lights atmospheres...<br /><br />unfortunately, the script is awful: the continuity of the story is lacking (cuts with "5 months later"; "3 years later") & the romance is so ridiculous that it's hard to believe in it: america is a big country but the characters kept bumping at each other; above all, wait for the ending & you understand how to kill a story (imagine the same in "titanic").<br /><br />sometimes, a bad script is saved by a brilliant filmmaker. unfortunately bis, hudson is a poor one. he has already committed "greystoke" and i find again the same flaws: no dynamic in scenes, in editing, in scoring: it is long, dull, flat....<br /><br />i knew that this movie was a disaster for pacino's career: now i understand. finally, this last movie for 2006 is in the vein of this year for me: a painful one...
