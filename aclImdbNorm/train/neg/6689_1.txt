i can only assume that the other reviewers of this "film" are stockholders in the production company, as this was quite possibly the worst movie i've seen in the last five years. from the opening shot of a rabbi laughing uncontrollably for no apparent reason, it was clear that the actors in this film would kill to be considered "b-level." both my wife and i were in a great mood before starting this film, and we were genuinely looking forward to a funny popcorn movie. we knew we hadn't rented citizen kane, and we weren't expecting to see the most amazing movie ever. however, after 40 minutes of enduring the most painfully unfunny bit of garbage i've ever seen, we shut it off instead of wasting another minutes of our lives.<br /><br />if a "comedy" with no laughs, terrible acting, thin plot and annoying characters are your thing, then this film is for you. honestly, troll 2 is better--at least i laughed at the popcorn sex scene.<br /><br />i cannot justify writing a longer review of this picture because i've already wasted almost an hour trying to find one joke.
