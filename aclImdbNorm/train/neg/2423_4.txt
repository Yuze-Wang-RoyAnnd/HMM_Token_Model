i got this film from a private collector and was very curious about it. it had a 7,8 in imdb (9 votes only) and some external comments were pleasant. but i have to say that it is a very usual and uninteresting giallo. yes, great cinematography, the film is well directed, but it never freaked me out. it starts well, but although it not bored me at all, the story is so ordinary and the things that occur so normal, that i didn't like it very much.<br /><br />you can make a few laughs. and you can see some little tits. but if you like the kind of giallos i like (bizarre, surreal, nonsenseful, gory, atmospheric, brutal murders...) you won't appreciate much this film.<br /><br />i give it a 4 for the good directing and editing, and the final twists, that make the film entertaining. but it could be much better.
