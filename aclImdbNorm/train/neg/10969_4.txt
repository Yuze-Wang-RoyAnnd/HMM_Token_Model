perhaps i'm out of date or just don't know what electra is like in current publications... but the electra that i read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan. she usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved. just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way.<br /><br />this movie was fairly weak on the dialog, the acting wasn't particularly convincing, and the action was spotty. i was really looking for something more along the lines of frank miller's book "electra assassin." which is much darker than anything in this movie.<br /><br />special effect where cool, action was interesting at times, but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical. tha hand was not menacing enough, and electra was not..... bitchy enough. she's the girl you love to hate... but in this story, i just didn't care either way.
