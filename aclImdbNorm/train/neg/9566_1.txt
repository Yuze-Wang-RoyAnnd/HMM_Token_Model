i see a lot of movies. saw the original wargames years ago and loved it. computers where still "a big mystery" for the most of us and the movie was convincing, in it's own way.<br /><br />this one, however, looks like a low budget wednesday night special. total crap, from start to finish.<br /><br />the plot is so weak, you won't believe it until you see the movie (which i would not recommend in the first place). i can not point out one actor that actually did a good job in this movie. but hey, with that script i would've been surprised if anyone could do a good job acting. lots of clich'e scenes. cgi looks like it's taken out of the '86 version.<br /><br />bah, no, i'm getting in a bad mood just writing about this. do not watch this movie.<br /><br />life's to short to waste it on watching crappy movies.
