jeux d'enfants or how the film was wrongly translated into english love me if you dare is a film made by stupid people and about stupid people. i just don't know how i could expect something worth a look from a film with such plot: two stupid ignorant kids make a bet that each of them will do something (certainly extremely idiotic) to prove to each other (wtf?) that they are "cool dudes". i know that i exaggerated some aspects but that is what the entire film is about. they grow older...and instead of realizing that they are just a couple of alienated weirdos continue to perform their crazy things, thinking that they are great people.<br /><br />one could expect such a film from hollywood, but france? it is even more offensive to watch the film from the country which created amelie a couple of years ago, which, btw, the film tries to look like but is far, extremely far away from.<br /><br />avoid. avoid. avoid.
