here again is yet another diane lane movie where she cheats on her husband. is this the only role she knows how to play? this time it's set in 1969 and she cheats on her husband with the blouse man. i am so not surprised because that is so very predictable. then her husband gets mad and throws the milk. i wouldn't be surprised if she slept with the milkman as well. i wouldn't be surprised if she slept with the ice cream man too because this is a very boring movie. then after some milk throwing, she says sorry and sees the blouse man again. duh. then while she is making it with him, her son gets stung by wasps. my mom always told me not to throw rocks at a wasps nest. this kids mom didn't have time to tell him that, she was too busy with the blouse man.
