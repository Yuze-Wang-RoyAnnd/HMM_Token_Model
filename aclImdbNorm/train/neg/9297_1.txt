i gave this a 1. there are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for. total mayhem. everyone gets killed or nearly so. i am tired of cross hairs and changing views. i cannot give the plot away. convoluted and insane. if i had paid to see this i would demand my money back. i wish reviews were more honest.
