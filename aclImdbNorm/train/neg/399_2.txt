this picture started out with good intentions, bacon the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility, and shue is cute as usual in her role. it all falls apart after that, it's your typical hollywood thriller now, filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore, minus any kind of humour, wit or soul. in other words, don't waste your time watching this. get the audiocassette tape with john delancie as the invisible man instead, also starring leonard nimoy. now that was good, and hg wells is well served, unlike with this mess.
