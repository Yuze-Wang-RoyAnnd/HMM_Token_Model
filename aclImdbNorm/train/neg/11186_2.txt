i wanted to watch this movie, but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off. character's don't seem to react to anything. consider this: heath ledger is walking a night (through a cemetery i believe) when he is attacked by spirits, which he drives away. once past this ordeal he calmly walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all. when asked what happen he says blandly "attacked by demons, nothing serious.", as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat tire.<br /><br />i shut it off when they go to ask something-a demon or something, i stopped caring-a ques ion. the answer can only be rented out of someone with the energy of their death, and the priest watch in what appears to be vague annoyance as a man is strung up and hung and they ask his thrashing, dying body question.<br /><br />0 out of **** stars.
