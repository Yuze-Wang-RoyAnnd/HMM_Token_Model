woman with wig, who "dyes" her hair in the middle of the film (=takes of wig) presumably does not see what the audience can see from miles away:<br /><br />*** begin spoiler alert *** that her hubby is having an affair with her best girlfriend and they both try get rid of her. *** end of spoiler alert ***<br /><br />and what a spoiler that was: the title already gives it away, doesn't it? bad acting, bad script: waste of time oh yeah: in the end, she lives happily ever after....<br /><br />if you liked this movie, you'll really love "cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death"....
