i don't hand out "ones" often, but if there was ever a film that deserved this sort of attention, it's "gas!" this is self-indulgent crap that reaches for some of the ambiance of m*a*s*h and falls completely flat on its face in the attempt.<br /><br />i see what corman was going for - malcolm marmorstein and elliott gould tried to reproduce gould's deathless role in the original movie version of m*a*s*h with a similar plot (in the movie "whiffs" - look it up here in imdb, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073891/ for more information).<br /><br />marmorstein and gould got closer to the brass ring with "whiffs" than corman did with "gas!" but didn't quite get there. neither one of those films even got close to the success of m*a*s*h.<br /><br />what's wrong with "gas!"? what isn't? no one comes close to really acting at a level above junior high school theatrics. the production values stink. someone else here mentioned the magically regenerating headlights on a getaway car, and there's more of that lack of attention to detail. nothing works the way it's supposed to in this film, and nobody cares.<br /><br />"gas!" actually put me to sleep. it's not a sure cure for insomnia, but really close. on the cinematic sleep induction scale, "gas!" falls somewhere between "last year at marienbad" and george clooney's remake of "solaris" (which itself was remarkable for being more boring than the mosfilm original, despite that studio's seeming unfamiliarity with the idea of keeping the audience's attention by judicious editing).<br /><br />judicious editing would have decimated "gas!" to about twenty minutes. the result would be pointless, but no more so than the original film.<br /><br />certain films are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching anyway. this isn't one of them. don't waste your time. it's not even amusingly bad.
