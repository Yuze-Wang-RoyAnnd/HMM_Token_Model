the perfectly stupid weapon. i think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of steven segal's movies was intented to mock jeff doing his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie. the plot is predictable, the fights were fair and jeff acts about as well as the sofa he beats with some sort of weapon in one scene.
