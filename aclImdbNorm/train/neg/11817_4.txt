a pretty average scifi film. the plot was more or less obvious from the start. although the acting was reasonably good, the writing seemed very cliched, using ideas taken from numerous films.<br /><br />the basic plot: scientists working on a deep space research platform rescue a fighter from crashing into the red dwarf that they have been orbitting. onboard they find a stasis pod, which coincidently malfunctions at that very moment. after 2 or 3 minutes of the man in the pod waking up, you realise that he is a complete lunatic. something which totally escapes the 3 person crew of the research ship...<br /><br />after that it becomes a rip off every other film involving a psychotic madman terrorising innocent victims, overall i think speed 2 was a better exploration of the subject matter, which i didn't consider to be a good film either.<br /><br />not a good film, get aliens out and watch that again.<br /><br />
