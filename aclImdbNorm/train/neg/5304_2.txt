i am not one of those people that will walk out of a movie that was based on source material and automatically say, "the book was better." i know better than to demote the value of a movie just because it wasn't a faithful adaptation. there is a lengthy process and lots of decisions that go into making a movie that are sometimes out of the director's/editor's/cinematographer's/producer's control and certainly out of the original author's control. therefore, it is unreasonable to expect a movie to be exactly the same, word for word, as a book or play or video game or disneyland ride, or whatever! a movie should be judged on its own standard and how it fits in society. moreover, a successful movie should be made because the material is relevant to the society which it belongs and, if it is based on source material, its relevance needs to be reexamined and enhanced by the filmmakers. <br /><br />films like there will be blood follow this paradigm because while it was based on a novel written at the turn of the century, oil!, it feels relevant because of things like the iraq war and energy concerns that the film's country of origin, the us, was and is experiencing. even king kong, based on the original film, benefits from using new technology and concerns of animal rights that people have.<br /><br />with that said, i just don't understand why they even bothered to make this movie? besides the great performances, guaranteed oscar nods and shanley's director/writers fee and royalties he will get, this movie seems to come from nowhere. it should have simply stayed as a play. the movie (which is essentially the same as the play) says nothing new about the reprehensible sexual atrocities committed and in many cases covered up by the catholic church here and abroad. it says nothing new or different than the original play. i can't help but compare this movie to another movie that came out at around the same time: frost/nixon, which was also based on a play. frost/nixon, while about nixon's regrets, seems relevant because it seems to have come at a time when president bush was about to leave office. the regrets that nixon had, as depicted in the play/movie, about the war and his presidency could just as easily reflected on bush and his presidency. in that respect frost/nixon seemed more relevant and actually benefited from a wider distribution via film because it got people talking and reflecting about the political status quo in the country at the time. in contrast, doubt felt like it was yesterday's news and didn't seem to offer anything that the play didn't offer.<br /><br />of course the movie is "good," the performances are outstanding, and the screenplay adaptation is apt, but so what? why didn't it just stay as a play? why, besides marketing and financial reasons, make it into a movie? it gave audiences nothing new to discus about the awful subject.
