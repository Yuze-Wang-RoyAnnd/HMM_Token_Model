the makers of this film have created a future where not only is abortion and birth control illegal in every state,but women are prosecuted for murder and sent away to serve long prison sentences.in other words,this film is every liberals worst nightmare!the political agenda is so heavy-handed here and the style of the film is so low-key that it just loses steam pretty quickly.regardless of which side of the fence you're on,i'd recommend skipping it.
