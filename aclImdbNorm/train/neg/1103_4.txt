as a young black/latina woman i am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. of course when i saw this movie at the video store i thought i would enjoy it; unfortunately, i didn't. although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story was simply not properly developed. the movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film. had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes, perhaps i would have enjoyed it a bit more. honestly, i would recommend a film like "raising victor" over this one any day. i just was not too impressed.
