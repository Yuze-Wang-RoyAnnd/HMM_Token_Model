three tales are told in this film, that seemed to have been shot without knowledge of this being a combined vignette film. the makers relate the three vignettes by having them all connected to shrink martin kove, although you never see some of the leads with kove.<br /><br />the first vignette has sexy vivian schilling, a woman afraid of everything under the sun(she makes adrian monk look brave), having a paranoia laced evening at home alone. you will literally scream at vivian for doing some ridiculous things. she spends the majority of her time in a nighty which shows off her amazing features. but her film is the worst if not the most nail-biting.<br /><br />the second vignette is owned by bill paxton as he portrays the roommate from hell. his geeky roommate allows him to take complete advantage of him, and bill does so whenever he can.<br /><br />the last vignette was funny as a man fears that death will take him at any moment, much like his pal who choked to death on an olive.<br /><br />not very interesting, as the movie as a whole seems chopped together with very little thought involved. a must for bill paxton fans.
