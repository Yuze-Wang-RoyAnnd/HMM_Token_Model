what a poor excuse for new zealnd movie making. i'm ashamed to call myself a new zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on new zealand satellite tv (aug 2006). the cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars. the ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) still all over the set including on the ship's funnel. the ship is supposed to be a cruise ship/ferry between the usa and mexico. it has obvious signs of rust and old age all over the place yet is supposed to be a luxury ship on it's maiden voyage. one of the scenes shows the snow capped peaks of new zealand's south island in the background for god's sake! must have been a very cold time on the usa/mexico area! the story is weak, the acting is weaker and the new zealand/american accents just don't work. i expect the new zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a waste of money better spent on a real production. i know high school kids in new zealand who could make better movies with their cell phones. goof: there is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a taco company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was american. but some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it. i'd love to go on but it just isn't worth the trouble in any way.
