all the ingredients of low-brow b-movie cult cinema. topless (and bottomless) girls, kung-fu kicking chefs, slave traders, evil germans with mustaches, cameron mitchell and sword-wielding zombies.<br /><br />and, of course the breasts of camille keaton, who's best known display occurs in the feminist exploitation classic i spit on your grave. we also must mention the hooters of jewel shepard, who play a hooker in the recent film the cooler.<br /><br />lots of blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts among topless dancers in a bar, in a whorehouse, and on a boat load of martial artists heading to some zombie island where bad martial artists go to die or something like that.<br /><br />tops and bottoms come off easily and frequently as travelers are well lubricated thanks to the boat owner.<br /><br />then disaster strikes as their boat is destroyed and they land on the zombie island where mas monks sacrifice young girls to the dead martial artists to bring them back to life.<br /><br />just when you thought it had everything, there are piranhas in the water. yum yum a big fat german for dinner.<br /><br />just the thing for your next zombie fest.
