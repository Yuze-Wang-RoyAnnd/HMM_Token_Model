impressed! this is the worst srk movie and one of the worst bollywood movies i ever saw! i didn't like the novel, but this movie made it worse! very bad music, even worse actors (apart from srk of course, though even he doesn't manage to save the movie), and not much sense. the director makes it all look very confusing, god knows why... maybe it's because he's trying to make it all look very surrealistic, and yet credible. well, he manages neither.<br /><br />even if you've got a few hours to loose, don't watch this movie, please! (saying this for your own welfare!) keep searching, you will find something else to watch!
