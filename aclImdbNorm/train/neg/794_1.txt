unless you are already familiar with the pop stars who star in this film, save yourself the time and stop reading this review after you've reached the end of the next sentence.<br /><br />forget you ever stumbled upon this film and go watch something else.<br /><br />but if you insist on reading, consider: <br /><br />lame vehicle for japanese teen idol pretty-boys featuring nonsensical, convoluted "plot" that drags out for an insufferable amount of time until you're ready to scream.<br /><br />nothing in this film makes sense. it's an endless series of people expressing various emotions, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, for no good reason. we can obviously see something incredibly "dramatic" is happening, but we just don't give a crap why 'cause there's no backstory.<br /><br />by the time this film is over, you will be sick and tired of these stupid, lanky, girly stars' faces. you'll be revolted at having spent all this time watching them smile, sneer, cry, look mysterious, be "serious," and any other pointless expression they slap on their faces.<br /><br />that some moron would ever go so far as to refer to this piece of insipid trash as being the "soul" of any of its "actors" should prove to you beyond the shadow of a doubt what the trailer and countless adoring comments on this site will not tell you: <br /><br />only the "converted," mindless minions will like this film, the majority of them teenage girls with a pathological adoration for anything androgynous. freud would have a field day.<br /><br />unless you're one of these mindless "fans," stay the hell away from this abomination.
