director f.w. murnau wisely stuck with the silent film medium he knew so well to cover this story of native islander life in the south seas. the documentary style works very well for the first half of the movie. the landscapes are beautiful, and the daily life activities of the islanders are interesting to watch. the film loses momentum, though, when it begins to concentrate more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers. the storyline just never gets that interesting, despite being handled well by murnau. won an academy award for best cinematography, although the award probably should have been for best scenery. you can't really credit the dp for getting to shoot in such a beautiful location.
