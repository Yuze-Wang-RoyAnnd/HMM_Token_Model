the dubbing/translation in this movie is downright hilarious and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise dull and derivative zombie flick. i haven't laughed so hard in my life as i just did watching zombi 3 (and i've seen some really bad dubbing in my life, believe me). seriously, the filmmakers could re-edit this movie and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars. it's just that funny.<br /><br />but... if falling off your couch laughing at the dubbing in a fulci zombie movie isn't your cup of tea, then avoid this at all costs.
