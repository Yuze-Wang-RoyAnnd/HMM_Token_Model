i've long heard that to get their start in 'legitimate' films, many behind-the-camera types work on porno films.<br /><br />the people who produced and directed this monstrosity stayed too long.<br /><br />poorly paced, staged and written, it uses a lot of perfectly good talent (diehl, dorn, eggert) badly.<br /><br />much sexual activity is teasingly implied here by the brassiere-popping host to the alien creature, but it never crosses the line...<br /><br />you'll still want to shower afterwards, though.
