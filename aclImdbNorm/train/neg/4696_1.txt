i know the people and i did some of the animation and graphic design and the show is horrible! they are rich little kids who don't have any talent, and probably just begged nick to accept them! alex has played the drums for one yearm, i've played for 4 1/2! the movie is terrible and so is the show! this is the craziest most mixed up comedy that even isint funny i've ever seen. it is so stupid it makes me want to barf!!! it is just so crazy that nickelodeon would ever accept something like this and so dumb! they are sooo stupid and weird! i hate them and their show and think once nick realizes how stupid it is they will most hopefully take it off!
