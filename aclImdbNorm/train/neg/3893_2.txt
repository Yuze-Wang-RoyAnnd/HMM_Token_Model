i was thinking that the main character, the astronaut with the bad case of the runs(in his case, his skin, hair, muscles, etc) could always get more movie work after he'd been reduced to a puddle. all he has to do is get a job as the blob. the premise of this flick is pretty lame. an astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiation(i think), and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day. not only is this a puzzler, but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity. huh? have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens, the person instantly turns into a killing machine? why is that?<br /><br />the astronaut lumbers off into the night from the 'secret facility'(which has no security whatsoever), shedding parts of himself as he goes. apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad, maybe because he wanted to return to space. <br /><br />thus begins the part of the movie that's pretty much filler, with a doctor wandering around with a geiger counter, trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off. he kills a stupid bill gates look-alike fisherman, scares a little girl a la the frankenstein monster movie, and finishes off a wacky older couple(punishing them karmically for stealing some lemons). then there's a short scene where he whacks his former general, and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around. you'd think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away, the scene would shift. but no...we're treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror, even though the monster is gone. all i could think was..director's girlfriend, anyone?<br /><br />the end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it. the melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo, and then...nothing. that's it. that's the end of the movie. well, at least that meant that there was no room for a sequel.
