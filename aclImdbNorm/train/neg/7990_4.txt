'anita and me' is a drama about growing up in multi-ethnic britain, rather like 'bend it like beckham', or more closely, 'east is east', with which it shares a 1970s setting. the tone is resolutely chirpy (in spite of the dour black country accents), but the film lacks 'east is east's vigour and the result seems rather thin and trite. moreover, the portrayal of the film's central relationship, between an asian girl and her white friend, is insufficiently deep to justify the way that the movie is structured around it. i have also grown tired of films where the hero years to be a writer, this is naturally often something that real writers have experienced, but hardly a fresh element in a fictional story. 'east is east' was fun and sharp; 'anita and me' seems obvious and dull in comparison.
