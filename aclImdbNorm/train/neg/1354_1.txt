i saw his film at the ann arbor film festival. i am a film student at the univeristy of michigan so i know a thing or two about film. and crispin glover's film is outrageous. he basically exploits the mentally challenged. not only is shirly temple the anti-christ (which i admit is a little funny) telling the mentally challenged to kill each other, but there is an obsession with killing snails. crispin also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are, mentally challenged. peta and human rights should be all over this thing. it's not 'counter-culture' as crispin stated at the ann arbor film festival, it's exploitation.
