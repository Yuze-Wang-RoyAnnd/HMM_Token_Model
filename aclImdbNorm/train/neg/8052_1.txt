i sat through this turkey because i hadn't seen it before, and because the premise sounded like it had potential. it was mildly entertaining until the hurricane sequence. at the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house, yet the trees in the background are perfectly upright and not a leaf is moving! in fact, when the characters move outside the house, bright sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops. at that point, whatever credence the filmmakers had developed evaporated faster than the highly localized rain in their film. too bad all hurricanes aren't like this one, it would surely help our homeowners insurance rates here in the sunshine state.
