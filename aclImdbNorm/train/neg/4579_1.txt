"what the bleep do we know!?" was one of the worst times i have spent at the movies. it was less of a movie and more of an after school special, but at the same time nothing special at all. the attempt at a narrative in which they grounded their ideas was absolutely pathetic, which almost anyone will tell you. marlee matlin in her underwear just shouldn't happen. i won't dwell on it. what i will reveal is a criticism that many are unable to formulate. this movie, while tedious, also suffered a tremendous flaw in reasoning. it was horribly contradictory because it took such a manipulative, become a creator of your life, manifestation of abundance, shoeless piece of propaganda. interconnectivity is explained as a large party of our existence. however, the movie encourages that we control our surroundings with our minds. it completely neglects that there are other people with minds that could be controlling us, which seems to be more the case. or at least the structures in which we exist greatly limit us. in this way, the movie was inappropriately solipsistic. solipsism and interconnectivity just don't mix unless you're god almighty. if you are, you will be impressed (?!?) by all the neat things this movie will reveal that you can do. if not, you will be sorely disappointed, a moron, or perhaps both. also, the title is so ridiculous, i have trouble warning people not to see the movie because i feel retarded mentioning it by name. shame on everyone involved.
