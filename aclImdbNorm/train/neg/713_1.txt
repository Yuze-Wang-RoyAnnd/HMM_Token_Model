can i please say first of all, that i felt so strongly about this movie that i signed up to imdb specifically to review it. and my review? this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />the synopsis of the movie sounded interesting- nazis, occult, time travel, etc., but the movies plot failed to properly bring all these elements together. remember the episode of south park that featured manatees writing family guy using 'idea balls'? did these manatees also write unholy? its like the writer wanted to include all these different ideas, but had no idea how to link them all together, and then to make things make even less sense, included a donnie darko-esquire time travel theme to the ending, messing up the chronology.<br /><br />i could tell from early on that this was a bad movie. special effects were too low budget for anything better than straight to dvd. the acting wasn't great, but in fairness i've seen worse. i will praise the nazi paintings, they were creepy, but the evil nazi butcher guy was just comic.<br /><br />i don't have a vendetta against this movie or anything, but to be honest, i'm not even into the horror genre. but this movie cannot be described as a thriller or a drama. if this story had been well told, this would have been a good movie. but it has been over hyped. waaaaay over hyped.
