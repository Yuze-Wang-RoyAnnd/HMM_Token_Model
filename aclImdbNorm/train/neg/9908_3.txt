i gave this 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open-ended and left unexplained, and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way, plus scenes of a decaying corpse. <br /><br />neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic manner.<br /><br />the film's plot, such as it is, concerns three loosely interconnecting stories, none of which conclude satisfactorily.<br /><br />the bounty hunter, played by bruce dern, is the character that connects all three vignettes.<br /><br />first we have dylan mcdermott, looking darn fine, as a wanted criminal who is fleeing to mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter, when he rides through a border town and spots a sad-faced saloon girl played by helen hunt.<br /><br />then we have one of the hemingway girls, not sure which one, playing a western wife out on the lonely frontier who goes over to see about a neighbor woman, an attractive redhead, whom we soon realize has been out in the badlands a little too long.<br /><br />the conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him, with the final scene in the film being completely beyond rational comprehension.
