the good thing about this that's at least fresh: almost no movies about dance music and the club scene (if even made) hit the cinemas. and it radiates lots of energy too, from the music to the portrayal of ibiza.<br /><br />but the main problem is that it can't decide what it wants to be. although it definitely likes to be a mockumentary in the line of this is spinal tap, the makers also realized they wouldn't want to play copycat. however, it fails grossly on the jokes because it's not very well written and most characters are underdeveloped. and it has no arc in its script and directing to make it to 90 minutes, so why not edit it down to 75? the production department and cinematography still try to save the day (e.g. paul's home).<br /><br />in a strange way and unexpectedly so it's all gone pete tong works much better as a simple drama in the line of almost famous. especially the scenes with beatriz batarda offer some acting power.<br /><br />conclusion: it's a mess, it somewhat entertains at a basic level, but you better spend a night in your favorite club.
