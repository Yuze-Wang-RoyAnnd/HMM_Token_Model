what a bad, bad movie! i tried watching without fast forwarding...that failed. after about 30 minutes i stopped the movie, went on-line to see how many minutes this disaster was. (only 84 minutes, whew!) it was a confusing, boring movie. i don't think anyone can get knocked down by getting hit with a fluorescent bulb much less gutted by one!! the one funny thing is that i watched "the killer cut" version of the movie. the box boldly states "more blood!" "more sex!" "more terror than the theatrical release!" yikes! if this movie was horrible with all those claims i wonder just how lame the "un-killer cut" was??? if you want to see a great movie about the world of the living & the world of the dead watch any of the night of the living dead series!!
