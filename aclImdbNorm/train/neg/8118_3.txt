well, eyeboy, i must say that it pleases me to no end when someone singles me out and tries to make fun of me, especially when it is someone who seems as intelligent as you do. my favorite part of your post was "but no big bang-bang good-guy bad-guy here, kimosabe. me suggest you stick to movie with lotsa bang bang."<br /><br />well said! i do like action movies, especially if they are well done, but i also like movies that don't have a whole lot of action, as long as they are well done. i'm sorry, but secret's and lies does not fit into that category and is simply a very bad movie. i really don't see very many non-american films, so maybe i was spoiled, and didn't realize how bad foreign films really were when i saw secrets and lies. perhaps if i judge foreign movies by a different standard i could some day see how secrets and lies could possibly be one of the highest rated movies on the imdb. hmm... if true, that is very scary.<br /><br />jeremy barger bits@midohio.net(new e-mail)
