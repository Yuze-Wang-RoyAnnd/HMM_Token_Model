this movie was terrible to say the least. i was hoping for a lot better after seeing "high school musical". the whole entire movie was a complete rip off of "the simple life", only it wasn't a reality show.<br /><br />the acting was not good at all. amanda michalka had her moments, when she wasn't that terrible. on the other hand alyson michalka was bad all the way through. chris gallinger, who played the love interest of amanda was playing a french guy, but had an awful accent. one good thing about this movie was the completely adorable michael trevino, who played alyson's love interest. just something to keep in mind, if this movie had been aired before "high school musical" it probably would not have seemed as bad. but it was no comparison.<br /><br />overall i give it a 2.
