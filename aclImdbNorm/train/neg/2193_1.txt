a demented scientist girlfriend is decapitated so he brings her head back to life. honest this is the plot of the movie. he try's to get her another body he searches through the sleaze area of town for that perfect body. for some reason he has ugly looking monster in a closet at his cabin. the sleaze style of the movie is laughable. no one in the movie can actually act including the head. the closet monster is a man with a mask tie on and you can really tell. the plot is slow, weak and the ending is so badly done. watch the mystery science theater 3000 version of this move. believe me folks i wouldn't watch this movie on its own.
