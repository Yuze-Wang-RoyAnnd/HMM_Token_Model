this is yet another depressing and boring film about aids and tragedy. it begins very uneventful and predictable and continues throughout the movie. i kept waiting for it to pick-up, but unfortunately it never did. the acting is fair, but the script needs a lot of work. and if you're looking for the nudity, don't waste your time with these not so hot actors. due to the poor sound quality and lack of captions, i missed 1/8 of the movie. if you have never seen over five gay films, or have recently come to terms with being gay, you may find this film interesting, otherwise it's your run-of-the-mill low budget movie. it ranks as one of the worst gay films i have ever seen.
