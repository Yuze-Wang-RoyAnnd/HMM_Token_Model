bo is jane parker, whose long-lost anthropologist father (richard harris, in the worst role of a very inconsistent career) is in africa studying something or another. she tracks him down (how?) and he tells her of the natives' stories of a giant monster whose nightly howling can be heard throughout the jungle. turns out to be the ape man himself (miles o'keeffe, who has the film's best dialogue), who rescues her from bad guys and falls in love with her, leaving them just enough time in this agonizing two hours to romp naked while a horny monkey looks on and cheers. normally i'm very open-minded to varying opinions about any film, but this is the sole exception. this is the worst film ever made. if you don't agree, you haven't seen it. (notes: newsday called it "unendurable," which is the best one-word summary i can think of. the maltin movie guide comments that they almost had to think of a rating lower than bomb.)
