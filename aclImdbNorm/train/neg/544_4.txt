pros: akshay kumar's performance(is it just me or does this guy always manages to trump ab in their movies together?). some touching scenes in the 2nd half.<br /><br />cons: the whole 1st hour(the jokes were flat to say the least). every scene involving rajpal yadav. major stupidity in ab's decision making. let me get this straight, he believes brutally insulting his son's soul in every possible way(that will likely ruin their relationship beyond repair) is a better way for him to make akshay finally take some responsibility then actually telling him the truth?? wtf? he considers akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his old father is soon gonna die due to cancer, but thinks insulting him will make him stronger? am i the only one who doesn't see the logic here? easily the movie's biggest flaw.<br /><br />- akshay becoming a stunt man. lmao!! we're told he finished 1st in college every year and has a degree in mba. but when the time arrives to support himself, and his pregnant wife, he becomes a stunt man. lol!! how abt actually applying for a normal job in ur field? or heck, anywhere else where ur life isn't in danger? this is some incredibly dumb writing.<br /><br />- the ending. i hate this sort of melodramatic crap. everything is pushed down our throats to feel sorry for ab's character, which i couldn't. the entire thing reminded me a little too much of srk in khnh(which i hate). this "please feel sorry for the guy with the illness" crap has run its course. i felt more like puking than sympathy for the old man. couldn't watch the final 20 or so minutes because of it and thus had to fast fwd. the whole thing.<br /><br />bottomline: waqt is just too dumb to be called a good movie. its obvious director vipul shah targeted this at the emotionally fragile chicas and oldies who could care less about a story that actually makes sense. give 'em some decent song picturizations, fancy outfits, plenty of glycerin-filled scenes and some star power and they'll happily lap-up crap like this.
