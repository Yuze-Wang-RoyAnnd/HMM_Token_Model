this film is a portrait of the half-spastic teenage boy benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his lousy marks in math. he didn't make the best experiences in life before and got serious self-esteem issues. after a rough start at his new school, he starts making friends, falls in love with a girl and does some american pieish teenage stuff.<br /><br />beside some comedy elements, the film is told in a very serious way, focussing on benjamin and his problems.<br /><br />if you already don't like this story outline, save your time and watch something else. if you do, please be aware of the following:<br /><br />1) benjamin is a total loser. whatever he does, he does it terribly wrong and then he goes for self-pity all the time. for me he wasn't that kind of "charming loser" who you can feel sympathy for and laugh with. instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind i could barely stand watching.<br /><br />2) the film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters just aren't (except for janosch maybe). and yes, i know this film is based on an auto-biography written by a 17-year old - but having some experiences with german schools and german youth myself, i don't believe him.<br /><br />3) showing the sexual awakening really is an important thing for a film with this subject. but i doubt that teenage boys do an "ejaculate on the cookie"-contest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during mass-masturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the sperm-wet cookie afterwards. although it kinda amused me in a contemptible way, it's nor funny neither underlining the serious attempts of this film.<br /><br />4) there's a sub-plot about benjamin's family and his father betraying his wife - still, i don't know why it's there and where to put it. it just bored me.<br /><br />well, i personally hated this film for having the character of benjamin, being without a message, concept, scheme, whatever and it's failing attempts to be dramatic and serious. however, i can image that some people may find it sensible and touching. if you liked "the other sister" you'll probably like this one, too. i hated both.<br /><br />17-year old boys shouldn't write an autobiography and if they do, it doesn't seem to be the best idea to make a film out of it.<br /><br />2 out of 10.
