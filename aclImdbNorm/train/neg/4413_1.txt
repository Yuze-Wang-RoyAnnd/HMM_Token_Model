broad enough for you? wait till you see this heavy handed<br /><br />adaption of a little collegiate one act. what is shocking and wild in<br /><br />college rarely holds up over time, and this is proof. to take on the<br /><br />catholic church with broadside humor just isn't shocking or<br /><br />interesting or funny, it's kind of boring. the performers are all<br /><br />game, giving all they've got, but it's basically a play that doesn't<br /><br />open up to film well. not a lot of fun.
