the funniest scene of this movie is probably when our saviours get their medals and plaques and whatnot. so the basic idea is, the police outnumbers these gangsters by like a million to one, but they're powerless because the villains' guns are just a bit bigger. i guess police ammo just kinda bounces of. they decided to shoot this movie in documentary style with fake interviews and all and seriously, what is wrong with these guys? they're talking like they were armed with rolled-up newspapers. okay i admit, it's probably still dangerous to be in the line of the fire, even when the situation is so much to your advantage, but don't go nuts. and why the hell did it take 44 minutes to solve everything anyway? i'd say that's a very long time when you have them surrounded and you're allowed to shoot. they're like ten ft. away, they hit absolutely nothing. then they go and buy bigger guns themselves to increase their heroism. and then yeah, there you have it, one of the cops actually hits someone. bullet was probably diverted by a lamp post or something. i had a good laugh i guess.
