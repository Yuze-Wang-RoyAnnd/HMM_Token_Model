strange... i like all this movie crew and dark humor movies; but didn't like this one at all! it's awful, horrible and surely not funny at all. pity cannot do a whole movie plot, disgust either. and it was really boring. long empty moments fills the movie; it could have been removed. it should have been in another shorter format, surely. maybe i expected too much from the crew - like saving the movie lol -. it's also filled with overused clich'es of characters and situations... i don't get it why people liked it... "poetry", "hope"; nope 'mam, didn't see anything like that! ^^ all in all, it's empty and crude, pitiful and hopeless. oh darn this one........
