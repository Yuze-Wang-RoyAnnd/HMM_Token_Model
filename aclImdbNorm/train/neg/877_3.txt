i was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic "private lessons" which portrays the dream of any male teenager.<br /><br />"private lessons ii" has nothing to do with the title i mention. it's just a regular soft-core cinemax flick that won't make a change in your life. there's just one hot sex scene in a rooftop but that's it. i watched this a long time ago but believe me, this is just a regular boring soft core flick.<br /><br />the women are hot but that's not enough to rent or buy the movie. my advice is to watch this only if it airs on cable.
