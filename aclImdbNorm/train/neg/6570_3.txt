i've never found charley chase very funny, even though his on-screen character sometimes reminds me of john cleese, whom i find very funny. (charley chase also reminds me of gowky hen broon from scotland's 'sunday post' comics page.) in chase's best films, i tend to admire his professionalism rather than laughing at him. i'll give chase credit that his very best films -- such as 'mighty like a moose' and 'his wooden wedding' -- have inspired a fandom who are fiercely loyal to him ... but i'm positive that even the most die-hard chase fan will agree that the very early and very crude 'married to order' just isn't funny at all.<br /><br />chase -- eager, awkward, gormless, naff -- is a young swain hoping to court the fair rose. oliver hardy gives the best performance in this film as her blowhard father, who disdains chase as a 'mollycoddle'. leo white, who did more notable work as a foil for chaplin at essanay, is on hand here as a rival.<br /><br />there's some action involving an ingersoll watch. i was intrigued that the brand name is mentioned in the dialogue titles: is this an early example of product-placement? <br /><br />sadly, a major flaw in 'married to order' is the casting of rosemary theby as rose: she's meant to be a standard-issue ingenue, but theby -- flat-chested, hawk-faced -- is physically wrong for the role. theby (the wife of harry myers) had a successful career as a screen actress, but was never a believable ingenue. film historian william k everson dealt with her very dismissively in one of his film books.<br /><br />i'll rate 'married to order' just 3 out of 10, and i'm being charitable ... because i keep suspecting that charley chase has got something that everyone else gets but i keep missing.
