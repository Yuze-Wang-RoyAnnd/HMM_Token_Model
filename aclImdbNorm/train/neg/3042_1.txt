i'm allowed to write 1000 words about this film, but one word could suffice: bizarre. hubby and i didn't laugh so much as gawk at this truly dreadful movie. we kept looking at each other with our best "what the...?" expressions. there is no way to adequately describe this movie. killer tomatoes were funny, but this is just sick. what kind of mind produces images like these and then puts them on film for others to see? what kind of mind includes innocent children in this weird, weird movie and then packages it as if it is appropriate for children? parents, whatever you do, if your child still believes in santa, don't let him/her see this movie. preteens can watch it -- probably with "what the...?" expressions on their faces. if you decide to inflict this movie on others, you might want to spike their eggnog.<br /><br />quite possibly the worst film ever made.
