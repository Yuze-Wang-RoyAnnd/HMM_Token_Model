watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of sandler. truly a slow and painful death.<br /><br />'bought the dvd in the $5.88 bin at wal mart. but the thought that keeps echoing in my head is, "how can i get my money back?"<br /><br />the most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat just does not sink!<br /><br />best constructive suggestion: mystery comedy theatre. you know that show on the scifi channel in which some guy and his muppet-machines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks (mystery science theatre). immediately, spin off a comedy program and feature this flick. without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck, i fear that viewers may actually begin following sandler with ice picks and chainsaws.<br /><br />
