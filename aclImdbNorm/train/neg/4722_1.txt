don't watch this serbian documentary and serbian propaganda look out for this documentary and you will see facts and truth http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/<br /><br />the death of yugoslavia documentary series (of five episodes) is a painstakingly compiled and researched account of the extended mass-bloodshed which marked the end of the old federal yugoslavia and spanned almost the entire first half of the 1990's. it includes a huge wealth of news footage and interviews with involved parties both "yugoslav" and otherwise. the only real "improvement" which could be made to this amazing achievement would be the inclusion of later developments in the balkans since the program was made. this was indeed done in the late 1990's for a repeat showing on bbc television, but the addition of some even more recent events would help to complete this admirably detailed and fulsome piece of work. perhaps another whole episode might be warranted? the very succinct title of this documentary was made all the more appropriate by the eventual abandonment of the term "yugoslavia" by the now-named federal republic of serbia and montenegro - a much belated and formal admission of that which occurred years before.<br /><br />not fiction like in "yugoslavia: the avoidable war (1999)"
