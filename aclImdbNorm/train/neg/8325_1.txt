i just saw this movie last night and, being someone who had very low expectations to begin with, was still disappointed. the most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point (the guy being awake during the surgery), had nothing to do with the outcome. it would have ended the same way regardless. so, what was the point of this? who knows. also, this surgeon had 4 malpractice suits against him and he didn't think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table? give me a break. jessica alba is completely talentless and christiansen is almost as bad. the whole thing was just laughable from start to finish. i'm fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel, you would be in more pain than that.
