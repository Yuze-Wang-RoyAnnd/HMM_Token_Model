i have to admit, i don't remember much about the characters or the story, though i'm not sure there was one, i was soooo irritated by this movie that i had a bit of a hard time focusing on it. how can you name a movie "keys to tulsa" and then film it in texas? the flat desert country around arlington ( i think that was the location) in no way resembles the green rolling hills around tulsa, and a celebrity in tulsa would have a much nicer neighborhood to live in. obviously no one in the movie has ever been to tulsa or else they would have realized how nothing in the movie even resembled it. hadn't anyone at least seen rumblefish or the outsiders? i know this sounds picky but i can't help it. i watched this because i love james spader and i usually find eric stotz interesting. but even these two intriguing actors could not liven up this meandering,and mean story of self-involved people who are not in tulsa!! i'm sorry, it can't be more expensive to film in oklahoma. what if "to live and die in la" had been shot in toronto? would that suck? well so does this.
