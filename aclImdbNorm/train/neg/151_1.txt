this is really terrible.<br /><br />the only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie i have ever watched, i would have a suitable reply.<br /><br />i think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell. i wouldn't have bothered commenting but i noticed some fanboys (probably connected to the movie) had claimed that this was the best movie since the matrix. let me debunk the myths and lies.<br /><br />there is nothing good in the movie. everything yells tacky. the actress is ugly. the fight choreography is the worst i have ever seen. the fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish. imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn't hurt a kitten. obviously, the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie.<br /><br />i know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before. unforgivable.
