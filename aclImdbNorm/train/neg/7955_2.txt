carrie fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this movie during a period of her life when she had a heavy cocaine problem, and she doesn't remember very much of it. that would explain why she made this film, but it doesn't explain why anyone else in the cast or crew did; i can't believe that everybody had a coke problem. this has to be one of the absolute worst movies ever made, and that's saying something. the blame can't be laid at the feet of "director" tim kincaid or "writer" buddy giovinazzo, as it is obvious that this picture wasn't written or directed by anyone. apparently it just spontaneously came together, as there is little evidence of coherency, consistency, design, plot, sense, intelligence or anything else. what is really amazing is that there were some actual professionals who were involved in this glop. co-star robert joy has done good work in other films, and composer jimmie haskell and cinematographer arthur marks are both industry veterans, marks also having been a director, and not a bad one. why they got involved in this steaming pile of offal is beyond comprehension. tim kincaid, the alleged "director", has made quite a few low-rent sci-fi and horror films, and, having seen most of them, i can tell you that not a one of them is any good. this one, though, is by far the worst thing he's ever done, and that is a major accomplishment on his part. everything, absolutely everything, about this movie is 12th-rate--at best. the cinematography is terrible, the acting is laughable, the "special effects" make "plan 9 from outer space" look like "spider-man", the story is trite, derivative and stupid. don't waste your time even looking at the video box cover, let alone renting it. a complete, utter, annoying, total dud.
