"feast of all saints?" where...? when...?<br /><br />was the feast of all saints storyline and theme edited out? <br /><br />what a waste of a wonderful title! there is never anything in the story that has the remotest connection to the "feast of all saints." nor is there anything in the story about "all souls day" which the term is referencing. why bother to use this title if you never intend to including any kind of storyline or theme about "all souls day" or the "feast of all saints"? <br /><br />embarrassly bad script & amateur writing <br /><br />how did they attract such great talent to this clunker? the writing is so amateur--characters that have known each other all their life go into big long speeches about their life history for the sake of the audience. not at all the way people talk to each other. <br /><br />what was the director thinking?<br /><br />the directing is equally bad! the forced and overly deliberate style feels amateurish. in one scene, a character is yelling "take your hands off of me" and no one is touching him! the most badly directed scene however, is the incredibly over-the-top battle scene at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />excessive gore in a very fake, silly battle scene<br /><br />there are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene. it looks like a saturday night live skit!! you can see extras waiting for their cues to walk across camera. everyone plays their death scene like 4th grade boys--exaggerating every little gasp and twitch. the blood on battle victims is so excessive and carelessly applied it looks like someone used a ketchup dispenser and just squirted straight lines of red on the costumes.<br /><br />this whole battle scene comes off as the spoof of a really cheesy war movie. you almost expect someone like will ferrell and mike myers to ride up on a horse and deliver the punchline.<br /><br />who in real life would ever behave this way?! <br /><br />the most ridiculous bit of writing, directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene: <br /><br />a little girl is standing under the dead body of her hanging father--who is terribly mutilated, and literally dripping blood form his gaping wounds. even a totally idiot would know he is dead! yet she is--very monotonously--repeating over and over "daddy, daddy..." while looking at someone off-screen. she delivered it with about as much believability and passion as you could expect from an non-actor kid that had been repeating the line for the cameras all day.<br /><br />even if the poor kid had any acting skills, the scene is completely unbelievable. the little girl wouldn't even be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage--surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies, while she calmly stands there!! natural instincts would had the kid screaming and terrified, running away from the bloody carnage! <br /><br />are we suppose to be horrified or laugh...?!<br /><br />one particularly goofy detail, that gives the scene an snl satire tone, is the father hanging, with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek. he looks like a fish on a hook! the unintentionally funny details, make the whole scene come across as fake and silly.<br /><br />in fantasy la-la-land, mothers and daughters are the same age! <br /><br />another funny detail, is that you see a central character--the little girl's mother--at the end of the scene and in the next scene, that occurs 20+ years later, she looks exactly the same! she is still young and beautiful, and now the same age as her daughter! <br /><br />i almost turned the movie off right there because the direction and writing were obviously awful--but i tried to stick it out because i wanted to see the louisiana settings and i like all the actors. i don't know what these fine actors were thinking when they accepted these roles!<br /><br />who was the targeted audience?<br /><br />the excessive amount of blood and badly acted violence in the opening scene are weirdly out of place with the soap opera storytelling tone that follows. it is also a strange way to start a movie that, for the rest of the time, seems targeted to romance novel reading females. weird inconsistency in tone!
