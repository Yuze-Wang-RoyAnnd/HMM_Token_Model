a huge hit upon release with australian audiences, it can still be funny today, but its over-the-top political incorrectness and blunt, unsubtle humour can make it a bit of a cringer. it goes on far too long; some of<br /><br /> the content could have been saved for the sequel, barry mckenzie holds his own, which desperately needed some new stuff anyway. granted, his ocker aussie attitude is funny, but also becomes annoying as the film drags on. some say crocker's songs are the best bits, and they are certainly original, but "hilarious"? the adventures of barry mckenzie will go down as a landmark in australian cinema, but we should do everything in our power to make sure that overseas audiences do not see the majority of australians as barry mckenzies (or, for that matter, mick dundees!). rating: 5/10
