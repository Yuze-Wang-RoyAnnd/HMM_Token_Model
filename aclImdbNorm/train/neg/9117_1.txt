... or maybe it just is this bad. the plot is a cheap rehash of the first, which is weird, since it's supposed to be a prequel, not a sequel. pretty much the entire movie seems like a cheap remake of the first, with scenes mimicking the things that happened in the first, only a lot more ridiculous and unlikely. where the first had a great cast, this one consist of b-list actors and rejects. the acting is mostly horrendously bad. half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first, as is nearly every major character, including the ones who weren't in the first movie. i realize this was made up by a tv series pilot episode, but that's no excuse. they didn't have to turn the (bad) footage into a movie. only one thing is marginally good, and that's the erotic sequences. however, as these are nowhere near as good as the ones in the first, even this isn't raising it above a rating of 1. if you have a chance to see it for free, and you're a straight guy, it could be worth checking out, if you want something erotic that isn't porn. if not, avoid at all costs. 1/10
