my friends and i rented that movie last night and we had one of the greatest laughs in awhile. the movie is not supposed to be funny at all, but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any realism whatsoever. first, phillippe (i forget what his character is called and i don't really care) uses his regular employee id to go through all the top-security terminals. not only is that pathetic but it gets topped when his enormous efforts culminate in his finding the so-scary lego-room, which hosts the super computers. this is plain funny. the tense mood that we are supposed to experience is completely spoilt by the childish looking room. the ending, like all else, is very very very cheesy, especially when the bad guy's lawyer shows up 'right on time'. anyway, this movie is a good laugh. if you need something to make fun of, definitely see it.
