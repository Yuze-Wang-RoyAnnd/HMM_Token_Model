okay, i've always been a fan of batman. i loved the animated series, and even batman beyond. i even read a batman comic now and then. so as can be imagined--i was a little excited when i heard about this series, and then i was severely disappointed. this series is nothing. it doesn't even begin to compare with the original series. it's like one long toy commercial. no depth whatsoever. and what the heck was with the joker? who,in my most humble opinion, is the best batman villain of all time and they killed him. i wish i could say his design was the worst part. actually, i wish i could say there was anything about this series that was remotely creative or interesting. in short (because believe me i could say so much more)do not waste your time on this show, or your money.
