hey hulu.com is playing the elvira late night horror show on their site and this movie is their under the name monsteroid, good fun to watch elvira comment on this crappy movie ....have fun with bad movies. anyways this movie really has very little value other than to see how bad the 70's were for horror flicks bad effects, bad dialog, just bad movie making. avoid this unless you want to laugh at it. while you are at hulu check out the other movies that are their right now there is 10 episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good plots and production and you can watch a lot of them in 480p as long as you have a decent speed connection.
