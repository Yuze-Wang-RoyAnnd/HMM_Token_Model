years ago a movie going friend and i went to see a horror film that we thought would be good because it starred john cassavetes. for the uninitiated, john cassavettes was an actor, screen writer and director (married to actress gena rowlands), nominated for oscars three times, who wrote and directed a variety of good low-budget films using his income as an actor to keep himself afloat. up until seeing the incubus, we did not understand that john cassavetes income was made from any movie that was offered to him. had we known what the film was about before seeing it we may have avoided altogether. but we did not walk out. at the time, my friend and i jokingly indicated it was the worst movie ever made. now frankly, this is not true. i have seen many poorly made films on friday nights on cinemax (did i just say that out loud?) that are far worse than the incubus. almost any movie starring brian bosworth is by definition a worse movie than the incubus. certainly santa claus conquers the martians is a worse movie than the incubus. however, i have since consistently used the incubus as a threshold below which i do not want to fall. when talking to this friend about a movie i may have seen i will always remark that it was better (or worse) than the incubus.<br /><br />http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
