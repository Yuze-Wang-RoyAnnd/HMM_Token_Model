when i saw this movie, circa 1979, it became the first movie that i ever walked out of in the middle. there is nothing worse than comedy that just misses being funny, and this misses every time (although i can't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). there was nothing original about any of the skits. while i enjoy racy humor where appropriate, these skits were needlessly vulgar. what was even more irritating was that this movie was advertised as "robin william's first movie", capitalizing on his new found fame in the "mork and mindy" television series. yet his role turned out to be so minor that you cannot even notice him on-screen.
