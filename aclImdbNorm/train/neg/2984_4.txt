i admit that the majority of this film was uninspired,but i was still entertained. it has a wonderful sense of frenetic energy,above average music,and the women in the film fiercely defend themselves,there's no prissies here. i can think of dozens of other films that were way worse,at least this one had an intriguing plotline along with some social commentary.they allude to how the military deals with viral epidemics,destroy everything in sight,even if it means the people you're supposed to be saving.also, how dangerous martial law can be since at that point democracy ceases to exist. fulci seemed to attempt to combine his earlier work(zombie,beyond,gates of hell)in an effort to somehow improve on them.he failed,but definitely not miserably,like a number of people would have you think.i have a soft spot for zombie films, so i admit that i'm somewhat biased when it comes to reviewing them.all i'm saying is that this movie is good for one time around,if there wasn't so much descension in the making of this film(fulci quit and bruno(i can hack with the best of them)mattei took over)it could have been much better and more focused.it's going to stay in my collection as fulci's zombie swan song.one surprising note, is that there is a scene in zombie 3 that cemetery man actually ripped off,i couldn't believe it myself,check it out you'll be surprised.
