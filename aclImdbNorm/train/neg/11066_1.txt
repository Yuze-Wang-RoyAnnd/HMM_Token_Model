prior to watching "dahmer," i thought no movie could be worse than "freddy got fingered." i was wrong. to sum "dahmer" up, it's a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of dahmer's encounters with gay men before they were killed. there is no plot to be found, and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about "dahmer." all you'll learn about dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men. horrible acting, horrible directing, horrible writing, horrible everything... if you have to choose between watching "dahmer" and projectile vomiting for three hours, go with the vomiting .... it wll be less painful.....
