when ritchie first burst on to movie scene his films were hailed as funny, witty, well directed and original. if one could compare the hype he had generated with his first two attempts and the almost universal loathing his last two outings have created one should consider - has ritchie been found out? is he really that talented? does he really have any genuine original ideas? or is he simply a pretentious and egotistical director who really wants to be fincher, tarantino and leone all rolled into one colossal and disorganised heap? after watching revolver one could be excused for thinking were did it all go wrong? what happened to his great sense of humour? where did he get all these mixed and convoluted ideas from? revolver tries to be clever, philosophical and succinct, it tries to be an intelligent psychoanalysis, it tries to be an intricate and complicated thriller. ritchie does make a gargantuan effort to fulfil all these many objectives and invests great chunks of a script into existential musings and numerous plot twists. however, in the end all it serves is to construct a severely disjointed, unstructured and ultimately unfriendly film to the audience. its plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that although ritchie does at least attempt to give his own spin he should be punished for even trying to pass it off as his own work. so what the audience gets ultimately is a terrible screenplay intertwined with many pretentious oneliners and clumsy setpieces.<br /><br />revolver is ultimately an unoriginal and bland movie that has stolen countless themes from masterpieces like fight club, usual suspects and pulp fiction. it aims high, but inevitably shots blanks aplenty.<br /><br />revolver deserves to be lambasted, it is a truly poor film masquerading as a wannabe masterpiece from a wannabe auteur. however, it falls flat on its farcical face and just fails at everything it wants to be and achieve.
