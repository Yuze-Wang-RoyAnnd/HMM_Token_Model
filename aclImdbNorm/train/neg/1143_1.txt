even 20+ years later, ninja mission stands out as the worst movie i ever managed to sit through. scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene, fire their obnoxiously noisy sub-machine guns with wild abandon, and then silently leave. wow, how will we find those silent invisible assassins? just follow the shell casings and smoke!painfully bad dialog (or was it brilliant and just poorly translated?), not an asian in sight in the cast, and a whopping total of 3 asians among the stunt crew. the plot is ridiculous, the acting pretty much non-existent - then again, ninja can't act! save yourselves - avoid watching at all costs!
