there are movies that are awful, and there are movies that are so awful they are deemed long-forgotten and unwatchable. also, lots of violence and bad stuff (not just cheesy stuff; you know what i mean) add to the mix as well. what is the result of bad movies with such raunchy content? why, "final justice," of course! <br /><br />remember "mitchell?" joe don baker was the star of that movie, and that was riffed by joel and the bots on "mystery science theater 3000." now this time, with mike taking joel's place on the satellite of love (but with the same bots), that trio got to make fun of mst3k's second joe don baker movie, "final justice." of course, much of the naughty stuff that i mentioned was removed for television release, but still, i want to watch that episode (and "mitchell" as well), because what does joe don "hate" the most? why, none other than "mystery science theater 3000!" <br /><br />p.s. if you have a big lots nearby, check that store for the uncut tape! lol that happened to another user!
