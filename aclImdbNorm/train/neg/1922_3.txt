about the baby: why wasn't big brother assuming he'd be hungry for a bottle or some nourishment or a diaper change? he should have been screaming non-stop after that many hours without care. definitely stupid to take the baby from a safe place when he didn't need to.<br /><br />and why was the road miraculously clear whenever anyone wanted to drive somewhere? didn't any uprooted trees fall on the roads and block them?<br /><br />i can't imagine the cops at the roadblock not immediately following after any young person who would crash it, especially when they said it was dangerous to go there.<br /><br />that being said, it was nice to have a movie children could safely watch, for a change.
