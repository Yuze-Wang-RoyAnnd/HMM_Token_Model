i've seen my fair share of badly thought-out endings and final twists to films, but i don't recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did.<br /><br />the film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would 'surprise' us all.... and it did, but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped. i was left feeling surprised that connery, harris, fishburn and capshaw had anything to do with this turkey, individually or collectively.<br /><br />the film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and i like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall. but once the twist was revealed, the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable, the underlying motive for revenge was ill-conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for bobby earl was ridiculously far-fetched. what's worse is that, once the twist was revealed, the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable.<br /><br />harris gave a terrific performance and connery is like morgan freeman in that he never gives a bad performance, even if the movie ain't that great! so all in all, it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. the last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema.
