i usually try to construct reasonably well-argued critiques of films, but i can not believe this got past the script stage. the dialogue is appalling, the acting very dodgy, the accents just awful, and the direction and pacing is scrappy at best.<br /><br />i don't remember the last time i saw a film quite this bad. joseph fiennes, pretty as he is, might just have killed his career as quickly as it started.<br /><br />the island of doctor moreau was no worse than this garbage.
