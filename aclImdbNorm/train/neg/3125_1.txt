boris karloff is matthias morteval, a dying, lonely old nut who lives in morhenge mansion with some servants and tells his doctor friend, "don't try to doctor me, doctor! i'm disgustingly healthy!" he invites his nieces and nephews to his home and warns them they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness by "shrinking the brain" (?)<br /><br />***spoilers***<br /><br />morteval/karloff ends up dying, and murderous "toys" (designed by his dead brother) start killing off the relatives. a mini cannon fires real bullets into a guys face, a life-sized knight in armor attacks with an axe and a dancing sheik stabs people with a knife. one guy getting strangled makes some hilarious faces. at the end, julissa and her boyfriend find karloff is still alive and hiding out in the dungeon where steel gates seal off the room. he plays the recurring organ theme music (sort of a death rattle used for the killings), the brother's spirit starts talking ("the whole house will go with me!") and the mansion goes up in flames.<br /><br />this senseless mess is too dark, boring and the stupid dialogue never matches the lips.
