just got back from a free screening and i'm very glad i didn't pay to see this very sub-par film. the theater was full and the crowd was a mix of kids and adults. it seemed like it was just the kids who were laughing at all the slap-stick and fart jokes though (good god they loved to hit these poor mice in the crotch a lot!). the movie is pretty juvenile, unintelligent, predictable, and mostly annoying. the characters just seem to be thrown together to fill in empty space and the relationships between them all seemed very forced with no charm at all.<br /><br />visually, the film is about average with nothing that really stands out. they did a decent job of mimicking the clay look from wallace and gromit, but other than that it's very forgettable imagery.<br /><br />although i was really bored throughout the whole film, i chuckled a couple times. it's not an absolute failure, but i most definitely would not want to watch it again. if you're a parent with kids (and you don't care that your kids see mindless cheap-jokes) then feel free to take them to see it, but everyone else shouldn't waste their money.
