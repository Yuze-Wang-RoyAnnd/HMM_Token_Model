i normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie, however this was an unique case. this movie was so bad that i actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was wasted. needless to say i was brutally disappointed. set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation, this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing. first, there are gaping plot holes. second, very few of the c-list (i don't even dare call them b) actors can act worth a damn, so any scenes that have potential fail miserably. third, the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult, leading to very few surprises for the audience. fourth and most importantly, the ending is completely anti-climatic partially because of how it ends (setting/who the killer turns out to be) and partially because the dialog is just atrocious. to the films credit, it is the only movie that i will ever say is the worst movie i have ever scene, and i've seen a lot.<br /><br />so, just like a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling no, you really don't as you run in the opposite direction.
