i myself am a big fan of low-budget 80's horror films. this isn't the worst but still not to spectacular. the plot line is decent but drags out way too long. you're through half the movie before you even get to see any zombie action. the kills aren't very creative and the zombies aren't too crafty. i truly think this movie would have been better if they left out the zombies and just made it into some mafia flick. it's watchable but i feel that this film did steal at least an hour of my life. i'll give the film credit for being somewhat original. if you are really into b horror movies it's worth a viewing but if you're not, don't bother. but you don't have to take my word for it.
