this movie was an attempt to go into places most don't and perhaps shouldn't venture into. it was a similar trial at the bizarre, head-case perspective given to us in the cell, although not near as in-depth and well portrayed. the plot is constructed simply with an initial campy feel to it. then, as the movie takes its supposed "dramatic" turn, the plot falls apart on what few legs it had to stand on in the first place. <br /><br />basically the idea is that of a kid (chris mckenna) who needs money. he takes on the role of a hit man, killing a city accountant. then he doesn't get paid for his work but instead gets tortured for several days because he dreamed up the "brilliant" idea of trying to use a backup file he had as leverage for payment. this idiotic move at trying to force them to pay him backfires as he is horribly and endlessly abused. he begins to go crazy (some very disturbing scenes). then, thinking he has paid for his sins and can start over, he visits the wife (kari wuhrer) of the man who he killed and wins her affections. soon after she discovers who he is, tragedy strikes, and revenge sweeps through the air as the boy goes after his torturers (daniel baldwin, george wendt, vernon wells) for their previous "kindness".<br /><br />i got to ask though, what is it with kari wuhrer and horror/gore type films?<br /><br />it seems everything she has put out lately has been in this genre. granted, i liked her in "eight-legged freaks" and she was okay in "anaconda". but despite all her obvious cuteness and allure (wow, she's hot!), she can act much better and chose better roles. or maybe, i'm wrong and that is just a misconception. for all you guys out there, you get to see the "fully monty" of her in this film, although it's rather bizarre and short-lived. i almost felt like she did some soft-porn after watching this film (something not foreign to kari's career). the sex-simulation is such that it has to make you wonder what things really go on during filming. <br /><br />anyway, i will say there is some good acting. just don't expect much of it from daniel balwin, whose career seems forever destined to second his brother alex's. the film did bring out a few old greats though, george wendt (norm from cheers) and vernon wells (commando, weird science). above all, chris mckenna does the best job in playing the main character, sean crawley. his little acting experience and yet his believable nature as a naive youth, bring some elements of substance to the film. <br /><br />i wouldn't go out of my way for this one. if you're bored and are tired of the same old episodes of "the hitchhiker", then i might advise watching this.<br /><br />and kari, please start acting in some better films!
