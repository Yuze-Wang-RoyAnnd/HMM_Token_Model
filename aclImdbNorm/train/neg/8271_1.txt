"handsome guys with bad haircuts !!" "beautiful girls without any clues !!" "stupid gangsters who cannot shoot straight !!" from dragon dynasty comes the hong kong gangster drama, "dragon heat." for reasons which will probably forever be completely obscured, the production and casting call for this 'criminals-on-steroids' movie somehow got both maggie q and michael biehn to sign on as villains. but they don't get all that much to do in this horrid slug-fest.<br /><br />they are two of the best contemporary actors around, each with their own resume' and list of accomplishments, and biehn in particular has had the courage to take some rather challenging and non-heroic roles.<br /><br />maggie q was the super-bad "mai" in "live free or die hard," so 'nuff said.<br /><br />biehn is, of course, famous for being the soldier-from-the-future who made "the terminator" of 1984 such a believable science-fiction/fantasy romp, by crashing up against big arnold, who is now the governator of california !! <br /><br />michael biehn is almost wholly wasted in this terrible train-wreck of a police drama. there is absolutely no reason for that, as the incredibly convoluted plot -- given mostly in chinese, as it is a hong kong story -- could have been better elaborated for non-chinese audiences with a foreign narrator.<br /><br />in other words, if biehn had been used as something like an interpol observer or coordinator, or an agent under deep cover, who needs to get some 'splaining given to him every five or ten minutes, that would have been great. but no, he's brought in as a part of an odd group of special forces-type bad guys who seem to be freelancing their own corrupt deal, in the middle of somebody else's totally corrupt deal involving the local king of corrupt deals. <br /><br />yes, there, i said it all. confused ? me too. "welcome to the party, pal."<br /><br />in the truly superb hong kong crime drama, known by its english title as "breaking news," there are also a number of fascinating characters at work, but there is only one story line in the plot. <br /><br />bad guys vs. good cops. in this wretched and excessively violent foray into the world of a hong kong triad, or gang, it seems that the hot-shot police force is little more than a parade of ducks in a shooting gallery, the way the criminals mow them down.<br /><br />so, not surprisingly, there's an almost otherwise incomprehensible scene ( several scenes, in fact ), where kids are trying to shoot wooden ducks in an arcade game, to win stuffed animal prizes. and so the hot shot good-guy police officers quite naturally intervene on their behalf, so that the arcade owner has to give up the kewpie dolls.<br /><br />there's also a half-hearted attempt at creating a "love interest" between one of the 'visiting cops' and the sole female 'visiting cop'.<br /><br />the visiting cops are supposed to be material witnesses against the triad gangster leader, who gets hijacked on the way to his court appearance, but not by his own team but by the mercenaries ( biehn, maggie q, and some others ). these killers all want something but we don't get to learn about what it is, until the very end of the film !! that was a stupid mistake inside of the overall story.<br /><br />you cannot build suspense in a crime drama without something to obtain, or get, or get away from, being introduced very early in the story.<br /><br />add to that some "cut-away scenes" done for purely artsy effects, all showing the bad-bad guys' and the regular bad guys' recent pasts, and any film buff can readily understand why this barking dog gets a 1 rating from this fan of all things cinematic with criminals and conspirators and hong kong.
