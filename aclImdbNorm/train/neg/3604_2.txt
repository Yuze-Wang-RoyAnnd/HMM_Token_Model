back in the days before the toxic avenger, the low-camp kings at troma films tried to take the high (ok, somewhat-less-low) road of producing straight slasher pics. i'd like to think that viewing the results here is what convinced them to give up all pretension and go for self-conscious parody.<br /><br />splatter university is another film for the masochists in the audience. as it meanders about through two separate casts and innumerable pointless subplots, it actually becomes painful to watch. let's see if i can summarize.<br /><br />after learning that a dangerous psychopath has escaped from a local hospital, the action moves to a catholic university (i don't recall the name, but in honor of the title, let's call it st. splatter). the students are listless and sullen, and argue pettily with each other, slackers ahead of their time. meanwhile, the new professor, julie parker, proves utterly incompetent at her job. the kids deal with relationships, infidelity, unwanted pregnancies, lecherous priests, and how to avoid doing any work in class; julie deals with a creepy boyfriend, the inflexible administration at st. splatter, counseling unwed mothers, and the blank, expressionless looks of her students. none of it means a darn thing or gets resolved in any meaningful way. oh, and every once in a while, a pov shot comes along and stabs one of the girls to death, but don't hold your breath waiting for it. there's a red herring killer, and then a sadly anticlimactic confrontation with the real killer, then it's back to the asylum and roll credits.<br /><br />the slow pace and numerous inane subplots seem almost calculated to produce a mounting sense of frustration in the viewer, which is helped along by choppy editing, coffee-can sound quality, and dialog that just doesn't make any sense. and the most agonizing thing about this movie is the killer's fixation on women - the men in this movie are just so deserving. i'd've paid good money to see someone off the jerk with the pregnant girlfriend, or the lunkhead lothario who was fooling around with his girlfriend's roommate, or any of the creepy priests. there ain't no justice.
