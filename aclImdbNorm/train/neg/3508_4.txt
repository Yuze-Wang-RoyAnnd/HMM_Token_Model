despite the overwhelming cult following for this sad "documentary," i must admit to having cordially loathed the film which struck our party as far more a distressing exploitation piece than usefully informative. that said, after seeing the magnificent stage musical drawn from it, one can appreciate what the film might have been in surer hands. <br /><br />one suspects that those many of us who actively suffered through the film may have had any campy delights its crueler fans enjoyed destroyed by the uncomfortable suspicion that too many of us - or those we know - are only a misstep or two away from the deplorable plight of the two mad women depicted who live in and contribute to a squalor they seem incapable of controlling or escaping.<br /><br />the film leaves the viewer desperately wondering how any person could have slid to this level of degradation and, unlike the musical, offers no cautionary clues or explanations, only a horror show unredeemed by humor or insight. <br /><br />this soul crushing flatness of the film makes the achievement of the stage version (hopefully to be filmed ultimately for cable) all the more remarkable. act ii is faithful in almost every detail to the film under discussion but strangely, setting the sad inmates' plight to music, raises the human tragedy to art. even more important, this act is preceded by a fine act i where we meet the women before their decent into mutually enabled madness, and are offered hints how their isolated purgatory came about. in short, everything which the film is lacking.<br /><br />to the filmmakers' credit (or their successors), the excellent criterion dvd release includes out-takes and bonus material that partially redeem the main film - behind the scenes photographs, interviews and commentary - filling in some of the blank spots the original editing consciously decided to omit in its drive for unadulterated horror and depression. they can't make the amateurish film itself satisfying, but they can at least make it a bit more comprehensible. <br /><br />ultimately though, it is only the remarkable stage piece inspired by and drawn from it by book writer doug wright, composer scott frankel and lyricist michael korie which raises the rating of the original grey gardens above a single (generous) star.
