after we counted the use of the f word, oh, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the film, listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse, and pretty much acting like 12 year old boys being naughty together, well, we turned it off. relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser hollywood movie, the product of unimaginative and no-talent writers. <br /><br />we did give it a second chance, thinking surely it would get better. no dice. later, my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved, still no dice.<br /><br />the main character did have a cool bike.<br /><br />i wouldn't recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature adolescents, or frat boys.
