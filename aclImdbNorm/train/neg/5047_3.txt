i wasn't really going to comment, but then i figured i had something to say. i saw this film two days ago and, although i think it's not a complete waste of time (it might have been of money though, for the producers), it's obvious it has serious problems. it's got really good cinematography and (little but) nice music. a lot has been said about ana cristina oliveira but, let's be honest, over what? she is not really an actress an she balances permanently between over-acting and preposterous under-acting. her performance passes for good because there has never been anyone like odete in any other film: crazy? sad? childlike? an impostor? no one knows, fellows. so she's kinda sorta dictating the rules here.<br /><br />i thought this film was also a good example of the problem most portuguese films suffer from: soundtrack. there is a permanent no to dubbing and the result is this usual mass of noise that comes out of the blue. people in other countries may think portugal is the noisiest of places. what thrilled me though, was that some of the dialog was dubbed but it didn't necessarily solve the syndrome. bad dubbing too, i must say. it's strange to watch a film in which the first thing that strikes my mind on the first scene, when the first character speaks is: it's dubbed. and all this to say that the film has technical problems.<br /><br />it also has script problems. it tries to be classical from the first to the last scene. there was a desperate fear of leaving things suspended and that shows. the writer was obviously trying to get everything straight and he does but... it shows!! all dialog is too expositive and there isn't one single piece of talk that sounds like a line from a film. it's all a little raw and slightly unpleasant.<br /><br />not that the film is a total mess, i must stress. i just think the good parts are so obvious that i prefer to concentrate on the bad ones.<br /><br />direction brings little to the weak screenplay. all shots are classical and un-innovative, but their beautiful. great work from rui pocas, by the way.<br /><br />now, what i think was the problem, the one that keeps people from believing this story and laugh throughout the film instead of taking it seriously: the guy who plays the guy who dies is obviously not an actor. actually, it's a rather important role and i can't see why non-actors are cast for such parts. this guy is neither an actor nor a good-looking man. which means the whole film rolls down the mountain, since we never believe for one second that this gorgeous woman is obsessed with him even though he's gone, and that his hunky lover who survives is actually having a bad time getting over the loss, when all we see of this character is apathy. too bad. the world is full of beautiful people who even happen to be nice seductive lovers. the world is full of good actors who are also cute boys and capable of causing obsessions on people after they's gone. the world is full of great films and also of not that great films. c'est la vie!
