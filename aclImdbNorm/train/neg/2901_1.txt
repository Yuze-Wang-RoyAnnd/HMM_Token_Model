the fact that there are positive comments about dan in real life on the imdb just makes me realize that their junket staff are hard at work trying to get people to watch this utterly horrific film.<br /><br />i have no words, no idea where to start to describe the truly awful film i sat through last night - dan in real life. steve's characters in previous films led me to believe that i would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialog but like other posters i felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the cast.<br /><br />the dialog was so contrived, the family was this cookie cutter walton's family and the film has been so many times before that i am shocked someone thought it was an original idea.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terrifyingly bad movie and don't believe everything you read on the imdb since the first comments were clearly written by folks sitting in a different theater watching a good film.
