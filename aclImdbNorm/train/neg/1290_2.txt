this movie was two and a quarter excruciating hours. someone please tell me what the point was?<br /><br />i mean, i understand the historical setting. it's supposed to be about a ragtag group of confederate bushwhackers (terrorists?) on the missouri-kansas frontier, taking revenge against all northern sympathizers and abolitionists during the u.s. civil war. but aside from gratuitous violence there wasn't really much of a point to this movie. perhaps it was a political statement? that war is really nothing much more than gratuitous violence? if that was the point it was done quite well, but i don't think that was the point. i think the producers really thought they were making a worthwhile movie here, but as far as i was concerned there was a complete lack of any plot. it seemed like i was watching a paperback novel come to life, with the characters looking like what you would see on the covers of such novels.<br /><br />this movie should be burned along with some of the towns this gang torched!
