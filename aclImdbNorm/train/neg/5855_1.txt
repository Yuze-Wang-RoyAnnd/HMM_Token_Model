the film released at the start of 2000 alongwith mela both disasters so sad to start a millennium with such nonsense<br /><br />the film seems to suit 70's but looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000<br /><br />anywayz some classic gems from the film: paresh rawal i don't understand to laugh at his role or cry reason: he goes searching his mother in the village worst part is when he realises a secret of anil he keeps the secret in his stomach which becomes big and makes him look pregnant i remember in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke urrf!!!! as a child i laughed at it that time but here?<br /><br />the whole film is a joke can't explain we have anil in a dual role(one older and younger) and rekha playing the older's wife and raveena the youngers we also have reject harish while shakti playing the son of aruna irani who both fight on who has the worst wig<br /><br />direction is outdated music is bad<br /><br />anil tries hard looks too old in the younger role and too young in the older role yet good effort rekha is adequate, raveena too is okay harish is bad shakti kapoor is terrible aruna irani is as usual rajnikant is okay in a cameo
