this is the worst brain damaged, ultra cheap, super stupid, silly, pointless piece of trash i've ever seen, an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre. if you think that ed wood's "plan 9" is bad, well... let me tell you, looks like "citizen kane" compared to that one. ?special effects?...again, "plan 9" is "star wars". ?acting?...thor johnson is al pacino... so it's beyond bad, really. but if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies, it's for you! i'm a fan of american international for so many glorious horror movies, the price-corman-poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff, but with "star creatures" they descend right down to the z level. of course, my 1 out of 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun (the guy playing an indian chief is great) so have fun and enjoy... if you can.
