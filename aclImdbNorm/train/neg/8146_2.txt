1st watched 11/7/2002 - 2 out of 10(dir-john bianco): pretty lame gangster movie about a godfather-like family in brooklyn who like to say four-letter words a lot and kill people. the only thing of interest here was their attempt to show the feds being a lot like the gang. this is the only attempt at good film-making. the rest of the movie was predictable, and cheaply-made. the quality of the photography on some of the scenes inside bars and floozy joints almost made you think there was a problem with your dvd player because of the bad contrasts and some of the actors were hard to hear at times because of the bad sound. the acting was pretty-much characatures of all your favorite gangsters from better movies with corny names like vinnie `knuckles' and jimmie `tattoos', and the plot pretty much followed those patterns as well. so, go see a better gangster movie before you put your money out for this one.
