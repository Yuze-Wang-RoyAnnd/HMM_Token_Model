after seeing "driven" on a plane flight to america 3 years ago i truly believed i had seen the worst film ever created, and i could relax safe in the knowledge i would never have to suffer that much in front of a screen ever again. unfortunately as i found out last night this was not the case. revolver is so monstrously bad i am actually thinking about recommending friends to go and see it, just so i don't feel like i'm the only one stupid enough for being conned into watching this. its really quite amazing how much this film falls completely on its face with the constant, and i mean constant voice overs of the main characters, with totally inane pretentious nonsense! i was actually getting angry in the cinema listening to andre benjamin's utterly relentless droning for what seemed like half the film, whilst all the time thinking - what would turkish have done to this complete joke of gangster/con man, whatever he's supposed to be, when he made his "offer"? i'll tell you what. he would have told him to f**k off, blown his head away, and watch with utter disdain as his equally inept partner waddles away as fast as his chubby little legs would carry him. i mean what are we supposed to believe is going through jake's head when they offer him their "solution" to his problem? they're con men, therefore they must obviously also have the skill to cure incurable blood diseases! i mean ffs. doesn't he start to wonder why his symptoms aren't getting worse? doesn't the penny drop on the third day what is happening instead of richie subjecting the audience to a painfully patronising phone call from avi to jake to let him know he's been conned. <br /><br />anyway, i can add a small positive note to the film by moving on to the dry humour if provides, thankfully of a similar standard to his previous films
