this movie is just lame. a total waste of time and money. the jokes are predictable, the characters are so clich'e and the way it talks about rpg gamers is not funny as well. the problem is that the writers seems not to know how a rpg game works and, most important, how to make jokes about this game. of course there are a bunch of losers who play rpg like freaking retards and total losers. but for me this is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game. the story doesn't make any sense at all. who cares about how long a game is being played? the greatest problem in this movie is that the writers and actors didn't even try to know what rpg is about to make jokes about it. i felt ashamed by watching this lame movie.
