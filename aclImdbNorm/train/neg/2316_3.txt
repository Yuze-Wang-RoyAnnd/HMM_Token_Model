having read during many years about how great this film was, how it established ruiz among the french critics (specially the snobbish cahiers crowd), when i finally watched it about a year ago, i found it pretty disappointing (but then, i guess my expectations were sky-high). shot in saturated black and white, this deliberately cerebral film (made for tv, and mercifully, only an hour long) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings (which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime. (the awful kate beckinsale film uncovered has a similar argument). borgesian is a word i read a lot in reviews about this movie, but i would say almost any borges story is more interesting than this film.
