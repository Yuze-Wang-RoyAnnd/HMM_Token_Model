i was looking forward to seeing amanda peet in another good role after recently renting "the whole nine yards"--easily worth the rental, by the way--but this wasn't it.<br /><br />i remembered that the trailer for "whipped" was somewhat funny and the plot about three oversexed new yorker twenty somethings all falling for and getting manipulated by the charming ms. peet was worth a shot. so, i convinced two friends one afternoon to come see this movie with me. this review is my penance.<br /><br />in the first act we have the three lead studs, recounting their conquests in a diner. what should have been funny, or at least telling, comes out rather pathetic. was there any redeeming quality about the three men and their encounters that we were supposed to get out of this?<br /><br />[and while i don't mind movies that are cheerfully vulgar, i kept wondering why no one in the diner turned around when the studs talk loudly about sexual and scatalogical details. they do this every week at the same diner? you would think someone would complain. oh, wait, i forgot: two other diners do notice in one scene. but this is just a setup for a punchline. everyone else in the diner is deaf.]<br /><br />the second act has the three studs all falling for mia and then developing brain rot, failing to ask each other or her about what's really happening between the four of them. and i kept asking myself, as the studs keep acting like they have been, what redeeming qualities does she see in them to stick with them longer than one date? does she start out with brain rot? i kept hoping for eric's character, the married buddy, to become something more than simply the annoying punching bag in this act. his role is clearly to dispense advice on being married. but why do they even bother to talk to him when they won't talk to each other? and his advice? sheeesh!<br /><br />the third act resolves what plot there is but by this time i was looking at my watch. my friends told me they were still waiting for something genuinely funny to happen and i had to agree. the scene that explains all was adequate and managed to explain all of the questions and mysterious dialogue bits throughout the movie but we were just checking them off a list. ("oh, okay, that's why brad had that happen and jonathan says this and...")<br /><br />what laughs we made were from the stupidity of the plot than at anything amusing. even the outtakes during the credits weren't very funny. ultimately i was left with nothing except a desire to warn people away from this movie.<br /><br />rating: 3
