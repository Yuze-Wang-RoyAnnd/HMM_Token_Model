i thought this was a sequel of some sorts, and it is meant to be to the original from 1983. but a sequel is not taking the original plot and destroying it.<br /><br />i actually had very little expectations to this movie, but i just wasted 95 minutes of life. no suspense - i actually feel clairvoyant, poor acting, and so filled with technical errors, so i as a computer geek just couldn't believe it. they have tried to make it a mix between a generic war movie and 24 hours. but this is not even worthy of a low budget tv movie.<br /><br />do not see this movie, this is a complete waste of time. instead get the original. the theme is still valid. don't let to much power into a machine. and the acting and plot is far more exiting and compelling.
