let's hope this is the final nightmare. this is the epitome of a good thing gone bad. okay, there is still some enjoyment to be had, but only in the most mundane sense. rachel talalay had been there for the duration of this franchise, had been on the production staff and produced even. i don't know what she was thinking, but this debacle comes complete with the human video game boy and a guest appearance by<br /><br />tom and roseanne arnold! i wish i had a clue what she was thinking when she wrote/directed this disappointing piece of garbage. she even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than an over-glorified popcorn movie instead of bearing any resemblance to horror, with the contrived use of a 3d ending. aren't those glasses nifty? and you get to keep them! it's the equivalent of, you just spent $9.00 making me rich. here's 10 cents. now, don't you feel special!? sorry, but for me, it just did not make me feel special. <br /><br />and freddy's had yet another face-lift. this one was for the worst, i think. all the beautiful artistry that went into his "look" in the earlier films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper, less detailed set of prosthetics. he looks ... less like the burn victim he is supposed to be, and more like he has a skin disorder. changing the lead's makeup like that so far into a series is about on the same level as changing the lead actor. but wait! they've done that, and done that. so i guess it doesn't matter. but it mattered to me. freddy is no longer scary. he's just ... another low-rent monster like the leprechaun. <br /><br />it's more...a dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises; riddled with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty one-liners and clever repartee (sadly, it fell short on both accounts). <br /><br />so there's nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh, because there was not one scary or suspenseful moment in this entire film. <br /><br />it rates a 3.2/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
