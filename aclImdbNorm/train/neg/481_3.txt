any time a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply doesn't bother with an actual story, it's annoying. those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first, and the story simply tacked on. for this reason we often talk of the story "jumping through hoops" as it twists about, trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashion.<br /><br />the story in "comet over broadway" doesn't just jump through hoops, it's a three ring circus. it's so ludicrous, so ill-conceived, so disingenuous that, if you are prone to speaking aloud to the screen, you will be carrying on quite a rant before it's through.<br /><br />the central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession. since it's all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion. so, in the end there's no point to the story, the theme becomes irrelevant and, as is often the case with poor screenplays, the acting doesn't save a thing.
