i am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators. to me it was rather a disappointment, especially the combination of historical facts, fantasy and the main character's internal turmoil does not work at all (in vonnegut's book slaughterhouse five and even in george roy hill's adaptation for the screen it does). credibility is often overstretched. too many questions are left open. did i miss some central points? or did i fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots? <br /><br />a boy called campbell, jr., grows up in upstate new york. at home his father has many technical trade papers and one book. it has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it. the boy leafs through the book, his dad doesn't like his doing that. what should this tell me? the family moves away from upstate new york to berlin. bang. it is 1938, the boy is a married man in berlin and a theater playwright. what kind of plays does he write? in what language? is he successful? his wife is an actress and looks glamorous. the parents move back to the usa and invite their son to do the same. he does not. why? because having grown up in germany he feels more german than american? because he is successful? because his wife is? because he likes his life there? because he likes the nazis? because he is just plain lazy and doesn't like change? don't ask me.<br /><br />possibly, the man just does not care, is not interested in politics, is a kind of an existentialist. he states that he is deeply in love with his wife. he speaks of his republic of two (meaning he and his wife). there is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie, it much more seems a republic of one.<br /><br />on the request of an american agent campbell, jr., agrees to broadcast anti semitic nazi hate propaganda to american listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to american authorities who read between the lines. the crucial meeting with the agent on a berlin park bench is short, unexciting and anti climactic, the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation, the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast.<br /><br />so now we have campbell, jr., presenting himself over the air as the last free american. the scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting - although one wonders what happened when campbell, jr., really and honestly had to cough, hiccup etc. (must have scrambled the messages terribly). anyway, the nazis lose, the wife dies (touring in the crimean for german troops - i never heard such tours really happened on german front lines in ww ii), campbell, jr., says he goes to the russian front but does not go, is captured by an american soldier who recognizes his mug (how come?), is dragged to a sight-seeing tour in auschwitz, is then released and resettled with the help of the crucial agent somewhere in the city of new york.<br /><br />and this is where the story really starts <br /><br />bang. from now on it is like a short story by paul auster. it is 1961, campbell, jr., lives in new york tenement as a has-been and mourns the loss of his wife. nobody really cares - or do they? yes, somehow they do, and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction. auschwitz survivors. a painter. some american supremacists
