a great slasher movie -- too bad it was the producers and not part of the script. basic plot summary - man with redhead fetish goes invites such women to his flat only to go into some kind of freakish coma and proceeds in offing them to various degrees of success. only the cutting crew behind the scenes must have thought the movie was as ad as i did and chopped the heck out of the movie. nothing flows, you get lost on which redhead he is with at the time (didn't he off that one earlier??), and most of the time it looks like the camera man passed out and resumed filming when he awoke. not that i can blame him i passed out 2-3 times and had to rewind and resume to try to regain what little plot that does exist. warning when you see the ending do not try to connect it with anything that happens before -- you will just get an aneurysm. not worth the time, effort, or god forbid money. only reason to get a 2 instead of a 1 - the slim chance that the hacking occurred between film release and the horrible version that i watched.
