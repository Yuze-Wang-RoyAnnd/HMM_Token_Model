it occurs to me that some of the films that have been banned during the course of cinema history were actually very important and very good films. i'd like to argue that instead of banning challenging, controversial movies the censors should consider banning films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your iq and your sanity. if they were to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be "stroker ace". this film is awful with a capital 'a'. it is the worst film burt reynolds ever starred in.... quite a feat for for a man with "cannonball run ii", "cop and a half" and "rent-a-cop" on his cv!<br /><br />the wafer-thin story introduces us to successful stock car racer stroker ace (reynolds), a man who loves fast cars and fast women. he gets stuck in a demeaning contract with crooked promoter clyde torkle (ned beatty). the contract requires him to do some humiliating promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants, such as dressing up as a giant chicken. thrown into the mix are lugs (jim nabors), ace's dim-witted pal, and pembrook feeney (loni anderson), a bimbo with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea who is wooed by ace.<br /><br />hal needham, the director of this low-grade garbage, was formerly a stuntman and he made numerous films that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular stunts and car chases/races. some of these films were ok, like "hooper" and "stunts unlimited", but with "stroker ace" he reaches a career nadir. the characters are so stupid that you actually feel pity for the actors playing them. anderson especially is saddled with such a dumb role that it makes you grind your teeth with despair. the humour is weak and infantile throughout, and the stunts and race sequences are unremarkable. even the out-takes during the closing credits (which can be found in all the reynolds-needham collaborations) are generally unfunny, which gives the impression that maybe the film wasn't much fun to make. "stroker ace" is a stinker of considerable magnitude.
