what an insult to the sa film industry! i have seen better sa films. the comments i read about hijack stories,by saying it is worthy of a ten out of ten is quite scary. a movie's rating should not depend on.., "oh, a movie from a developing country. lets boost their industry by saying nice things about their work, even though it is bad." we have the expertise to make good movies. don't judge the film industry on what people say how great they think hijack stories is. we can tell great stories such as cry the beloved country and shaka zulu. cry the beloved country i'll give 9 out of 10. great directing by darryl, great acting by two great elderly actors, irrespective from where they are. hijack stories.., i'll give 1 out of 10. it could only be people involved in the project who would give it high scores. i would've done the same if it was my movie.
