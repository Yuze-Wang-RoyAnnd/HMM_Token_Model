when the young kevin gets the boat of his dead uncle as a gift, he invites five friends of him to a trip to catalina island for the weekend. while in the journey, they drink booze, have sex and play games, with each one of them telling his or her greatest fear. later kevin drowns in the open sea, the engine stops, and they are haunted and murdered by their greatest innermost fear.<br /><br />yesterday, my wife, son, daughter and three other friends joined to watch "haunted boat" on dvd. with less than 30 minutes running time, the group gave up watching this messy and boring amateurish piece of crap, and we decided to see another film. later, i decided to watch the rest of this flick to see how bad it could be and it would have been better off going to bed to sleep. the confused story has an awful cinematography and camera work, with a cast that is probably studying to be actors and actresses and in the end this film seems to be a bad project of cinema school. the terrible and pretentious screenplay shows a ridiculous twist in the end, actually a complete mess that made me not understand what the story is all about. was the girl insane and traveled alone in the boat, imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends? if that is true, are their friend again in the very end fruit of her madness? my vote is one.<br /><br />title (brazil): "viagem para a morte" ("trip to the death")
