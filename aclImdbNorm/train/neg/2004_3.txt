i read the book a long time back and don't specifically remember the plot but do remember that i enjoyed it. since i'm home sick on the couch it seemed like a good idea and hey !! it is a lifetime movie.<br /><br />the movie is populated with grade b actors and actresses.<br /><br />the female cast is right out of desperate housewives. i've never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and i get the gist. is there nothing original anymore? sure, but not on lifetime.<br /><br />the male cast are all fairly effeminate looking and acting but the girls need to have husbands i suppose.<br /><br />in one scene a female is struggling with a male, for her life, and what does she do??? kicks him in the testicles. what else? women love that but let me tell you girls something... it's not as easy as it's always made to look.<br /><br />it wasn't all bad. i did get the chills a time or two so i have to credit someone with that.
