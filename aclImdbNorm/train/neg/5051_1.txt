i'm both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this movie is so accurate about vietnam, and were never there. this movie is about as true about the whole vietnam war as the rodney king beating is true about all police officers. yes, bad things do (and did) happen, but in general the people there are just like you and me. they have morals, they are not killing machines, they do not all do drugs. atrocities were the exception in vietnam, not the rule. they happened far more infrequently than the "hype" would lead you believe. oliver stone has a knack for making movies that show the vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath, but are based as much in reality as star wars. if you honestly believe the stereotypes of vietnam, do yourself a favour and learn the truth. fact: the viet cong and nva did far worse things to the south vietnamese than any soldier in the us armed forces ever did. fact: the soldiers in world war ii treated the enemy far worse in general than the soldiers in vietnam did, and they were welcomed when they came home. the fine americans who served this country in vietnam deserve our respect; though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint, no one could have asked for more from our soldiers, and it is a great disservice to assert that this kind of "mostly true" fiction is the way things really were there.
