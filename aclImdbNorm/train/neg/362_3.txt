not to be confused with the madonna film "the next best thing", "the last big thing" is a silly, campy, off-the-wall comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called "the next big thing" which reviews a variety of up and coming artists. this low budget indie makes "chuck and buck" look like a masterpiece. fraught with lousy acting, poor sets and costuming, etc., "...thing" has earned some awful reviews and to date has only been nominated for one fringe award. pass on this one.
