massacre is a film directed by andrea bianchi (burial ground) and produced by legendary italian horror director lucio fulci. now with this mix of great talent you would think this movie would have been a true gore fest. this could not be further from that. massacre falls right on its face as being one of the most boring slasher films i have seen come out of italian cinema. i was actually struggling to stay awake during the film and i have never had that problem with italian horror films.<br /><br />massacre starts out with a hooker being slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax. this scene was used in fulci's nightmare concert. this isn't a bad scene and it raises your expectations of the movie as being an ax wielding slaughter. unfortuanitly, the next hour of the movie is so boring. the movie goes on to a set of a horror film being filmed and there is a lot of character development during all these scenes but the characters in the movie are so dull and badly acted your interest starts to leak away. the last 30 minutes of the movie aren't so bad but still could have been much better. the gore in the movie was pathetic and since fulci used most of the gore scenes in nightmare concert there was nothing new here. the end of the movie did leave a nice twist but there was still to much unanswered and the continuity falls right through the floor.<br /><br />this wasn't a very good film but for a true italian horror freak (like myself) this movie is a must have since it is very rare. 4/10 stars
