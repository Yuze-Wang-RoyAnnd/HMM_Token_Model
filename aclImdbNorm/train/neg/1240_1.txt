i think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci-fi flick. for one thing, it was directed by tim burton. another thing, it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic. i found it boring, gross, and ridiculous. if you've seen it, you know what i mean. just about everyone at imdb say it's crap and boy, are they right! if you haven't, avoid it. it's a snorer. 1 out of 10.
