first of all, i have to say i have worked for blockbuster and have seen quite a few movies to the point its tough for me to find something i haven't seen. taking this into account, i want everyone to know that this movie was by far the worst film ever made, it made me pine for gigli, my boss's daughter, and any other piece of junk you've ever seen. belyt must be out of his mind, i've only found one person who liked it and even they couldn't tell me what the movie was about. if you are able to decipher this movie and are able to tell me what it was about you have to either be the writer or a fortune teller because there's any other way a person could figure this crap out.<br /><br />for the love of g-d stay away!
