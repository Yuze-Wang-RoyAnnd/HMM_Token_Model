wow! pretty terrible stuff. the richard burton/elizabeth taylor roadshow lands in sardinia and hooks up with arty director joseph losey for this remarkably ill-conceived tennessee williams fiasco. taylor plays a rich, dying widow holding fort over her minions on an island where she dictates, very loudly, her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary. when scoundrel burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend, taylor realizes her time is up. ludicrious in the extreme --- it's difficult to determine if taylor and burton are acting badly or if it was williams' intention to make their characters so unappealing. if that's the case, then the acting is brilliant! burton mumbles his lines, including the word boom several times, while taylor screeches her's. she's really awful. so is noel coward as taylor's catty confidante, the "witch of capri." <br /><br />presumably boom is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves along --- two standard williams themes, but it's so misdirected by losey, that had taylor and burton not spelled it out for the audience during their mostly inane monologues, any substance the film has would have been completely diluted. <br /><br />boom does have stunning photography---the camera would have to have been out of focus to screw up the beauty of sardinia! the supporting cast features joanna shimkus, the great romolo valli as taylor's resourceful doctor and michael dunn as her nasty dwarf security guard...both he and his dogs do a number on burton!
