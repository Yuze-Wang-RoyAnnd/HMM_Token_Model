i've had to change my view on the worst film in the world having just seen this one. this is it!<br /><br />make no mistake this film is awful.<br /><br />here's a list of reasons:<br /><br />hopeless storyline (despite being based on a true story). dreadful acting (what was judge reinhold thinking) unbelieveably bad stunts. childish dialogue. non-existent continuity. lack of atmosphere.<br /><br />get the picture?<br /><br />
