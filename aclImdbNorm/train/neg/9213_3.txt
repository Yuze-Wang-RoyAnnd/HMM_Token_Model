i caught this movie at a small screening held by members of my college's gaming club. we were forewarned that this would be the "reefer madness" of gaming, and this movie more than delivered.<br /><br />tom hanks plays robbie, a young man re-starting his college career after "resting" for a semester. what we, the viewer, find out as the movie progresses, is that robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role-playing game called "mazes and monsters," a game that he gets re-acquainted with after a gaming group recruit him for a campaign.<br /><br />this movie is laughable on many, many levels. one scene features the group "gaming by candlelight," which is probably the best way i can describe it. while i'm sure that this was meant to be "cultish" in some way, as most gamers know, it's horribly inaccurate. most role-play sessions are done in well-lit rooms, usually over some chee-tohs and a can of soda.<br /><br />the acting, while not oscar-caliber, isn't gut-wrenchingly awful either. this is one of tom hanks's first roles, and bosom buddies and bachelor party were still a year or two over the horizon. the supporting cast, while not very memorable, still hand forth decent performances.<br /><br />mainly the badness lies in the fact that it was a made-for-tv movie that shows the "dangers of gaming" worth a view if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
