this has been put out on the dvd market by alpha, and it's for die-hard boris karloff fans (like moi) only. it's not a horror flick, but a drama where boris is a struggling scientist agreeing to kill a wealthy woman's husband in order to gain the fortune needed to continue with his work. but once the dying victim changes his will and leaves his spouse nothing, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />it's appeasing enough seeing karloff as another selfish sinister type, and some of the acting is unintentionally hilarious (especially from the leading lady mona goya who is absolutely a laugh riot as the double-crossed wife).<br /><br />but proceed with much caution.
