this movie is so bad that i cannot even begin to describe it. what in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers, producers and director? how on earth did they get funding for this abomination? the plot is laughable, the acting is poor at best, the story... what story? the first fight in this movie is ok but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off.<br /><br />i guess i'm the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute.<br /><br />*** spoler alert ***<br /><br />i only saw this movie because scott adkins was in it... and he is in it... for 30 seconds...<br /><br />i give it 1 out of 10 because it's the lowest grade imdb has to offer.<br /><br />do yourself a favour: see an uwe boll movie instead... twice... it's more worthy of your time.
