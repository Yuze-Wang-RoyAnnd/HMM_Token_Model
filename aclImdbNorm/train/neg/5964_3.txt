the version of this film i saw was titled 'horror rises from the tomb'. the horror in question is a wicked medieval magician played by spanish horror legend paul naschy looking like he's playing abanazer in a church hall panto. he rises from his tomb when a stupid descendant (i think he's a descendant, as he's also played by naschy)returns to his ancestral home and reunites the magician's head and body, which had been separated by by the witchfinders who executed him, in an attempt to stop him, er, rising from the tomb.<br /><br />obviously, once head and body are back together all hell breaks loose and lots of people die. like all good magicians, abanazer here has a lovely assistant. this one's played by another spanish horror great, the beautiful helga line. like practically every other woman in the film line periodically gets her kit off. there's a lot of nudity in this film, and not just female - we even get to see naschy's paunchy body, which isn't a pretty sight, i can tell you. most of the film's sex angle is laughably gratuitous. there's one particularly funny scene where naschy and line discuss their evil plans and then suddenly decide to both have a grope of the nubile young blonde they've possessed.<br /><br />it's also pretty gory in places - notably a herschell gordon lewis-esquire moment where line plunges her hands into a man's chest to remove his heart.<br /><br />the best part of the film is the pretty effective zombies who turn up towards the end. they're quickly scared off by a fire though, and don't bother coming back. which is a shame. the scene where the zombies rise, however, is the film's most ludicrously inept moment. it all happens in long shot, and we haven't really got a clue what's happening until we see some figures shambling on from the distance. there are several rubbish moments like this, thanks largely to poor editing. when a labourer falls under the hypnotic spell of naschy's head there's a big close up of his face that seems to last forever and serves no purpose whatsoever.<br /><br />all in all, not a great horror film, but entertaining enough. of course, the version i saw was a dubbed american version that had probably been chopped to pieces. for all i know, the original spanish version could be a masterpiece...
