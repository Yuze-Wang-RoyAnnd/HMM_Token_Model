thanks to a dull, dimensionless screenplay by neil simon, and lackluster direction from robert moore, chapter two becomes a shrill showcase for marsha mason who received her third of four oscar nods for chapter two giving the same performance here that she gave in cinnderella liberty(73), the goodbye girl(77), audrey rose(78) and only when i laugh(81);only this time she doesn't have a child to drag around. chapter two is the third and last feature film for moore having previously directed neil simon's the cheap detective(78) and murder by death(76). caan is miscast, the characters are mono-dimensional, the dialog is overly analytical, and there's virtually no establishing detail. the first half is a less-than-captivating, meet cute, coy romance between a blinkered caan and a chipper mason, and the dreary second half makes you long for the first half. the nyc locations as well as joe bologna, and a painfully thin valerie harper are irrelevant, but at least they provide some welcome distraction. and last and least, there's an awful song played during the credits.
