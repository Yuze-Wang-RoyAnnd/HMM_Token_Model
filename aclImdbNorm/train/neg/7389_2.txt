i buy or at least watch every seagall movie. he came out with a handful of good movies then descending into poor stories, bad camera work and a walk-thru persona, he nearly lost me. a few movies ago he remembered how to make a decent movie. now he's forgotten again. this film is seriously dark (on any level you care to name). there is a lot of slash & gash going on here with no discernible purpose unless it's meant as a warning against the military.<br /><br />seagall may have had a stand-in for many of his scenes as it was often too dark to tell and someone else's voice was used most of the time. sadly the only interesting character was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape custody & then proceeded to raise havoc all over the place. okay since when do we place an armed guard in the holding room with a prisoner? anyway this bad guy was at least colorful, and very focused. there's lots of gore if you like that king of thing. it looked to me like the bad guys tore the same gash every time. i'm just glad they didn't suck the blood from their hapless victims. i harken you back to my summary. basically it is a horror movie disguised as an action film.dec 6,2006
