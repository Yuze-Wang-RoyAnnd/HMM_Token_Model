i had to watch this film because the plot was so outrageous and the film lived up to expectations. in fact it makes for quite uncomfortable viewing at times. unlike other meyer films, the sexual antics are down to a minimum. some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily gratuitous and offensive. the plot is chaotic and some of the acting and lines are dreadful.<br /><br />the film is a strange combination of sado-masochistic fantasy combined with a window of the brutality and immorality of the slavery and fails on all counts. it's as though meyer was trying to make up for the sexploitation/ blackploitation by having a higher moral message. meyer knows we feel a bit guilty about getting turned on by the blatant dominatrix connotations of the early scene showing lady susan wielding a whip in a provocative outfit. he then tries to steer back to the righteous path by turning it into a film about the triumph of good over evil. however, because they cancel each other out, you end up with nothing.<br /><br />because it so bad in so many ways, it is actually worth watching if you appreciate the art of making an awful film in the worst possible taste. perhaps, because it is so bad, we almost let meyer get away with the unacceptable.
