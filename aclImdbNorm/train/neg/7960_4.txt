i rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a little kid. i snuck downstairs really early one morning, started watching hbo, and the raft (segment 2) terrorized me good. this time around, i still enjoyed the raft, although i couldn't tell whether it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short. the other two segments were complete trash. i can't believe a producer somewhere payed to make this junk. all i've accomplished by watching this was to ruin one more childhood memory. creepshow 2 will now join rad among my list of tainted childhood classics. 4/10
