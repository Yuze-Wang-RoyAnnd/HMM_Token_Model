i read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 film noir, "criss cross." i found the latter to be disappointing but it was still better than this film. <br /><br />this movie is a "neo-noir" since it's modern-day and it's in color, two things that purists would make it be disqualified for film noir status. <br /><br />the biggest negative to it, however, wasn't the cinematography (that was fine) but the muddled storyline. hey, some of '40s dashiell hammett stories were similar but i didn't care for some of those either. the filmmakers here did not help the situation by placing flashbacks into the story what seemed like every three minutes. no wonder it was the keep up with this story. it was ridiculous! what happens is that by the 45-minute mark, their is so much confusion nobody cares anymore. i know i didn't.
