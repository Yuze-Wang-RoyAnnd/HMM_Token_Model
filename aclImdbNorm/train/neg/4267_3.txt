i saw this film at the rotterdam festival, as did presumably all the other voters. the director was present and seemed to have worked very hard and be very committed to the project, which i think explains the above average reception and mark it got. it's most similar to a feature length episode of aussie kids favourite "round the twist" but it takes itself too seriously to have even that redeeming feature. the movie in itself is maybe worth seeing if you're trying to do a cinematic world tour visiting all un member states, as i can't think of another fijian movie but overall it was generic, poorly acted (albeit by an amateur cast) and prey to the subaltern mentality. the moral of the story seemed to be that native islanders will try and screw each other over, but as long as there is an essentially decent white governor to step in, all problems can be solved (by leaving the island).
