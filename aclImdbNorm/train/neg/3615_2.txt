how come i've never seen or even heard about this junk-movie before? it's right up my alley with bloody teenkill, laughable plotting and an irresistible 80's cheese-atmosphere hanging around it. for some reason nobody is really interested in, the staff and students of an elite catholic university are butchered by an unknown psychopath. freshly recruited teacher julie parker becomes involved when all the people she has contact with either turn up dead or behave strangely. this movie is hilariously bad! there's absolutely no logic or coherence and every character is equally meaningless to the others. for example, there's a girl killed and her body dumped in a container. then, and for no reason, the story suddenly moves forward three weeks yet the murdered girl is never mentioned or even missed. not even by her boyfriend! the acting is pitiful and there isn't even a bit of nudity to enjoy. the revelation of the killer is quite funny because the makers really seemed convinced that it was an original twist... it's not, guys! "splatter university" is easily one of the worst horror-turkeys ever.
