i didn't enjoy this film. i thought the acting wasn't very good and the story was boring. a 20year old computer saving the day? i thought that this was just slightly far fetched, even for a film. i couldn't figure out why they couldn't just turn it off, why not take a sledgehammer to it.<br /><br />its a shame, but after the original film from the 80s you expected so much more than what was actually delivered. this film could have been a 21st century version of the old film, it wasn't. if that is what you want to watch, do not watch this film! <br /><br />even if the old computer hadn't have turned up to save day, this would still, in my opinion, be a very very cheesy flick..
