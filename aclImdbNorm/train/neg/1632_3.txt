an apparent vanity project for karin mani (who?), as a hottie charles bronson going around wiping up the 'scum' that mugged her parents, or grandparents or something, and impressing young hunks with her karate skills. in a pivotal scene she intervenes to stop a rape and a moron cop throws her in jail, so after a couple cool shower scenes and some abortive prison-dyke seduction she has to take the law into her own hands blah blah blah. i guess there were a lot of movies like this? the script is dumber than usual if you can believe that. mani comes off as exactly the kind of showbiz type that would co-produce her own death wish starring role, and i find that type sporadically endearing, but the movie is an ungainly apparatus. competent actors would be wasted on the scumbag roles here, and would actively undermine the fantastic mincing-incompetent da and a judge that has got to be the producer's uncle.
