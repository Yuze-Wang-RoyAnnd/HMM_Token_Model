there's a lot of good that can be said for this cartoon; the backgrounds are rich, lushly colored and full of nicely done art deco details. the animation is up to the usual studio standards of the time, which are unquestionably higher than those of the present day. however, i find it tedious for a number of reasons.<br /><br />the music: it's definitely not up to scott bradley's usual standards. although it's probably supposed to be evocative of a "great gatsby" setting, it ends up being dreary, sleepy, repetitious and monotonous (repetitious and monotonous are not the same, as beethoven's 5th symphony attests). since most people (including me) tend to close their eyes when they yawn, there's a lot of the visual part of the cartoon that will be missed by the average viewer.<br /><br />the storyline: i'm not giving away any secrets that aren't already in the plot summary - country good, city bad. this is a common theme in films, both animated and live, from this era. it's a misplaced nostalgia for a nonexistent rural idyll, which, in the present day, is reflected in a similar nostalgia for "values" that never were.
