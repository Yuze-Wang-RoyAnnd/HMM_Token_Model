this movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on dvd i was one of the first to rent it. for once, i should listened to the critics and passed on this one.<br /><br />despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing. i can see now why it went straight to video. <br /><br />i had thought that with bloom, ledger, and rush it could have some value. all have done wonderful work in the past. <br /><br />the movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. i failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end. <br /><br />i do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. it won't satisfy even that.
