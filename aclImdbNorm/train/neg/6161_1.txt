this is possibly the worst fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. that is not just because the so called sports fencing is poor but because the plot, characters are so weak that they've got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and, later, supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying, i suppose to maintain audience interest. what a waste of f. murray abraham's talents. you're better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like zorro, scaramouche, anything that has basil rathbone as the villain. as a fencer myself i recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens it's got to have fresher, better drawn characters and a plot with more depth.
