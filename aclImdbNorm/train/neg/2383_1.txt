this is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime. cool title, excellent director (i saw "to die for" and "drugstore cowboy" before this), and hey - uma thurman in the cast. how can you go wrong? well, that is a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after i watched this turkey.<br /><br />disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat, this is a dead-zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs. its critical lambasting was well deserved. you have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redeeming quality. zero out of ****.
