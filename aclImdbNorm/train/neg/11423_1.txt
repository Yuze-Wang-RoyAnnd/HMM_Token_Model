what happened in the making of this movie so that it ended up as the total mess it is? just one year after "the breakfast club", a brilliant movie with many of the same actors as in "st. elmo's fire" (who by the way looked and acted in the latter more like they were still the high school misfits from the former but without the grip or discipline in portraying their roles.<br /><br />was it the directing or the writing. since it was the same person (joel schumacher) it must be both. but then schumacher has since given us "the phantom of the opera", "phone booth", "a time to kill", and two batman movies, "batman and robin" and "batman forever" which range from good to great directing. something went wrong on "stef" because it has no genius whatsoever, no comedy worth anything, and is very far off the mark on what is truly valuable in life. <br /><br />example: the character wendy (a rich little girl with a heart to do good and help the less fortunate played by mare winningham ) reveals to billy (an unruly slob who cheats on his wife and on his girlfriends, drinks far too much and has no sense of order in his life appropriately played by rob lowe) that she is still a virgin. billy truly see a challenge and possible conquest but wendy "is not ready". wendy, in fact is so not ready it is hard to believe she is in this clique of friends. later in the story, when billy whose wife has left him taken his child and married another has somehow drawn some of the strings of his life together. billy is leaving for new york, deserting and abandoning all parental responsibility for his baby daughter, he convinces wendy that her virginity would be the perfect "going away gift" from her to him. and wendy, who works as a social worker helping broken families, seems not to be phased at all by this despot. give me a break. the one thing she can only give once, she gives to a loser who is leaving his family and friends? schumacher frames this scene as a wonderful and touching moment.<br /><br />many more example exist where there is a complete disconnect between what is real and of value being tossed overboard and the acts are made to look like virtue.<br /><br />i suppose some may say that "that was the 80's" but i remember it was in the "80's" that men began to be held responsible for the children they fathered whether in a marriage or out.<br /><br />i think this movie is so bad because it is so out of sync with what it really valuable and right.<br /><br />as for the technique (not the story), it was terrible as well. it is disjointed and feels like a 3 hour movie that has been edited to 1 hour and 40 minutes. transitions and jumps in time simply do not make sense. pick up what is on the editing room floor, put it back in and the movie would probably flow much better...but it still is a horrible movie.<br /><br />maybe schumacher has become a better and stronger director since 1986 (he must have) or maybe he was over his head when it came to writing the screenplay for st elmo's fire or maybe this group of actors took over the set and went their own way - that is what i really think happened.
