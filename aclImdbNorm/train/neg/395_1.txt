when i ordered this from blockbuster's website i had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was. who knows? maybe i'd forgotten to take my add meds that day. i do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon, donned in their late 70's-style wide collars, bell-bottoms and feathered hair, i knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster.<br /><br />the first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning, trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe, forcing polyester and porno-quality music on the would-be viewer. from the opening scene with the poorly-done effects to the "monsters" from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of 'the vagina monologues'.<br /><br />throughout the film, the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear. the "ship" was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old vcr and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path. of course if moved slower than bob barker's impacted bowels, but it had menacing pencil-thin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two (with some assistance).<br /><br />moving on... as the weirdness and bell bottoms continue... we found out that they're caught in a "space time warp". how do we garner this little nugget of scientific information? because the oldest male lead tells his son that, in a more or less off-the-cuff fashion, like reminiscing about 'how you won the big game' over a cup of joe or an ice-cold bottle of refreshing coca-cola. was pops a scientist? nope, but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and einstein's theories.<br /><br />the recording i watched on dvd was almost bootleg quality. the sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone, other than that, it was really, really, really bad. (there's not enough 'really's' to describe it, really).<br /><br />i know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics. i never saw this film on its original release, but even back then i think i would've come to the same conclusion: bury this one quick.
