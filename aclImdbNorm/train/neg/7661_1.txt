the title of worse film of all time is one that gets handed out quickly and often. most of the time it is exaggeration of the fact but i would like to welcome alone in the dark to the short list of real candidates: plan 9 from outer space, battlefield earth, and the adventures of pluto nash.<br /><br />as i watched the 90 minute bore i found it difficult to even stay awake even while i was trying so hard to laugh at the film. but alas i felt alone in the dark (i was gonna try to avoid the pun but i couldn't resist) as i looked around hoping to see mike nelson and his two robot friends. alas my friends and i had to provide comedy throughout the film.<br /><br />so... about the film itself. lets talk about the action and effects since that should be the only positive part of the film. the film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the xenos in aliens (they even call them xenos), and the creatures in pitch black. the can turn invisible at random (and i assure you it is random) and get hurt by light. also present are small centipede creatures used to control humans that transform them into something resembling a zombie. all of these are shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. the action scenes are chaotic and are impossible to follow. people shooting randomly on a blue screen stage or an empty set at monsters who were inserted in post. light quickly flashes on a dark screen making your pupils burn from overwork while bad rock music blares in the background.<br /><br />and those were the high points. the story revolving around a paranormal investigator (slater) whose idea of looking tough is wearing a black wife beater tshirt with a trench-coat and not shaving for 2 days. an archaeologist (reid) who is rather inept. and a government agent(dorff) whose lines involve barking order. all three should be ashamed at their performances (not that they have really ever done a good a job before) and the casting director should be ashamed. reid and slater are supposed to be lovers in the film i guess. the film contains the single most awkward love scene i have ever seen on film between the two.<br /><br />then comes the plot. quiet frankly the parts that make sense are not interesting at all. the rest is illogical at best. the plot holes could contain the collective egos of all three stars. the film begins with text and a voice explaining the back-story. this opening lasts for over a minute and already the viewer knows they are in for something terrible. this opening narration is later repeated adnausem in the awkward dialog in a very clumsy and heavy handed fashion through the rest of the film. and the ending did not make one ounce of sense. not only did it not make sense in the world of the film, it simply did not make sense.<br /><br />finally the direction of one uwe boll. disgrace, thats all that can be said. his use of shaking the camera to simulate suspense. his lack of direction with the actors. just watch reid in scenes in which she is not center focus of the shot. the complete waste of special effects money for bullet time effects. and finally choosing to use voice over to explain something that should be painfully obvious to the viewers.<br /><br />i payed a $1.50 to see this show at a second run theater. and while the laughs me and my friends provided made it worth every quarter i would advise people to avoid paying any more for this film. grab about 3 friends and split the rental cost and tear this movie a new one.<br /><br />shame on you uwe boll. shame on you tara reid. shame on you christian slater. shame on you stephen dorff. shame on anyone who was associated with this film.
