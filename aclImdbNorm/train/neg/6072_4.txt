deniro is a master...one of my favourites. and i love good sports movies {not into baseball so much, but hey, its sports movies, right?. i was expecting much more for this movie. it seems to start out well: deniro is what i expected, snipes {whom i don't really like} is very good as the spoiled star. barkin's role, to me, was ok. she's a good actress, but seemed out of place in this role. to me, they always seemed to rush the scenes, and then it drags a bit in places. it just seemed tio me to be so uneven! considering the cast and the plot, it could have been so much better. i rated it a '4', and i was being generous ~ i'm a tough one with numbers!
