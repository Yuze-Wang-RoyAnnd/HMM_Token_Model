it's like a bad 80s tv show got loose and tried to become a soft-core porn movie. oh my god was it bad. the plots of each character had little relevance. the plot itself wasn't anything to speak of. something about a stalker, i guess. in the end he shoots himself? it's not really clear, but somehow there's a volleyball game involved. and the main character (randy) sleeps around a lot. the only reason my friends rented this movie was because casper van dien was in it, and they ended up wanting to fast forward to the scenes with him in it, which were barely watchable at that. thank god i didn't spend any money on it, but i want that hour of my life back.
