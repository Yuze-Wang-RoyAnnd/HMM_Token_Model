otto preminger directs this light as a feather story. bohemian jean seberg and her equally bohemian widower father david niven holiday in the south of france with nutty myl`ene demongeot. things are fine until family friend deborah kerr shows up. nivens, a degenerate womanizer, finds the conquest of kerr too hard to resist. that's fine with seberg, as long as niven loves her and leaves her (as he's done with all the women in his past...including demongeot). when it appears as though she's becoming second banana in niven's life, seberg exact revenge on kerr. preminger tells the story in flashbacks from seberg's perspective and cleverly combines black and white with sunnier color scenes. the cinematography by georges p'erinal is stunning. the film features some of preminger's least heavy-handed direction, although he rarely allows any close-ups, which makes it difficult to make out what the actors are really feeling. arthur laurents wrote the script and it's full of acidic dialog and funny scenes (mostly involving bird-brained demongeot). seberg acquits herself fairly well, but niven is at his least appealing...and he shows no chemistry with either seberg or kerr. preminger really mis-steps with that casting. it's a role that seems tailor made for someone closer to charles boyer. with geoffrey horne as seberg's would-be suitor and martita hunt as his daffy mother. juliette gr'eco, playing herself, sings the title song in a paris nightclub. the great titles are by preminger regular saul bass.
