i couldn't believe my eyes once i've watched this movie. there's no point in it either then blood and violence. unlike other scary movies that had gore and a meaning to it this movie is just blood, gore, and killing one after another. this movie isn't interesting at all, has no meaningful plot or story line, nor does it have an intelligence in it. the blood looks very fake and this movie overall, is pointless. don't even waste your time with it. it's just an hour or two of mindless violence. it has many bloody scenes that aren't scary but just plain revolting. this is probably the worst horror film i have ever watched out of all the horror films i ever saw.
