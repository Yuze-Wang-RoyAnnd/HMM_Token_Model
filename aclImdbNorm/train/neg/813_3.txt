the biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say zues takes dutch commands. but she is speaking german to him. the 2 languishes are completely different, its like saying "well he takes french commands" and start talking spanish.<br /><br />james belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest. the role just doesn't fit him, even if its mend to be a comedy.<br /><br />to many stereotype/predicable stuff. typical comment or comebacks.<br /><br />if you don't look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on tv. but i wouldn't suggesting renting it.
