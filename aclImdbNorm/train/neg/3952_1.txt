return of the boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesn't play like a movie, it plays like an episode of a tv sitcom when they flashback to older episodes. return of the boogyman is just a clip show.<br /><br />mutch of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie. over and over again the same footage. how boring this is.<br /><br />the movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie.<br /><br />i have seen the first movie i don't want to see the same scenes over and over again and i don't know who would. the whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and thats it.
