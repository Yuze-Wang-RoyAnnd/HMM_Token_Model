obviously a lot of talented behind the scenes crew members worked on this movie, so don't even look at the credits at the end, you'll only hold it against them. nobody seemed interested in seeing this movie, only 3 were in the theater; two passed out after 10 minutes, and they were the lucky ones. the 'monsters' were the unemployed worm from star trek 2, the wrath of khan, and rejected designs for the space creatures in alien. the creators of the movie obviously didn't want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters, so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didn't get to memorize their lines, or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began. some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening, if anything is. if you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing, and you don't pass out, you'll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film. the implausibility of several scenes will just stun you, and stephen dorff's regular spewing of the 'queen mary of curse words' conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this. if you must see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the bargain bin at the video store. if there's any justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to rent it to you.
