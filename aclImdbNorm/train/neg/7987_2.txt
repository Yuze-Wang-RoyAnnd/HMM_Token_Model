i'm sure this was one of those "woah!" attractions in 1982 when epcot opened, but now it's just silly. the film's message is clich'e. the circle-vision is disorienting. and that awful song at the end is grating. and i really wish they'd install seats. after so much walking, all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes. and when you hear there's a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous! you get entertained while sitting down, right? wrong! you're standing there for 18+ minutes leaning against a short little railing. disney should make a newer maelstrom like attraction to liven things up and replace this dull, lackluster film. not fun. skip it. in fact, skip canada altogether unless you're eating there. move directly to the united kingdom.
