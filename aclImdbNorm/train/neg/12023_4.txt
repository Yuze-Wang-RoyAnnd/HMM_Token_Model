reed diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who's been in a mental asylum for over a decade after he was found wondering the back roads with blood on his hands. the doctors want to test out an experimental new drug that'll return his lost memories if it works. but when the drugs give him hallucinations of a demon, he chooses to escape instead. while outside he befriends a young boy whose stepfather (greg grunberg) mistreats his mother, won't let her near the darkroom in his basement & acts suspicious in general.<br /><br />while the general 'mystery' of the film is a tad easy to identify way before it's revealed, i found mr. diamond's acting to be enthralling enough to keep my attention throughout. (in the interest of full disclosure, i've been a huge fan of his since homicide and his brief, but extremely pivotal, role in the shield up through journeyman & dollhouse) not a great film nor a good one, but serviceable enough. although i did like it better than the previous films that i've seen from director/writer michael hurst (room 6, pumkinhead 4, mansquito)<br /><br />eye candy: one fleeting pair of boobs in a hallucination<br /><br />my grade: c-
