"steve"(chris hoffman)gathers a group from high school for a reunion at the cabin location where his twin brother wes went missing. while they are there, a reptilian creature in the shape of a man(reminded me a lot of the gillman from creature from the black lagoon)awaits in the wilderness choosing the right time to pick them apart one by one. a biker, ellen ripley-type time female bad-ass, kat(chase masterson)has an underground military bunker she practices experiments in, while it also serves as a place of safety from the thing on the bloody rampage. kat knows more than she's telling(she also suffered the loss of a child), but there's another novelty twist most of the group have no idea of. this creature might just be more human than they realize..and it's former identity might shed some light on a deception only one other person has been hiding since wes' death. kat holds the key to many of the mysteries that unlock as the group remains near the cabin.<br /><br />thankfully, a large portion of the film stays away from the creature which leaps in the air while we also see a hazy screen when we look through it's eyes. the film has dawson's creek-type melodramatics which often hinder any real tension that needs to build in a little monster movie. the direction is very bland leading to a relatively dull experience instead of eliciting scares. the cast is rather life-less and uninteresting. pretty maggie grace(the fog remake) might be the only draw for this film.
