i am, as many are, a fan of tony scott films. when this movie came out i had high hopes that it would be like 'man on fire'. to find out that the movie it's the furthest thing from it! the story was treading water from the get go, and the choice of mickey rourke was not such such a good idea. and the whole 'arm'scene was too gratuitous! <br /><br />the movie is centered around kiera kinghtly, and this movie reveals that she'll never become a movie star! the movie brought some of the worst acting ever.<br /><br />i like tony scott's direction 'n all, but this takes the whole friggin cake! sorry ton, 1 out of 10!
