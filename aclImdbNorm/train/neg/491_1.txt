as others have noted, this movie is criminally inaccurate in its portrayal of the artist's life and i for one was very annoyed and offended... by its transformation of her rape into a tragic love affair, by the implication that her rapist was responsible for 'awakening her talent,' by its complete disregard for her work, by the way it turned her into a sex object, on and on, you get the idea. also, i find it disturbing that people who aren't familiar with gentileschi will see this film and walk away with that kind of impression of her.
