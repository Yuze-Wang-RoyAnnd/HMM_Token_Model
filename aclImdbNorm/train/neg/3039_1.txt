i can always tell when something is going to be a hit. i see it or hear it, and get a good feeling. i did not get a good feeling watching the preview. i was not at all enthusiastic about this film, and i am not at all surprised that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 films. i was in fact proved right.<br /><br />the first thing that threw me off was the title. not that i have a problem with ebonics(i am black by the way), but for a movie they could have used a better title, and for this time use a title that doesn't have bad grammar. i heard the dialog, saw the acting and all i could do was make faces.<br /><br />i also think that the dance movie theme is being overdone. at least "you got served" was better than this in my opinion. even the soundtrack didn't thrill me.
