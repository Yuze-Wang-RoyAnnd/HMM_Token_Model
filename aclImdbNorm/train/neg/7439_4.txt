a different look at horror. the styling differences between american and russian films is interesting. however from my american perspective this movie just wasn't that good. the protagonist, marie played by anastasia hille wasn't a pleasant character and i had a hard time identifying with her. she was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left. also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film. then a long time passed before any real suspense built up. once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else. the concept was more original than most direct-to-video movies and they didn't use sex to make up for a thin plot. all in all i'd recommend it for renting, but not for theater goers.
