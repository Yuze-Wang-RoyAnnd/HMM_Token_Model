mild spoilers contained herein. i'm spoiling this film to save you the trouble of having to watch it. <br /><br />jet li's movies fall into one of two categories: shaolin period movies and movies set in modern-day hong kong revolving around triads or triad like organizations. each genre has its best and worst films. `twin warriors' is jet li's best shaolin era flick while `the evil cult' is his worst. `fist of legend' while in the recent past is the best `modern era' jet li movie. `black mask' without a doubt is the worst.<br /><br />jet li plays a self-exiled mercenary who received an injection that gives him superhuman ability, but shortens his life span. in his `new life' in exile he plays a pacifist librarian. when his old mercenary squad goes on a rampage, jet li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them. he dons a very silly corrugated cardboard mask so as to conceal his identity from the police (and public) as a librarian, as well as to conceal his true identity to his ex-comrades in arms.<br /><br />the version i saw was dubbed, and horribly at that. why does jet li capture and hold hostage his library co-worker if he's a pacifist? is there a love story between them? why does the police chief not care when he learns of the black mask's true identity? the plot is just plain bad. bad by way of the superhero cheesiness, bad in the sense that characters are never properly developed, bad in its character interactions, all topped off by a half-explained story i quickly lost interest in. <br /><br />the action and martial arts sequences are way over the top. lots of blood, gore (severed body parts aplenty), explosions, and matrix style superhuman martial arts fiascos are present in the film. unfortunately this is the films best and only selling point. if you want to see jet li playing a vigilante superhero in a mission impossible style movie `black mask' delivers. for the rest of us jet li fans it is a true disappointment. this is one of those movies where jet li never gets to be jet li: he gets neither the chance to charm us with his charisma, nor a chance to impress us with his impressive yet realistic martial arts ability. <br /><br />normally a chinese knockoff of ozzy osbourne would be enough to engross me in a film, sadly `black mask' proved to be an exception to that rule. indeed the antagonist of this movie, by the way he dresses, his long straight hair, and trademark round sunglasses looks like the modern and aged ozzy osbourne. however the villain isn't on-screen long enough to make the gimmick worthwhile. i am assuming the likeness to ozzy was intentional; in addition to the villain's look, he also ran a satanic looking hideout. so much more could have been made from the ozzy osbourne villain gimmick! if only the writer, director, or anyone had bothered to give a background to and develop the character of the film's arch villain!<br /><br />`black mask' was the first jet li film released on video in the usa after lethal weapon 4, and i'm glad i stayed away from it until now. it may well have ruined my whole perception of jet li as a martial artist and actor. if you want to see jet li at his worst, rent `black mask' and `the evil cult' and make it a double feature or horror, both intentional and unintentional. otherwise stick to moves that utilize the talents of jet li, and have plots that are semi-well thought out and plausible. 3/9 stars.
