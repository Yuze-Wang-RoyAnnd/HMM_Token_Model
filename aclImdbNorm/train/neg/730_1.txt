i have not seen the first film and if it anything like this have no great desire to. <br /><br />having just watched it a few hours ago i am struggling to remember a thing about it. <br /><br />from what i remember it's main plot seems to be a group of very annoying people stay at a house with that dodgy old woman from friday the 13th and are stalked by plank of wood man.<br /><br />some people die, the film ends, i am starting a law suit against the person who sold me this film as i want compensation for the missing time in my life. <br /><br />i will pay u lb1 to take this film off my hands......oh wait i already gave it away to a "friend".
