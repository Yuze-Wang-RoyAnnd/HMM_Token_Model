i was one of those "few americans" that grew up with all of gerry andersen's marvelous creations. thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action/adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it.<br /><br />i expected it to be a romp, but i did not expect it to aim at such a low age group. like lost in space, this could have been both visually stunning and exciting. it should have focused on more action/adventure and the goal of the original series... saving people in trouble.<br /><br />instead, it focused on alan saving the day instead of his brothers (who were cast too young anyway vs. the original). the breakout part was lady penelope and parker. i didn't care too much for the characters in the original, but i was grateful for them in the movie. they stole the show!<br /><br />i always enjoyed thunderbirds more for the high-tech than the stories, and even that did not get enough screen time as far as i was concerned. i would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool gadgets.<br /><br />but then, i'm just a big kid... ;)
