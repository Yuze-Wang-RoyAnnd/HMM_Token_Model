this was not enjoyable to watch. frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets a normal (boring!) job just so his stepson can go to film school, but his stepson decides that he'll make a humiliating documentary about the man instead. a documentary filmmaker should point the camera and simply shoot, not manipulate and comment with snide captions. the bitterness and resentment of the filmmaker towards his stepfather is obvious. and sad. the goal seems to be to make frank appear dumb and pathetic, instead he comes across as the most human of the 3 people featured.<br /><br />essentially a smear campaign all dressed up as something much smarter and edgier than it really is. it left me with an intense dislike for the filmmaker.
