i always get frustrated by films that were obviously written by one gender. especially when they obviously don't do enough research to find out when something not only doesn't ring true, but rings blatently false.<br /><br />the scene i am remembering is the one in the bathroom where jack tells his football teammates that he got diane pregnant. in no way, shape, or form would a guy ever cheer another guy getting a girl pregnant in high school. they might cheer about the guy having sex with the hot cheerleader, but i can also guarantee that the first the football team heard about it would not be at a urinal.<br /><br />it was obvious that this film didn't take itself so seriously, and it wasn't hideously bad, but come on!
