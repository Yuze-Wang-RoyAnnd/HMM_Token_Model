how many centuries will pass until the japanese/asian horror films abandon the long-haired ghost-woman shtick? admittedly, they've managed to rip off "ringu" a million times, and often it worked well - which just goes to show that originality isn't that much of a requirement in the horror genre (or that i'm very uncritical and easy to please?). however, this time around i found myself a little restless, somewhat bored. it's not a bad film, but it's at least half-an-hour longer than it should be, with its absurd 110 minutes length. compared to many other japanese horror films, omc lacks atmosphere and excitement. plus, the ending is confusing: it makes no sense at all. as for the ring-tone: miike could have come up with a melody that is more effective than that forgettable little thing. even though it was played a dozen times i can't even remember it - that's how scary it was. speaking of miike, for him this is something of a commercial venture, so if anyone thinks they might be getting perversion of the "bijita q" or "audition" kind, they're wasting their time.
