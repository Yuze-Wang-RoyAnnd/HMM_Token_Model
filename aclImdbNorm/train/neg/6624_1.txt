this film was absolutely...ugh i can't find the word oh wait... crap! i mean when it started i was like yeah this looks good and then after it was so boring. i nearly fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that i caught a late showing because it was utter filth. ram gopal varma has tried his best but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original sholay i mean what was he thinking doing a remake. what was he trying to do? be like sanjay leeli bhansani and win all the awards next year like he did for black? ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he was the one to look at. what was amitabh doing? he's destroying his own dignity by doing all these stupid films. first nishabd then cheeni kum then jhoom barabar jhoom and now this i mean hes got to gather a bit of his money and move as far away from bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and i'm telling you he's already past half his way. i mean all this is really good for the other actors like shah rukh khan who's getting a really good name now because of the recent downfall of amitabh. i never really liked him because he thinks he's god and i just knew abhishek was going to be in that movie. <br /><br />if you want to save your lb17.75 and spend it on something good go watch heyy babyy because that's just the funniest movie ever and it's number one in the charts!
