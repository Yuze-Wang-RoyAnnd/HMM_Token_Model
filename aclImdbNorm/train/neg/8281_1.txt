this was a silly movie with a predictable storyline and dreadful acting!! willy nelson was as stiff as his braids. the movie just seemed like a very long advert for the bright red lipstick that jessica simpson wore - especially as there were so many close-ups on her face. the premise was not amusing and as i said - soooooooo predictable. whatever money was spent on making this movie was a shameful waste. any allusions to other old marilyn monroe movies did not enhance the viewing of blonde ambition at all. it was also so unbelievable - jessica simpson being able to step into an executive secretary position at the drop of a hat - that was laughable!!!
