i watched this on a weekend afternoon as there was simply nothing else on, it would have been more entertaining to chew off my feet and probably less painful. i urge anyone to watch this just to see how turgidly awful a movie can be, surely it was deliberate. i cringed at every futile attempt at humour carried out in such a childish, unrehearsed, badly executed way that it was beyond belief. this is the movie that makes spiceworld look like goodfellas, think i am exaggerating? well give it airtime and think again. dreadful, utterly dreadful. if this wasn't a prank then the director and anyone else responsible for this should be removed and promptly shot after being forced to watch this film again.
