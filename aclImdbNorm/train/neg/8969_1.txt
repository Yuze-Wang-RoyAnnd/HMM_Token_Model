the plot doesn't offer any new excitements, it even starts the same as cube i. this time there are no other enhancements for the cube machinery, except for having an extra exit, which is not guarded, very ingenious. the characters are also not so well elaborated as in the first episode, they just became "flat" as in a soap opera. <br /><br />if somebody makes it to the normal exit, the person would be asked some questions, like "do you believe in god?", its not really creative or original and especially in my opinion it doesn't fit into the mystery of the cube with it traps. really there is nothing much else to say about it.
