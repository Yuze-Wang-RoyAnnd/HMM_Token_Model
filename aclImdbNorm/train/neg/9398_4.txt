...at least during its first half. if it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes, it would have been a much better and tighter film. the second half of the film is worth it, especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships, but it's like a dull toothache getting there. also, don't watch this film just because ginger rogers is in it. she has an important role, but it's a small one.<br /><br />the film starts out showing three new york city buddies working the tourist trade and also in good-natured competition for the hand of sally (ginger rogers), a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue. world war i breaks out, the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle, yet enlist in the navy anyways. the one of the three with the least industry as a civilian (bill boyd as baltimore) winds up the commanding officer to the other two (robert armstrong as dutch and james gleason as skeets). to make matters more complex, sally has fallen in love with one of the three, but doesn't have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to war.<br /><br />the film is a little more interesting on board ship, mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself, and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable. however, james gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby, especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible.<br /><br />one real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design, or, i should say, the lack of it. in the scenes in new york just prior to wwi we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 - no effort was taken to bring this film into period.<br /><br />in conclusion, if you watch the few scenes with ginger rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission, you've seen everything here worth seeing. the rest is padding.
