i cannot say that aag is the worst bollywood film ever made, because i haven't seen every bollywood film, but my imagination tells me that it could well be.<br /><br />this film seems like an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director, and i for one be believe he has been successful in his mission. no a-list actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same billing as him for all the humiliation this film is bound to carry with it.<br /><br />but lets not just blame the director here, there is the cinematographer, who looks like he's rehearsing for the amateur home movie maker of the year award. there is the over dramatic score, that hopes to carry you to the next scene. the lighting man, who must have been holding a cigarette in one hand and light bulb on pole in the other, and hoping that the flame burning off the cigarette would add to that much needed light in every scene. and, of course the actors! some of them are by no means newcomers, else all could be forgiven here. the ensemble of actors in aag were put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the re-make of india's most loved movie of all time, 'sholay'. one must not forget that these actors were not forced in to this film, they are a-list and willing participants to something that, let's face it would surely have had high and eager public expectation??? so it begs the question, amitabh aside (for now), did the other actors really believe their performances even attempted to better the original? did amitabh bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in this farcical abomination of a film? don't be stupid, of course he didn't, this was a demonstration to the public of how much money talks hence can make actors walk.<br /><br />i truly hope everyone involved is satisfied with what is truly a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film, which only succeeds in polluting everyone's mind when they watch the original.
