the "saucy" misadventures of four au pairs who arrive in london on the same day in the early 1970s. there's a swedish girl, a danish, a german and a chinese. the story contrives to get the clothes off all of them, involve them in some carry on-type humour and couple them with various misfits from the british film and tv culture of the time, including man about the house star richard o'sullivan, future coronation street rogue johnny briggs and horror film stalwart ferdy mayne (playing a sheik). there's a pretty risqu'e amount of female nudity on display, for those who like that kind of thing (but obviously nothing hardcore).<br /><br />most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential; the girls are stereotypes, and german anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder - she's a moron obsessed with colour tv who acts like a kind of uninhibited child & dresses to deliberately show her private parts; in another more serious film, she would be a psychiatric case. the most interesting section of the film involves the swedish girl being taken to a club in london where some dodgy types are still trying to swing, being seduced by a middle-aged rocker, losing her virginity and realising that the scene is not for her. these sequences have some energy in them and point to a more intriguing film than we've ended up with, in which promiscuity and the dregs of the music business and upper classes live soulless and seedy lives (there's a fine turn by john standing as an impotent public school rou'e). the strangest of the stories has the chinese girl (future cannibal film veteran me me lay) getting off with her childish piano prodigy employer, falling mutually in love with and then leaving in the middle of the night for no good reason at all, except some orientalist notion that "chinese birds are inscrutable, ain't they?!" the film is pretty demeaning to its women characters and there's a smattering of homophobia in the dialogue and one of the characterisations. the end is striking, as mayne's sheik for no earthly reason (except they have to end the film somehow) whisks all of the girls away to his arab kingdom for what looks to all the world like a future in the white slave trade, which they are all delighted about.<br /><br />stuff and nonsense for the most part then, but directed with a fair amount of skill by veteran val guest, which puts it as a piece of film-making a notch above most of the 70s brit sexploitation flicks.
