(r#97)<br /><br />there is one good thing about this poor man's pok'emon (make of that what you will): the opening theme. it has to be the coolest theme music of any sloppily dubbed japanese made-for-the-consumers-oops-i-mean-the-young-fans anime tv show. unfortunately there was need to add some sort of show after the opening theme. and they just couldn't come up with something more interesting than people arguing loudly about whose cards are better than the others' cards. freud would have a field day, unfortunately i can't imagine why any kids would want to sit through a show where dialogue written by a thousand monkeys in five minutes takes up 98% of the running time.<br /><br />"my uber-fantastical doomsday creature of ultimate doom will take your measly pyramid diamond animal in a single strike! can't you see that you have no chance of winning this battle, you fool?! hahahahhahhaha!"<br /><br />"oh yeah? well watch this! i am about to use my destruction force delta times pie card which eradicates every single one of your power munchers and renders your uber-fantastical doomsday creature of ultimate doom's destroy beyond all significance attack useless! i bet you didn't see that one coming!" <br /><br />seriously, that's all they ever do in this show, talk. whereas in another crappy kids' show i used to watch, namely the commercial phenomenon pok'emon (every soccer mum's pet peeve), at least the monsters had the courtesy to duke it out every once in a while, "yu-gi-oh" is just, in the quiet words of roger ebert's a clockwork orange review, "plain talky and boring". not to mention long-winded (i realize i'm being hypocritical here considering the sentence i just wrote).<br /><br />this show goes on forever. i don't know if there's any plot, and the static monsters have none of the character of pok'emon. even when not compared to my fave cartoon as a kid, this show sucks. it's unintentionally funny, but not funny enough to be worth seeing. bye bye, sleep tight, dream wet dreams.
