my wife and i rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and "office space". blockbuster and imdb even had it as an "also recommended" selection if you liked "office space".<br /><br />now, i've seen office space probably 15 or 20 times. i love it. it's probably one of my 10 favorite movies. witty, humorous, and featuring characters that remind me of people i've worked with over the years. "haiku tunnel" is similar to "office space" in that they are both films. that's where the similarity ends. we sat through probably the first 50 minutes of ht, giving it the benefit of the doubt, hoping, nay, *praying* that it would get better. it didn't. we couldn't take it any more, and stopped the tape. thank god it was a free rental. i'd have been p***ed if we'd actually paid for it. we should be reimbursed for having to sit through it. now, since we didn't see the end, perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself. i doubt it.<br /><br />haiku tunnel is so bad it's hard to believe it ever got produced. the movie is so unfunny it's painful. just mail the friggin letters already!!! the premise is asinine. the jokes are awful. we got as far as the "printer doesn't work" scene and had to stop. we couldn't take it anymore. this film is an embarrasment for josh kornbluth.<br /><br />if you are a fan of office space......don't waste your time with this turd. 0/10
