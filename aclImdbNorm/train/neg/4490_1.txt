man would expect that a movie shot with an approx. budget of 300,000,000 u$d should at least entertain you for the time you are spending in the cinema actally watching it. "matrix reloaded" proves this assumption wrong.<br /><br />"the matrix" worked out better, despite having apparent holes concerning logic of the story. at least nobody could explain to me why beating up a bot (aka agent) inside a simulation (aka martix) would harm the responsible computer program in any way...<br /><br />unfortunately, the wachowski brothers made excactly this "agent-bashing" the main thing in "matrix reloaded": it's a beat 'em up o-rama. this fighting scenes may be work out sufficient (or even cool) in a 5 sec. trailer, but prolonged for several minutes, apparently being faked, choreographed poorly and repeated over and over again it is nothing more than boring. despite seeing the promised spectecular stunts there is nothing more than simple low-quality, unimaginative bashing already seen (or better not) in eg. van damme 'movies'. the difference of post-production (etherything is 5 times faster, the camera floats around a lot and freezes on certain scenes, and this is repeated for at least 5min) doesn't help here, all this has nothing to do with the very meaning of "martial arts". beside these 'fights', all actors do refuse to do what they are payed for: acting.<br /><br />what's up besides the fighting scenes? few except hollywood routine. this oh-so-multicultural bunch of hippies which sucked in "waterworld" are recycled as citizen of "zion" (mans last city on earth), and on the order of morpheus they start dancing, 'cause this is a good opportunity to show a lot of barely covered tits and butts. the oh-so-popular clich'ee of the frog aka frenchmen talking with this "je ne sais quoi" dumb accent, who wastes his fortune because of a "liason d'amour" is bravely served. following this (and unwanted funny) is the fight between neo and the sinister followers of 'the frog', since it takes place in an erroy flynn like enterieur, luckily featuring a lot of mideaval weapons for decoration. for neo posing with the hellebarde, just add 2 stairs and a lot of statues (for being destructed, thrown over evil guys and the like) and you get 5 more senseless, boring min. of this junk.<br /><br />whats left to expect? the usual merchandising hell. and "revolutions" which will happen or not - certainly without me.
