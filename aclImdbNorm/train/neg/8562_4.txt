camille 2000 <br /><br />aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (panavision)<br /><br />sound format: mono<br /><br />whilst visiting rome, an amorous nobleman (nino castelnuovo) falls in love with a beautiful young libertine (daniele gaubert), but their unlikely romance is opposed by castelnuovo's wealthy father (massimo serato), and fate deals a tragic blow...<br /><br />a sexed-up love story for the swinging sixties, adapted from a literary source (alexandre dumas' 'la dame aux camelias') by screenwriter michael deforrest, and directed with freewheeling flair by radley metzger who, along with the likes of russ meyer and joe sarno, is credited with redefining the parameters of 'adult' cinema throughout the 1960's and 70's. using the scope format for the last time in his career, metzger's exploration of 'la dolce vita' is rich in visual excess (note the emphasis on reflective surfaces, for example), though the film's sexual candor seems alarmingly coy by modern standards. production values are handsome throughout, and the performances are engaging and humane (castelnuovo and gaubert are particularly memorable), despite weak post-sync dubbing. though set in an unspecified future, enrico sabbatini's wacked-out set designs locate the movie firmly within its period, and piero piccioni's 'wah-wah' music score has become something of a cult item amongst exploitation devotees. ultimately, camille 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of this director's elegant softcore erotica won't be disappointed. next up for metzger was the lickerish quartet (1970), which many consider his best film.
