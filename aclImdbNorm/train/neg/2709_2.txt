the only way to get anything out of this film is to approach it as a comedy. seen in that light, it does deliver. <br /><br />if you're looking for a serious movie, look somewhere else. this film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a cursory and one dimensional examination of "issues" with no insight whatsoever.<br /><br />making a movie about stereotypes and then making every single character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely poor strategy - especially when those same characters only break their hackneyed molds in predictable, stereotypical ways. <br /><br />busta rhymes and ice cube make the film almost watchable, and michael rappaport turns in a good performance, but the script is so awful and the social commentary is so trite, it's hard to find anything redeeming.
