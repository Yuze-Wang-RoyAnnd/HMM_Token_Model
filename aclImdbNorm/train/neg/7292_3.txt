sunshine is a european import set in hungary between 1880 and 1980, it's the epic story of hungarian jews, the sonnenschein family. this name literally translates to sunshine. the family has humble beginnings, then is prosperous, becomes upwardly mobile, changes it's name, and hopes to assimilate into hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally. the story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations; ralph fiennes plays these three roles. for those who missed the ww-ii and the holocaust in europe, the sonnenschein' approach to life doesn't work out very well.<br /><br />sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success, but it is an opportunity missed. the story line, dominated by world history, is predictable and transparent; this is reinforced with voice cover narration and newsreel footage. the family 'plot' lurches from one predictable event [ie. the hapsburgs, ww-i, ww-ii, fascism, communism, etc.] to the next with little continuity, depth or detail. the jewish assimilation theme is unfocused, and important sub-themes [the 'secret' diary and family philosophy] that could have given the family character and credibility are l ost until the very end. alternatively, the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest / infidelity.<br /><br />ralph fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance but his performance is far from award winning material. the "3 for 1" casting format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater. sunshine is basically hungarian "history channel" material. it has the look and feel of winds of war morphed with forrest gump morphed with something about sex.<br /><br />
