elvis presley plays a "half-breed" native american ("indian") who has to defend his reservation from nasty business tycoons. everyone likes to get drunk, fight, and make children. fighting, wrestling, and "punching out" each other replace the stereotypical hand-raised expression "how"?<br /><br />although he does have make-up on, it's obvious elvis is healthier than he appeared in prior films; possibly, he was getting ready for his famous "comeback". it couldn't have been because this movie's script was anything to get excited about. joan blondell trying to seduce elvis, and burgess meredith in "war paint", should be ashamed.<br /><br />the best song is "stay away" (actually, "green sleeves" with different lyrics). the most embarrassing song is elvis' love song to the bull "dominic". there are some surreal scenes, but it never becomes trippy enough to succeed in that genre; though, "stay away, joe" might provide some laughs if you're in the right "mood".<br /><br />otherwise, stay away. <br /><br />** stay away, joe (1968) peter tewksbury ~ elvis presley, burgess meredith, joan blondell
