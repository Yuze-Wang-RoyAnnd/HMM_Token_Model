i'll just put it out here, that was the worst sequel to a classic disney film i've ever seen. in 1950, disney released what i hail as one of his greatest films of all time. now take away the great songs, add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost tv show. "put it together and what do you get?" the biggest load of crud i've ever seen. after i saw this, i thought it was all over for disney. cinderella should've ended with, "and they lived happily ever after." not this garbage. this film did not deserve a sequel like this. i thought it would be like "a twist in time" which was moderate but better than this. also, what do we care of anastasia? she switched sides like iago did, but it didn't help anyone.
