i kind of feel like a genius; i feel like i'm the only one who saw through this fake film. i watched it three times, once with commentary, and i found myself getting annoyed at all the close-ups, all the times the screen just blacks out, and worst of all, i feel the film never really resolves anything. yes, the priest dies, but he didn't really seem at peace with the town that gave him so much grief, or with himself. that and he was an idiot. if it weren't for the commentary by peter cowie which explained not only the movie but the book it came from, i wouldn't have been able to stomach it at all. i enjoy french movies, but this is one that was completely absurd.<br /><br />diary of a country priest is filmed in beautiful black and white photography but, that alone cannot save this deadly dull tripe. scene after scene of extreme close-ups where characters don't say anything until the camera cuts away and goes to a black out do not make an interesting or relevant story. how this film ever became a classic is mind boggling: it reminds me more of the emperor's new clothes.<br /><br />yes, claude laydu's performance is heartfelt and thought provoking, if you are a sadist, but this film left me feeling empty because overall it is a weak impression of the catholic priesthood, which is an ignoble and inglorious institution of corruption. the young priest's triumph over the countess's pride is a weak scene but 90% of the film will drag you down with its dreary introspection and window into the young priest's melancholy thoughts. this priest doesn't come across so much as being humble as he does just plain pitiful.<br /><br />being that i don't speak or understand french i was looking forward to doing the english subtitle thing to help understand the film. well, the english subtitle is at times impossible to view/read and the text rolls by so quickly that there was much i could not read (and i am not a particularly slow reader - i just finished dostoyevsky in 3 days). <br /><br />i really wanted to like this film . i try out everything "chosen" by the criterion collection, and yet can not see why in many ways this one merits some sort of critical nod. however, i sat through this entire two hour film yearning to feel some sort of empathy for the main character, and it never materialized. he just seemed like a victim rather than a fighter. and for that, i say it stunk.
