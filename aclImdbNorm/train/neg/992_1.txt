this movie was disgusting. their should be a warning that some sadistic nasty writer is attempting to make a name for herself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching garbage. what is garbage? the misuse of peoples time, the misuse of energy, and the waste of whatever type of educational system that taught her how to read and write. talia you are a sick demented loser. your psychiatrist needs to prescribe stronger medications for your problem. <br /><br />the acting and plot gave me no choice but to fast forward through the middle of the garbage. i ended up at a scene that was uncalled for. if you want to learn how to shock people watch a larry clark movie. i lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie "no more support from me." how could actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross depictions of human behavior is manifested from the mind of a psycho? i feel sorry for all actors that took part in that scene. i think the devil now knows who the writer of this movie is; congratulations you won his attention.
