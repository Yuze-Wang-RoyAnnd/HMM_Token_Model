i've seen (far too) many flicks from this company - this one is about middle of the pack. one the good side, its a bit more stylized and under control than some of their fare - less of the sophomoric attempts at humor and more adherence to story (for what its worth). many of their titles, like sexy sixth sense, are buried by baaaad performances and an amateurish sensibility. on the other side, i found the simulated sex scenes not as hot as some of their other flicks (like vampire vixens, gladiator eroticus, spiderbabe or mistress frankenstein).<br /><br />misty mundae is always a 10 on the peter meter, as is darian caine. i found barbara joyce hot in a school-marm kinda way, and ruby larocca a sexy little hottie.<br /><br />watch this with the remote firmly in your (free) hand, on a night when you need a break from porn. don't waste your time wanting to check the story - you've got better things to do w/ your life. it is not a movie, it's pure t&a, but not bad by that standard.
