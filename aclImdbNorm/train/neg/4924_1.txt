this film is really bad. it maybe harsh, but it is. it really is. poor script, every vampire clich'e in the book is used, and no sympathy is given at all to the origins of the main character ... i.e. ole dracula. there have been some truly brilliant dracula/vampire movies in the past, but this doesn't even make it into the "dire" slot.<br /><br />take a selection of people who seem to have dropped out of a teen-slasher move, add a dribble of dracula lore and mix in a heady tonic of religious/surreal day-dreaming ... and you get a confusing mess of a film - dracula 2000.<br /><br />i really cannot find any good things to say about this movie, as if it wasn't bad enough that it was made in the first place, they seem to have made johnny lee miller effect an english accent ... whats the problem with that i hear you cry ... well, he is english, but he sounds like an american trying to do an english accent.<br /><br />all in all you may as well say your money (if you were thinking of buying it), or rent it out, watch it, and discover for yourself why it's about as scary as the tellytubbies.<br /><br />p.s. although la la is pretty frightening!
