hard to describe this one -- if you were a fan of russ meyer films back in the day, you will surely be pleased to see that haji is still looking really hot, though forry ackerman has not fared so well (what is he doing still making these movies anyway? if i go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie?). it was a pretty fun premise -- a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon -- but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length, and the jokes were on a level with your average joe e. brown comedy (or, abbott and costello if that's your thing) -- basically just bad puns. still, i found this movie fascinating to watch, and for more than 2 reasons. good job, but still a fundamentally flimsy production.
