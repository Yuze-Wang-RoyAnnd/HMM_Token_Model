it figures this is a french film, lol, with the emphasis on young girls with much older men...why is it the french are so fixated on this kind of thing? when the age difference is this great, it really comes off as pervy! valentina cervi is beautiful (she bears a strong resemblance to olivia hussey, of zeffirelli's '68 romeo and juliet, set in a similar period), but she looks about 15 and the actor playing tassi, her painting instructor, looks...well, 50 is kind.<br /><br />other posters have done the work of explaining the historical record (unusually detailed in this case) of the real artemisia, a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of this period (17th century). her story speaks to us in modern times particularly because of the age-old accusation that "all great artists were men" -- she pretty much blasts that assertion to bits -- and because the story of her rape trial is so poignant. not only was she clearly assaulted, and forced into a degrading sexual relationship (because in those days marriage to your assaulter was the only way to avoid social shame), but tassi was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and child.<br /><br />the movie does a terrible disservice by inverting this truly fascinating and remarkable real life story -- very dramatic and not in need of any "spicing up" -- because in some weird frencified way, it's "hotter" to have an oversexed teenager drawing male sexual organs and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather. that's "sexy" -- the truth is boring and seems too feminist/politically correct.<br /><br />it also disturbs me that this is only part of artemisia life considered interesting enough to film. the fact that she painted for decades (her famous painting of judith beheading holfernes was painted after, not before the rape), that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious florentine academy, that she went on to have children...oh that's boring stuff. after all, that's about a middle aged woman and they aren't "hot" like teenagers.<br /><br />i understand that there is a lot of creative license in making a film (or a book) about a real historical character. you need to create dialog, have subplots, create dramatic structure. certainly some details can be sacrificed -- it's no big deal if the dates are moved a few years, or if artemisia is played by a blonde actress (when we know from her self portraits that she was a brunette...and a big boned one, not a skinny minny), or something like that. but to turn her story around on her, and make rape into a romance is actually sick and disturbing. it's even worse because the director is female. she should be horribly ashamed of herself!<br /><br />if you like this (and i know some people could care less about the real woman artist and just like period costumes and hot sex), you will probably like "dangerous beauty" with rufus sewell and catherine mccormack. similarly based on heavily re-written history, with lots of heaving bosoms and jewel encrusted goblets: bon appetit!
