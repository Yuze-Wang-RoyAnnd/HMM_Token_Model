it is very unfortunate when a movie such as this is made. a great deal of work and money has been put into a film that is amateur at best.<br /><br />the editing drags on, there are obvious mistakes that could have been corrected easily in a second take, and the soundtrack is unimaginative. so much more could have been done with this video movie. i guess they ran out of time, or videotape.<br /><br />hand-held shots have a distinct amateur feel to them.
