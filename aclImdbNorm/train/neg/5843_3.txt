altered species starts one friday night in los angeles where dr. irwin (guy vieg) & his laboratory assistant walter (allen lee haff) are burning the midnight oil as they continue to try & perfect a revolutionary new drug called 'rejenacyn'. as walter tips the latest failed attempt down the sink the pipes leak the florescent green liquid into the basement where escaped lab rats begin to drink it... five of walter's friends, alicia (leah rown in a very fetching outfit including some cool boots that she gets to stomp on a rat with), gary (richard peterson), burke (derek hofman), frank (david bradley) & chelsea (alexandra townsend) decide that he has been working too hard & needs to get out so they plan to pick him up & party the night away. back at the lab & the cleaner douglas (robert broughton) has been attacked & killed by the now homicidal rats in the basement as walter injects the latest batch of serum in a lab rat which breaks out of it's cage as it grows at an amazing rate. walter's friends turn up but he can't leave while the rat is still missing so everyone helps him look for it. all six become potential rat food...<br /><br />also known as rodentz altered species was co-edited & directed by miles feldman & has very little to recommend it. the script by producer serge rodnunsky is poor & coupled together with the general shoddiness of the production as a whole altered species really is lame. for a start the character's are dumb, annoying & clich'ed. then there's the unoriginal plot with the mad scientist, the monster he has created, the isolated location, the stranded human cast & the obligatory final showdown between hero & monster. it's all here somewhere. altered species moves along at a fair pace which is just about the best thing i can say about it & thankfully doesn't last that long. it's basically your average run-of-the-mill killer mutant rat film & not a particularly good one at that either.<br /><br />director feldman films like a tv film & the whole thing is throughly bland & forgettable while some of the special effects & attack scenes leave a lot to be desired. for a start the cgi rats are awful, the attack sequences feature hand-held jerky camera movement & really quick edits to try & hide the fact that all the rats are just passively sitting there. at various points in altered species the rat cages need to shake because of the rats movement but you can clearly see all the rats just sitting there as someone shakes the cages off screen. the giant rat monster at the end looks pretty poor as it's just a guy in a dodgy suit. there are no scares, no tension or atmosphere & since when did basements contain bright neon lighting? there are one or two nice bits of gore here, someone has a nice big messy hole where their face used to be, there's a severed arm & decapitation, lots of rat bites, someone having their eyeball yanked out & a dead mutilated cat.<br /><br />technically altered species is sub standard throughout. it takes place within the confines of one building, has cheap looking cgi effects & low production values. the acting isn't up to much but it isn't too bad & a special mention to leah rowan as alicia as she's a bit of a babe & makes altered species just that little bit nicer & easier to watch...<br /><br />altered species isn't a particularly good film, in fact it's a pretty bad one but i suppose you could do worse. not great but it might be worth a watch if your not too demanding & have nothing else to do.
