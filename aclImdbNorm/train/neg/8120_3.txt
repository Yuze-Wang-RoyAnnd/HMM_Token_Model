at least among those movies with 100 votes or more. nominated for best screenplay written directly for the screen? brenda blethyn nominated for best actress in a leading role?? nominated for best picture?? i always disagree with many of the oscar picks, but this movie might very well be the worst movie of all time to be honored by the academy. the writing and acting were both horrible. blethyn's perfomance in particular was one of the worst i've ever seen, and probably the most over-rated acting performance of all time. awful movie, not worthy of the big screen and not worthy of any cable or television channel that has ever played it, including hbo(where i saw it). i am only thankful i didn't actually pay to see one of the most over-rated movies of all time.
