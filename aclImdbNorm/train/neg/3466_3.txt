a slasher flick, made in the early 80's, has a curse on it which has anyone who tries to finish it turning up dead. years later, a group of film students attempted to complete the movie - also resurrecting the films deadly curse. great idea for a film, but sadly 'cut' is just another wasted opportunity.<br /><br />unfortunately australia hasn't had the world's best track record when it comes to horror. 'razorback' (1984) was an out and out dud as was 'holwing iii' (1987), which was half an american film anyway. as for our foray into comedy-horror, 'body melt' (1993) is best left forgotten. the problem with 'cut' is that the makers trying to create a clever horror satire a la 'scream' (1996) but have no insight into the genre or what makes it work. and although this sounds weird me saying this about a slasher film but what 'cut' really lacks is any "heart". sure it follows the basic "rules" established by 'scream', but it doesn't want to play with the formula, instead it goes for a cardboard copy of the earlier.<br /><br />the killer, scarman, is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic villains in horror movie history. his endless barrage awkwardly, lame one-liners would make the dialogue of a porno seem like shakespeare. the cast never seem like their fully involved and look like their just waiting for a shoot to be over so they can collect their pay checks. and the feel of the film is like it's deliberately trying not to be creepy; looking more like an episode of 'neighbors' or 'heartbreak high'. by the way, those attempts at mtv style, hyper-cinema during the "research" sequence just look lame, dated and out of place.<br /><br />if australia ever gets a chance to do horror again (which i hope we still do) maybe we should take a leaf from the 'mad max' (1979) book. instead of trying to copy the u.s. we should be trying our own take on the genre.
