i've seen the first of the dwarf-movies and sometimes i had little fun watching it. there are many famous tv/comedyactors appearing in the first part and presented, in fantasy costumes, typical little episodes of their stand-up-program and exactly that is the problem the second movie has to struggle with. everything was already there....nothing new to obtain. you're familiar with most of the often boring and dumb "jokes" and you always feel like their goal was to put in every comedylooser of the last decade who wants to get back on stage. there's nothing important about the story: typical fairy-tale story of rumpelstiltskin, without any importance. i expected something like that but that's nothing i could complain about. i'm actually complaining about the lazy story writers who had an entire background story; their only business was to get many jokes and parodies inside but they didn't get it anyway. this crap is except the great appearance of helge schneider a total waste of time and money.(if you don't like him then remove 2 points of my evaluation) if you like to save your money and get bad jokes then watch the crap that's broad casted every friday evening on sat1 or rtl for free. i'm sure you will recognize some "laugthers" i saw last night in cinema.
