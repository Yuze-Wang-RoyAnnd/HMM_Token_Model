beating the bad guys... again is the tag line for this movie, it exposes so much truth about it.<br /><br />home alone one and two, film classics. home alone three and four, a good film if you're three! like sharkboy and lavagirl, as hard as it tries to be funny, it's not. culkin is replaced by alex d'linz or something else. he's a very bland actor with bland performances, but it's not entirely his fault, the writing called for bland vocabulary and bland expressions. the pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks, and you'd have to be blind to think those chicken pox are real. a good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which is showing this film on a rainy day. and to make things worst, a totally different cast, go see if you don't believe me, but you'll regret it.
