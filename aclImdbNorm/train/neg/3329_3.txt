take your basic frankenstein flick, inject some reanimator (but not the good parts), and you have doctor hackenstein. certainly, this was obviously inspired by aforementioned films but it never materializes as anything special on its own.<br /><br />a scientist accidentally kills his wife, so the whole movie takes place over the course of one night as he attempts to revive his wife. to revive his wife, he decides to chop off body parts from some women that have become stranded and, coincidentally, decide to stay the night at his place.<br /><br />i can't really say the acting is bad, nor is the directing. everything here is just way too standard. what little attempts there are at humor actually work (check out the scene when hackenstein keeps hiding behind his deaf assistant because she would undoubtedly be very upset if she saw him clutching a woman and a needle), but that's hardly enough to recommend this film. the music is decent, what blood that's there is decent, and the cast looks quite good. and for half of the time, i was even entertained by this film. but i never felt like this was anything more than a time waster. avoidable.<br /><br />try frankenhooker instead.
