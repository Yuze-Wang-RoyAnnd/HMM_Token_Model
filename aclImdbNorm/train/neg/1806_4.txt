antonioni's movies have aged not well. what always surprised me about them is that, besides an unquestionable plastic beauty, there is a dull and didactic "psychology" of the characters and situations. remember, for instance, the conversations between mastroianni and the "wicked capitalistic" that wants sing up him in "la notte", or monica vitti laughing at the peasants flirting in the train in "la aventura", or ferzetti dropping the glass of ink at the end of the same film. <br /><br />i have reviewed yesterday "zabriskie point". in this film there are a lot of nice and elaborate shots of the rod taylor office, the streets and highways of l.a., the publicity advertisements, the deserts,etc., that show the fascination of the author in his american journey, in the same way than wim wenders years later. unfortunately, there are too a lot of hippie-leftist clich'es that spoil the movie: - the boy leaves the meeting, steals an aeroplane and flies over the desert in order to liberate himself and find "something different". - the executives in grey suites speak all the time about speculation. - the girl looks at the "object women" in the swimming pool and leaves because she wants not to be like them. - the couple of fat middle-class in the caravan speak, in front of the beauty of the nature, of building a hotel and earning a lot of money. - last but not the least, a lot of couples making love in the desert. what a hippie platitude!<br /><br />sorry, today, half a century after the "revolution" of "la aventura" we can see that the king is naked, and his films (except "le amiche" and perhaps "il grido") are only a handful of aestheticism and commonplaces.
