or: it's a bird ? it's a plane ? no, look... it's a disaster ! or: no need to look up in the sky.<br /><br />or: (... ok, that's enough.) if singer tried to make a romantic titanic like movie to crash the box office record, he failed. the sr structure can't do this, the dark and restricted color scheme (i would call it "wishi-washi"), the boring usual dialogs, the clown with advanced alien technology, the missing fun and magic, etc. makes the movie completely disappointing.<br /><br />it simply doesn't work.<br /><br />the main thing at a character like superman is, that he is a superhero. that's the core, the most important thing.<br /><br />love trouble and a sadly lost depressive supersoftie can maximal only be a facet in a 2:40 long superman movie, not the whole time.<br /><br />because then it is not a superman or superhero movie anymore. it's like a (and in this case a very bad and boring) social study, where every 30 minutes a person flies around.<br /><br />that's a big difference.<br /><br />this movie is a joke. holy skywalker, this is superman, so give us supervillains, superaction and the most important thing, superfun.<br /><br />we want entertainment ! singer, if you want to make a 2:40 long soul love trouble drama about lost and sadly people ? then take normal human characters and make a yentl remake.<br /><br />they say: superman returns. and then, supersadlysoftie stands in the door.<br /><br />maybe singer has tried to kill the legend without kryptonite, but one bad movie can't do this. don't give up, they plan a sequel...<br /><br />next time singer (and warner brothers), make a superhero movie, not a depressive superlame soap, or let it be. a superhero movie means a colorful fantasy with a lot of fun and magic.<br /><br />this movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover. yes, technically there are all sorts in, yes, there is a lot of small talks, there are a few jokes, a view action scenes, etc, but the only one what all these worse pieces have in common is their poor quality.<br /><br />it's not more than a super boring patchwork and one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my live.<br /><br />the ridiculous cast strategy (cast them young as possible, so we can make sequels in the next 25 years) gives the rest. kate bosworth plays a 22 year old star reporter, she's looking like 19. superman was full five years away, so he slept with her 6 years ago, so she was 16, (looking like 13) and a daily planet reporter, wroting "i spend a night with superman". warner brothers, that's too much.<br /><br />routh is not so bad, he is playing a little bit wooden, but the whole movie is wooden, so... ?! temporary good were marsden and sometimes posey. the rest, forget it. even spacey, this is not his terrain.<br /><br />reeve/hackman/kidder were acting so easy, with fun. what a difference.<br /><br />the jesus poses at the end are ridiculous too. what the hell should that be ? the problem here is, they mean this serious, not as a joke. next time spiderman or batman or ironman falls and rises like jesus or angels ? or they speak with god directly. why not ? they are superheroes, saving human lives every day. so at least one talk with god every week should be possible... oh my god.<br /><br />maybe this was not the real announced movie, instead it is from a bizarre dull parallel universe.<br /><br />for the warner brothers this superlame depressive flick will be possibly the greatest disaster in history. not only because of the money.<br /><br />i understand how difficult it (maybe) was to create and transport some messages or feelings, but showing lone, lost and sadly people isn't new and thousands of movies or tv-shows did it better, in very old or new ones like magnolia. and the flying frogs there were more impressive than this flying superwoman, sorry, superman of course.<br /><br />singer and wb, that's simply nothing. in fact it's even more than nothing, it's like a black hole that destroys the passion for (comic/superhero) movies and steals us three hours of our life.<br /><br />mrs. smilla's little brother. (very angry and green like the hulk.)
