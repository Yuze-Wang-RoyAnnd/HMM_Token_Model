an obvious b-grade effort to cash in on the hostel/saw buzz, my expectations for this film were low (really low!) and yet it still managed to disappoint on every level. the acting is so bad it's not even funny, the plot-line is non-existent and the only scare was realizing that i had wasted 1hour 21 minutes watching it! i'm surprised to note that 34 people gave it a 10 star rating. i can only suspect that 33 of these are cast and crew. the 34th is possibly the directors mother? - although i'm sure even she would find it hard to go higher than a 2! dvd extras include an hour long "making of" feature. which raises the question, "why?" (although perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do!). avoid at all costs.
