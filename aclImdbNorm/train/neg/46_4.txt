i have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties. i finally found it on dvd at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie the story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil. laura crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in south america. they take her into the jungle laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself "the devil" she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy. maidens are chained up. the devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner. peter weston, is the devil hunter, who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her,
