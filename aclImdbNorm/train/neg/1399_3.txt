ouch, what a painfully boring sci-fi movie! and that's especially saddening because the opening 15 minutes were so action-packed and full of potential! during the intro, we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a briefcase full of top-secret files. as he's about to reveal the supposedly horrible & inhuman events that take place in the lab, he's executed. figures
