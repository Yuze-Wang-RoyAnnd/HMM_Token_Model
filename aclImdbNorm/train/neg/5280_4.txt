chris, an adopted son of a moral family, a loser whom works at the school newspaper with kate (christine lakin from of the awful sugary "step by step" show of the now thankfully defunct abc's tgif line-up), finds out that he's just inherited a porn empire from his biological parents. he loses sight of what true friendship and love is and blah blah some other nonsense. he also has to contend with an uncle who wants control of the family business and a shifty lawyer (arn't they are?) a slightly below average teen comedy that steals from better teen comedies (the opening alone is highly american pie-esquire), bops you on the head with the moral every chance it gets, and wastes the only star talent it has (wayne newton, lin shaye, and if i'm really stretching the star word, martin starr of "freaks and geeks", and justin berfield of "malcolm in the middle"). it's not bad exactly, but it's far from good.<br /><br />eye candy: a few extras get topless <br /><br />my grade: c- <br /><br />where i saw it: starz on demand (available until september 29th)
