the only reason i watched the movie till the end was the "hope" to see something interesting. the movie is really bad and the performance of the girl it is really, really bad, honestly, i am not a movie critic neither an expert but you just need common sense to notice that this work it is incredibly bad.<br /><br />the first thing that came to my mind as soon as she started to talk was: "she has an affair with willem dafoe and he accepted to help her with the screenplay and appear in her movie since she is the brilliant director"... surprise, surprise, next day after i watched the film i found out on internet that giada colagrande is his wife. awful story and terrible performance.
