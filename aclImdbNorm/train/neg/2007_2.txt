the cast is ok. the script is awkward at times, and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is. i found myself looking forward to doing the dishes. the shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war. i guess we were supposed to not notice it...we did. its a house, you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes. the shower part...huh? what was that about? literally, it is i have a client, "ok you can use our shower." yawn. the angles are trying way to hard. there was a set of woods, suddenly its gone cause you can see right through, then next it is deep and animals are dying. in the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions.
