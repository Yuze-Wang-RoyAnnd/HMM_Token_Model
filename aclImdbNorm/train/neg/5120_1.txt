this isn't a film, it's a 111-minute evangelical christian sermon draped over red state america's #1 sport, high school football. another of the long, earnest messages to the converted who are then presumed to be fired up enough by the spirit to go abroad and convert their unsaved neighbours.<br /><br />dialogue like "you won the big one when you accepted christ" loses any possible camp appeal by the disturbing intensity in director/coach alex kendrick's sunken black eyes. then there are the "parables".<br /><br />two farmers prayed for rain but only one prepared his field to receive it. which one do you think god blessed? this rhetorical question is meant to foreshadow the miraculous climax, in the course of which coach asks his trepidous back-up kicker, "son, do you think god could help you make that kick?" it's the kind of entertainment we could have expected would receive faith-based funding ad infinitum, if only the evangelical christian bush administration's hegemonic pursuits around the world had convinced us all to become "devout" after their example. behold that poor giants coach in the apocalyptic finale, urging his team on crying "who's with me!" while the devout eagles on the other side were quietly going about doing the lord's work.<br /><br />so, do you think our terrified back-up makes his kick to vanquish those self-centrist goliaths? well, we all know zealots can't lose. put it this way: transfer the playing ground to the deserts of the middle east, replace the christian proselytizing, and this virulent nonsense can easily be repackaged as a taliban-vs-superpower parable, which the devout worshippers of this garbage might want to think about a minute.<br /><br />luckily they won't care, nor need to: like coach tells his team of earnest empty vessels pregame, the answers are all right here in this book. and the christian right will devour this on their way to their rapture, that final victory they have prepared their fields for.
