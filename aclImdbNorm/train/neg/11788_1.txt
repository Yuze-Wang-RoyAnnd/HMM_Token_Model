this was one of the worst movies ever!!!!!!!! it was so bad, i was laughing through the whole movie! the plot was so cheesy; especially the end. this movie turns from an end-of-the-world-disaster to save-the-eels! i mean, c'mon! and i swear...i think they use sock puppets for the eels! and there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced. how predictable! it was so terrible that my mom, my sister, and i couldn't finish it, and when we did finish it, it was about a year later! the second time we watched it and we finished it this time, we did mst3k-like comments throughout the movie.<br /><br />summary: only watch this if you're a movie basher! make hilarious comments, watch this at a sleepover for laughs, and i mean huge laughs. also watch for mockery. the metaphor that explains this movie: this movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and sock puppets!
