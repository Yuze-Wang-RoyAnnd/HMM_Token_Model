are you kidding me?! a show highlighting someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal? how talented do you have to be to do this? she may be able to cook but it is not portrayed in this half-hour stomach churning painful production. i know she has a martha-stewart-esquire empire. so does warren buffett but i don't see him with fake knockers opening cans of cream corn and alpo.<br /><br />she has a nephew named...brycer. brycer? stop talking about anyone a name that stupid.<br /><br />more time is spent on "table-scapes" than actual cooking. who has that kind of time?! silicon should be on your spatula, not on my tv. this show should be on cartoon network, not food network.
