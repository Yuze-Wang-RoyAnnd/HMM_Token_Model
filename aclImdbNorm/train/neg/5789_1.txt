my wife and i really had high hopes for this film, but it was a major disappointment. it was a native american version of mr. magoo. a pathetic father who fails at everything he tries e.g. fishing, hunting, in an obvious way he subjects his family to his wild fantasies. his "visions" are not only ridiculous but in the process he lies to his son numerous times about various obvious things. words cannot express how bad this film is. the children and wife are very real which makes the film even sadder. i don't get the humor... unless you like laughing at other people making a fool of themselves. i don't get how this could have come up for awards. save your bucks, it's not worth the rental.
