i am an avid fan of horrendous movies, anything cheesy and down right ridiculous is my game. so imagine my spirit i went to the local rent shop, and found vampires vs. zombies. the name is just too entertaining, you know that no one in the world could pull off something like it, it just has to be bad.<br /><br />and boy, is it bad. after viewing this horror-ific movie, i was speechless, literally. me and my pal sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes, both of us contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie. i broke the depressing silence with the words, "...dude....what?" yes, i am an enthralling individual.<br /><br />heres a quick 'street review' the plot; there is none, at all, ever, constantly in "wtf" mode. the characters; no development, forgettable. the music; worse than porn. the vampires; theirs vampires? the zombies; theirs zombies?<br /><br />in the end; everyone should see this movie, honestly, its so bad i yearn to see it again. so do yourself a favor, watch it and get depressed.
