hood of the living dead is about a young scientist named rick who lives with his brother in the town of oklahoma where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets. then one night, rick's brother gets shot by a gang driving down the street who fought with him earlier. desperate, rick calls his scientist partner to bring over the latest formula they've been working on that brings sick blood cells to health. the formula hasn't been tested on a human, or even a dead body but rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. he gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens. so rick calls 911 and the body is carted away only for it to come back to life and feast on human flesh. now rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the dead. hood of the living dead is one piece of trash. the plot is a direct rip off of resident evil, the acting is just horrible especially with rick' s fake crying for his brother, the guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired it sends sparks out, and the make up is just lame. it's only fake blood covered over the actors face. the zombies are also modified. they run, growl, and must be shot in the heart to die! zombies should only scuffle, moan, and must be shot in the brain to die! this film is so horrible, the outtakes is the only true good moment of this film. hood of the living dead gets a 3 out of 10, a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest.
