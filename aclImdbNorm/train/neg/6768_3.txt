herbie, the volkswagen that thinks like a man, is back, now being driven by maggie peyton (lindsay lohan), a young woman who hopes to become a nascar champion. the only thing standing in her way is the current champion, trip murphy (matt dillon), who will do anything to stop them.<br /><br />the original love bug wasn't that good. even as a kid, i remember not liking it very much. i had some hope for the sequel though. i mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie. unfortunately, herbie is no better now than he was before. the film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12. it will probably entertain the kids but that's all.<br /><br />i realize it's a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting. there were very few laughs and it got boring near the end. most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too. lindsay lohan was alright as maggie peyton. she usually gives better performances like in freaky friday and mean girls. matt dillon gave the best performance out of everyone. he was very good as the bad guy even though he didn't have a lot to work with. justin long, breckin meyer and michael keaton are really just there and they don't do anything special.<br /><br />angela robinson directs and she does an okay job. she tries to keep the film interesting but she's working with a weak script. thomas lennon and ben garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for taxi and the pacifier? these two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable. it's not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder. in the end, herbie is a safe, predictable family film that's worth watching if you're a kid. everyone else is better off skipping it. rating 4/10
