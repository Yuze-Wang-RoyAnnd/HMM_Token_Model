i figured that any horror film with orson welles in it would be weird. necromancy sure was but it was a little too weird for it's own good. the film does indeed have a creepy feel as it deals with a coven of satanists/witches in a small town and a young woman's attempt to escape them. the director though seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream sequences. by the finale, there are too many unanswered questions. what's worse, as the story is so confusing, it's pretty hard to root for any of the characters. it seems odd that welles would agree to headline this film especially since he doesn't have that much to do. maybe someday they will put out a tape of the outtakes and bloopers from this movie. now that would really be fun!
