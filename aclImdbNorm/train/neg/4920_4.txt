a very slick modern (keeping it sensually hip) revamp on the dracula story (although staying with the traditional customs) with quite an interesting, if not fully grasped back story of the prince of darkness. the first time i tried watching it i could only make it halfway through, before losing interest. again it gets off to a good start (especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with dracula), but then for me it got less involving when it hits new orleans to focus on van helsing's daughter. a great place to set it, but never took advantage of its settings (despite etching a paradise in damn, where dracula could flourish). produced by wes carven (and yeah they throw that name out there), but written / directed by patrick lussier. artistically it had its moments with few dreamlike visuals, but some kinetic editing and cheap jolts don't help. the messy script does get considerably silly. lussier does a polished job that remains rather glassy, inserting a lot of blood (the make-up is suitably achieved) and a lot of "virgin" advertising. no i don't mean virgins, it's the music company, as it does get in numerous shots and helsing's daughter works there too. oh that wasn't obvious planting. the soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes. now the performances are all over the shop, but there are few familiar faces to spot (danny masterson, sean patrick thomas, nathan fillion, shane west and lochlyn munro). gerard butler as dracula just didn't come off, as not much of a presence was formed. he was simply out-shined by the succulent ladies of the night; jennifer esposito, colleen fitzpatrick and jeri ryan as dracula's brides. the likes of jonny lee millar and justine waddell are respectably okay. christopher plummer gives out a grizzled turn as van helsing and omar epps has fun with his role.
