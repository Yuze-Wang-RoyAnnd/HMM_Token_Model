the entire movie is flashbacks from the first boogeyman movie as well as, inexplicably, footage from another uli lommel / suzanna love film brainwaves. it is framed with some more current (from the early 90's anyway) footage that is boring, poorly acted and cheaply shot. not only is the film almost completely flashbacks, they repeat the same flashbacks throughout the film. so you see the recycled footage over and over again, as if you hadn't seen it already. as if the originals weren't bad enough. i've never seen a movie so padded.... someone was milking the last dollar out of these films. total ripoff. and talk about padding... why do i have to write 10 lines about this trash? if i can convey that it's garbage in 2 lines, that should be enough.
