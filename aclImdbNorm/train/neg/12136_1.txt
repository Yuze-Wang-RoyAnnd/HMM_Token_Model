i saw this movie on t.v. this afternoon and i can't see how anyone can sit through this piece of trash. it's not funny at all and it takes your i.q. down a few notches. i know this movie is for kids, but that doesn't mean the writers should take their intelligence for granted. i bet that writers were sitting around a large wooden table and figured that a) the word "poop" equals big laugh. b) a four foot tall kid can dunk on a ten foot tall basketball net. c) kids should always fight kidnappers armed with guns because the kidnappers will fall for anything and d) 3 months of karate training is all you need to beat up so-called "ninjas" with swords. one good thing i can say about this movie is it contains the weakest suburban "gang" in the world that couldn't scare anybody. maybe the guys at mst3k could use this movie for a good laugh. don't bother with this lame-ass excuse for a movie.
