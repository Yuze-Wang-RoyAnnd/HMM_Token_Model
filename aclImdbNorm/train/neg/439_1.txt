just a stilted rip-off of the infinitely better "murder, she wrote", it is absolutely amazing that this poorly-written garbage lasted for a full eight years. i'm sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do, or simply remembered its star from the old dick van dyke show. van dyke, who only had a decent career in the 1960s, never was much of an actor at all (by his own admission) and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993. he looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking. his talentless real life son barry, a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that didn't involve his father, plays his son in the series.
