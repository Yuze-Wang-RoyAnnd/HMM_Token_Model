i hate to be the one to rain on a parade (even a small one like this) but from the very first scene, you could tell this film was going to be absolute shite. its a shame really, as i quite like martin freeman and danny dyer. i was intrigued as to how they would mix in a film together, but to my dismay, they did not even have a scene together!! i think i need to repeat this - the two lead actors (who stand side by side on the advertisement posters and dvd covers) did not have one scene together!!!! they did not speak to each other and never appeared on screen at the same time. just about sums up this poor excuse for a movie. false advertisement.<br /><br />the dialogue was painful, every single character in the movie was unrealistic, and un-human like. the scenarios were far fetched, the plot was crap, the jokes were thin, freeman tried too hard to be funny (and played a poor mans tim from the office), nobody was likable, and worst of all, some of the characters were so annoying that it almost drove me to switch off, as i couldn't bear to watch, or listen to them any longer.<br /><br />this low budget stinker was an epic fail. even danny dyer couldn't inject some humour and charm into this, but bless, he tried. what a waste of time.<br /><br />how anybody could rate this movie as 'ten stars' is beyond me. ten stars? seriously? come on....i won't even give some of the greats ten stars, as ten stars implies that a movie was perfect. this film was far from perfect, almost the opposite, meaning that it was almost completely dire throughout.<br /><br />watch it if you like, but if you've seen a lot of movies, and watched a lot of great movies, your review will probably similar to mine.<br /><br />1/10
