i didn't think it would be possible for joe don baker to make a movie as bad as his stinkbomb 'mitchell', but this one succeeds.<br /><br />i wouldn't recommend this if you're a fan of joe don baker's much better work. but,if you like to watch fat guys sweat and really, really drawn out gun fights, you'll love this movie.
