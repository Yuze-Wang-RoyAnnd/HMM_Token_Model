the trailers for this film were better than the movie. what waste of talent and money. wish i would've waited for this movie to come on dvd because at least i wouldn't be out $9. the movie totally misses the mark. what could have been a great movie for all actors, turned out to be a b-movie at best. movie moved very slow and just when i thought it was going somewhere, it almost did but then it didn't. in this day and age, we need unpredictable plot twists and closures in film, and this film offered neither. the whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good, however, not sure if it was the way it was directed, the lighting, the delivery of lines, the writing or what, but nothing came from it. lot of hype for nothing. i was very disappointed in this film, and i'm telling everyone not to see it. the cheesy saxophone music throughout made the film worse as well. and the ending had nothing to do with the rest of the film. what a disappointment.
