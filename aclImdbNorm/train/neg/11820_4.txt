i saw this on dvd ( it`s known as corrupt in this format ) and the blurb on the casing really hyped up how harvey keitel`s character frank is so much like the one he played bad lieutenant in " this gritty and powerful police thriller " . what the casing didn`t mention was that this is an old italian movie . how old is it theo ? well when a character plays music he doesn`t put on the cd player , he pulls out a big plastic pancake thing , puts it on a sort of revolving hob where a sort of mechanical arm touches the pancake thingy causing music to be heard . you see my point about this being an old film ? the dvd case gave no clue this was a movie made 20 years ago . it`s also a film with poor production values like so many other italian films masquerading as american ones . with the exception of keitel the cast are awful though johnny rotten`s performance is bizarre rather than terrible , the cinematography is static with the picture and sound quality giving the impression that i was watching a fourth generation pirate copy ( i don`t know if it`s down to a dodgy dvd or if it`s a very bad film print ) and worst of all is ennio morricone`s score . it`s impossible to belive the man who did the irritating intrusive incidental music for corrupt is the same one who did the music for those clint eastwood westerns.<br /><br />all of this is a pity because corrupt does have its moments . it`s by no means the greatest psycho thriller ever devised but it did hold my interest and as always keitel puts in a good performance as a violent nutcase cop . just a pity the rest of the movie didn`t match up to his high standards
