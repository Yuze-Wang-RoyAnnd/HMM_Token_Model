stereotyped, derivative, unoriginal and boring western. the two popular stars (charlton heston and james coburn) both give performances that are far from their best, and justifiably so; they both have superficial roles and character traits stated mainly by dialogue. heston is a sheriff who "liked the world better as it used to be before" and coburn is an outlaw who "owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt". additionally, heston is so old that he has trouble riding a horse and coburn is mean and tough but not as cold-blooded a killer as some of the minor villains. apparently, the filmmakers couldn't come up with even one original idea about how to make this movie somewhat distinguished.
