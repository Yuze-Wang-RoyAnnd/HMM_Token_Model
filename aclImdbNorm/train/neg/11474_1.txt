this relic of a short film starts with a teen going through the process of attempting to get a driver's license. it quickly becomes sidetracked with just about every imaginable topic relating to cars.<br /><br />such things as dune buggies, drag racing, custom paint jobs and car shows are discussed. it often attempts to be humorous but instead the film is dull, drawn out and even sexist at times. none of the people in the film are actually heard. instead, everything is done in narration and voiceovers. sorry, but i can't stand that.<br /><br />there is nothing educational or interesting about "dad, can i borrow the car?". it's just another piece of mindless filler to take up time on their "wonderful world of disney" tv show. 1/10
