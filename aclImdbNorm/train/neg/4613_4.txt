well then, what is it?! i found nicholson's character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting. angelica huston's character drained my power. and kathleen turner is a filthy no good slut. it's not that i "don't get it". it's not that i don't think that some of the ideas could've lead to something more. this is a film with nothing but the notion that we're supposed to accept these ideas, and that's what the movie has going for it. that nicholson falls for turner is absurd, but then again, it is intended to be so. this however does not strike me as a.)funny, or b.)...even remotely interesting!!! this was a waste of my time, so don't let the hype get the best of you...it is a waste of your time! with all that being said, the opening church sequence is quite beautiful...
