there are no reasons of taking this documentary serious and there are four reasons for that: <br /><br />1) the people who made this documentary (including the director and the producer) are serbs or of serbian origin, therefore the criteria of neutrality fails. for instance, they mentioned that the diaspora croats (the so called "ustase") played a huge part in the fall of yugoslavia, but they didn't mention that there were equal serbian organizations as well (cetniks)! for you who aren't that familiar with balkan ww2 history: the serbian so called "cetniks" that were portrayed in the documentary as being so kind that they helped british paratroops during the war. well, that's only half the truth. they were also a fascist (monarch) group who collaborated with the germans, but then switched side when hitler started losing the war. it's also ironic that they don't mention the cetnik leader mihajlovic in the documentary, a man that is responsible for killing thousands of people and burning hundreds of villages all over bosnia and croatia. but they mentioned a certain ante pavelic...hm...allow me to be just a little suspicious.<br /><br />2) most of the people interviewed are to me totally unknown. and i've studied this war for a long time (who is the old british lady!!! she really hasn't made her homework!) and they are not even presented by name, so they could more or less be anybody, maybe someone they took from the street. who knows.<br /><br />3) in the documentary they talk about kosovo and how the serbs have lived there for ages, and therefore it should belong to serbia (even though they are a minority). well, when they mention the serbian dominated part of croatia (krajina) suddenly the serbs are portrayed as how they have the right to live there because it has been their home for so long. fine, but what people don't know is that the largest city in krajina (knin) has great historical importance for the croatian people. it was there where one of the most celebrated kings of croatian history (zvonimir) was crowned, and therefore the city has a historical value for croatia. the serbs arrived almost 800 years or so later! but no, the serbs should have krajina and kosovo according to the documentary. is that fair? to me it looks like double standards of morality from the director. plus, it is said in the documentary that the croatian constitution didn't have any laws about minority rights, this is a lie because it was one of the first laws implemented because of the fact that croatia had a huge serbian minority.<br /><br />4) the film mentions a radical croatian paramilitarian leader called glavas. or the muslim radical oric. they accused them of being a huge reason for the negative development of the war. yes, they were radicals, but if you want to talk about radicals, why not also mention the serbian radical paramilitary leaders such as seselj and arkan? the flaws are so many that i just presented a few of them, just so that people get an overview of the documentary. it looks like the people who made this documentary weren't well prepared and didn't have the guts to criticize the serbs because they were afraid that their serbian relatives would slap them or something. there aren't that many documentaries out there that are of good quality, but the best so far is "the death of yugoslavia" where all the significant participants of the war are interviewed (e.g. milosevic, jovic, bulatovic, tudman, izetbegovic, karadzic etc.) and where you get a whole 5 hour explanation about the fall of yugoslavia and the war.<br /><br />one other thing. i saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the us gave support to a country (bosnia) that had connections with bin laden during the war. well, first of all, all the countries involved in this conflict had nationalist presidents and because the bosnian muslims didn't have an old ethnic identity (previosly they were called "muslim croats") they had to rely on something else besides nationality to raise the spirit among the people, and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common: their religion. and they took help from the mujahedin because no one else would support them. they had to fight the 4:th largest army in europe! they needed all the help they could get. nationalism is the best way to unite a people during war. history has shown us that.
