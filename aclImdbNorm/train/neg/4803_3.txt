adrianne, should really get a life-without mr. "brady". she nauseates me, and has been one of the main reasons why i know longer tune in to the show. it's pretty brainless show, and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put under the scope and analyzed to death. this makes them look/sound they are anything but ready for marriage, and yet, i know these disagreements are all part of life. i guess to some people this is entertainment. if this happens to fall into next season i will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their life but watch this trash. though i would not be terribly surprised. can't even stand the commercials for this show anymore! i hope they're getting enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a camera week after week. however, the "a" girl has one heck of great butt!
