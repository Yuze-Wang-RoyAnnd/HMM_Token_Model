i would like to say that unlike many of the people who disliked this film and found it impossible to understand i was fully able to understand it for what it is.. a very incoherent attempt at a plot line.<br /><br />i don't like to toss this word around but in this case it fits very well. the director firstly presents the material in an extremely "arrogant" way and worse, extremely incoherently. it is incoherent in that it presents the material in a messy dislodged order, making us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come first, and arrogant in that at 2 hours long they expect us, the viewer to care by the end of it.<br /><br />i respect surrealist cinema for what it is. (creating a story around a more than real world that does not tie to real life) but there is nothing surreal about having a story placed in ordinary modern times, and a modern day earth setting, that is most importantly not able to engage the audience but furthermore, simply a dislodged series of events that barely tie together. the most accurate way to describe the experience of viewing this film is like viewing a story; perhaps even a very good story as it was based on a book, but being frustrated by the fact that the camera doesn't seem to capture the necessary moments and tie together any means of coherence.<br /><br />let's compare stylistic cinema. compare gaspar noe's "seul contre tous" to this. he gave us a coherent, extremely engaging and intellectually deep story. this movie offers no intellectual study, and while it is very stylistic in it's fragmented presentation, the director has ultimately abandoned the essential art of good storytelling and all we are left with is a mess of events that barely tie in together.<br /><br />yes indeed it is possible to make sense of things.... to a point. but as i said earlier the viewer will reach a stage where they simply say "who cares." it plays out like watching a drab mundane story of a man going to a supermarket and buying groceries in uncronological order. even with murders it is completely uninteresting and unengaging. too many people these days will give high marks to something they are unable to understand or make sense of simply for fear of looking foolish, and in every way this film tries to make the viewer look foolish.<br /><br />if you have too much time on your hands, then please watch this film, taking into account what i have said of it. it is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a much more effective way and that is my bottom line reasoning.
