spoiler below, but read on or you'll never know the horrible fate that awaits all planing to rent "rodentz".<br /><br />on a moonlit night, in a remote research laboratory, a major medical breakthrough is about to have deadly results. a chemical compound that was created to "hunt and destroy" deadly cancer cells has leaked from the hazardous waste disposal system into the building's basement. now, the rodents involved in the laboratory experiment upstairs are not the only rats in the facility that will become the altered species. professor schultz, a leading bio-researcher, has just determined that the addition of a new enzyme now enables his "hunt and destroy" formulation to regenerate for the length of time necessary to neutralize deadly cancer tumors. when three varying degrees of the new mixture are administered to three different rats and the rest poured down the faulty "waste hazard" sink, shocking side-effects result in a night of terror.....right.....<br /><br />seriously, this is probably the worst film i've seen this year. everything about it screams "low-budget!", from the horrendous acting to the special effects which are some of the worst i've ever seen. the characters are clich'ed morons and act in stupid, predictable ways: walking down dark hallways alone, looking for a cat, tripping and falling so the "rats" can catch up with them, boarding themselves up in a small room, etc. <br /><br />while some films are cheaply made, this film really takes the cake. every possible corner is cut, everything from reusing earlier shots, filming the "lab" hallways from different angles to make it look bigger (that reminds me--why were only two guys working in this freakin' massive building?!?!?!?), to music and special effects that could be done on a children's workshop pc.<br /><br />that brings me to the worst aspect of this steaming pile of dung--the special effects. just horrendous. the computer generated rats look so fake and stand out in every scene so even the dumbest of film buffs could see they are computer generated. and that giant rat suit--oh my god!!!!!!!! seriously, are we supposed to believe that freaking beany baby is a monster? just pitiful........on the better side, some of the gore looks pretty cool, especially considering the budget. <br /><br />the actors all suck. no one involved with the production cared or knew what they were doing. i've wasted enough time with review, just take my advice, it's garbage. 1/10.<br /><br />about the dvd: the transfer sucks, the audio is passable and there's a commentary track on the disk by the director and two of his friends, who say they had absolutely nothing to do with making the film but were there to ask questions and make comments. all three of these sub-human primordial slime are so incredibly stupid that they should be institutionalized before they can harm themselves or others. i don't want to waste any more of you kind reader's time or mine, for i am starting to remember more than i want to about this film..... dvd rating: 1/10.
