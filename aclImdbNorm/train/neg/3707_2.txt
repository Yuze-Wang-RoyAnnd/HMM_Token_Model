this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen, (yes it's even worse than dungeons and dragons and any film starring kevin costner.)<br /><br />chris rock looked very uncomfortable throughout this whole film, and his supporting actors didn't even look like they were trying to act. chris rock is a wonderful stand-up comedian, but he just can't transfer his talent to this film, which probably only has two strained laughs in the whole picture.<br /><br />if you haven't watched this film yet, avoid it like the plague. go do something constructive and more interesting like watching the weather channel or watching paint dry on a brick wall.<br /><br />for chris' efforts i give it a 2/10!<br /><br />
