the japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy movies. they have always been ready to destroy cities by huge plastic monsters coming from outer space and elsewhere. the problem is they have never had the money to succeed in making convincing special effects. this film, released in france under the title les envahisseurs de l'espace, is no exception. its ambition is to show three creatures from the giant octopus to the giant lobster trying to have the upper hand on the humans. it's extremely awkward and laughable, but well quite enjoyable too. after all, we do like these creatures and these films after all, don't we?
