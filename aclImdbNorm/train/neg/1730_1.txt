firstly i would like to point out that i only know of the show due to my younger sister always watching it. i find it the most annoying program on tv. there is nothing funny about any of the 'jokes' and the canned laughter is unbearable. the show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience. that way the laughter would show just how 'unfunny' the show is. however i give credit to the acting talents of the young cast. it sickens me however to think that they'll look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first tv show was. the show links in well with the overall annoying voices and style of the cbbc presenters. why the youth of today need to be shouted at so much is beyond me. that is all.
