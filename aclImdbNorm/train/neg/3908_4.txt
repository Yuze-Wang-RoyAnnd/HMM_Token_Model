there's enough star power in the house of spirits to create another galaxy, yet the final product is pretty debatable. the film and its messages are very noble, and i think perhaps most would agree with them. (liberal democracy good, violent fascist regime bad; open-mindedness good, racism bad, etc). unfortunately, we're battered from head to toe with these, and as much subtlety is used as i've described them. <br /><br />ultimately, we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities. it radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated "pro" wrestling match.<br /><br />jeremy irons plays the patron, a man of many contradictions. meryl streep as his gifted bride and glenn close, as her sister in law. when the camera stays with these folks, the movie tends to move, and is quite enjoyable. unfortunately, the house of spirits engages with simply way too many subplots, and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets. we don't get to know them, hence we don't get to care for them. the result is boredom. <br /><br />if bille august, the director and screenwriter (from isabel allende's book) had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters, this film might have worked completely. as it stands, it was a nice try, with nice messages, and a bonecrushing yawnfest.<br /><br />not recommended.
