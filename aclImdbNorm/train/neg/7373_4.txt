i don't know what the rest of you guys watch steven seagal movies for, but i watch them because, as silly as they are, they're at least always good for a laugh. why would you rate this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the dubbing, when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like this into a cult favorite that you can laugh at the silliness of?<br /><br />attack force is by no means a great movie, but i felt it was as worthy a steven seagal vehicle as many of his other movies; in fact i didn't think it was one of his worst by a long-shot. it had, most of the time, a half-way coherent plot line, and it was, most of the time, fundamentally exciting. the ending really sucked, but even that had some enjoyably trashy elements. in the end the story itself did not deliver what it promised, but i actually thought that the acting, characterization (if i may use such a big word) and the rest of the production values delivered exactly what a true steven seagal fan would expect. seagal himself in particular was exactly the stone-faced, no-nonsense man's man that we've come to expect, and the rest of the cast backed him up pretty well, without ever up-staging him. this, people, is what a steven seagal movie does. deal with it. or even better: laugh at it.<br /><br />4 out of 10.
