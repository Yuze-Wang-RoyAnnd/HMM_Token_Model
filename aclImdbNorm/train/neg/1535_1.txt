i don't think you can get much worse then this. put together bad actors, fake limbs, and three stupid stories and what do you get? this b-rate pointless excuse for a movie.<br /><br />the first story immediately shows the bad video quality and the acting is just really pathetic, especially when you bring in the 25 year old posing as a grandma with the usually grandma bun over the ears bit. plus, the man is ok, but the woman is rather ugly. "you look great!" not! the werewolf in this one was the best one out of all three i'd say, but its still not impressive since it was all bad costume. the face on the woman later was decent enough for halloween but not for a werewolf movie.<br /><br />the more stories you go through the worse it gets. there are two lesbians in this next one who are completely retarded its ridiculous. the whole "i want to be a werewolf, too" "how could you do this to me?!" was silly to say. you asked for it now get over it! the werewolf will not even be spoken of...its a rat!<br /><br />the third one has no point...almost forty five minutes of running and boring narration make up this story and the whole switch thing still didn't make it interesting. boring!<br /><br />music, yes, bad...who couldn't even hear some parts it was stupid. animals effects were either rat or pig-like which was stupid. they couldn't use lion sounds? guess not, good movies use that. well, i =f you enjoy b-rates this is good for you. i got this movie since i'm a hardcore werewolf fan and i'll buy any werewolf movie and watch it more then once, but thats just me. if you prefer good ones, don't waste your money. i beg you!
