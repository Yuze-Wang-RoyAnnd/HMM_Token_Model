eddie murphy for best supporting actor??? what an insult to alan arkin and djimon hounsou. <br /><br />jamie foxx (who can act) walks through this film like a zombie. <br /><br />beyonce ??? that was acting??? <br /><br />this movie pales in comparison to chicago or just about any other recent musical. <br /><br />if it were not for the great singing and performance of jennifer hudson i would have given this a zero.<br /><br />and no i never saw the stage play so i am not making the typical broadway vs. hollywood rap.
