a dedicated fan to the tlk movies, with the first one being a milestone and the second probably the best sequel disney has produced, along comes this film... now i'm not arguing with animation, voice work, music, but this is no more than a timon/pumbaa screwloose in the tlk atmosphere. although it isn't bad, it doesn't add anything. basically this movie is one big joke... and that's about all that saves it. make a real tlk3, disney! the potential is there.<br /><br />4/10
