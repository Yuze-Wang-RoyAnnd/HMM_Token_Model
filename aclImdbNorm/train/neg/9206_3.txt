the subject matter seems pretty dated today. adapted for tv from rona jaffe's book; we trip and stumble through a fantasy existence. four college students get deeply involved playing a live version of the board game mazes and dragons (based on dungeons and dragons). one player, a young tom hanks, enters the fantasy world too deep. his co-players must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted harm.<br /><br />david wallace, wendy crewson and chris makepeace round out the game's foursome. support cast is made up of veteran actors like murray hamilton, vera miles, anne francis and susan strasberg.<br /><br />at this date, it seems lumbering and tame. but the highlight of watching is seeing tom hanks between his "bosom buddies" salad days and his big splash in splash on the silver screen. the youngest of viewer will get most enjoyment.
