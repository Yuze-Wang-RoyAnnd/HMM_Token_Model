kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i've ever seen. sort of like a high school film project. what was rosanna arquette thinking?? and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town? pretty hard to get involved with this one. no lessons to be learned from it, no brilliant insights, just stilted and quite ridiculous (but lots of skin, if that intrigues you) videotaped nonsense....what was with the bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all the heterosexual encounters. and what was with that absurd dance, with everybody playing their stereotyped roles? give this one a pass, it's like a million other miles of bad, wasted film, money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa.....
