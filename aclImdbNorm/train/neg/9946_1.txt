spoilers herein<br /><br />my high school did all they could to try and motivate us for exams. but the most memorable method they used to get us into the right state of mind was a guest speaker, who was none other than australian kickboxing's favorite son, stan "the man" longinidis. the first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone, because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him. now, his speech was full of the usual "if you fail to prepare, then prepare to fail" stuff, but there were various instances where i got really worked up. the guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no-one else. he was offered many deals in the past to give up kick-boxing, but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming australia's greatest kick-boxer. he said that he wasn't a sell-out, he was happy and a retiree, he wasn't ever involved in any other activity other than kickboxing
