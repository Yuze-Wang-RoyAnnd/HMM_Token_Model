the title above is used to introduce the film "gen" to its audience. gen is about a young doctor(doga rutkay) with an ill mother. the film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job. while she drives, we realise that she is not that close home as the hospital is in a remote area. as soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital, she sees the death body of a patient. this is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days.<br /><br />two policemen comes to the hospital so as to investigate the suicide. in fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions. all their communication with outside world is cut off too. there is no way out!! in those few days, there will be more nasty murders. now everybody suspects from each other.<br /><br />in my opinion, the idea is brilliant. it could have been very scary indeed. there are positive sides of the movie of course. i really like the beginning of the movie. especially, when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital. actings are okay. some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though. i think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie. what i am saying is, it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the end, we should have realised that was coming when we see what is happening. the director needed to explain it altogether which i think didn't work well. also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least 48 years old but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. lastly, i would like to say a few things about the director. i am sure he will improve. this is his first attempt. i have recently found out that he is only 21 years old. that made me feel more positive about him and his future films. i am not going to rate this film * out of ***** though.
