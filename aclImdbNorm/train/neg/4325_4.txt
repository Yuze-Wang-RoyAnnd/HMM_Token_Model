the second in the vacation series is easily the least enjoyable one, as clark griswold wins a trip for the whole family to europe.<br /><br />the tasteless, below the belt humor that worked so well the first time around is practically nonexistent here. that fault surely lies with director hackerling, who's obviously nowhere near as good a director as harold ramis and a very uninspiring script that has only a handful of decent lines scattered around.<br /><br />the cast does what they can; chevy chase injects some form of life into the proceedings but it's simply not enough and the very funny eric idle is completely wasted in a small role as a very unlucky englishman. some potentially hilarious moments aren't played out to their full potential and leave the viewer mostly aggravated. all depictions of europeans are one-dimensional and almost universally not funny at all (like how the english are sooo polite).<br /><br />apart from a few scenes, there's hardly a laugh in sight and the ending turn this one into complete slapstick. but if you're a chevy chase fan (like myself) the film is watchable, but no more than that.
