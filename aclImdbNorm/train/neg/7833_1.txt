i just saw the third week of stephen kings' nightmares and dreamscapes mini series; meaning, i saw 6 episodes so far. i have to say that the stories are really weak. i have read stephen king's skeleton crew, a collection of his short stories that was published way back. i recall most of the stories were average to poor but there was one that was really excellent, if not outstanding.<br /><br />what i'm trying to say is that just because this mini series is from a collection of stories from stephen king does not mean that it will be any good. in fact, if his previous collection of short stories are of any indication, then most of this mini series will be average to poor.<br /><br />in stephen king's defense, i have not read these new short stories. perhaps they are good as stories in a book and not readily adaptable to television, or perhaps it was the fault of the scriptwriters in trying to write an interesting script. who knows. also, these short stories may have been made exclusively for this mini series and not not for print purpose. maybe that may have been the problem. if stephen king had submitted these crap stories to an editor, i am sure the editor would have immediately told him to make it more interesting because as is, it is simply boring.<br /><br />what is clear from all of this is that the problem is with the stories/script and not the actors and actresses because this mini series has some excellent people acting on it.<br /><br />seeing this mini series really makes me appreciate those old "twilight zone" series. each series was only half an hour but it was compelling and riveting. i don't understand why this mini series could not accomplish similar feat. i am sure this mini series had a good deal of money to make a good mini series but unfortunately, something must not have clicked.<br /><br />for instance, this week there were two episodes shown. the first involved a horror story writer who buys a picture drawn by an artist who committed suicide. the writer begins to see changes in the picture as he is driving homeward. feeling uncomfortable, he throws away the painting but it keeps appearing near him. also, the portrait of an individual in that picture is killing people and is out to kill him. (i will not even mention the second episode for this week involving criminals and their loot because it was even more boring than this episode!)<br /><br />this premise is interesting and so the story should be good but after seeing it, i was frustrated because there were too many gaps in the story as well as extraneous materials that was shown that did nothing to help the story. after the last scene, i was left with more questions than answers.<br /><br />i tried for 3 weeks to get into this mini series but it was just too aggravating due to poor stories/script. if this was a movie, i would have recommended that people should wait for the movie to come out on cable or such. i would not even recommend that it be rented in your video store. however, given that this is on tnt, a cable channel, i would say if you have not seen it already, then try it for one week. if you do not like it that week, then you will not like the past series nor the future ones, since they all share the same boring trait.
