very bad movie........and i mean very bad...the plot is predictable, and it's eally cheesy, the creativeness of the battle and the dance scenes for the time are the only reason i didn't give the movie a one, other than that...this is def a movie one can def afford not to watch.....i feel while watching the movie, the idea behind the movie was an interesting one tho kind of clich'e....bringing country bumpkins to the city blah blah blah, but i feel it might have been at least a little better if it just wasn't so cheesy, very poorly portrayed from idea to screen, i think. the plot is somewhat predictable at times, tho the dancing i can say at times, is pretty good, the break dance battle twist was good.....if u just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and make up your own dialog maybe it can be a 5...lol
