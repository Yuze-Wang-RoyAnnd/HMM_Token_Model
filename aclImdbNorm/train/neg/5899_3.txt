by all the fawning people have been doing over miike and his work. i sat through this flick tonight. i figured, if it's half as good as ringu, as i assumed from these comments it might be, than it will be worth my time.<br /><br />no such luck.<br /><br />i'm all for finding the next great director (or writer), but i don't think miike is the one. i don't have an nyu masters of fine arts, but i do know this much: a horror movie has to have pacing. it also has to give the viewer more credulity than this movie does.<br /><br />this film's pacing had me shaking my head. some of the scenes near the end dragged so badly, i went to the fridge and lingered there while kou shibasaki stared at the camera for seemingly minutes on end, eyes wide and mouth agape. a famous director once made the claim, and i'm paraphrasing, a movie could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it roll. kou is not a good enough actress to make that work. she stares paralyzed at the undead girl for more scenes than i care to remember. and she isn't the only one doing an impersonation of a deer in headlights; other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this non-performance. the script gives them little room to do much else for far too much of the time.<br /><br />i like asian cinema. hong kong action flicks from the last 30 years, korean horror like "phone" and "koma", ang lee's work, some of the trashy but fun filipino movies with gratuitous sex and fighting, as well as others. chakushin ari i could have done without.
