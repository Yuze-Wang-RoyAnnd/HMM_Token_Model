i read the book "7 years in tibet" from heinrich harrer and was fascinated of it. then i immediately grabbed the dvd and started to watch the movie. i remember the first time i saw it back in 98, i kinda liked it. well, now i watched it again in full knowledge of the book it is based on. and soon i realized how wrong it all was told:<br /><br />when they enter lhasa the people start to stick their tongues out of their mouths and thewlis and pitt have the impression that its the way to say hello in tibet, so they greet back... in the book harrer explains, that sticking the tongue out is a sign of absolute humbleness and loyalty in tibet and they may do it in front of the dalai lama but certainly not for these two europeans! not only the mother but even the dalai lama himself was wearing glasses in the public. in the book harrer mentions, that no one in tibet wore glasses to that time(sorry forgot the reason, but its explained in the book too).the young dalai lama did, but only when he was alone and nobody could see him! and what about that mao tse tung lookalike, destroying the mandala in front of the young "living buddha"?? childish... and the tailor made harrer and aufschnaiter tibetan clothes not european designer suits! why are so many events that really happened eliminated from the story, just to fill the time with a fictional love interest (the female tailor...)that is completely unimportant? just like the whole story about harrers son, rolf. not one word is mentioned about him or even any family member of harrer in the book. but that was ok for me because "7 years in tibet" is not a book about harrers person. its about tibet. i'm very disappointed by this "adaption" of the famous book. and i bet heinrich harrer was, too... 3 stars, just for the cinematography.
