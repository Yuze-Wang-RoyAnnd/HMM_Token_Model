i gave this movie a single star only because it was impossible to give it less.<br /><br />scientists have developed a formula for replicating any organism. in their lab(a run down warehouse in l.a.), they create a t-rex. a group of industrial spies break in to steal the formula and the remainder of the film is one endless foot chase.<br /><br />of course the t-rex(a rubber puppet)gets loose and commences to wipe out the cast. it has the amazing ability to sneak up within 2 or 3 feet of someone without them noticing and then promptly bites their head off.<br /><br />one cast member escapes in a police car and spends the remainder of the film driving aimlessly through the city. she is of such superior mental ability that she can't even operate the radio. she never makes any attempt to drive to a substation or a donut shop and appears hopelessly lost.<br /><br />the t-rex wreaks havoc throughout the city, there are blazing gun battles and buildings(cardboard mock-ups)blowing up, but a single police car, or the army, nor anyone else ever shows up. such activity must be commonplace in los angeles.<br /><br />we can only hope that a sequel isn't planned.
