there are some good things about the movie. the music and cinematography is great. alex wilson is hot and gives a great performance. ryan bauer is also hot. the production was very lucky to have casted them because they really give production value to the movie. jonny vincent (sean) and a lot of the boys in the movie that don't speak are cute too. why isn't the actress who plays amy listed in the credits? brandon alexander gives a great comedic performance as clitarissa pink.<br /><br />the worse thing about the movie is probably the star, james townsend. he can't act. he's also very scrawny, not nice to look at at all. his arms are like spaghetti. it's disgusting. they have no muscle tone at all. it's no wonder he has to make his own movie and cast himself in it. no one else would cast him in anything.<br /><br />james townsend is not believable as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he acts so gay. they should have casted someone else as the lead if they wanted what's best for the movie. then again, maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to launch a career in soft-core porn, definitely not real acting because he would have taken some acting lessons. plus, anyone who does porn is blacklisted in hollywood.<br /><br />the most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the casting of a tan-skinned latina as devon's mother. sonja fisher does not seem like an actress at all. all in all, this movie is soft-core porn and is no better than something you would see on skinemax. i think even alex wilson, probably the best thing about this movie, is embarrassed by it and doesn't want to be associated with it. there is no photo on his imdb page and nothing else listed, so alex wilson is probably a disposable stage name. plus, i ran into him in west hollywood one time recently and when i mentioned this movie, he just turned around and walked away. i understand. if i had worked on this movie, i would be embarrassed and wouldn't want to be associated with it either.
