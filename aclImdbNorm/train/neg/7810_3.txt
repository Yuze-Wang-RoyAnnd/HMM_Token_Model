against all hope is a very poorly made, sometimes painfully so, movie. this is michael madsen's first movie, and it shows, he isn't that good in it. some people might find the story laughable; an alcoholic realizes his life and family are falling apart so he calls a preacher as a last resort for help. after telling the preacher his story, he accepts jesus christ into his heart. <br /><br />i actually found many of the religious scenes, as when cecil moe (madsen) goes to a church but walks away from it, pretty realistic. i also liked how cecil knows his life is breaking apart and tries to get help, but realizes only god can help him. at the end he realizes with the help of god he can go through life without drinking again.<br /><br />this movie is not well made at all. the acting is bad, the script could use some work, and looks worse than my home videos, but it has a good message. now, just because you become a christian doesn't mean you will automatically be able to stop an addiction or heal your broken family, and cecil realizes this and works hard to stay on track. overall, if your a christian you will appreciate how this movie portrays christianity and if you aren't, you may find yourself being called to find out more about the faith.
