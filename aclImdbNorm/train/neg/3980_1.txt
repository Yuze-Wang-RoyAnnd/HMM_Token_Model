no ,i'm not kidding. if they ever propose a movie idea, they should be kicked out of the studio. i'm serious. their movies are exactly the same in every one, and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations, having a problem which they easily resolve, hoping to be popular, and getting new boyfriends. think about it. if you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot, contact me and tell me its name. these "movies" are poor excuses to be on tv and go to other countries. there is a reason that the movies never go to theaters. i'm sure that when they were really young and made some o.k. movies, some studio boss bought all their rights for 15 years, or something, so that now that they're, what, 17, they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the studio's money. let me advise you, stay away from mary-kate and ashley! it's for your own good!
