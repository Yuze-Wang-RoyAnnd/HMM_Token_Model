i love watching jerry as much as the rest of the world, but this poor excuse for a soft-core porno flick is needlessly offensive, lacks anything resembling wit, and serves merely as a vehicle of self-promotion for springer. even though it runs a quick 90 minutes, the film drags hideously, and i should have had the common sense to walk out. simply atrocious.
