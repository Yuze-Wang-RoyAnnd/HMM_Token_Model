i found this film to be an interesting study in cause and effect but little more than that. the basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions (deliberate and otherwise) effect the lives of the others. the film's premise holds great promise but i feel it fails to deliver on its promise. too much time is spent telling the audience about chaos theory and too little time actually showing it. as a result, i never got a true feel for any of the characters and never made a good connection with them emotionally. by the end of the movie, i had a "so what" attitude about all of them. a stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great, but as it stands it is merely so-so
