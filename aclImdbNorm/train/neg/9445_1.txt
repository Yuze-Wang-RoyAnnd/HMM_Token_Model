shame shame shame on ua/dw for what you do! <br /><br />i was appalled. <br /><br />do not take kids to see this movie. the humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they'll be bored and disappointed. certainly *we all* have read theo's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations...but this is pure trash. dr. seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his "thumbs up" at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic.<br /><br />what a pity. <br /><br />spend your money on the book. if you own a copy, then buy the book and donate it to a toys for tots program. this movie is not worth a "free" ticket viewing.<br /><br />stick with the book. the tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal - save your money...seriously. save your money - it will be on cable by saint patty's day.<br /><br />shame shame shame on what they do!!
