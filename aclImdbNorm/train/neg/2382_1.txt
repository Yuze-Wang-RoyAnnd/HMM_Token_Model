there are movies like "plan 9" that are so bad they have a charm about them, there are some like "waterworld" that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident, and there are some like "desperate living" that you hate to admit you love. cowgirls have none of these redemptions. the cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable, and from what i've been told, the book is enjoyable.<br /><br />how then could this movie be so intolerably bad? to begin with, it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings. then tell them to do their best kevin costner imitations. open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide expanses of america from being interesting in any way. finally give the editing job to your brother-in-law, because the meat packing plant just laid him off. he does have twenty years of cutting experience.<br /><br />this movie now defines the basement for me. it is so bad, it isn't even good for being bad.
