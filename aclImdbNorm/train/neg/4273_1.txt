there is nothing unique in either the tv series nor the movie. which is a prequel to the tv show, that isn't found everywhere else in life and entertainment. both before david lynches disgusting style of story telling, and after. <br /><br />from the moment the body of a poor misguided girl washed up on the beach. and being introduced to some of the most mind numbing shady immoral character of the twin peaks.<br /><br />to the mind numbing almost pedophilia disgusting way the movie seems to romantically tell of the destruction of a human life through some random psychedelic phenomena in the movie twin peak:fire come walk with me. <br /><br />i watched it all just to make sure i wasn't missing anything. i didn't. it's is simply one mans obvious sexual fetish extended over long series fallowed by a ridiculous overly pornographic movie. save your self the agony the suspense and watch anything else that at least has the ability to tell a story, rather then seduce you into some kind mental porn movie.<br /><br />i have heard a lot of reviews, rants and raves about how great david lynch. because of his ability to define misery and and tragedy and making it into some kind of a wonderful thing. this is not life imitating art, as much as it is some sick twisted version of art doing its best to inspire complete mindless life.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage.
