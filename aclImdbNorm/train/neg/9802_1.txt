many people here say that this show is for kids only. hm, when i was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old) i watched this show first. it was disgusting for me. i talked with other kids about this and, sure, other shows and know what? this was the measure of disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize something's silliness (either on tv or anything else) we said "uh, just like power rangers" and laughed. <br /><br />and before visiting this site i could not imagine that there actually are fans of mmpr. it was so strange for me that i decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it. i did not enjoy that viewing. but it dawned upon me: maybe i have not enough imagination? it may be. however this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than 1 star.
