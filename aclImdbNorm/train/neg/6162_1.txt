"smokey and the bandit" wasn't exactly shakespeare, but then nobody wanted it to be. it was lowdown slapstick, but it did have brains. it had a very smart script with definable characters and a fun wrap-up. people came out of the theater smiling. "hooper" provides none of this. there is no reason to smile. if it's supposed to be a tribute to the hollywood stuntman, it makes them look awfully lazy by providing nothing but badly-choreographed fight scenes and one of the most unconvincing car-jumps i've ever seen. it all looks phony, badly-filmed almost on purpose. poor sally field (as the girlfriend who wrings her hands on the sidelines) is given her weakest role, with not a single funny or smart line ("if you do that jump, i won't be here when you get back"). burt reynolds keeps looking at the camera and winking, but the joke is on any audience who sits through "hooper". * from ****
