slasher films are often seen as the derivative, repetitive and frankly unoriginal. i happen to to be a horror movie fan, but this film was just so poor, words fail me. the script is severely lacking, the plot is ridiculous, the acting astoundingly bad. just an all round stinker, that i wasted time of my life on. this had all the entertainment value of a 15th sequel to a film that was dire in the first place. <br /><br />who greenlit this mess?<br /><br />i only liked two things in this movie. the first was the killer's mask - which was nice. the second was the austrailian affinity with humourous profanity.<br /><br />save yourself, and avoid this hideous mess.
