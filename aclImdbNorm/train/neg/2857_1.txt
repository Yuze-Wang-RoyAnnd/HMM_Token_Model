i've seen plenty of sci-fi channel original movies ever since i started watching them back in 2002 (my first one was sabretooth - which actually is one of the more entertaining sci-fi channel features in my opinion). their quality varies. some of them are average but decent (sabretooth, dragon fighter, never cry werewolf, swamp devil), some are laughably bad, and then there are some that are truly terrible. raptor planet lies in the latter. <br /><br />raptor planet, a loose sequel to the 2004 sci-fi channel original raptor island, is a barely watchable mess of a film with truly horrid acting and lazy scriptwriting. the effects that bring the dinosaurs to life (a combination of puppetry and animatronics as well as cgi and stock footage from raptor planet) are some of the worst looking effects i've seen in a low budget film. the gore effects are even unconvincing. <br /><br />the plot involves a bunch of commandos who for some reason (i forget why) travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs. that's right folks, the dinosaurs are aliens. dinosaurs in outer space. what's next, sharks in space?!? the rest of the plot is simple. the human cast are picked off and eaten. by now, we've come to expect this in the numerous dinosaurs movies and novels that are released, but this is the first killer dinosaur movie i've seen where i actually became bored with all the dinosaur attacks.<br /><br />there are a few chuckles in it though. there's one scene that stands out in which a man is being munched by a carnotaur (brought to life by stock footage from the original film) that seconds later becomes a giant raptor. also, a bit of trivia, this is the scene where steven baur is shooting at his own death scene from the first movie. <br /><br />while raptor island wasn't a good film to begin with, its a masterpiece compared to its sequel.<br /><br />believe me when i say, this is quite possibly the worst movie syfy has ever aired. it's darn near unwatchable.
