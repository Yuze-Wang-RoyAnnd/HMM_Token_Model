despite being a huge fan of fred astaire and ginger rogers' movies, it wasn't until about 6 years ago that i first saw 'follow the fleet'. i knew all the songs from an old astaire/rogers record (yes, vinyl) but knew nothing of the plot.<br /><br />unfortunately, while the songs are catchy and ginger rogers' character is sweet and funny, you just can't like 'bake baker'. while trying to make up to his longtime partner, he continually sabotages her career. his character doesn't have the usual humour and elan of the other films' astaire characters.<br /><br />worth watching for the songs and a great solo tap routine by ginger rogers.
