this is the worst adaption of a classic story i have ever seen. they needlessly modernize it and some points are actually just sick.<br /><br />the songs rarely move along the story. they seem to be thrown in at random. the flying scene with marley is pointless and ludicrous.<br /><br />it's not only one of the worst movies i've seen, but it is definitely the worst musical i've ever seen.<br /><br />it's probably only considered a classic because "a christmas carol" is such a classic story. just because the original story was a classic doesn't mean that some cheap adaption is.
