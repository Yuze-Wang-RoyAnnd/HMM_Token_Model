this movie has beautiful scenery. unfortunately it has no plot. in order to have a plot there must be a conflict. this movie had none. it spent two hours painting a beautifule scene and failed to ever place any activity in it. the picture trys to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling.<br /><br />if you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don't expect a story. there isn't one.
