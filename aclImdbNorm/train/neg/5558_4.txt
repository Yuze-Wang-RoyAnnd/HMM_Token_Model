i wont take too much time here, just wanted to state that darkman 3 is awesome. i have all 3 on dvd, added these to my collection of dvd movie sets. darkman ranks up there with the best, like indiana jones, aliens, star wars, die hard, you get the point. there isn't too many good horror, thriller, sets out there. many thanks to the whole crew, and set for giving us the darkman trilogy. by the way if your wondering how i came across this one on dvd. i purchased it through the internet, it is however region 4, as you know most us dvd players are region 1. if you own a sony playstation 2, you have the best dvd player since it is an all region player. just go to set up then choose witch region setting you want ( 1-9 ).
