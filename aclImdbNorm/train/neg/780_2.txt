this show is awful. how is george wanting the death of his mother funny? this show is terrible. the parents are obviously horrible and the children should be taken to child services. the daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat. george isn't funny, especially when he speaks his loud and obnoxious brand of spanglish. ernie is a loser, but at least i've chuckled at him a few times, but mainly at how pathetic he is. george's mother, benny, in an awful, despicable character. sure, her husband left her, but how anyone can laugh at the way she treated george as a baby is beyond me.<br /><br />can someone explain to me how george's head being big is funny? it's not even that big! i've moved on from characters because they're too awful and it would take hours for me to write and i, frankly, don't care enough. i do care enough to tell anyone looking at this and wondering whether or not they want to watch this show, that this show is an abysmal excuse for a sitcom, and is not worth your time.<br /><br />i give it 2 starts, because the wife is extremely attractive.
