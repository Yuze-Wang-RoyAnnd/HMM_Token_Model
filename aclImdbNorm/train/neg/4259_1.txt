i knew nothing of this film before i was convinced to see it by a friend who had heard it was a "non-stop epic battle scene from beginning to end". that couldn't have been further from the truth. this was one of the most boring, poorly written, amateurishly directed, horribly acted films i've ever had the misfortune to lay my eyes upon. i'd rank it up there with the movie i consider to be the worst film of all time... battlefield earth. there basically is no story, it's hard to believe that the makers of this film thought that this cheesy soap opera crap would be taken seriously as actual historic fact. it also features some of the worst dialogue i've ever heard... like this little gem... guy tells girl "you smell like the moon.". girl replies "what does the moon smell like?" omg! you have to be kidding me! the scene where the guy was drawn and quartered got some good laughs from the audience since it looked so ridiculously cheap and the sound fx of the guy being ripped apart reminded me of someone making a fart sound with their mouth. if this is playing at a theater near you, avoid it at all costs. this movie is so bad that i actually made the decision about 45 minutes through that i needed to catch up on my sleep... and i did. awful.
