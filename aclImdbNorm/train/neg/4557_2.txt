ok, it's very rare that i complain something i got for free. so i guess this movie pushed me over that limit. i saw it at the hollywood cemetery for free and walked away very very disappointed. one audience member's question to the director about using the native american references just as "bookends" instead of being weaved into the movie better, basically says everything that this movie failed on. <br /><br />native american references--- the native american references felt really out of place and contrived. it's obvious that this director and writer tried tackling an arena they never played in before. they should have stuck to the old adage of "write about something you know". if they are in fact versed in this it certainly did not show on the movie or the beauty of this unique culture was not given proper justice. <br /><br />clich'es and on the nose--- i agreed to see this film on the basis that it was an indie. so i held it to higher expectations. "little miss sunshine" was an indie and saw it before it became so popular. before it even came out to wide release i was already raving how it's going to be a hit. unfortunately i could not say the same about "expiration date". "sunshine" took us to clich'e incidents but the filmmakers were so clever at their approach that the outcome would take us to a different direction avoiding the trap of being a "cliche". this movie on the other hand had no way of not falling in the trap because it was already trapped from the start. the psycho mom's antics, the hendrix couple, etc. <br /><br />i hate to say it, but the best and worst movie i've seen this year were both indies. "little miss sunshine" being the best and this movie being the worst. i wish i could say otherwise. <br /><br />but i do congratulate the filmmakers for having such a good turn out from their family members at the cemetery.
