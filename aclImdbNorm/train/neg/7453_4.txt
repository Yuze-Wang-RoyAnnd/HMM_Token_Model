wonderful actors. <br /><br />lousy script and not too great direction either. my main problem was i simply didn't care about any of these people. not the killer not the victims. the settings were pretty drab. dennis quaid's character was so poorly written in, i didn't even care when the end came. he got his kid back. big deal! i wanted my money back.
