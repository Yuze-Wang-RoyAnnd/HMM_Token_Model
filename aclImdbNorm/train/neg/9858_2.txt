this movie is not funny. it just takes the d&d nerd stereotypes and amplifies them. all the main characters make less than 30k a year, they all live with their parents, they're all socially retarded, and they have no luck with women. the jokes are horrible and unimaginative, such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a kkk looking hood on (it was his wizard costume) and the other guy had on a john rocker warm up (oh how funny, he's a nerd so he doesn't know about sports). you may have to be a childish high-schooler to find any of this stuff funny. poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch, but obviously extremely cheap to make. i feel sorry for kelly lebrock and beverly d'angelo. i guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime.
