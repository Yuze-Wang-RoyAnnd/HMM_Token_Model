primal species comes from b movie legend roger corman and as such everybody who watches this needs to realise that this is a low budget b movie and it knows it.<br /><br />a bunch of terrorists high-jack a lorry and kill an entire army doing so, they believe it to hold uranium, but no..... it contains two dino's with a taste for human flesh... then a crack team, who might as well be called delta force get called in.<br /><br />ok, this ain't jurassic park, and yes the dino's are never clearly seen because it's obviously a guy in a costume that's not too dissimilar to barney the dinosaur - only slightly less terrifying,but come on guys this had about 1% of jurassic park's budget and as such does what it can.<br /><br />does this deserve to be in the bottom 100?....hell no!!! i think the nearly half of voters who give this a 1 - are being way way overly harsh, it's much closer to a 4... it's actually a lot better than a whole host of other movies not in the bottom 100, and has a similar production value to a sci-fi channel production. (again movies which get a overly harsh time from critics here on imdb)<br /><br />the acting is as expected in a b movie although none of the actors take it that seriously, neither does the script<br /><br />all in all it's an enjoyable b movie - not for film snobs<br /><br />** out of *****
