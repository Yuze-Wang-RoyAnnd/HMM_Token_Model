this movie is easily the worst of the series. though new line might just be looking at sales, they all know the only reason this one made more money than the one prior was due to its 3d ending. it wasn't that the 3-d was good either, because it was 50's 3d with the red and blue lenses(anaglyph.) it was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like. beyond that this movie was so poorly done! bad script, bad characters, bad acting, worse directing. this movie is trying to push the camp factor almost to the point of being like a "looney tunes" episode.<br /><br />seriously, not for horror audience, because it is corny and not scary, and not funny or amusing for comedy crowds. just a total mess with some really bad cameos that are still trying to play this whole thing as camp and having it fall way short of what they probably wanted.<br /><br />i remember most of us who had been fans of this series were just praying that it would end at this point because of how bad it had gotten. this is one of the movies that helped take horror out of popularity and ride a fad of belief that audiences really wanted to laugh with some stupid comedy than see a good and scary horror film.
