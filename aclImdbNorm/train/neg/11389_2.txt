if you like films that ramble with little plot exposition spiced with kinky sex, this film is for you. on the plus side the lead actor/actress (newcomer transsexual) does have an interesting screen presence, but not enough to add up to much more than a mildly interesting movie - if that. essentially this film is about 3 social outcasts (transexual prostitute, male hustler, and russian,gay immigrant) who somehow have developed a bond. why is not clear. we are expected to accept these misfits are at the core basic honest people who have the ability to love while they hustle their bodies on the street. right!! and anna nicole smith was truly in love with her ninety something sugar daddy! the filmmaker shows a gritty, unpleasant side of life while wanting us to believe underneath it all these seriously damaged people are really quite normal to the extent they have a menage a trois which helps them through life. quite a fantasy, but unfortunately portrayed here as real look of life on the wild side. in sum, no plot, no truth and no real reason to spend much time here. unless of course you just like to revel in the kink!!!
