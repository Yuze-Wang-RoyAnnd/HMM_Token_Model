i just rented this today....heard lots of good reviews beforehand. wow!! what a pile of steaming poo this movie is!! does anyone know the address of the director so i can get my five dollars back???? finally someone bumped "stop-loss" from the 'worst iraq war movie ever' number one spot. to be fair, i don't think there are any good iraq war movies anyway, but this was really bad. <br /><br />i won't get into any technical inaccuracies, there's a hundred reviews from other gwot vets that detail them all. if the director bothered to consult even the lowliest e-nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made the movie somewhat realistic....maybe. i guess the writer should be given the "credit" for this waste of a film. he or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraints of reality. does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was? was there a message? seriously though.....wtf????<br /><br />i'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really. this film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that, the plot sucks, characters are shallow (to say the least) and the acting is poor at best. it's ironic, i suppose, that this movie is supposed to be about explosive ordinance disposal, because it's the biggest bomb i've seen this year.
