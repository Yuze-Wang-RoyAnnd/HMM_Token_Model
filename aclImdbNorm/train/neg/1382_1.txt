the movie was awful. the theater was dead with silence 'cause everyone was embarrassed to be in there watching such trash. i think someone gave jet li a lobotomy and made him perform a script with dialogue written by a five year old. the martial arts are 'ok', but when put next to the jackie chan movies and "the matrix" you're better off seeing one of those.
