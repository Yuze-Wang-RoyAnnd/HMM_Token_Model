rosie wasted a lot of tv time talking about the tainos as if they were super influential in the dynamics of the modern day puerto rican. they were not. the truth is that the africans and the spanish were and she knows it. what kills me is that she is standing on the screen looking like some average light skin black chick ( with an obvious black daddy, cousins and auntie)pretending to truly acknowledge the real essence of what makes them the modern day puerto ricans,but barely mentioned how africans influenced the way their spanish is spoken, the food and music. she is so typical and i lost a lot of respect for her and will not support anything else she does. also, since she wants to dance around her african-ness then she need not take more roles associated with blackness (i.e. lackawanna blues). we can find a prideful black latina next time (thank you zoe saldana,gina torres, gina ravera and melissa desousa).<br /><br />to the puerto rican on here that said they are african and not "black"....thank you. we "blacks" certainly do not have anything in common with "you" so there is no love lost. but, since you are probably in the states and have benefited from the civil rights movement we would like for you refuse any decent human treatment you received courtesy of the blood ,sweat and tears from the backs of the "blacks" you share nothing with.<br /><br />if i am correct puerto ricans have a terrible image in the media, but we blacks do not spend our time trying to disrespect you because we know that the media loves to exploits the low points and behaviors of all minorities to maintain mindless generalizations. however, you evidently have fed into the hype that one you are somehow white or superior...you are not. also, you somehow feel compelled to believe that black culture is bet...again you are incorrect and need to take a vacation out of the hood. try visiting atlanta, ga., houston, texas, charlotte, n.c. trust me none of those blacks want to claim your "culture" either.
