basing a television series on a popular author's works is no guarantee of success. yorkshire television learnt this the hard way when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books credited to dick francis, three of which were broadcast under the collective title 'the racing game'. mike gwilym was sid halley, a former jockey turned private eye following an accident in which he lost his right hand, only to have it replaced by an artificial one. gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma ( and looked like one of the bad guys ) while mick ford ( who played the irritating chico barnes ) made me think of a horse's arse whenever he was on screen. for six weeks, this less-than dynamic duo charged about the countryside, foiling nefarious plots to fix races, usually by the same methods - blackmail, kidnapping riders or doping horses. yorkshire television threw money at the show, but to no avail. violent, sexist, far-fetched and repetitious, it was quickly carted off to the knackers yard.
