awwww....yes, it is heartwarming and all that some unlucky family gets adopted by abc/sears and has their home "renovated." that's where the humanistic appeal ends. i liked it early in its run, but now this show has become disgustingly excessive.<br /><br />ten needy families could be given relatively luxurious homes with lots of goodies for every one family that each episode of this show splurges on. the people at habitat for humanity must be shaking their heads in disbelief. for example, is it necessary for a healthy sixteen year old boy to have a jacuzzi in his bedroom, or have his bed tricked-out with "low rider" hydraulics? does the mom really need her dilapidated, non-running and rusted out old pick-up truck restored and "pimped" by some of the best customizers in california? a new one would have done the job quite nicely, and probably for a third of the price. do people really need a sixty-five inch plasma screen in every room of the house? and then there's the issue of who pays the increased property taxes and utility bills. even after the zaniacs at "makeover" leave, somebody still has earn a living. i doubt the friendly folks down at social services will see the humor in all of this largess.<br /><br />this show is nothing more than a ratings grabber for abc, and a tacit commercial for its sponsors.
