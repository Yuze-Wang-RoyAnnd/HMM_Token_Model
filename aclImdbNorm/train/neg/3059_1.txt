all right i recently got a chance to rent this and watch santa claus conquers the martains. although the children were much more sadistic in scctm, i would have to say that santa claus was a much worse movie. as a spanish assignment in spanish 5 we all had to watch it. i'll tell you, usually when we watch a movie we are all just talking and eating food, but not for this movie. everyone just kept there jaw open wondering what the evil mr. pitch was going to do next. would merlin help santa claus!?! or would his robot reindeer come and save the day? i would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of rubbish i have ever seen and i love it for that. :d
