italian-born eleonora has inherited from her deceased lover karl, an ultra-modern and isolated house in the middle of the woods. it's winter and she meets the mysterious caretaker leslie, who eventually ends up not only just looking after the house, but also that of eleonora, as she tries to adapt to her new surroundings and a growing attraction between the pair.<br /><br />what was i expecting? a thriller indeed, but it wasn't quite so. that's just the advertising on the package for ya! i'm quite perplex about everything. the title, the story and the motivation. so how to classify it? well, this wooden character drama is more a enigmatically moody romance bound-story of alienation, possession and dependence twisted into a complicatedly passionate relationship of two masked individuals. co-writer (along with william dafoe) and director giada colagrande's art-house film is just too clinical, distant and calculated with its mysteriously metaphoric story, which it leaves you questioning what does it all really mean
