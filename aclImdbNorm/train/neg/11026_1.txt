i just finished reading a book about dillinger. this movie was horribly inaccurate. it's like they got a list of names and just made everything up. his robberies and getaways were well planned, down to the second - when the time was up, they left whether they had all of the money or not. they had notes of every road, where to turn, etc. purvis never saw him at the restaurant, he was told that dillinger paid for his meal after dillinger left. purvis never even saw dillinger before the night dillinger was killed, only photos of him. the way his gang members died were fictitious. dillinger never robbed a bank by himself, like he did in this movie. if i had never read the book, maybe i could have enjoyed the movie. the acting was a bit over the top in places. the action was overdone as well. on second thought, i doubt if i would have enjoyed it much even if i hadn't read the book.
