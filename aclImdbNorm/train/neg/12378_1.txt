creepy & lascivious wolf. the young "red" is wearing full make-up, and extremely short shorts & robe. got about 20 minutes through and realized it could be a pedophile's dream come true. the "up-beat" music sounds a lot like something i'd hear at a strip club. i actually think this movie is a sick joke - it's not a family movie. gross, glad i was watching this with my daughter, i don't want her to think it's normal for families to view quasi kiddie porn together. very bad, very sad it's sold as a family film, joey fatone will probably be embarrassed he was in it. and what's with advertising it as a "special effects spectacular"??? the effects do look low budget, gawd awful.
