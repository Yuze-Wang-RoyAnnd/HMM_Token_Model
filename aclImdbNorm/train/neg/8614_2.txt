i have to confess right off that i have never been a fan of rodney dangerfield. indeed, from me he gets "no respect." i watched this only because my wife wanted to see it, and found exactly what i expected: a stupid story without any real humour. it's full of lame, crude jokes and a totally ridiculous plot revolving around a developer's (dangerfield) plans to build a ski resort in utah that just didn't capture my attention at all.<br /><br />in addition to dangerfield the film starred a weak cast, including the likes of andrew dice clay and the totally over the hill john byner (i didn't even know he was still around until i saw his name in the credits for this.)<br /><br />this truly is a dangerfield disaster.<br /><br />2/10
