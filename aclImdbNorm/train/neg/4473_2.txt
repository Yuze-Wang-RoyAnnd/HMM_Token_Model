dane tries to hard and is to extreme with all of his yelling and going crazy, spilling water on himself and rolling on the floor. to much. calm down, get yourself together and make us laugh. i didn't quite understand his comparison toward comics and rock stars. just because there both up on stage or something? he said that every comedian wants to be a rock star. i'm sure rodney dangerfield was really into that when he was alive. he had a few good jokes like the burger king joke where people yell at the drive thru. i also liked the reese's pieces joke. if dane just didn't act so mental he might be funnier and i might have given this a higher rating, as high as maybe an eight.
