i watched this movie, and hoped for something to get better the entire time. what is so great about a guy with no emotion? *yawn*<br /><br />you never see alex show emotion for anyone other than his son. yeah, i know that this is why his son is the only one to cause him to lose his temper (if you can call it that), i get it.<br /><br />characters are undeveloped, relationships aren't given enough time to be understood. in one scene sarah says they won't fall in love, and the next time we see her she's talking about how his death really shook her up because they were so close? logic synapses abound in this film.<br /><br />it's like someone watched boogie nights and wrote this part to mimic little bill. even the scene where he "loses his temper" is the same as when little bill shoots his wife, down to the facial expression (or lack thereof). yes, william h. macy is good at portraying a man without emotion - been there, done that - can you say magnolia?<br /><br />this movie didn't only lack emotion, it lacked substance, a good script, developed characters, and a plot. and it certainly lacks my recommendation. :)<br /><br />~a~
