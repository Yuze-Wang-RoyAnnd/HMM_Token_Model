this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. there is absolutely no storyline, the gags are only for retards and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching. in the whole movie fredi (oh my god what a funny name. ha ha) doesn't ask himself once how he came from a plane to middle earth. there are plenty of stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny. e.g. : gandalf is called almghandi, sam is called pupsi ... and so on. i didn't even smile once during the whole movie. the gags seem like they were made by people whose iq is negative. if you laugh when someone's coat is trapped in the door (this happens about 5 times) then this movie is perhaps for you. another funny scene: they try to guess the code word for a closed door (don't ask why- don't ever ask "why" in this movie) and the code word is (ha ha): dung. so if you laughed at this examples you might like this movie. for everybody else: go to youtube and watch "lord of the weed": it's a lot, lot more fun.
