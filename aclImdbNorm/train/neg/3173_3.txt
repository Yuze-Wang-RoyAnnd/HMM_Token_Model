this movie is similar to the play entitled 'blithe spirit' written by noel coward. the plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to coward's writing. i'm surprised that movies of this nature don't acknowledge the original writer's concept. i realize that the public may not be aware that this is a knockoff but it is.<br /><br />sad. these movies are so expensive to produce. i do perk up when a screenplay is original. i even perk up when it's an innovative way to produce a work that was previously released. there were some samples mentioned (such as topper, etc.). <br /><br />i realize that movies are still a comparatively affordable form of entertainment. however, i'm not please when the public's taste is taken for granted. in this situation, the public's taste is overlooked.<br /><br />i look forward to better produced movie entertainment.<br /><br />in this case. i rather see the play.
