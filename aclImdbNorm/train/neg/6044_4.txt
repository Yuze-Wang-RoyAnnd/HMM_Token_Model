a well put together entry in the serial killer genre that unfortunately gets mired down in its own pretentiousness to be really satisfying. willem dafoe is superb as a nyc detective trying to track down what appears to be a copycat using the same renaissance art-related killing techniques used in a series of murders he solved years earlier. scott speedman is dafoe's junior partner and they have pretty good chemistry (at least for a while). other characters pop up to conveniently tie the two cases together. clea duval is the friend of an earlier victim and peter stormare is some sort of art broker/mentor to dafoe...that's a bit hard to take, although stormare is, of course, never dull. the film's ending is particularly disappointing. look fast for deborah harry as dafoe's less than forthcoming neighbor.
