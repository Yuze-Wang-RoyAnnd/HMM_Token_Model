this was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed movies i've seen in a very long time. i've never liked spike lee, but thought i'd give this one a try: bad mistake. the movie is supposed to show how the son of sam real life murders affected a neighborhood in the summer of 1977; what it really did was center around the most boring characters that i doubt anyone cared for as far as their drug problems, marriage problems, and so on, etc. the scenes that depict the murders are just that, and nothing more; a shooting and then it's back to saturday night fever! what's even more ridiculous is spike lee's choice to show up as a reporter in the movie: spike, trust me, you're no hitchcock, stay out of the movies, it makes them even worse off. the most silly scene had to be the dog speaking in a goofy voice, which was depicted in a scene before it where it was supposed to have been shot??? spike, what were you thinking when you made this film? not thinking at all is my guess. people who think they'll see a crime drama, take my advice and do not waste your time or money on this loser. you're better off watching jerry springer in this case! waste of film, i gave it a 1 out of 10: awful dud.
