let me start off by saying i am not a fan of horror movies. i never watch them.<br /><br />let me tell you about my experience...<br /><br />the only reason i watched this movie was because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see it over happy feet.<br /><br />...i never saw happy feet, but i am sure it is better than this...movie? anyway, we didn't actually expect it to be good...we actually went in just to laugh at it. cool with me...i have a problem with ruining the movie for other people in the theater but since it was just other couples talking and making out, it did not matter.<br /><br />after 15 minutes the 2 other people left to go sneak into borat, a movie i would have gladly seen again over this. the movie was not scary, and not stupid so it would be funny...it was just boring. it wasn't terrible like "baby genuises" terrible, it was terrible like...not entertaining at all. avoid.<br /><br />now i am no expert, but it seems the problem with the horror industry these days is that you can have a pg-13 horror that is boring and not scary, or you can have an r gruesome horror movie that either is too bloody or too disgusting for people.<br /><br />you want a pg-13 horror that sucks but is funny? see "the grudge." avoid this movie like the plague...because it may literally bore you to death.<br /><br />0/10
