how can you gather this respectable cast of young british actors and come up with such a pile of filmic manure? horrible script, annoyingly hectic camera, awfully edited, gruesomely badly acted. only rhys ifans tries to fill his role with life. another painful proof that "different" sometimes equals "dreck". why do the money people fail to read the scripts beforehand? do yourself a favour: spare yourself and do something else - like hitting a mallet onto your knees. it's less painful and more fun than this movie!
