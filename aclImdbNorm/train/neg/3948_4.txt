this is not the video nastie, but only because it came out in 1994 when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in britain. it is 75% a rehash of the boogeyman, and would have been banned for the same reason - whatever that was.<br /><br />i was initially confused as i thought that annie (kelly galindo) may have been a different lacey, but she was someone trouble by psychic visions of a boogeyman similar to the one in the first film. fans will immediately note that they are not the same person.<br /><br />after seeing a murder in a bathroom, and also seeing the address as well, annie, her psychiatrist and a para psychology student who greatly resembles the guy on the cheap romance novels and butter commercials, head to the house, and, sure enough, it's the same bathroom. 24 hours later a murder happens just as she described. of course, we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered.<br /><br />then the movie shift to a rerunning of the boogeyman story with some extra footage that we did not see in the original. notably, the boogeyman is shown unlike the original. sadly, some of the good scenes were cut, but 90% of it is there. why rerun this film? did they find the footage in the trash? what was the purpose? <br /><br />we'll never know and, despite the psychologist telling annie she is cured, we all know the bogeyman will never die.
