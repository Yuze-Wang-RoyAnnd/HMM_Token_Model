i like the time period, i like the attempt, but watching a movie that looks like i'm looking at it through a coke bottle gives me a headache. if i played computer games that were this blurry and out of focus, i would upgrade my computer. could be that this was the look the director was after, but not so it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes. if i hadn't taken someone with me to this film, i was out of there. even though it was a series and not a movie per say, band of brothers accomplished this. they made it look like wwii footage, with just a touch of graininess, but it was still a pleasure to watch. movies need real people, with real sets, and real locations; use cgi when it is appropriate, not for an entire film.
