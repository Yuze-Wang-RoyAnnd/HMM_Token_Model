sure, if you ask any mom who's the most beautiful baby in the world, she'd tell you her son is the most amazing kid in the whole world. she's right, at least in her own world.<br /><br />the producers of the movie were biggie's mother and his good friend puffy. oh, well, do i need to say more? i'll break it down for those who doesn't want to do a simple deduction.<br /><br />the whole movie was fake. you may just put a few biggie's mtv video together and call it a movie.<br /><br />the beautiful angela bassett played biggie's mother. the real one in life looks like a dog.<br /><br />i just wonder why he called himself biggie small. big body small dick? big mouth small sound? big fat small eyes? disclaimer: i'm a person of color. so keep your racist remark to yourself.
