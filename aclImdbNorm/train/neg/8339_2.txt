this film just goes around in circles, and the viewer does not know where they are. at first i thought..mmmmm, could be kinda cool movie this, but it just drags on and on, and eventually you don't know what's going on. the lead female is a good actress and played her role well, and the psycho fella, is creepy, but after a bit you don't really care what happens, because this film just drags on. shame really, this could have turned out a lot better.<br /><br />would say though that the lead female and psycho fella, will have a good career ahead of them , but will they remember this film, for making them known, or for being the film they regret they ever made.
