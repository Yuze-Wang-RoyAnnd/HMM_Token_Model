my 10-year-old daughter, alexandra, writes:<br /><br />i thought it was very boring, and i thought it was just a repeat of stuff from "101 dalmatians." i couldn't wait for the movie to end. the best part was the credits at the beginning - they were cute and well done. the rest of the film is not worth watching. thank you.
