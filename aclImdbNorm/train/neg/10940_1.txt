first, let's all agree that lorenzo lamas could never be considered a skilled actor, barely even decent, sometimes just plain lousy. however, in this piece of @*!^ called snakeeater, the film industry as a whole sank.<br /><br />first, let's start with the plot. a vietnam vet named jack kelly, aka soldier (who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some, which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through 2 guys' feet and pins them to the floor), gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped. therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. had some potential, but still pretty thin to begin with.<br /><br />now, the acting. being an actor myself, i am qualified to say that this was some of the worst acting in the history of the art!!!!! lamas is, well, himself. the jackasses playing the clampets/deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so-called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere, especially talented ones who never get their big break!<br /><br />finally, the action. the gunfighting is so-so at best, and the fist-fighting is deplorable. i've seen more real-looking fights at the renaissance festival (and those were pretty fake-looking)!<br /><br />readers, listen to me: avoid this piece of caca at all costs! if it were the only film in existence, you still would want to avoid it! for the sake of your brain-cell count, do not watch this thing!
