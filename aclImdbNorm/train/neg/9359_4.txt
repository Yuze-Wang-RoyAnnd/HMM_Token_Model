this film is probably pro-muslimization. <br /><br />why do i write that? the main character has a muslim father and a christian mother. he lives his first 20 years in a christian village. in the end of the film he seemingly is a muslim because of his head-wear, that he has kept his amulet, and his general clothing. he has a six year old child, who wears the same head-wear and therefore is probably a muslim, although the mother is a christian. the main character thus chooses to, it seems, to be a muslim and his child becomes a muslim. no one of the other male main characters, which are christians, seems to breed a child. there are more muslims in the world of this movie at the end of it, it therefore seems.
