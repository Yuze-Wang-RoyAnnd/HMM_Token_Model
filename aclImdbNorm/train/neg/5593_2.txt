i love dracula but this movie was a complete disappointment! i remember lee from other dracula films from when i was younger, and i thought he was great, but this movie was really bad. i don't know if it was my youth that fooled me into believing lee was the ultimate dracula, with style, looks, attraction and the evil underneath that. or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me. <br /><br />but can you imagine dracula with an snobbish english accent and the body language to go along with it? do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension..? then this is a movie for you! <br /><br />otherwise - don't see it! i only gave it a 2 because somehow i managed to stay awake during the whole movie.<br /><br />sorry but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and home alone in a dark room with lots of unwatched space behind you. maybe alone in your parents house or in a strangers home. cause not even the characters in this flick seemed afraid, and i think that sums up the whole thing!<br /><br />or maybe you like this film because of it's place in dracula cinema history, perhaps being fascinated by how the dracula story has evolved from nosferatu to what it is today. cause as movie it isn't that appealing, it doesn't pull you in to the suggestive mystery that for me make the vampyre myth so fascinating. <br /><br />and furthermore it has so much of that tacky 70ies feel about it. the scenery looks like cheap theatre. and i don't say that rejecting everything made in the 70ies. cause i can love old film as well as new.
