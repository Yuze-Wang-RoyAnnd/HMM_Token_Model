"absolute beginners" was a film for the younger generation, a multi-time film that discussed the issues that teens were facing in britain and how these troubled, constantly hitting each note, teen's problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow. it could have been dubbed the "moulin rouge" of the 80s, but it disappeared. it made its very shallow mark on the world, snuck under the radar, and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section, the comedy section, or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that doesn't need chain money to survive. alas, that wasn't where i found it
