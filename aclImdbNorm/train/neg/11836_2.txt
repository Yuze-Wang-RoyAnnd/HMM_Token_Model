ultimately too silly and pointless. yes there is the gilded cage metaphor but probably most kids would miss that. forgettable. instantly.<br /><br />animation is, as we have come to expect, super-real. the plot-line could best be described as thin but tenacious. although the ending seemed arbitrary to me.<br /><br />the sewer underworld is a suitably disgusting reflection of the world above and, somehow, wealth and money seem to count for a lot there too. oh yes, and there's a romantic interest with the female being the smarter, more savvy and go-getting of the pair - this in itself is rapidly becoming a tiresome (anti) stereotype. probably your kids will love it though.
