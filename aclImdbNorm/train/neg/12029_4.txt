generally, i've found that if you don't hear about a movie prior to seeing it on dvd, there's probably a good reason for it. i hadn't heard about this movie at all until i was in a blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf. since all the good movies had already been rented out (the ones i wanted to see, anyway), i figured i'd give this one a shot.<br /><br />it's really not much different than other movies in the genre, such as the singles ward or the r.m. if you're into those type movies, you'll probably enjoy this.<br /><br />however, if you're not a mormon, this movie probably won't appeal to you. there's no way to avoid the overtly religious (mormon) message contained within, and at times it comes across as sappy and cheesy. ultimately, if you don't fall within the mormon demographic, you're probably better off watching something else.<br /><br />admittedly, there were some very funny moments in the film, but i didn't think that it was enough to salvage the movie overall.
