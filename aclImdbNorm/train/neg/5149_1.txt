this movie is about a female rape victim/comic book writer from new york that decides to get away from all that awful big city glamor and move to a dirty, run down small town where she finds refuge in a single-wide trailer on a dirt lot in the middle of 12th and nowhere. the townspeople are mentally ill, yet so is she for inviting crazy men into her trailer. annoying is the fact that she has the ability to do exactly the right thing to place herself in dangerous circumstance after dangerous circumstance. db sweeney's performance was high school at best. he's one of those kinda-cute young actors with a sweet grin. unfortunately career has not been kind and mother nature has been right in tow. to the previous commentator stating that the acting was "so real", well i agree. actually it wasn't acting. the two main characters really are pathetic, weak and incapable of making mature, healthy decisions. in brief, this movie sucks like no other, rent it to laugh at it. the real crime scene? the atrocious wood paneling in the trailer - enough to make me commit murder. and lastly, she's a artist/writer, so couldn't she afford a double-wide trailer and something other than a sun-yellow chevy chevette for love of god!
