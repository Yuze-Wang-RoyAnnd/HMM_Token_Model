when i first saw this movie, it was titled terror on a train and was the back half of a double feature. glenn ford, an armament expert is called on to defuse a hidden bomb on a train loaded with high explosives. the tension is slow and steady; and this black & white film runs only about an hour and twelve minutes. all these years later on tv; the tension and drama has lost most of its impact. this is still a good movie as far as early 50s standards go.<br /><br />along with ford are anne vernon and maurice denham. the villain/saboteur is played by victor maddern.
