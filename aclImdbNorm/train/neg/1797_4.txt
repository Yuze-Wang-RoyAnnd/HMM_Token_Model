this movie has a very hard-to-swallow premise, even by this genre's standards. we are asked to accept not only that a record played backwards can bring a dead man back to life, but that the record also contains hidden messages aimed specifically at one kid, when the singer had no connection to the boy when he was alive, and of course no way of knowing at whose hands the record would end up. anyway, the film is fun for a while, but eventually the silliness and the pointlessness reign supreme. if they were really trying to create a new freddy-like horror icon, they were way off: the villain here has no personality, no motivation, and no variety.
