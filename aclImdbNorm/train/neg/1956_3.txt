this movie has one redeeming feature. at one point, after a character is attacked by an ax-wielding fairy, his brother asks him, "why is your dick over there, chuck?" after suffering through almost an hour of bad film, this almost made my drink come out my nose.<br /><br />some of the acting isn't too bad, but the kids all stink and p. j. soles should be ashamed of herself for doing this film. the story is weak and nobody does what you think (or what common sense dictates) they should.<br /><br />of course, there are a lot of story points that don't add up. for example, in one scene the ghosts of young children must concentrate hard to move a physical object so they can prove they exist, a difficult feat since they apparently can't interact with physical matter. however, minutes later they all pick up branches off the ground and beat the tooth fairy with them. apparently they can sometimes move matter and sometimes they can't. go figure.<br /><br />lots of blood and guts, though...a few nice boobs. but this doesn't make up for the deficiencies.<br /><br />if you want a movie about the tooth fairy, go rent "darkness falls". i think it's great, though a lot of other reviewers don't share my opinion. at least it sets a mood.
