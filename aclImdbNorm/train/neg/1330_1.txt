there is a reason why jay leno himself will not acknowledge this film. it consistently ranks as one of the worst films of all time. the acting is horrible, the script lacks direction and the director himself doesn't seem sure on which way to take this film. "a buddy film," "an action/comedy," "mystery." seems half way through, he gives up, and is just along for the ride. jay leno and pat morita are talented and dedicated performers. it is a shame that they wasted their time and gifts making this mess of a movie. jay leno and pat morita prior to involving themselves with this, had spent years pounding out their crafts on the hollywood circuit. mr. morita had already been a star in his own right, acting steadily since the mid 1960s as the star of such cult tv and movie classics as "happy days," and the dismal but affable "mr. t and tina." and won the hearts of america with his roles in the powerful film, "midway," "the karate kid," and a host of others. mr. leno can been seen on tv shows dating back to the mid 70s. and was a top performer in the comedy clubs of america. he can be seen in countless tv spots and in major films. it is a shame, that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense.
