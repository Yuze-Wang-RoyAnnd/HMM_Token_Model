there is just one word for this film. appalling. the director clearly has talent but like his character robert carmichael he throws it all away.<br /><br />carmichael has potential, but like cray he can't be bothered to use it. being drawn into petty crime and then descending into depravity is cray's vision of british youth. like the british tabloids this film portrays young people with no aspirations or respect. cray cries out for attention, but deserves none.<br /><br />i was appalled by the act of violence that cray chose to shove in the faces of the audience. he assumes the audience are ignorant of world atrocities. like a piece of obscene graffiti on a toilet wall he shows us male depravity with adolescent glee.<br /><br />some actors of quality have small parts in this film. danny dyer and leslie manville both make short appearances. the acting is otherwise amateur, the young men joe and ben are cringe making. carmichael played by daniel spencer is creepy. miranda wilson plays monica, the attractive wife of celeb chef jonathon (michael howe); how she was able to subject herself to such an ordeal is beyond belief. the film is never subtle and monica is treated to the most gratuitous violence which is cut with war action. war imagery is used to convey the idea that young men cannot help themselves, that acts of violence will occur within even "civilised" countries. this is most certainly true and is symptomatic of our altered society where males have an increasingly less important position, but cray descends to the level of the barbaric males he seeks to expose through his use of such brutal and violent images. the female characters in the film offer no relief. they are either victims or in manville's case a washed out mother. the community is represented as dysfunctional.<br /><br />this is cray's first film. i listened to what he had to say during a q and a session at edinburugh and he is not unintelligent, he simply lacks experience and his film exposes his naivety. the film is due to be released later this year, but i hope the company goes bust cos the public really don't need this kind of messed up material.
