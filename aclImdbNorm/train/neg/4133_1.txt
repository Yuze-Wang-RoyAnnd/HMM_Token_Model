i watched this movie with some friends a couple months ago, i still laugh today thinking about some of the utter stupidity. the first few scenes alone were hilarious. i won't spoil anything for those who wish to see it, i wouldn't want to ruin the laughs. needless to say the entire time i watched this movie i was trying to figure out exactly what the point of anything the characters in this movie were doing. towards the end we all got bored however, as the initial hilarity and shock of a movie being this random wore off. there is no plot and not a trace of decent acting. the characters are about as well developed as those in a kindergarten "learn to read" book. they even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting.
