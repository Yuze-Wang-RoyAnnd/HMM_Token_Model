i wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine. it wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic. the storyline is different and i am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands. directing and acting were awful!! i had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs. although the movie started promisingly, it got worse and worse. i think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters.. i still think that it is worth watching as i haven't seen films subjecting gay porn. don't keep your expectations high though,then you will be very disappointed. * out of *****
