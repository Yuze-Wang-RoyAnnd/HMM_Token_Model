stalker is right! girl sees guy, girl wants guy, girl contrives mundane ways to keep bumping into him, girl won't leave him alone, girl pretends to be a patient, girl can't stop talking about him, girl pretends to love another guy (or two), he doesn't pay attention to her because she's annoying, girl still won't leave him alone. played right, drake's character could have been charming but she's completely, wholly, unrelenting in her pursuit of cary grant's character, her girlfriend-in-cahoots is dull, and sadly, drake's attempt at playing, "charmingly screwball" comes off as, "disturbingly demented." grant is himself, as usual, which is fine for cary but it's as close to a phoned-in performance as i've ever seen from him. the direction is lackluster and the dialog is just plain dim.<br /><br />screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully and when it fails, like in this stubbed-out butt of an attempt, it just stinks. worse still, drake spends the entire film in need of a lot of valium and a restraining order. she ruins any humor to be found in this drier than mummy dust relic.
