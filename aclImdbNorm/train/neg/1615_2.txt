same old same old about che. it completely ignored the really interesting facts of che's true character. sodeberg redid the same boring narrative of che. the silly seductive tale of an argentinean rich-boy who was so shocked by poverty he became a robin hood fighting alongside the poor, until eventually he was murdered by the cia. yeah, yeah, heard it all before, boring and untrue!. the reality of che guevara is very different and far more explosive! the facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messiah streak, who openly wanted to impose maoist tyranny on the world. he was so fanatical that at the hottest moment in the cold war, he even begged the soviet union to nuke new york, washington or los angeles and bring about the end of the world. che urged khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against us cities. for the rest of his life, he declared that if his finger had been on the button, he would have pushed it. when khrushchev backed down and literally saved the world, che was furious at the "betrayal". if che's recommendations had been followed, you would not be reading this review now. how a homicidal maniac became a pop icon would have made a much more interesting film. incredible that no filmmaker has been daring enough to show the real side of che and his posthumous media transformation. that would make an oscar winning film! i thought making independent film meant taking real risks and being groundbraking! they only stick to "safe counterculture themes", to wit, "che cool", "wall street bad", "republican= nazi", "bush ex hitler", "nra is worse than kgb", "christians are fanatics and stupid", etc...ad nauseum. oooh, how daring, how mind blowing. tres anti-mainstream and edgy. i wish they would have some real cojones and tackle the independent film oligarchy! that would be truly daring!
