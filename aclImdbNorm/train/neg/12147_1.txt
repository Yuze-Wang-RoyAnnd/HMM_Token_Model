this is perhaps the worst attempt at a zombie film i have ever had the misfortune to see. terrible, terrible, terrible. any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the filmmaker, the filmmakers family, or a friend of the filmmaker. how does this film suck? let us count the ways...<br /><br />the plot? incoherent. dialogue? atrocious. i will not slam the effects/gore, as i understand that this is low budget. but was there even one zombie that was not obese? c'mon! and for a film set in rhode island, why did that truck sport a massachusetts plate? continuity, find some.<br /><br />the girl dancing while the soldier "stands at attention". please, don't put your ex-girlfriend or buddy's sister in your movie naked. this was an ugly movie filled with ugly people, and has no business even mentioning romero on the cover. next time you decide to make a movie, don't.
