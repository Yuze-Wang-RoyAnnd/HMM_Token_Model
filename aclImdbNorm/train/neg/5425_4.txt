i got mirror mirror mainly because yvonne de carlo was in it (i thought she was great in american gothic) but sadly she didn't have a very big role in this film. it starts off ok and the pace moves along nicely...but by the end it starts getting a bit tedious and dull. that's not to say that this is a boring film, but it's just very average and nothing spectacular. i didn't like the "posession" side of it and there were no decent gore scenes. plus the 'main' story was very confusing and the ending doesn't make much sense at all. i did however like the story surrounding the gothic girl and how she got revenge on her tormentors.<br /><br />i wouldn't particularly recommend mirror mirror to horror fans - it's nothing to wet yourself over.
