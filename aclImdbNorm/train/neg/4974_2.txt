may the saints preserve us, because this movie is not going to help.<br /><br />someone with access needs to e-mail mel gibson and tell him we need a faithful production of beowulf. something that actually has something in common with the epic poem that is the foundation for all modern western literature.<br /><br />the recent (since 2000) versions of beowulf make we wonder two things. first, why is there so much interest in the story. second, why are all these filmmakers squandering mountains of cash on this crap.<br /><br />the only reason this got a two is that the version with lambert in it (beowulf 2000) was worse and needed the 1.<br /><br />what is even worse, some people will watch this and get the wrong idea about the poem. how can an industry where peter jackson gets a literary conversion to film so right can get it so wrong. i mean really, the roman forum as a model for heorot is too much.<br /><br />and please, horns on helmets? spare me. this is insulting.<br /><br />/hjm
