despite being a 2001 movie, the direction is the kind of 90's art-house style that was considered "old" and out-of-date a few years ago. the cheesy cuts and effects were painful to watch. the script is decent enough, and a few scenes did kind of captivate me (like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). but the story line with the detective who's sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just plain terrible. the performance by the actor who plays selma blair's married boyfriend seriously bothered me. i did sit through the whole thing, though, which is rare for the kind of random, what-is-this movie you just find on tv and decide to watch.
