this dvd appears to be targetted at someone who will just put it on and play it in an endless loop in the background. it's organized as a series of music videos of the grand canyon set to various pieces of tangerine dream music.<br /><br />unfortunately, the td music is dull, and the transfer to dvd looks rather blurry and dim. too expensive a dvd for what it is.
