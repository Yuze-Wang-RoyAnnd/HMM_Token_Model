i used to have a fascination with the cartoon back in college when it was being made. it had much the charm of "get smart". while it admittedly had its faults, it was rather enjoyable.<br /><br />naturally i was very interested in seeing the film version. that was before i saw it. afterwords i wished it had never been made.<br /><br />besides being miscast all around (who on earth though broderick was even close to the role?) it just didn't make the grade.<br /><br />the effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing i liked about the movie; seeing a live-action version of the gadgets in action! what was missing was a story and treatment which made it funny or charming or interesting.<br /><br />the original was a wacky cartoon with a very lighthearted attitude. it was fun. the motion picture became murky and took itself far too seriously. if it had seriously had a great plot or went crazy enough to make it seem like a "cartoon on film" it might have been enjoyable.<br /><br />as it exists it doesn't deserve to be considered part of the "gadget legacy".
