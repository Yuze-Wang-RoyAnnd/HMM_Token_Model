i knew i was going to see a low budget movie, but i expected much more from an alex cox film. the acting by the two leading men was terrible, especially the white guy. the girl should have won an oscar compared to those two. this movie was filled with what i guess would be inside jokes for film industry people and a few other jokes that i actually understood and made me laugh out loud, which is rare. without these laugh-out-loud moments i would have given this film 2/10. what happened to the alex cox who made all the 80s classics?<br /><br />spoiler:<br /><br />there were a couple of questions i had after the movie was over. why did the mexican guy go to the other guy's house at the beginning? what did his daughter say he got 100 people fired from his last job? why was she breaking her own stuff when she was mad at him? i guess i should have gone to the q&a after the movie, but i didn't want to get up at 10am.
