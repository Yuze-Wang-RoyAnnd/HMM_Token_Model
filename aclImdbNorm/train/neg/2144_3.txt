i've always thought that cinderella ii was the worst movie i've ever seen, (followed by peter pan 2, and some other sequels like the lion king 2 and the hunchback of notre dame 2). all these movies are made with the same idea; because the movie has no plot, they try to make up for that by filling it with jokes. i'm not saying the jokes are bad, but they make up most of the movie. the first time i saw the movie, i would have given it a 1/10. but now i think about it, most kids don't care how good the original movie was, they just care that the movie is entertaining. i still think the movie was a bad sequel, but that doesn't mean it's horrible. now i think it deserves a 3/10.
