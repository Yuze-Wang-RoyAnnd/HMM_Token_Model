comedy central has a habit of putting on great programs at times-chappelle's show, the daily show, colbert report, and then there are those that some people love or hate-stella, dr. katz. then there are some shows that have their defenders but are just plain awful- mencia, and now, sarah silverman.<br /><br />this show is based on the fact silverman is self-centered, which can be funny (colbert report) but can be horrible (mind of mencia). it should shock no one that i believe the latter is the case. this show is a parody of a sitcom and society, a program so absurd it loses itself in its absurdity and it simply isn't funny. a woman farting has been done in comedy many many times because its not something that's common. we don't need 25 minutes of it. when a criminal is disarmed by a queef, it simply loses its appeal-we saw it in jay and silent bob strike back, except the women were hotter, and the whole scene was more absurd, making it better. but the best comparison of this show is to stella, except stella was more subtle, which is what made the absurdist comedy funny. it had better acting, and i suppose, a bit more of a fantastical realist view.<br /><br />perhaps the fact some reviews are so negative (i'm very skeptical of the critical acclaim but do not dispute fan reaction) to this show is the amount of advertising on it, very obnoxious ads through many programs far outdo advertising on for other programs. many people are wondering why sarah silverman has a career, and others are still bitter when better shows have been canceled. this show should've never made it past the unaired pilot stage. back to norm showed far more promise, yet this show makes it further. and as far as critics being correct, many things have been universally panned have seen their status rise immensely. last i checked, britney spears gets good reviews too also. take that comparison however you want because someone will no doubt accuse me of being psychotic on imdb for not liking this show.
