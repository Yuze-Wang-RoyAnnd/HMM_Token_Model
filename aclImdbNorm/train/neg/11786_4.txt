the show had great episodes, this is not one of them. it's not a terrible episode, it's just hard to follow up "the man that was death.", "all through the house", and "dig that cat, he's real gone."<br /><br />this episode is about a couple that has just been married peggy (ammanda plummer) and charles (stephen shellen). in the first five minutes you find out that charles only married peggy for her money. the two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion. charles soon finds out a secret of peggy's family...<br /><br />in my opinion you should watch this episode, but just don't expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season.
