its one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies, and i do not see where all this 'its not that bad' rubbish is coming from. the acting is terrible, it follows exactly the same storyline as all the other 'dancing' movies out there. its terrible! the name should scream don't watch. 'how she move.' since when can movie titles ignore grammar? at least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes, these ones don't even deserve a watch. i give it a 1 out of 10, just because there is no zero. i seriously implore anyone with an iq of over 60 not to watch this, and not to waste your money. the 1.6/10 should tell it all. this movie should not have even be made.
