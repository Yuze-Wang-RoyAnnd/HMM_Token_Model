i have never panned a film on-line, but i felt moved to do so, after seeing this one. one doesn't show up at someone's funeral and say to the bereaved, "my relatives died, so why should i care about yours?"<br /><br />minus the propaganda, there was little, if anything, that could be called "art." as the daughter of deaf parents, i was particularly annoyed by the use of deafness as a gimmick. any deaf person feeling a vibration of that immensity would likely have investigated, not ignored it.<br /><br />the word "chutzpah" comes to mind. as a writer, there are few subjects i would stay away from: the holocaust is one; this is another. i wish these movie makers had not been so arrogant (and inept).
