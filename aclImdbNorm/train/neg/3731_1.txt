i was raised in a "very christian" household since birth. i was saved before i saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a youth group at my church. this movie was highly disturbing. i saw it when i was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares about it for years. i used to lay awake in bed and listen for the sounds of my mom's footsteps upstairs. if i didn't hear her footsteps, i would sneak upstairs to make sure she hadn't been raptured. i used to pray so hard every night for salvation because i was terrified of jesus forgetting me. this is definitely not something i will show to my kids until they are much older, if at all. it took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me.
