andy lau stars in another cop undercover tale. daniel wu plays nick who is working for the cops and is also close to the top of a drug dealing gang(lau). the movie begins as we watch the police try to make a drug bust only to see it go to pieces. we then are introduced to the young drug addicted mother and her daughter living near nick and to his cronies and the cops, and 45 minutes in i shut off the movie and put on the news. well acted and great to look at this is as uninvolving a movie as i've seen in a long time. its not bad as such its just you really don't care. i mean i really didn't care at all. i actually started to do something else completely forgetting i had on a subtitled movie on, thats how much i didn't care. i wish i could have hated the film but the film is such a nonentity that it made almost no impression on me (its not even something i could sleep to its just something to ignore). come on the box called it the chinese scarface,what after he was dead? this is one to avoid.
