primal species (1996, dir. jonathan winfrey) <br /><br />international terrorists get a surprise when their cargo turn out to contain living dinosaurs. the army commando team now have to think fast, if they want to prevent the extinction of the human species, instead of the reptiles.<br /><br />you look at the cover and you gain your first impressions of the film. that is pretty much it. the acting is only just acceptable from a few characters. the story is poor, with the whole film based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs. this film came out three years after 'jurassic park'. instead, this film looks to have come out 13 years before 'jurassic park'. the dinosaurs costumes are so poorly made, and i do mean costumes. there are obviously people dressed up, and this film makes no attempts at hiding this. a scene when a dinosaur runs down a corridor is created in a way, in which it looks like someone is riding the creature. the is one good thing, which comes out of this film. the short running time. at only 1 hour and 15 minutes, it doesn't waste too much of your life, but still try to avoid it altogether.<br /><br />"it's like a friday the 13th nightmare." - officer (brian currie)
