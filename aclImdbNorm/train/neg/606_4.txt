the potential was there. i saw creep and thought, 'oooh, this is getting interesting' several times. yet somehow the interesting plot lines wound up unexplained or ignored, like they never happened. the lead character was irritating throughout the movie, and at one point my fella and i both shouted that we wanted her to die. there are some genuinely spooky/scary moments, but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me. it's another one of those horror movies that crops up and intrigues you for a while, but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the movie makers were trying to achieve.<br /><br />the one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy, but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know you're on to a loser.
