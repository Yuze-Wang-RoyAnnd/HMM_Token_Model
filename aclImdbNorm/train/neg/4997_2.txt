...but it's certainly not without merit. already writer-director preston sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories, creating broadly drawn yet distinctive characters and situations, and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue. (no wonder the coen brothers' next movie is going to be an homage to sturges.)<br /><br />the major problem is that the plot's not all the way there yet; it lacks surprise, the unexpected plot twists and sudden changes of fortune that keep viewers guessing. the coffee slogan is a lousy thing to hang the plot upon, and the ending is thoroughly predictable. frank capra does this sort of thing much better.<br /><br />if you're new to preston sturges, check out "the lady eve" or "sullivan's travels" or "the miracle of morgan's creek" first. if you've seen these already, then go ahead and watch this one.
