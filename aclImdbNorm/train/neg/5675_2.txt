set in the 70s, "seed" centers around convicted serial killer max seed (will sanderson), who killed 666 people in 6 years. he is sentenced to death, but in the electric chair he doesn't die, even after being shocked three times.<br /><br />detective matt bishop (michael par'e) and other officers cover up this secret by burying seed alive. seed breaks out and goes after the people who put him in his living coffin.<br /><br />filmed by the worst director in the world (uwe boll), "seed" is nothing more than a snuff film about trying to stretch the envelope of decent society and fails to deliver in any aspect of a storyline. and he said this is based on true events because if a person survives the electric chair after being shocked three times, they will be set free. this is an urban legend, and it would never happen. much like boll's other abominations ("alone in the dark" for one), "seed" is just utterly horrendous.
