i was so disappointed by this show. after hearing and reading all the hoopla about it, how it was a "ground breaking show" and all sorts of wild promises if quality, i tried to watch it.<br /><br />what a letdown!! the acting was way forced and exaggerated. the story made very little sense. as for any hint of the vaunted "look into teenagers' lives", i could only see a paltry attempt that had as much reality to it as a reality show.<br /><br />some are wondering why there are so many negative comments about this show. the reason is that it's really not all that good and beating the drums over quality on this show only serves to attract attention to how poorly made it is.
