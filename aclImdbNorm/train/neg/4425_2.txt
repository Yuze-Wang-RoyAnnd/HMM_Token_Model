a film about the harlem renaissance and one author in particular. it contrasts it with a modern day story about a young, gay, black artist.<br /><br />if that sounds vague it's because the movie itself is. it's well-directed, fairly well-written and (for the most part) well-acted. also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black & white. also this is one of the few film dealing with gay men that does not shy away from sex scenes (not that explicit and no frontal). still, i mostly hated this.<br /><br />the film meanders all over the place, is full of unlikable characters (including the main protagonist) and (this is the killer) moves at a snails pace. three times i considered leaving the theatre because i was so utterly bored. but the director was there so i stayed. <br /><br />his talk afterwords shows this was a labor of love and took 6 years to complete. i really wish i could like this more (there are very few films dealing honestly with gay blacks) but i can't. unless you're very interested in the harlem renaissance there's no reason to see this.
