starring an unknown cast which seem likely to remain that way, this "film" is yet another cheap slasher flick which amazes me how this was released. i have no problem with horrors and slasher flicks in particular, in fact they are my favourites. but when they are done this bad, it really does take the monkey and its no wonder the genre has such a hard time. the story is as clich'ed and without imagination as possible with a bunch of people in a cabin out in the woods being slashed and hacked up by this zombie/ghost guy. its not the story that sucks the most, its the atrocious acting and dialouge, home made directing quality and an awful soundtrack. not to mention laughable effects and some incredibly lazy film making - these morons are outside in clear daylight yet we are meant to believe it's night?? what the hell was the director thinking with this move? what, he had only one day to film all this in? he was scared of the dark? ( is hilarious seeing a cop walking around in pure daylight with a torch acting as if its pitch black, though)<br /><br />i guess the positive side for the actors is they look like people who work in the local supermarket so at least they could possibly escape from this film without ever being noticed. im sure one of the "teens" plays bingo down the local pub - but she's 40-45.<br /><br />anyway, good for a laugh but just another waste of film and time.
