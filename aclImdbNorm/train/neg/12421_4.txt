mark pirro's "deathrow gameshow" of 1987 is a black comedy that is extremely cheesy in many parts, but occasionally very funny nevertheless. this movie could certainly have been a lot better, the acting is terrible, and some extremely cheesy scenes make it hard to watch at times, but the concept is funny, and it has some hilarious moments.<br /><br />in the near future (the year 1991), game shows have changed. chuck todean (john mc cafferty) hosts a game show called "live or die", in which convicted death row inmates have the chance to play for their lives, and for money. candidates who fail, get executed on the air using many different methods, such as guillotines, electric chairs, and other, more bizarre devices of execution, followed by applause from the cheering studio audience. the show is, of course, more than controversial, and chuck has made lots of enemies...<br /><br />"deathrow gameshow" is incredibly cheesy and crappy in many aspects, and the acting is terrible, but it is without doubt fun in many parts, especially if you're a fan of dark humor. you haven't missed anything if you haven't seen it, but it is definitely funny and a good time waster. 4/10
