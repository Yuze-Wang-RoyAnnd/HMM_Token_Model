being a fan of movies like "fire sale", "where's poppa", "airplane" i saw this because it was mentioned favorably in the context of real comedies and satires like the aforementioned. well, wrong conclusion!<br /><br />not only is this not funny, it makes you angry because it isn't bad in a schlocky, likable way but in a really bad way. it's bad-bad. the script does not contain a single funny line which is rather in the way when you're trying to entertain your audience with humour.<br /><br />adam arkin's speech impediment is probably the single most annoying thing in this movie. still this cruelty of nature doesn't prevent him from being smug throughout the movie and he has a hard time not looking into the camera. this amateur without charisma fits in nicely with the constant continuity errors and bumbling along of the story - if you can find one.<br /><br />ed mcmahon - i had to think of jay leno, another late night talk show person, who always refuses to call himself an actor. well, i've seen a few leno movies and he's laurence olivier compared to mcmahon.<br /><br />kenneth mars is good, though. in the few lines that he's given. i'm not easily frightened by bad comedies so i kept watching and looking for all the quasi-jokes every 5 minutes or so.<br /><br />the movie actually becomes sort of a comedy as soon as alan arkin takes over - he literally does: starting 75 minutes into the movie he's in every scene. but it's too little, too late.<br /><br />when movies try to fool you into believing their lack of professionalism is the reason you're supposed to like them because they have the right intentions they remind me of pupils that haven't prepared for an exam. in those cases you have to remain strict and the grade has to be an 'f'. (but please don't assume i'm a teacher. that is a profession with a respectability somewhere between politician and child molester).<br /><br />if you actually look for a likable schlocky horror/scifi movie that is fun to watch and does contain jokes try "man with the screaming brain" by bruce campbell. or watch sunshine/core if you prefer modern loud shallow scifi schlock. those are equally funny, albeit involuntarily.
