this is the worst show. buntch of grown up acting like kids no humor nothing. even sesame street has better humor and more adult than friends "friends" may be the worst thing i've ever seen on television and i've been sitting in front of the tube observing friends" simply does not stack up well to other, contemporary series. it lacks the smartness of "seinfeld" and the wonderful self-ridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of "frasier". the characters in "friends" seem designed to make them repellant dullards. this incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl.<br /><br />the unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort. the characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric -- though intentionally so. (it might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim lower than their capabilities so as not to confuse the loyal friends of "friends".)
