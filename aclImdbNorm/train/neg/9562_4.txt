i think this could've been a decent movie, and some of its parts are ok... but in whole it's a b movie. same about the plot, parts are ok but it has several holes and oddities that doesn't quite add up. acting is mostly ok, i've seen worse of this too. :)<br /><br />the beginning sets the level, with cars driving in the desert, making "cool" but totally unnecessary jumps through some small dunes (in slow motion! cool!), like the drivers had never seen sand before... it gets slightly better from there, but not much.<br /><br />if you're gonna rent this, get another one too and use this one as a warm-up. keep expectations low and it might work for you.
