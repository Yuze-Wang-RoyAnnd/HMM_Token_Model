the cast although nothing special, all do an ok job, the story seems like a good idea, the script is bearable and the end has quite a good twist; so what's wrong with it?<br /><br />for a start the special effects are really bad (if this was made in the 60's) it might look ok but in 2003 there is just no excuse for visuals as poor as this. it makes me laugh that the dvd cover claims very proudly 'from the special effects creator of jeepers creepers'.<br /><br />secondly the direction is weak, this film just does not capture the essence of the story, a doctor feeding the hospital inmates souls to the devil (or demon type creature) should be tense or frightening; it simply isn't.<br /><br />all in all this is a pretty poor film, and although bearable and at times mildly entertaining, it is still probably best left alone.<br /><br />a rather sad 4/10
