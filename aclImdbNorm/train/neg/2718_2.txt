this is the least scary film i have ever seen. how the blob manages to eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the film. the blob moves so slowly that an o.a.p in a zimmerframe could escape it. the blob has a large slice of luck coming across a typical horror film woman who instead of running away stands still for half an hour so that she can be eaten. if you havent seen this film i recommend you do, its far too funny to be taken seriously.
