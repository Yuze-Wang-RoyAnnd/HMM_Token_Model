in this forgettable trifle, the 40-ish norma shearer plays a fluttery, girlish socialite in monte carlo, caught in a tussle between george sanders and robert taylor. it would be tempting to blame this movie's failure on the dull, talky script, or director george cukor, who never seems interested in livening up the film's generally comatose state. mostly, though, it's the fault of shearer herself, who desperately wanted to keep playing "young" parts as long as she could get away with it. inadvertently, this makes "her cardboard lover" a bizarre monument to an aging woman's vanity.
