what i hate about this show is how poorly the leads are written. these women have no self-respect or dignity. the entire plot is them throwing themselves at guys. amanda bynes' talent is completely wasted. she was brilliant on "all that" and her own show. why they would write her and jenny garth as vapid, airhead, desperate, men chasing, "old-maid" wannabes is beyond me.<br /><br />their plots and dialog remind me of "the simpons", homer says whenever his cartoon character poochie is not on screen, "everyone should ask, where's poochie?". all the talk centers on whining about some guy, and then whining to some guy. sometimes they change it up and the guy whines instead. then they get back together or break up at the end. the 2 women are either shallow, stupid, or sex addicts. the only word i can think of is "sucks".
