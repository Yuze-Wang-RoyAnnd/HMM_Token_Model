you know, i went to see "the hills have eyes 2" wanting to like it. i really enjoyed the original, and the remake was fairly entertaining. they obviously had more money to throw around than wes craven did on special effects the second time around. even though i still prefer the original film, the remake was done well, and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me. bloody, intense, and great special effects. in short, a great popcorn movie for any horror fan.<br /><br />which brings us to "the hills have eyes 2". man, where do i start? the plot, or lack of one, is paper thin. we are not exactly breaking new ground here.the military has decided to monitor the area, and all of these people turn up missing. so what do we do now? let's send in the national guard to investigate. in true hollywood fashion we need to make them the dumbest, and worst soldiers ever seen. gee, i've never seen that premise before. to make a long story short, you have the mutants killing off the moron soldiers one at a time in graphic fashion. once again the special effects by nicotero are great, but the kills no matter how graphic become boring, and predictable. honestly it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck. it was bloody, and graphic, but i found it predictable, boring, and not scary at all. for me it would have been nice if this film contained one original thought.wes craven and his son shared the writing duties, and he has been involved with many of my favorite horror films, but sadly this isn't one of them.
