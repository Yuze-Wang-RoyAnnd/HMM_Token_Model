this one is bad. a really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary in it. a series of crimes, the killer that you do not see throughout the whole movie, the classic investigations. and also the classic tale about a cop who figures out what's going on and isn't believed by anyone, so he has to fight by himself to reveal the truth. not too much in this one. vote: 4 out of 10.
