first off, to give you some idea of my taste in movies...<br /><br />2007 comedies i enjoyed: superbad, knocked up, hot fuzz, blades of glory <br /><br />2007 comedies i hated: evan almighty, the brothers solomon, good luck chuck<br /><br />i should have followed my first instinct and turned off "hot rod" after i got to about the 20 minute mark. i knew by that point that this movie would not make me laugh once. the script is absolutely brutal - i have no idea how this monstrosity managed to crack 6 on imdb. any one older than 10 years old who enjoyed this must be some kind of mental defective.<br /><br />this doesn't come close to anything with will farrell and it's clear that andy samberg can't carry anything longer than a 5 to 10 minute sketch on youtube or snl. i don't know how they roped ian mcshane and isla fisher into doing this movie... they must have owed favors or something. i came in knowing that it would be a dumb movie, but i thought it would at least be funny. i didn't so much as smirk.<br /><br />i don't normally comment on movies at imdb, but this was so awful, i just had to warn people. this is only the 4th movie i've seen that i've felt compelled to rate 1/10.
