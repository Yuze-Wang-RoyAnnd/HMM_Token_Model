was sort of enjoying this movie until the issues of ed norton's facial hair. without revealing any plot details--on one afternoon he was sporting a light beard but by the same evening the beard was gone and a very luxuriant moustache was in place. it was much fuller than the moustache that went with the beard. later on, in the course of a dark night in the open the moustache was gone and he appeared cleans haven. this was on an occasion where stopping to shave wouldn't be an option. these continuity discrepancies totally distracted me from the rest of the movie and ruined any credibility it had previously had. also, i found the lengthy scene of the cowboy alone in his bedroom was way too reminiscent of de niro in taxi driver. even if it was meant to be an homage it was laid on too thickly for this viewer.
