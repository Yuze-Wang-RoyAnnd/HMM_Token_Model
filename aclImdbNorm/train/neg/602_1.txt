yet another example of the complete waste of uk lottery money. just how commercial did this film prove. the film council ,who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded, on one of the london undergrounds disused stations, for allowing this clich'ed, dismal specimen to be committed to film, a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate, most notably deathline. amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute. it's a little bit too late then! surely all those development executives, at the uk film council, could have noticed this at the script stage. add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare.
