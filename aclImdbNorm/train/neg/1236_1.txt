what ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? well, he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could've been directed by anybody available out of film school...and in fact, they probably would've done a better job. they would've at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script.<br /><br />mark wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes. (gasp!) except this time around, the apes squirm through groan-worthy dialogue, nonsensical plotting, and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could've been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered 'masterpiece' next to this tripe.<br /><br />as much as i enjoy the superb acting talent that is tim roth, his performance as evil ape leader thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing. luckily for him, the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap-dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles.<br /><br />and alas, the always dependable hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause. and the "haha, we're so clever, aren't we?" way that hollywood intermingles references from the original pota into this one. sigh...<br /><br />instead of seeing this, spend the night in and call up some friends and rent 'ed wood', 'edward scissorhands', 'batman', or even to a lesser extent 'sleepy hollow', and reminisce about the days when tim burton was a man of vision and originality...not shame and ridicule.
