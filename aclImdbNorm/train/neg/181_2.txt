ah, channel 5 of local mexican t.v. everyday, at 2:00 a.m. they air horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. it was "return to cabin by the lake" the movie that aired yesterday. i regret for watching it.<br /><br />the original "cabin by the lake" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. the problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. ugh. the plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word.<br /><br />the movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it's absurd dialogs, cinematography, and direction.<br /><br />my advice is : avoid this one at all costs. it's a movie that it shouldn't be watched by anyone. not even for lovers of mediocre film-making.<br /><br />you have been warned.
