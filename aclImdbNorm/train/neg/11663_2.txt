white chicks hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as black chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. can anyone give me one wayans movie where they haven't dressed up as ladies? don't be a menace doesn't count, jack white and michael costanza ghost wrote that (the other norton trio members acted as directors).<br /><br />in white chicks, there's never really any jokes. it's just the wayans acting like girls for 2 hours. there's no setups, no punchlines and no laughs. there is a lot of "i think i'm gonna play some time crisis 3." at least for me there was (5 times to be exact).<br /><br />somebody has to tell kenan ivory, damon, marlon, shawn, damien (the only talented one), kim, rakeesha, george w., and osama bin wayans to stop making movies. its only hurting the o-zone layer.<br /><br />verdict 1/2* out of ****
