to sat how awful the shield is, you'd have to write pages and pages, so suffice it to say that it is a monument to bad directing.<br /><br />"when directors go awry" should have been the title of this production. indeed, directors are supposed to infuse their work with a sense of visual style and story-telling that propels the story forward.<br /><br />how is constantly shaking the camera and playing with the zoom lens a "style"? how is it propelling the story forward? of course there's also the "editing by random numbers" nonsense. apparently it's become hip to just cut randomly.<br /><br />i guess it's too much work to do good editing.<br /><br />well, that made it too much work for most people to watch the shield which languished as one of the most over-hyped and unwatched shows of all time.
