this whirling movie looks more like a combination of music-clips at mtv than as a real movie. there is no real story and as the movie goes on you ask yourself: "what is going to happen?"; but nothing happens. the story around eric cloeck, the frustrated writer, is the only good thing. the other persons seem to have nothing in common: then why bring them together in a movie. with music you can make watchable the worst movie. when i open the tap and there comes water out with the music of bach then most people will like to look at it but this is not a movie. the director should learn how to write a script for a movie of 100 minutes or more before starting to direct a movie.
