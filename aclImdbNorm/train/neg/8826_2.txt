this (extremely)low-budget movie is compared to the great classic "silent night deadly night", since it is labeled as a slasher flick. first let me say that i think that even "silent night part 2" is better than this (that one was filled with flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie). "christmas evil" tries to get psychological by introducing the main character as someone who goes insane,(a strong word), slowly (very slowly). he is irritated by people who do not get the true meaning of christmas and at work he can't stand how the fabricated toys are made with such lack of quality and love. dressed up as santa he finally goes on a killing spree. also a strong word, since only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects. no tension, no thrills, no gore, no cast. for one exception that is: jeffrey demunn is in it. he is best known for playing aside tom hanks as one of the guards in the classic "the green mile". he still must be kicking himself these days for ever accepting the role. he truly is the only one who really can act, his supporting role is better than the main lead. (who also isn't that bad, but if you're overshadowed by a little supporting character, you're not great either.). and what about that strange ending ? (you have to see it, to believe it). "christmas evil" is downright boring, nothing happens and the artwork is just misleading. this is not a slasher. you wanna see a real christmas slasher, check out the all time greatest: "silent night, deadly night".
