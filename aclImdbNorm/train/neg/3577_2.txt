this early pia zadora vehicle followed a familiar harold robbins formula: ambitious main character wallows in decadence while pursuing the path to the top of some randomly chosen but glamorous world, in this case the movie industry. but despite being so formulaic as to be completely predictable, this movie manages at the same time to be completely unbelievable. zadora (to call her inexperienced as an actress is to be charitable) never convinces as a screenwriter. one would expect a movie about movie-making to have some insights into its own industry and creative process. but the script gives her none of the qualities which make writers interesting movie characters: observance, skill with words, a love-hate relationship with one's own creative abilities. her character is as empty as a donut hole. and this is just a taste of the incompetence on display here. the cinematography is so murky that it is sometimes hard to see what is happening. and the scenes never really hang together, so everything seems like a succession of random moments at bad hollywood parties. avoid.
