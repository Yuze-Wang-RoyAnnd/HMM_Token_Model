this is the 2nd time i've seen this movie in about 12 years. these remarks come from someone who finds kane and ambersons to be amazing, worthy films. but the remainder of welles career is, unfortunately, squandered on material unworthy of his talent and too flimsy to withstand his filmic embroidering. and when he makes a potboiler like shanghai, the lack of anything substantial to hang his filmic tricks on, is just kind of sad. i couldn't tell you what he was exploring here. it's all as mannered as welle's godawful irish brogue; which takes a lot of effort, but adds absolutely zero to the film. several welles projects became this overdeveloped and baroque. mr arkadin (pick a version, any version) is a similarly belabored project. the material is inconsequential. it just can't bear the weight of all this noodling. for a director trafficking in reality-based drama (as here), he never feels any pull to tie his bundle of conceits back to reality; or to a coherent story. the murder-for-hire scheme is ridiculous. <br /><br />kudos to welles though, for having hayworth cut her hair, and getting that performance out of her. the camera loves her. she's the classiest, most upscale, sultry and ravishing femme fatale ever put on film. but her treachery comes so late in the film it feels like some desperate decision, made so the movie will have some genre it fits into. the movie can't be saved by a noir convention deployed in the last 60 seconds.<br /><br />when all is said and done in l.f.s., the convolutions are all for what?; to convince you you've seen something thoughtful? to give welles more to do? to make you roll your eyes? welles has no sensitivity to the scale of a story, or to telling a story directly. one wonders what shanghai has to say to anyone who isn't a crippled billionaire, arranging a quadruple-cross murder-for-hire scheme, or a fanboy in love with filmic conceits devoid of meaning or substance. <br /><br />overwrought, preposterous, unengaging.
