unfortunately, the realism is boring. this movie, i thought it would never end, would have been better if all the characters would have been nuked in the first five minutes. where's blade when you need him? while as dismal as combat shock, requiem for a dream and as nightmarish as boise moi, dead creatures isn't nearly as entertaining as any of the aforementioned bleak movies. while the gratuitous cannibalism might make the wannabe jeffery dalmers hearts race a little faster, it wasn't nearly as interesting as ravenous. really, i found it about as interesting as late-night infomercials, and as exciting as a trip to the dentist. if you have strong masochistic qualities, you might be able to endure this, otherwise, for no one. i was really surprised that this one wasn't made by the people at brain damage as that was the quality of dead creatures.
