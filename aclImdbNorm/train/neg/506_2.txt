(aka: the bloodsucker leads the dance)<br /><br />lots of naked babes in this one with a couple of lesbo scenes thrown in. the film is supposed to take place in ireland but it looks more like rome and the adriatic to me.<br /><br />gothic lesbians get invited to a count's island castle for the weekend. one by one they seem to be missing their heads due to a madperson running around.<br /><br />it's not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights even though candles are lit. go figure...(sic)<br /><br />dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for the eroticism and nudity. directed by euro horror actor alfredo rizzo, this is one snoozer.<br /><br />pretty boring 2 out of 10
