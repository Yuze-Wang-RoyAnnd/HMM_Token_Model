mike brady (michael garfield who had a minuscule part in the classic "the warriors") is the first person in the community to realize that there's murderous slugs in his small town. not just any slugs, mind you, but carnivorous killer bigger then normal, mutated by toxic waste slugs (who still only go as fast as a normal slug, which isn't that frightening, but i digress). no one will believe him at first, but they will. oh yes, they will.<br /><br />ok, killer slugs are right above psychotic sloths and right below johnathon winters as mork's baby in the creepiness factor. so the absurdness of it all is quite apparent from the get go. the flick is fun somewhat through and is of the 'so bad that it's good' variety. i appreciate that they spelled out that this was slugs: the movie as opposed to slugs: the children's game or slugs: the other white meat. probably not worthy of watching it more than once and promptly forgetting it except for playing a rather obscure trivia game. director juan piquer sim'on is more widely known for his previous films "pod people" (which mst3k deservedly mocked) and "peices" (which is quite possibly the funnest bad movie ever made) <br /><br />eye candy: kari rose shows t&a <br /><br />my grade: d+ <br /><br />dvd extras: merely a theatrical trailer for this movie
