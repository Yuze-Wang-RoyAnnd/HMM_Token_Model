i picked up this movie for $5 dollars at a discount book store, adam sandler is a awesome actor and i figured it would be a good movie, well, it wasn't. there was absolutely no story line at all, bad jokes, and the other comedian said "the f-word" every other word he said,cursing usually dosen't bother me but this was over the top. and even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when sandler would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie, it reminded me of dora the explorer when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions. and last of all is when they would randomly put in bikini shots of girls at random times in the movie. in my opinion, don't buy this movie, its a waste of money
