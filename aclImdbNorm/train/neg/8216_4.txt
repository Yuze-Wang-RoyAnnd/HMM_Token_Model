and maybe, as fred sandford used to say, "one across the lips". that to those who released this film on an unsuspecting public. and perhaps to the person in "rue morgue" who called this a "fender hellbender" and said it was good.<br /><br />five young girls, apparently taking a short-cut home from a high school football game, become lost and stop to ask directions at some small store in the middle of nowhere. while there the driver accidentally hits a parked suv & knocks out a headlight, but the girls all decide to just leave & not go find the driver. but the driver does come to find them, and it's not just that the headlight on her vehicle got dinged, it's for another reason that the girls do not yet understand. when the driver does first catch them she (yes, it's a she) brandishes a shot gun & makes them strip down, and keeps screaming at them, "how much did you see?". of course the girls are scared to death & don't know what she's talking about.<br /><br />as the night rolls on the girls end up in a cat and mouse game with the driver of the suv, who manages to inflict all manner of injuries on the girls, who are remarkably resilient to shot gun blasts and screwdrivers where they didn't want them. eventually they come to find that something happened back at that store after they left that is the reason for this woman's psychotic rage. and eventually they have a chance at revenge and take it about as far as they can go.<br /><br />there are elements of this film that are rather disturbing and scary, but unfortunately, those moments are undermined by bad acting, bad dialog, and huge lapses of credibility. one girl is hit by a shot gun blast and appears to be mortally wounded, and she's feeling cold, her life is passing before her eyes, but she got better? and how far can a mini-van run on an almost empty gas tank at speeds of 80 miles per hour? i need one of those things, it apparently gets great mileage.<br /><br />there should have been an ending when the girls got their revenge, but the film goes on for a bit after that, which is an anti-climax, but they at least learn some of what set the woman off, and the driver is still worried about "messing up her mom's van", which is obviously the least of anyone's worries.<br /><br />so this isn't the worst film i've seen, but it's too amateur to be good and yet a bit too scary and gruesome at times to be completely terrible. but it does take the cake for plenty of shrill hysterics and you'll want to put two across your ears if you watch this. which, by the way, i don't necessarily recommend. 4 out of 10.
