i am dumbfounded that i actually sat and watched this. i love independent films, horror films, and the whole zombie thing in general. but when you add ninga's, you've crossed a line that should never be crossed. i hope the people in this movie had a great time making it, then at least it wasn't a total waste. you'd never know by watching it though. script? are you kidding. acting? i think even the trees were faking. cinematography? well, there must've been a camera there. period. i don't think there was any actual planning involved in the making of this movie. such a total waste of time that i won't prolong it by commenting further.
