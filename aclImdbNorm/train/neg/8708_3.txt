like all carnosaur movies, this is a joke. the way the dinosaurs move, reminds me of when my sister plays with her dolls, because they cannot be any stiffer or more fake-looking than they were.<br /><br />the plot had no sense whatsoever. i mean, first they're on a bus, then in a warehouse then, all of a sudden, they're on a boat. and let's be serious, does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together on a van, or on a ship? i thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can fit on a moving van. it sounds stupid even when you think about it.<br /><br />the only reason for which i gave this a 3, is because it's still entertaining. i found it better than the first one (haven't watched the second yet). just, don't rent it. i saw it on tv and it's a good thing i did because i wouldn't have wanted to waste money renting it.
