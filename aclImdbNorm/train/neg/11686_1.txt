movie: there are some very interesting comments on imdb about this movie. its truly awful. not enough money is spent on the movie and the way spike lee has made it, it seems like a combination of an indie film and an action flick. characters/actors: denzel has done "exactly" what he does in every movie, so no surprise there. here is a little mind game for the readers. quickly think of 10 denzel movies. now count how many of them were in which he played a cop/detective/body guard, whatever. clive owen, hmmmmmm, this guy needs a better role on his plate soon. his best performance was i think in "beyond borders". other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well. his tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in "sin city". surely this guy knows acting, what he doesn't know is better way of choosing roles. he is in desperate need of a better agent. jodie foster was brilliant in the movie, if you are watching her for the first time in your life. she has done better. she has had better roles. it so happens in hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as jody foster did in this movie. plot: plot was not confusing, in fact, i could think of such a plot, in fact the whole movie, while taking a dump after a nice big chinese dinner. i mean come on, ****spoiler on the way----> i am sick of the un-necessary haulocast and the racism token. the movie is about bank robbers, why put the haulocast and the racism in there, nice try playing with people's emotions, worked on anyone? not me. police let the bank robbers go thinking they were hostages? riiiiiiight, please, we're talking about us police force and security here. nobody could find out where clive was, i mean they didn't find anything different with that room. who're we kidding? conclusion: sure, go watch this movie, if nothing, you'll have a nice time talking to you friends how bad the movie was. at least people won't think you're stupid to go watch this movie because they'd think you went to watch it because it has a big star cast "mistake".
