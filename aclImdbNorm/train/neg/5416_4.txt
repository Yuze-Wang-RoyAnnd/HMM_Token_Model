this was director von stroheim's third effort - it is quite crude and shows none of the exceptional flair for the camera and editing mastery he would display a few years later with his masterworks, greed and the wedding march. essentially we have a trio of grifters, masquerading as a russian count and two russian princesses who have rented a villa in monte carlo. their aim is to use counterfeit money at the gambling tables and win a fortune. part of that plan is for the count (von stroheim) to insinuate himself between a visiting american ambassador and his "foolish" wife, wooing her and hoping to gain some money by playing on her weaknesses. he makes the mistake of also taking the life savings of the maid, whom he has promised to marry. when she sees them together, she sets fire to the room, (von stroheim and his prey are on the room's balcony). here von stroheim first establishes his persona as "the man you love to hate." he is thoroughly bad and his character flaws eventually bring him to a very bad and deserved end. the film is crude in its cinematography and editing and not worth seeing unless you are fascinated by the director. there is a cute bit- when he first attempts to meet the ambassador's wife, she is reading a book - we see the title - foolish wives by erich von stroheim. this was originally envisioned as a 210 minute film, cut down to 140 minutes by the studio and finally released at 70 minutes. the restoration on kino video restores surviving footage (damaged in some way in most scenes) from the alternate earlier version to give us a 107 minute print.
