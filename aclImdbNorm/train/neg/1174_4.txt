eric rohmer's 'the lady and the duke' is based on the journals of an english aristocrat who lived through the french revolution. but it's a stilted affair, with its strange, painted backdrops and mannered conversational tone. most notably, this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action; one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie, and little of the chaos, poverty and terror that unfolded away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted, but spoilt, aristocratic classes. the result is frequently dull, and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction; it's a disappointing film from an acclaimed director.
