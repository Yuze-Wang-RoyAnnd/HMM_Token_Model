i am going to keep this short.this "adaption" of the wonderful king book is a bad joke and nothing more.of course there are many kubrick and nickolson fans in this site and,as a result,this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top-250.<br /><br />jack nicholson is laughable as torrance and so is shelley duvall.the story,that has nothing to do with the book,is an incoherent mess and the characters of jack and wendy torrance are complete jokes.<br /><br />my advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story:stick to the tv series ....<br /><br />oh ,and the people who are saying that kubrick had every right to destroy the king story cause king is...not a good writer should stick to reviewing "masterpieces" like "eyes wide shut".
