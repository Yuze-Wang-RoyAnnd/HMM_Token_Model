the sentinel represents everything about the soul-lessness of hollywood and the saddening lack of imagination present in so many movies these days. i cannot possibly think of one good thing about it, it's all so generic, so factory-made and so lazy assembled that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting, undeserving public.<br /><br />a plot about a secret service agent planning to assassinate the prez could well be entertaining. if handled by a good director or caring cast that is. douglas is the one who is framed. basinger is the first lady, with whom he is having an affair (an undeveloped, unresolved plot contrivance). sutherland is the best pal who believes his guilty because there would be no movie if he didn't. and longoria is nothing. a woman with a fortune of maybelline and...that's it. i guess there are less requirements for women when entering the secret service. as usual in a film like this the role of the prez himself is nothing more than a tool, a token and is very badly written.<br /><br />clark johnson's, he who gave us the equally as pathetic swat back in 2003, mechanical direction lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap tv-movie. douglas, basinger and sutherland look incredibly bored and phone-in their performances from afar. eva longoria, the most over-exposed woman of the 21st century, is basically only in this to attract to the desperate housewives audience. her role is 100% pointless and she does absolutely nothing to further the plot or add to character development. she barely has 2 lines to rub together. a truly shameless marketing ploy.<br /><br />if you're a glutton for punishment then don't let me stop you. but it is time and money you won't be getting back.
