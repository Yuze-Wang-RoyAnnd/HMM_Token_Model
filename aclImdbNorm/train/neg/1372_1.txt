saw this on tv. i'm glad i didn't go to the cinema to see this or spend the money on rental. the movie is totally predictable - from the corrupt owner and planner, to the snaking electric cables. the plot is really weak and unbelievable - the avalanche expert guy gets hit by a 20 foot wave of bone breaking avalanche (using actual footage) and all he has to do is get up and shake himself down. the avalanche thunders down at a million miles an hour and stops dead at the side of the road.<br /><br />some of the actual avalanche material is impressive and shows its devastating power. but the contract between the real avalanche and the staged stuff makes this film look even flimsier.<br /><br />do yourself a favour, don't bother with this one not even on t.v.
