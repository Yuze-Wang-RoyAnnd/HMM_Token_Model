this was awful. andie macdowell is a terrible actress. so wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job. but then remember that turn in four weddings, equally as excruciating. another film that portrays england as full of chocolate box cottages, and village greens. i mean that school, how many schools apart from maybe hogwarts look like that? the twee police station looked like the set from heartbeat ( a nauseating british series set in the 60s).this film just couldn't make its mind up what it wanted to be- a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women's friendships. if it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked( i say just). but those scenes just didn't work with the tragedy in the second half. i also find it implausible that kate would ever speak to molly again after her terrible behaviour. a final note- what is a decent actress like staunton doing in this pile of poo? not to mention anna chancellor. macdowell should stick to advertising wrinkle cream.
