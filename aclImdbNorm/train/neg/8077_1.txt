i saw this movie a long time ago... luckily it was for free. i have to be one of the maybe twenty people who saw this movie in the theater. i don't remember a whole bunch of it, but i do remember i was incredibly bored, the plot made no sense and when i came out of the theater the only thing i could say was at least now i know what the worst movie i ever saw was. i just was incredibly bothered by one thing: if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun low enough for humans to survive, why can't they turn it down to a comfortable temperature instead of being all hot and sweaty? how stupid do they think we are?
