do you guys wanna know a secret?. this movie sucks. well actually i don't know because if you allow yourself to be indulged by plagiarised versions of original movies, then perhaps you may find this movie astounding (this movie being a plagiarised copy of i know what you did last summer). the first 30 minutes of the movie is based on a typical story setting; a bunch of so-called cool teenagers relishing their vacation in florida and being themselves by behaving very much like the juveniles they are. the only insight we get at this point is the extent to which the director succeeded in illustrating a pretentious sense of adolescent decadence within the characters. the second half hour of the movie gains a little momentum and begins to illustrate a start to the no- where-near unprecedented killings. the third half hour of the movie will most definitely remain a mystery to me because i switched it off before i could further delude myself into thinking that the movie may still have something interesting and original left to show. as far as the story is concerned, it can easily be explained in a few lines. a bunch of teenagers go to florida on vacation. while they are busy partying, they slowly (and i mean slowly) begin to get killed because they know some sort of silly secret. the only thread to the killings is that all victims were matriculates of a common high school. one thing that did however amaze me about this movie, was how much betty (im not sure about her name..the blonde character) looks like reese witherspoon. another thing that amazed me about the movie was that it made me jump from my seat a few times. does that make it a work of art? absolutely not because my 12 year old niece made me drop a glass of orange juice because she "boo'ed" me when i was just about to go through the guest room door..whats the difference between the director and my 12 year old niece???? <br /><br />do you wanna know a secret??? i'm not sure about you guys, but i don't..
