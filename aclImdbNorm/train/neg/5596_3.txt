a group of models is seeking an apartment to live in, and are shown one by a local real estate agent. unknown to the models and the agent, however, is that "hell's threshold" is in the apartment and when crossed, the demon "dethman" is summoned to kill all those in his path. the story is told by sam bishop, a journalist who was accused of the murders.<br /><br />although i am a champion of low budget, microbudget, and independent films, i cannot praise this movie. the creators take pride in their 24-hour shooting schedule and at least one actor boasts on the dvd of his acting prowess, but i cannot wrap my head around this. why make a film in 24 hours if an extra one or two hours of editing would make all the difference? and why pride yourself on acting that is poor, nonsensical and results in the bad delivery of a handful of lines?<br /><br />through much of the film, the models are being shown parts of an apartment by a real estate agent. the dialog is clearly ad-libbed because no scriptwriter could come up with such empty diction. the agent, also, clearly knows nothing about housing... she focuses on aspects of a home that no one could care about, incorrectly explains the heat source (didn't she see the radiator?) and says the vermin problem will be solved when they call "the terminator". please, write a script -- some deviation is fine, but this was a mess.<br /><br />and why were the girls moving in models? their careers had no point in the plot, and this seems like a forced situation. at one point, an actress breaks character and says something to the effect of "dude, they're going to be (upset)" which sounded more natural than any other line, though out of place because of the other bad dialog.<br /><br />the demon made no sense. i appreciated the attempt to explain how "hell's threshold" jumps to random places on earth (including apartment fireplaces), but why not explain where the demon came from? his background involves a man whose love is killed by another man. how does this make you a demon? (also, why did we need all these victorian flashbacks with no dialog and glances across a field? it was overdone.)<br /><br />the dramatic pauses between lines was awful. the sam bishop character was by far the worst, with the interviewer not far behind. does every question require a pause, a funny face and a response... followed by a pause, a funny face and a response? i was so frustrated. to me, the only point was to drag the time out... but i'd rather have thirty minutes of good delivery than an hour of horrible delivery (and then more time is wasted by rolling through the same credits twice).<br /><br />who was the sam bishop character, anyway? allegedly he "saw" all this and was accused of killing the girls, but yet at no point was he ever in the part of the tale with the girls. so how did he see them? and if he didn't, how did he know dethman killed them? and if he didn't see dethman, how does he know dethman is the spirit of apostoles? i was so lost... was there even an outline for a plot when this was written? <br /><br />the only part i found enjoyable in this movie was a scene with one of the models in the bathroom. not that it was really important or anything, but it was the only break from boredom i was given. i wonder what director felix diaz was thinking. his music is very good (see the dvd behind the scenes for his impromptu playing), but i wonder about his movie making skills. although, by far the best part of the dvd was the trailer for his "superhero excelsior" (the trailer alone was better than this entire waste of time).<br /><br />i am sorry i have to be so harsh. i'd like to think that this movie was a test of what can be done in 24 hours or maybe just an experiment for fun and the idea was never to make a quality film. but if "superhero excelsior" is any indication, diaz can make quality... so why did he choose to avoid that here? perhaps the world will never know.
