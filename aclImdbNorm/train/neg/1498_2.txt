justifications for what happened to his movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors, drunks and receptionists doing script rewrites aside, let's just take this movie as it's offered, without extraneous explanations.<br /><br />this movie is god awful. straight up craptastic. rather than rehash what may serve as a plot, i'll run a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my head.<br /><br />a class (of 5) take a field trip for a history class to the middle of friggin' nowhere ireland. these students may be canadian or american, it's difficult to tell. that it was filmed in a canadian forest rather than ireland is rather obvious as well. one student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the "dumb jock" character from a number of kick ass 80's movie, except when he channels randy from scream. one character may be chris klein's stunt double. he has a girlfriend who probably gets killed, but it's never really established if that is true. one character is sullen and removed from her peers...just...cuz... and then there's a blonde girl. yay blonde girl.<br /><br />ireland has a population of 2. they're cousins. gary, who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast, is called "sir" more than once. he's very ominous and wears a knit cap. his cousin is a roughed up porn star with the worst irish accent to befoul film in my lifetime and most likely beyond.<br /><br />picturesque ireland features many canadian forests and swampy areas and 2 ducks which appear more than once in cut scenes.<br /><br />the producers got a discount on volume fake entrails. good for them.<br /><br />unbeknownst to me, horribly inbred freaks have access to brand spanking new hunting knives. perhaps there's some kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the register.<br /><br />also unbeknownst to me, if you inbreed for roughly 600 years, as the story leads us to believe happened, you end up being somewhat lumpy, yet amazingly spry and fairly strong. genetics are a wonderful game of craps.<br /><br />there may or may not be more than one freak in this film. reference is made to "them" and we see shadows, yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever. and when one odd looking dude is finally killed, apparently all danger is passed. i'm running with my initial assumption that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up, thus they just used the one. that's what it looks like on screen, anyway.<br /><br />richard grieco should be ashamed.<br /><br />also of note, aside from those shiny new knives, the inbred freaks have access to some posh leather gear, as once richard grieco cuts his bonds, there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied up...who also then escapes, because the chains give you enough slack to just undo them, making one wonder why they even bother tying anyone up.<br /><br />a dead body in a shack will be maggot-ridden after what i would guess is about 2 hours has passed. said dead body will also have glasses on, when no characters wore them. curious.<br /><br />jenna jameson appears for no reason from stage left, chats for 2 minutes, vanishes stage left. in the middle of a giant forest. that's not unusual, as gary can also pop out of nowhere, which is also known as whatever exists in tv land off the screen.<br /><br />ms. jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes vanish like my hopes that this movie wouldn't suck wind.<br /><br />i offer a special nod to the "breeder" character, the poor girl who has been used by the freaks for months (or maybe years) for breeding purposes. the poor girl who still has eye shadow on and emotes on camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua.<br /><br />the ending of this movie was clearly tacked on by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental disability that has been cultivated and encouraged with excessive gasoline drinking over the years.<br /><br />apparently this wasn't just random crap i found on the movie network late at night, apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through it's production. how sad for you all. i have nothing more to say. may god have mercy on us all.
