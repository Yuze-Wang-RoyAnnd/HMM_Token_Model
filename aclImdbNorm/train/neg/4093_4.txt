the plot and characters are ridiculous and barely qualify as "plot" and "character". the biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark, out-of-focus, and blurry. the fact that fulci filled the whole movie with mist doesn't help. on the other hand, the whole thing is completely bizarre and filled with sex and violence. the inconsistencies are pretty entertaining, one of the main characters says he has no friends, yet he latches onto the new guy in a minute of screen time, and has a whole gaggle of women on the side. though he does show his anti-social tendencies by randomly putting an arrow in some poor b*****d who's just minding his own business!images of blood or gore flowing get more attention than the characters but what do you want from fulci. maybe it ruined his career, but it wasn't really much more stupid than zombie. worth a rental if you like gory italian flicks or are desperate for sword and sorcery or something bizarre. how do you sleep through someone getting sucked into a pit 2 feet from your head and screaming for help?
