ok, i kinda like the idea of this movie. i'm in the age demographic, and i kinda identify with some of the stories. even the sometimes tacky and meaningless dialogue seems semi-realistic, and in a different movie would have been forgivable.<br /><br />i'm trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like the others did, but it's not that easy when the filmmakers weren't trying at all.<br /><br />the editing in this movie is terrible! possibly the worst editing i've ever seen in a movie! there are things that you don't have to go to film school to learn, leaning good editing is not one of them, but identifying a bad one is.<br /><br />also, the shot... oh my god the shots, just awful! i can't even go into the details, but we sometimes just see random things popping up, and that, in conjunction with the editing will give you the most painful film viewing experience.<br /><br />this movie being made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse also. i've seen short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity! joe, greta, i don't know what the heck you were thinking, but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both your egos. you should be ashamed of yourselves! in conclusion, this movie is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene. if that's not your kind of thing, avoid this at all cost!
