jason lee's pecks are back! if that's what you are looking for, look no further. if not, better move on...<br /><br />but about the movie. clich'es galore, some poorly shot but kinda exotic fight scenes (used jkd) and lots of bad acting & cheap effects. poor lee looks like he's in pain throughout the movie, and no wonder. not a pleasant comeback.<br /><br />the movie doesn't even cut it as a b-movie - sure, there was a germanish bleached blonde rutger-wannabe bad guy, but no gratuitous sex scene or even a single booty shots. none. zip. nada. even in starship troopers 2 they had the common sense to include the mandatory nudie scenes (as for rest of my comments on that excellent piece of classic cinema excellence, please refer to our upcoming review on that mind-blowing sequel...). i did get the feeling that the writer was taking his revenge on somebody with this - thus i won't get into the "plot" of the movie or pretty much anything else related. except that it did have some non-heterosexual overtones, so 'nuff said.<br /><br />however, this movie has one thing going for it - no jean-claude :)
