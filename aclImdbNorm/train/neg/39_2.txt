an actress making a movie in africa is kidnapped and taken into the jungle where she is held for ransom. the producer hires some one to go and bring her back. complicating everything are the cannibals in the jungle who worship a really ugly looking "god" who likes to eat naked women.<br /><br />this is a gory sleazy movie. there is copious amounts of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against nude people. its an exploitation film designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being, and if the movie wasn't so boring this film would be a classic. lets face it, despite the gore, the nasty sex and abuse,and the ugly monster this movie is a snoozer. the pacing is all off kilter and it puts you out. there are multiple plot lines that all seem to be happening separately from each other, even though its ultimately all one story. worst of all, almost no one says anything. most of the minimal dialog concerns the cruelty or one characters protestations that "i'll do what i want". its such a quiet and dull movie that if it weren't for the frequent screams of the victims i'd recommend this as a sleep aide.<br /><br />this is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep, or unless you need to see every euro-cannibal movie.<br /><br />(an aside. videoasia just released this as part of their terror tales series. their print is oddly letter-boxed which looks to be the result of taking their print from a japanese source (there is fogging) that was cropped to remove the subtitles. their print also has no opening titles)
