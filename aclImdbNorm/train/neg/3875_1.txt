i've seen a lot of stupid plotlines in my time, but this one is among the worst. after catching some disease in space, an astronaut comes back to earth and starts melting. he then goes on a rampage, killing people (how is beyond me; i just watch them, i can't explain them.) this is the kind of movie that shouldn't have been made in the first place.
