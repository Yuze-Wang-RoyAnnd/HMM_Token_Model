as much as i love rodney dangerfield, this was a terrible movie. the plot was kind of a holistic rip off of various movies, but unfortunately they forgot to rip off any good jokes. in addition it was annoying and boring and that's being kind. if you're looking for a good laugh, rent a copy of private parts.
