wow. i thought this might be insipid but it was even worse than i imagined! sometimes i like to watch a good "car-crash" movie: those that are so bad that you can't look away because you want to see how bad they can possibly get. this is really the only reason i could leave the television on - morbid fascination. it wasn't so much the acting, which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect from this cast, but the premise and the plot which never should have seen the light of day. the script, too, is groan-inducing. as for cinematography, did anyone else notice that they used a "curtains drawing" segue device, like in an old 50's tv show...but without irony? at first i thought they must be kidding but the movie takes itself too seriously to have used this in a tongue-in-cheek manner. don't even ask me about the score...the only high point is the final song, by morcheeba. i guess they wanted to leave people with something for their $8...glad i saw it on tv!!!!! just silly! i wonder if this is why timothy hutton has had trouble finding much work recently? i guess if you don't expect much, and want to watch a mindless thriller, it would be better than spending an evening clipping your toenails, which is why it merits a 2.
