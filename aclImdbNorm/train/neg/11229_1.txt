they made me watch this in school and it was terrible. the movie is outdated. the episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting.the teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experience.i have read that very few people who appear in this are actors, but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life.this accounts for cheesy acting very often. also, very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far-fetched. i don't like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them. though, it was written to be educational, funny, suspenseful, and hip, it ended up being boring, dry, far-fetched, and old. i hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it.
