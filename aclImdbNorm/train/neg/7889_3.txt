i just finished watching this movie. it wasn't ridiculously bad, but i'm really disappointed with it. i'm not really sure why someone would make a movie like this. it was marginally entertaining, but i feel like the people making it had a lot of disagreements on what they were making. monday, the writer was in charge; tuesday, the director; wednesday, the guy who gets the coffee; etc. it almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies, but only had the time and money to make one.<br /><br />someone else commented that the acting was really good, but i'd have to disagree. then again, if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming, perhaps they're better actors than i give them credit for.<br /><br />the back of the dvd gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery... something along the lines of a historical law and order or national treasure. it starts off like that, but then, out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the twilight zone, or... what was that other show that wasn't as good... a bad episode of the outer limits.<br /><br />my main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out. there's the evil guy with spiked white hair. there's the love interest, who, when she first appears, the wind actually blows through her hair. seriously. once you realize it's a christian movie, the end is also pretty easy to spot.<br /><br />the cinematography was poorly done, especially in the opening scenes - way to put your best foot forward. it wasn't atrocious for most of the movie, but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady, praying, arms up in a dark room while lightening is striking - the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the movie.
