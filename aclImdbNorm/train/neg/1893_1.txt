this movie got extremely silly when things started to happen. i couldn't care less about any of the characters; susan walters was so annoying, and the leading actor (forget his name) also got on my nerves. can't quite remember how it ended and so forth but the whole idea of aliens possessing human bodies and all just seemed stupid in this film, things didn't quite carry off. my dad told me it's s stupid movie...i should've listened to him.
