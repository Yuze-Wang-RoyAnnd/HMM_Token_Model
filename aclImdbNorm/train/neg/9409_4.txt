i liked this show! i think it was nothing with wrong with it! only that spidey don't punch anyone but only for that the show doesn't suck! some people only think this show is bad because of that. the story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like x-men, the punisher, daredevil and iron man! to bad sandman never appear but i kinda like it! best spidey show ever!! my favorite episodes are: 1. turning point 2. spider wars 3. the hobgoblin 4. the alien costume 5. mutant agenda<br /><br />but there are some episodes that was really really bad like: rocket racer and the spot which was embarrassing to watch. and i don't like morbius and hydro man. first of morbius suck plasma instead of blood and i don't like vampires. and it irritates me that he was almost the main villain in season 2. of course i have to mentioned hydro man! he was terrible! i rather see sandman! his last appearance was so terrible. and i don't like spidey as the man-spider!<br /><br />but i guess everything than this was bad!
