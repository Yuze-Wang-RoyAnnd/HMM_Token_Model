though the movie may have been "true" to lewis's book (in that the script was basically word-for-word, verbatim), it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this. the mythical creatures (unicorns, centaurs, griffins, ghouls, ghosts) are *drawn* in, and as in the previous review, the green-screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow. i nearly laughed to death when i saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth; i nearly cried when i heard the wolf's "howl--" a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could.<br /><br />all of the acting is tremendously forced, especially that of little lucy penvensie... i could only take so much indignation, desperation, and buck teeth in the (what felt like) fourteen hours of watching the movie. the actress who plays the white witch, in all her histrionics, seems that she'd be more at home on stage, where a booming voice, spread arms, and a valiant effort at something shakespearian would be more than welcome. <br /><br />the sets feel claustrophobic, whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors. indoors, it's as if bbc could only afford to spend $100 on constructing a set, and so it is very small, and all the characters are constantly huddled together. the white witch's castle is a run-down, rotting countryside english castle filled with styrofoam statues and bad lighting. when the penvensie children are wandering through the woods-- actually, *any* scene in the woods-- feels like they are simply wandering around in circles. <br /><br />the only thing that looks decent in the film is aslan, but you can bet that bbc probably blew the film's entire budget on building the mechanical feline. it looks great when it's standing still and before it starts speaking, but once it starts moving, you can't help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear-end in the lion suit. <br /><br />yes, if you are a hardcore narnia fan, you may want to see this version, simply because it preserves every word that lewis ever wrote-- but lewis was certainly no screenwriter, and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen. during the scene in which the children are at the beavers' and getting ready to flee from the wolves, mrs. beaver's incessant, "oh, just one more thing, dearies, and then we will be ready to go," punctuated by the children's simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of "no, mrs. beaver, please!" -- a scene of comic relief, so incongruous (they are supposed to be fleeing from imminent danger, not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not), detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have. in fact, the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these. <br /><br />i would recommend seeing the new narnia (disney 2005). the new movie, with updated effects, spectacular computer animation, great timing all around, and a gorgeous and scene- stealing white witch (who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician, as opposed to a shrieking banshee) captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of narnia without detracting the least bit from lewis's original vision (i think). lucy is a lot cuter (no buck teeth, yay!), as are the beavers (and realistically-sized), and bratty bbc edmund has nothing on the divine, desperately-hungry-for-acceptance-insecure-and- angsting-with-an-inferiority-complex edmund that the new disney version fronts. <br /><br />unless you're the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies, i would not recommend this film to anyone.
