this is the kind of movie which shows the paucity of french cinema when it comes to making thrillers.the director's desire to "sound american" is so glaring that you will not be fooled a minute,unless you have not seen a serial killer movie since "peeping tom".<br /><br />two male cops (or one and a half,more like,as you will see),horrible murders,a plot more complicated than complex.charles berling is not lucky with the genre(see the astoundlingly dumb "l'inconnu de strasbourg" a couple of years ago).the scenes with his pregnant wife -which are supposed to be a counterpart for the otherwise noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot-are among the worst ever filmed.add a steamy love scene between them and a gory autopsy to get a pg 12 and thus to attract the huge adolescent audience.a violent and absurd conclusion,followed by a silent epilogue who could make a nice commercial for the c^ote d'azur,it's really the silence of the lame.
