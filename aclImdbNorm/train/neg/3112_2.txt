let me start out by saying i will try not to put too many spoilers in this. normally i enjoy robin williams movies, however this gem was not one of them. it was billed as a suspenseful thriller. the night listener was anything but. to be blunt there were 6 people in the theater opening day, 2 walked out, for good reason. the movie was in my opinion poorly written and directed. the acting was alright but again there wasn't anything to work with. the movie is about a storyteller who reads a good book by a dying kid. however *insert spooky here* no one can verify the kids existence. so williams goes to wisconsin to try and find the author, however all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boys caretaker. there thats it, thats all. you wait for about an hour and a half and movie ends. it had as many thrills and chills as a dentist office visit. the homosexual undertones, or overtones had really nothing to do with the story, and the movie had a little profanity but it seemed to be thrown in there for absolutely no reason and made little sense. in conclusion i really can't write a decent review on this film because there was nothing to it, it was as captivating as watching paint dry. i gave it a 2 because the acting for what it was worth was alright and it wasn't directed by uwe boll.
