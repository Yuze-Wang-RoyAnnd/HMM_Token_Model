i have never posted a review before, but i had to do it for this film! this film is so bad, i found myself trying to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as kitsch or parody. but it isn't. it is truly, un-self-consciously bad. this is a serious attempt that flops gloriously. other reviewers have pointed out the film's many flaws, so i'll try not to repeat these, but i do urge you to see this film. throughout it i was either speechless, literally gasping with disbelief, or rolling on the floor in hysterics. i haven't had so much fun watching a film in years. in fact, i'm going to try to get all my friends to see it because it's the kind of movie that needs to be shared.<br /><br />my favorite parts: -- when arthur auditions to be a go-go boy (his dancing is unbelievable) -- the gratuitous nudity (the director/leading actor just had to get a nude shot in) -- the preacher's office with its cardboard and crayon rendition of christ -- of course, the famous wedding scene with the palm trees and the forgotten rings (what narrative function does this play?!?) -- the ex-wife's wrestling match with ben to get possession of her gun -- the detailed sequence wherein arthur kills the preacher; he apparently burns him up with this incredibly measly match -- yes, the gay religious-fanatic brother with his bleached hair and weho fashions -- and, my favorite, the use of joplin's "the entertainer" as the opening soundtrack and "pachebel's canon in d major" as the closing soundtrack! -- the list goes on and on -- a must see!!!
