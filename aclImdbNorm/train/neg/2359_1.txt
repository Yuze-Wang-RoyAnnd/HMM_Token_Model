it was supposed to be the last freddy movie (and it was for over 10 years)--you would think they would have tried to get a good movie done. but they turned out giving us the worst of the series (and that's saying a lot). the plot made no sense (i seriously can't remember it), all the main characters were idiots (you really wanted them dead) and freddy's wisecracks were even worse than usual. the only remotely good bit about this was a brief (and funny) cameo by johnny depp (the first "nightmare" movie was his first).<br /><br />also i originally saw it in a theatre were the last section (reaccounting freddy's childhood) was in 3-d. well--the 3-d was lousy--faded colors and the image going in and out of focus. also the three flying skulls which were supposed to be scary (i think) had the opposite reaction from my audience. everybody broke down laughing. looks even worse on tv in 2-d. pointless and stupid--very dull also. skip this one and see "freddy vs. jason" again.
