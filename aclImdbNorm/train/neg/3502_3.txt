sarah silverman is really the "flavor of the month" comic right now. is she really worth all the hype? yes and no. she is funny at times, sometimes hilariously so (her standup routine is actually quite interesting, though not always funny). other times, you're feeling cheated by the media for overhyping yet another performer. she is one of those really cute comedians that men especially flock to, saying that they dig her intelligence and wit. but if you corner them, most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her, and that's why they watch her. she reminds me of why many men flocked to margaret cho and janeane garofalo, even though neither of them are really "hot" now in terms of popularity. sarah doesn't drink or smoke (at least cigs), so she should be hot when she's 60, so her fans (especially the male ones) can rejoice.<br /><br />as for this show, it's very much like her comedy. when it works, it's hilarious. when it doesn't, it's full blown tedium and very, very boring. the aids episode here is the best one. it's consistently funny, and has some really good satire in it. brian poeshn's character has an unhealthy obsession with tab in one episode, and it's hilarious seeing him in a tab t-shirt. but they never really go anywhere with it, and it eventually wears out its welcome. sarah's character in the series is rather annoying, the gay couple (brian poeshn and some other guy) seems tacked on and never really does anything for the show as a whole, and the supporting players (including sarah's real life sister, laura, who doesn't look a thing like her) are ok. when the jokes hit, they're brilliant. when they don't, they're awful, and i mean really awful. there's also an obsession with coprophilia here (aka poop jokes), which seems to have replaced actual wit and intelligence in comedy today. so should you watch this show? if you have a crush on sarah, go for it. you can gaze at her and pretend she's yours. as for her show, it's ranges from good to absolute zero.
