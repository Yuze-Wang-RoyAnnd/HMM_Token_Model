coyote ugly might have been much more effective if the film-makers had made it an r-rated guilty pleasure/exploitation film (with plenty of nudity.) but since the pg-13 rating is what all the studios are wanting these days, we end up with a movie like this: a pg-13 "tease" flick that isn't allowed to go nowhere near as far as the movie should have gone.<br /><br />the script is go generic that it is easy to guess what plot point is going to occur 15 minutes before it actually happens. the acting is adequate, but the characters are so paper-thin that nothing could be done with them. there were also a lot of points where it seemed like i was watching a music-video rather than a movie.<br /><br />the film's only assets are the amazingly beautiful female leads. we get to see them in some extremely tight and pretty revealing outfits.....but only so much could be shown due to the pg-13 constraints. there's plenty of cleavage and toned, heaving bodies doing some well-choreographed dance numbers, but there's no nudity or sex to speak of. tyra banks (she keeps getting even more insanely beautiful with age) is also in the movie for a very small amount of time. sexy newcomer piper perabo is also very easy on the eyes (and she has a killer smile) and shows some genuine acting potential.<br /><br />the only people i could see this movie appealing to is pre-pubescent boys who aren't allowed to watch r-rated movies yet. that audience might get a lot out of it from a titillation aspect, but adult audiences will feel annoyed and cheated.<br /><br />rating: the movie-1 the women-10
