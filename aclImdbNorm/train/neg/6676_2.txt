i might not have been the biggest blair witch fan but nonetheless appreciated that effort, so i was looking forward to altered, especially after reading the superlatives thrown around in various imdb comments. "unique", "intelligent", "a future cult classic" and so on... you gotta wonder where people come up with that stuff to describe such a poor effort.<br /><br />because alas, altered is a poor, weak movie that fails to engage in any and every respect. the silliness is not funny. the horror and gore is not scary. and whatever "thinking" aspect some poor fellows saw in this movie were due to severe delusions because there's certainly nothing profound or smart about this mess.<br /><br />ok, so we know nothing stands out. is it at least bearable? is the experience worthwhile in any way? unfortunately, no. for starters, get very poor acting. it's not a stretch to say most b-movies these days feature better acting. the plot? boring and messy. dialogs? many amateurs actually do better.<br /><br />it's really the direction that puzzles. i did not expect major improvements over blair witch but at least small steps forward. instead, our director seems to have worsen over time, completely oblivious to previous experiences.<br /><br />if there is a major flaw in altered, it's the main set. a major part of the plot takes place in a single location, where the main characters are confined but s'anchez has failed to give the place any personality whatsoever. considering that in blair witch, the forest plays a major part and is as much a character (an antagonist, if you will) as the three students, you would think the director would realize the same thing was needed here. but no... this place has no personality whatsoever thanks to sloppy direction and no attention to details.<br /><br />there's nothing salvageable here. die hard fans of "blair witch" are better off following daniel myrick. although his output is far from being golden, it shows better structure than s'anchez and some lessons from blair witch are applied (unfortunately, in weak stories but still).
