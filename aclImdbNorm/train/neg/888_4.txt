this was a movie i could not wait to see! so i finally got it and i was pretty disappointed. for starters,the movie has so little said about new york,just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings,streets,bridges and cafes.it really doesn't stay focused on the new york magic.another thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this movie.i know that it is a remake,but it is not a french style remake! anyway,here you will notice elements that remind you of french movies,such as long and messy scenes,no or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style ! the story follows many lives ( too many for my taste) and they somehow seem connected in the end. i feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories. the movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyone's happy ending.so we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each.and there you have your 120 minutes ! if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you ! i give it 4 just because i love new york and i loved the cast !
