oh dear... as an englishman, and a small part welsh, a fan of anthony hopkins' work in the industry..... to date, i am truly disappointed. <br /><br />you see i am a nobody, who hoped for better. so my comments are as 'straw in the wind'. but, that's the point isn't it? - i have no axe to grind on the commercial value of a work. i, a full member of the great unwashed, go to see a movie to be transported to another place. to yes, suspend belief for a brief period. but not to enter a state of total disbelief.<br /><br />had this been by an unknown author and director, i would guess that this 'production' would have been castigated into oblivion. unfortunately, its not, and i was left wide eyed and confused. having seen some of the rave reviews given this work i am faintly worried....<br /><br />perhaps its that i try, without prejudice, to view each movie on its own merits. regardless of author, director, studio or even the notoriety of the content.<br /><br />my advice, as many before me: don't write and direct the same production. it is fraught with danger. movies need to be moderated to retain a semblance of credibility.<br /><br />as they say in school reports "could and can do better..."
