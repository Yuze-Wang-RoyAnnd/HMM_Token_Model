"white noise" had potential to be one of the most talked about movies since "the exorcist" i think. seeing as evp is supposedly true it really had an easy passage to be a feared true fact. not many movies come along that really instill fear into the minds of people. like i said this movie could have, but did not. the movie degraded itself to a low class pg-13 scary movie. nothing compared to "the ring" or "the sixth sense" by any means. someone really needs to just take charge in the horror movie industry and just make a movie that not only makes us think, but it makes us jump, scream, everything a horror movie should do. i'm honestly sick of the pg-13 horror genre, because its becoming a genre of its own. we need the old days back, the blood and gore days, the freddy kruger, the jason, the mike myers days. few movies can pull off a think about this mentality being so not scary. so why try to pull it off? a few good jumps in this movie amount to nothing but one of the stupidest endings in movie history with no resolution at all...don't waste your money on this movie.
