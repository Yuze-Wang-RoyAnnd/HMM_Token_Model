please humour me if you will, for a minute while i read you the back of the alley cat vhs box. it says that:<br /><br />in this part of the city every street is a dead end- on every corner something to buy- in every alley another way to die- to survive you're got to be the best- just like the alley cat. alley cat- this lady owns the night. on the streets where even the predators become victims she knows how to survive- cross her and you've run out of luck. alley cat- this animal is aroused.<br /><br />now isn't that one of the most pathetic blurbs you've ever heard in your life? whoever wrote that must be insane if they thought such a awful description could tempt us into viewing the video. yet unfortunately, whichever faceless individual was responsible for that tragic use of english was doing their job only too well.. the movie contained within the little plastic case is as bad as it sounds, and then some.<br /><br />karin mani plays the title role, and the script basically tells her during every given scene to either a) pout like a goldfish b) kick male butt or c) show off her feminine 'attributes'. no complaints about the latter, but in terms of the other two.. let's just say she isn't much of an actress, and is even less convincing as a martial arts expert. but even meryl streep with cynthia rothrock's body (what a scary thought) would fail to save this movie. the unfolding of the plot is boring beyond belief, as we get one ineptly directed fight sequence after enough, pausing only for hysterical courtroom shenanigans and the occasional gag-inducing love scene with the interestingly named robert torti. the camera-work also follows a similar path of shame, with far too many unneeded close-ups and continuity errors abound.<br /><br />the part that i think really sums this scum-bucket of a movie up is where our heroine is sexually assaulted, and finds herself testifying in front of a corrupt judge while her rich-kid rapist leers at her from the box. not only does he get off scot-free despite the overwhelming evidence against him, but she herself is then jailed for daring to protest about the verdict in front of his honour. behind bars, she then has a group shower, a lesbian crush, a couple of cat-fights and a nice, sweaty game of volleyball before being released on bail to continue her battle. this ten-minute section has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, and the screenplay grinds to a halt to encompass it. i can only imagine the producers wanted to add a bit more t&a to the mix, and came up with this needless sub-plot as a means to achieving that end.<br /><br />which kinds of begs the question, is this an exploitation film, or a serious drama? neither, is my response to that.. it isn't sleazy or camp enough to appeal to fans of troma-style cinema, and it certainly doesn't make the grade as an exploration of one woman's fight against the system.. purely because it is so appallingly made. so who on earth would want to see it? lunatics, i guess.. or imdb reviewers who stay up till 3pm and watch any old rubbish on the box while trying to get to sleep. sadly on this occasional i failed, and the horrors will stay with me for quite some time. don't make the same mistake i did. have a hot milk, or something.. 1/10
