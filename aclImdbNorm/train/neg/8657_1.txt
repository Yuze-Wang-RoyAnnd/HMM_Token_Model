now i myself am a lover of the b movie genre but this piece of trash insults me to no end. first of all the movie is starring lizzy mcguire's brother as the annoying little kid that goes looking for his lost 3 legged dog. now please what kind of dumb ass mistakes a three-legged dog for a god damn mutated crocodile please i ask you? and heres another point for pondering, why do they show the dinocroc on the back of the movie box being enormous and actually in the water? i believe if memory serves the thing spent about 2.6 minutes in the water and was just shy of 6 feet tall, that was a heart breaker. but redeeming qualities to this movie were that it was so bad that i almost died laughing because believe me the bad acting made me wish for death. but the fact remains that once again this thing is created by another military testing site to train super crocodiles for military combat or something like that from the source of all things evil e.v.i.l corporation. and let's not forget the characters let's see we have jerk off #1 as the male lead and half way decent chick (who doesn't know how to act) as the female lead to that i say wow! the only thing worse then the acting was the end of course the heroes spend about what seems like 2 hours talking and planning some long elaborate way of killing the dinocroc only to have it fail and kill it in an ordinary way that could have taken about 15 seconds to come up with. all in all this movie was beyond gay with its random opera music in the background and the fact that it was probably the gayest of all cgi monsters ever made along with the fact it of course was impervious to bullets and bombs (otherwise it wouldn't have been made for the military duh!). by far the best scene was when lizzy mcguire's brother runs into the shack and the dinocroc eats him causing his head to pop clean off with a popping noise i might add. i believe that you would be better off shooting yourself between the eyes then to watch dinocroc. and as for the director i believe that we should get a bunch of people to hang him by a noose and all take turns kicking him in the crotch for wasting an hour and a half of our lives until he finally dies and then i can go on living.
