in light of the recent and quite good batman the brave and the bold, now is the time to bear a fatal blow to that mistake in the life of batman. being a huge fan since the first revival by tim burton 20 years ago, i have been able to accept different tonalities in the character, dark or campy. this one is just not credible : too many effects, poor intrigues and so few questions. what is great about batman is the diversity of his skills and aspects of his personality : detective, crime-fighter, playboy, philanthropist etc. the batman shows him only in his karate days. and by the way, how come the penguin is capable of such virtuosity when jumping in the air regardless of his portly corpulence ? and look at the joker, a mixture of blanka in street fighter 2 and a stereotypical reggae man, what batman fan could accept such a treason ? not me anyway. batman is much better without "the" article in front of his name.
