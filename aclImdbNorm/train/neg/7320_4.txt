a bondage, humiliation, s&m show, and not much else. the plot is flat, really just a banal setup for the stylishly depraved set-pieces. the host of the aforementioned show, a silly little man who spouts drivel while prancing around the stage in dresses, was almost as painfully distracting as the attempts at artful editing. the dream-like ending felt tacked on. to the film's credit though, aya sugimoto was fairly convincing as the tortured lead. flower and snake has been compared with eyes wide shut but aside from some minor surface similarities, kubrick's is easily the more layered, artistic, and atmospheric picture.
