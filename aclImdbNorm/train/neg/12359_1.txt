i thought this was a truly awful film--i found myself actually yelling at my tv a couple times. one or both of the gay male leads was miscast; there was absolutely no chemistry between them and richard ruccolo looked like he'd rather be kissing a dog. the movie covers their long and tortured courtship, highlighting each break-up and make-up, but not developing the reasons in-between in any detail. these reasons would make for some interesting characters, not the fight or the make-up scene in bed (lame even if you liked the movie).<br /><br />andrea martin and adam goldberg shine as their characters, but it doesn't make the film worth renting. save your money.
