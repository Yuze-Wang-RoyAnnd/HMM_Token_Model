knowing enki bilal's comics for quite some time, i had to see this movie. i have thought this would be a good way for the artist as bilal to spread his art and ideas to wider audience. i have also thought this would be a good movie to recommend, and i thought i will enjoy watching it... i was wrong! the movie was a true torture to watch. the idea has potential... but, movie leaves way too much to be desired, and basically everyone who sees this movie is left with impression that he could do it better. i will not make suggestion whether you should see this movie or not. chances are if you're reading these pages that you have already seen it, or that you're gonna see it - but be prepared for very bad 102 minutes.
