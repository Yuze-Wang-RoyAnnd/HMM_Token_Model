this movie was the most horrible movie watching experience i have ever had to endure, and what is worse is the fact that i had to watch it, and didn't have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school! admittedly, the storyline was decent...but i found the acting terrible! the exception was marianne jean-baptiste, i thought her performance was wonderful. she was the only highlight, without her, i doubt i would have been able to bear watching the film. every time i hear somebody say "daarling" i cringe! i nearly attacked a customer the other day because they said "it". it made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life!<br /><br />(i apologise if this has offended anybody, i am only expressing my opinion)
