james gandolfini is a good actor so what ever did he take a role in this piece of unfunny rubbish. affleck is just a lightweight who just can't cut it, the rest of the cast are truly unforgettable. i saw this in the usa in an empty theatre, i soon knew why the place was empty after about 10 minutes. i walked out before the end it was so bad, so imagine my surprise when back in england i saw the movie had a glowing report from that yoyo "paul ross" in one of the down market sundays. i always rely on ross to save me money on cinema tickets, if he says the movie is good, i get straight on this very website to check it out. this movie should have gone straight to lb1.99 dvd in a supermarket near you.
