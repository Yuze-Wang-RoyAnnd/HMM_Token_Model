alright, friends, a serious movie buff is expected to watch all kinds of movie, the bad as well as the good, and this movie put me to the test. i won't mince words. this movie was bad. the story was bad. the acting was bad. the always wonderful sissy spacek did nothing to make this movie better. indeed i asked myself why did i even bother to see this rotten trashy movie? why did i waste my time and money on something that i suspected would be bad? the answer is, of course, that i am a movie buff and therefore cannot avoid what otherwise should be avoided. i will not waste your time explaining what exactly was wrong with this amateurish movie, except to say that the quality of the acting was, to put it politely, subpaar. a serious movie buff may want to take on the responsibility of watching this movie. otherwise. stay home, don't waste your time, read a book, take take of chores or have yourself a good sandwich.
