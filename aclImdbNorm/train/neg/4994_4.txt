good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in a certain way, but sometimes you're not in the mood for that. <br /><br />i wanted something simple, no thinking just plain action when i watched this one. it started of good and was quite entertaining, so why a bad review. well in the end the movie lost it's credibility. the storyline wasn't that cheesy at all, the action was not too special but overall good, acting was ok, so more than enough to satisfy my needs. but all got ruined because things happened that were over the top, and it left me with a bad feeling. they should have put a little more effort in making everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the "no thinking just plain action" category. so in conclusion if you know you'll get irritated because things are happening that seem completely illogical: don't watch! otherwise i'd say go ahead...
