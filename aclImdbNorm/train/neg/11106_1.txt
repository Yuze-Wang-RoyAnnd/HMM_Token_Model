i have heard a lot about this film, with people writing me telling me i should see it, as i am a fan of extremely bloody, gory movies. i got my hands on it almost right away, but one thing or another always kept me from watching it- until now. i would have been better off not remembering i even had it.<br /><br />this movie was atrocious. the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was. i know it was a story by clive barker and all, and no i have not read that story- but it appears to me that if you haven't then you will be, as i was, completely clueless and utterly disappointed.<br /><br />the film begins good enough- the actors are convincing, the story interesting. the first scene is bloody- a great way to catch your attention. i thought the blood looked a bit bad, but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on. i was wrong. <br /><br />the blood and effects are so horrible, it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that, for instance, someone could knock a person's head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer. wtf? cgi blood (did they even use any "real" blood at all? my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film!), unbelievable acts of dismemberment (eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head; arms cut neatly off- does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies?!), too-dark scenes (every scene is either an odd yellow color, or in hidden in shadows)...it just gets worse and worse. i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake. there's just too much. add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial-killer movie turns into some demonic/supernatural/monster movie at the end...no thank you! it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway- ok, with a conspiracy theory thrown in- and an overzealous photographer. maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant? plausible, doable...and a lot better i think than the "real" story. that could have and should have worked. instead it became a "creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you, and unless you read the book, well...you just won't ever understand it" fiasco. tragic, what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential. if you like mindless fake blood and gore, you'll love this. but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it. stay away- far, far away.
