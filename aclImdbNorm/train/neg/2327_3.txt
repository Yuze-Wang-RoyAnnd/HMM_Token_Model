this motion picture comes straight out of the dark dungeon of full moon entertainment. this production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the 90's by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movies. the most famous disasters in their ouvre are "subspecies", "seedpeople" and "trancers". none of these are recommended and neither is doctor mordrid, actually. hyperactive director charles band did come to the right company for his film. doctor mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely humourless. i only saw it because it stars jeffrey combs. i learned that it can have several disadvantages if you're a fan of him. for every good movie, it seems like he has made 5 inferior ones. anyways, the story is about the battle between 2 ancient sorcerers. one good one who's here since 150 years to protect the humans ( jeffrey as dr.mordrid ) and one wicked one called kabal. he wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason i already forgot. combs gets his instructions from mentor. that "guy" only exists of a pair of eyes in space. very very cheesy, that is ! every once and a while a blinding lightflash is shown on the screen but that's about the only form of special effects this movie has got. the whole thing is just a piece of whining and nagging and when the two wizards finally face each other, it's over before you know it...i would have expected for the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little, but nooooooo.... in some scenes, you really can detect some originality and creativity ( like for example jeffrey's lecture about the influence of the moon on criminals ) and if you really pay attention, you might even find some very small but nice aspects ( like the raven which is called edgar allen) but overall, it's a terrible waste of time and energy. i'm a big fan of jeffrey and maybe he is a superhero in my eyes...but he sure doesn't have to put on a stupid maillot for that.
