would anyone really watch this rubbish if it didn't contain little children running around nude? from a cinematic point of view it is probably one of the worst films i have encountered absolutely dire. some perv woke up one day and thought i will make a film with little girls in and call it art, stick them in countryside and there isn't any need for a story or explanation of how they got there or why they don't appear to live anywhere or have parents because p*rn films don't need anything like that. i would comment on the rest of the film but i haven't ticked spoilers so i will just say avoid, avoid avoid and find yourself a proper film to watch
