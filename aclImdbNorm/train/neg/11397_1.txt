this was truly dreadful! it had a terrible storyline, was poorly acted, and was like an amateur remake of evil dead but not nearly as good.<br /><br />it took all my tenacity to make it through this one, it's a good job i didn't have to visit the toilet else i doubt i would have come back! this one makes hammer house of horror look like a big screen hollywood epic. <br /><br />the only value to this movie was the never ending supply of beautiful women. not a bad one among them! <br /><br />if you want to letch with your friends after a night on the beer then this one's for you ... else avoid it like the plague!
