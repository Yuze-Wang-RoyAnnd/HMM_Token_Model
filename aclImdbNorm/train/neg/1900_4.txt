randall "memphis" raines is a retired master car thief who is forced back into the "game" when his younger brother faces death for not filling an order for british crime boss raymond calitri. the job involves "lifting" 50 cars in 24 hours or calitri will enact his punishment. so raines quickly assembles a crew he can trust and sets about the task to hand. but the police are on to him and some of the cars on the list are not easy takes. it would seem a near impossible job to complete.<br /><br />it's got quite a cast has gone in 60 seconds, nicolas cage, angelina jolie, robert duvall, will patton, delroy lindo, vinnie jones, giovanni ribisi, christopher ecclestone, scott caan & timothy olyphant. all of whom deserve better. enough acting horsepower there to propel a porsche 998 turbo. trouble is, is that this is very much a case of too many cars overstocking the car park, mucho characters, not enough zest. from the off we are in no doubt that this is a bruckheimer/simpson production, bonkers script laced with loud noises and lashings of cheese, scattergun editing, and directed with sledgehammer subtly by dominic sena. it's essentially a big budget remake of h.b. halicki's 1974 indie movie of the same name, with the premise offering up the potential for an adrenalin fuelled car based movie. potential that sadly is never realised. there's one or two high impact moments, daft for sure, but enjoyable none the less. but if you pardon the pun, the film never gets out of first gear, it's more content to labour with its ream of characters who mope about trying to make the boorish screenplay {scott rosenberg} work.<br /><br />car fans will get something from it {the cars are ace on the eye}, as will fans of unintentional comedy movies {check out ecclestone's carpenter grief moment}. but no, it's really rather poor all told. 4/10
