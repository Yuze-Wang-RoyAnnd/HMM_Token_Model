i really disliked this movie....mainly because of the main characters! they are both immature, selfish, and self-centered people. they hurt everybody around them playing their silly game. the visual effects were good but what good are they if there are no characters that you connect with or a story line that is interesting. am i supposed to be happy when these two psycho people finally consummate their love for each other? <br /><br />after watching this movie i was thinking "this is supposed be the #1 smash from france?"........<br /><br />*spoiler* <br /><br />as for the end: good riddance! they both deserve each other! <br /><br />
