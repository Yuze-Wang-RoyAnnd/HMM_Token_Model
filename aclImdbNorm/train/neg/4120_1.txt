absolutely horrific film. ameteurish and it isn't funny at all. lead character played by mehmet ali erbil is very annoying. edits by e.t and star wars is just plain stupid.<br /><br />actor yilmaz goksal is the only good think about this movie. he should master his english and move to hollywood. hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities. other than goksal this movie is a garbage.<br /><br />director gani mujde is a comic writer and this movie is his worst written work to this date.<br /><br />music of cem karaca is another plus of this waste of money. actor sumer tilmac also have some presence. actor who plays the three sons has no talent what so ever.
