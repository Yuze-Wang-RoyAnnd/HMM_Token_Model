horrible, horrible tv show! why comedy central decided to repeat old episodes of this program is beyond me. it really sucks! i am, of course, speaking about the seasons after the first two. the first two seasons were golden, and if i was exclusively talking about those seasons, this show would have gotten eight out of ten stars. none of the comedians appearing after the first two seasons who were not part of the original cast are any good. they were, and are, awful. the comedy is not funny at all. at all!!! <br /><br />the original cast was full of very talented comedians, like artie lange, phil lamarr, and mary schorr (or whatever her name is), all of whom should have gotten better deals after they left mad tv. this show is highly overrated, and less worthy of your channel surfing time than saturday night live, another horrible show. go out on saturday night and have fun, and leave mad tv to wither and die, as it deserves to.
