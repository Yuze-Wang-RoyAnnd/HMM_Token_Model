this film is a twisted nonsense of a movie, set in japan about a dysfunctional family who end up with a strange violent guest who just sits back and watches the 4 members of the family at their worst. nothing is sacred in this movie, with sex drugs and violence stretched to such a limit i'm surprised it got past the censors.<br /><br />overall, i think it will appeal only to those whom we shouldn't be encouraging, rather than any supposed underlying message coming out for the rest of us to consider. a film that panders to the worst element in society and is in anyway utter gash... a disappointment from a man who made the sublime dead or alive and audition movies.
