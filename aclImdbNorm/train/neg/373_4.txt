blank check is a movie that i saw on tv one day and like most movies they air on tv blank check wasn't that good. first of all no one i have ever met has seen blank check and that includes people that grew up in the 90s. also blank check won't be remembered in the 00s either simply due to the fact that it will be overshadowed by pixar's films. i wouldn't call blank check a bad film but its not really entertaining either. (or at least it isn't to anyone over the age of 6) blank check isn't a entertaining film because nothing about it is original. everything just makes you go "what haven't i seen this before?" blank check rips off and tries to cash in on everything from richie rich to home alone (which strangely enough both have macaulay culkin in it) blank check isn't a bad movie, but it deserves to fade into obscurity.
