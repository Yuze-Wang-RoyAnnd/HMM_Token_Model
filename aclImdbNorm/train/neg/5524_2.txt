i disliked this movie for numerous reasons. within the first ten minutes of the film, i grew extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to salvage itself, for me at least, that it was going to have to pull itself out of the enormous hole it had dug. unfortunately, that did not occur. the two draws of the movie for me were to see jane fonda and felicity huffman. i don't know enough about lindsey lohan's work to have been interested in what she would bring to the film. afterward, i just felt disappointed in and for all three of them even though there were "moments" in each of their performances. i imagine that for each of them to find their "moments" was a very difficult task given the fact that there was an amazing lack of character development and uninspired dialog. although the plot is an interesting one, the movie on the whole is so poorly written, directed and edited that anybody's performance as an actor would suffer and be tainted by it. the disrespectful way in which it dealt with sexual abuse and the trite and insulting viewpoint of small-town america, i think, were the two main reasons why this film failed in hitting it's mark. as one reviewer has noted and i would agree, the movie is almost impossible to market given it's finished form. i suspect that, or at least hope that (for the actor's sakes anyway) there are some real gems on the cutting room floor. sad for us but if that's true then the actors can take solace in that and feel somewhat good about lending their talents and time to such a flop. oh yeah and another thing...i wished for just once i could go see an american movie which included the sadly disappearing but wonderfully bucolic settings such as the one in this film where the main characters weren't absentmindedly and/or disrespectfully littering the country side with pop cans, smashed cds and, other such trash!
