at first look of the plot tagline i figured it could have been a decent film. could i have ever been more wrong? the beginning of the film makes it look like a bunch of freaks got together and decided to make a low budget film. for the first 10 minutes you don't notice the cheesy acting, horrible sound and god-awful special effects, but then it gets worse. just about 20 minutes into it i was asking myself, "what was the plot again?" i could only ask that question when i wasn't busted out laughing from the sheer lameness of this film. the main actor has one setting for emotions and he sticks to it throughout the entire film, even though he was supposed to go through love and hate and everything in-between. the flashback scene almost made me vomit because it made me re-live one extra minute of footage from earlier in the movie. now we hit the middle of the film where they are obviously trying to rip off morpheus from "the matrix," although he is doing just a horrible job. the actor's talking about "star wars" and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable. now at the end of the movie you don't realize that it's the end of the movie because you actually think the plot is finally developing. the "morpheus" character dies, the only good thing about the movie. he utters a couple words and the credits roll. what is this? no plot, bad acting, cheesy everything, it couldn't get any worse. please, if you value human decency, do not watch this movie!
