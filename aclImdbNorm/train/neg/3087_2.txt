a group of extremely unlikable a-holes are tormented by lame puppets that some elderly douche bag night-watchman has kept locked away in a film vault for twenty years for no reason whatsoever.<br /><br />many people know this film merely from mst3k's spot-on ribbing of the flick. but i've seen the actual movie and can safely say that yes it's bad, really, really bad. from the one of the most awful 'fight' scenes i've ever witnessed to the stuffed toy 'aliens' that suffer from a lack of motion (i had a my pet monster that was scarier) right up to the atrocious acting (i had a my pet monster that was more charismatic) however, that being said rick sloan's "vice academy" films are somehow, and trust me i have no earthly idea how, much worse. that's not to suggest that this film is anything but crap, because it isn't. just throwing it out there.<br /><br />eye candy: no nudity in the movie proper, but there's 2 pairs of tits in the dvd introduction to the film <br /><br />my grade: d- <br /><br />retromedia dvd extras: introduction by jim wynorski; stills gallery; and trailer for this film
