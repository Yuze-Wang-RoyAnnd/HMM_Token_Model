this had high intellectual pretensions.the main lead intends to give a "deep" "meaningful" rendering(with voice over for his frames of mind naturally) and he was certainly influenced by the fifties/sixties "method " -which,when the script and the direction were worthwhile did give stunning results (see clift,newman,winters).but here the story is abysmal.besides it moves too slow,you could edit at least 20 minutes -including pointless flashbacks-and the plot line would not be changed .at times ,it's very doubtful that bruce dern believes in his "uncle "character and his portraying often verges on parody.an interesting side is only skimmed over:the relationship young boy/hero -if we admit that the hero is himself some kind of child- when he says to the young kid that he would let nobody do harm to him,some welcome tenderness emerges.but it's botched and only the final scene returns to it.<br /><br />word to the wise:take foley's "at close range" instead:it has two great actors (christopher walken and sean penn together!),it's also an offbeat movie ,but it's gripping,suspenseful.here my hitchcockometer points sullenly towards zero throughout.
