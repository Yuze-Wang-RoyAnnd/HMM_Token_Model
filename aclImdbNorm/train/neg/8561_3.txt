the cowboys could leave you a little sore in the saddle. definitely not one of johns best movies. don't get me wrong, with any john wayne move there is always some good spots. and this one has it's fair share. but over all the picture moves slow and just doesn't live up to the aspirations it could have been. bruce dern again does an outstanding job as the villain. roscoe lee brown is another bright spot in the movie. the kids in the movie were average but could have been cast better. this would be a good movie for the eight to fifteen year old movie goers.<br /><br />this would be a good family move to watch with your children. just be aware, there is a couple of scenes that you may want to take a look at before you let the young ones see it. but most kids that i know who have seen the movie like it. maybe it's because they get to see kids their age do all the grown up work.
