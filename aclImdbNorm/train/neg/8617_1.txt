having watched 10 minutes of this movie i was bewildered, having watched 30 minutes my toes were curling - i simply couldn't believe it: the movie is really awful. in fact it is so awful, that i had to watch all of it just to be convinced(!). during this, i came to realize that it reminded me of a bunch of danish so-called comedies from the 60's and 70's. the pattern is as follows: take one extremely popular comedian, make a script putting this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible, add a bunch of jokes (especially one-liners), and spice it up with a couple of beautiful young girls - film that, and you have a success! i wouldn't know if this movie was a success, but unlike the danish tradition which died quietly (with a few great comedians) it seems that there is a market for this kind of movie in the us.
