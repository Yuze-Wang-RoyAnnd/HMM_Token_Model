anyone who loved the two classic novels by edward ormondroyd will be disappointed in this film. all the magic and romance have been modernized out of his original story of a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old lady, and given "three" in return. three what? not three wishes, but three rides into the 1800's on a rickety elevator...<br /><br />the first novel is time at the top. the second is all in good time.
