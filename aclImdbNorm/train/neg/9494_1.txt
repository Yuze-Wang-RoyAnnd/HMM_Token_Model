the only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by clint eastwood, whose work i admire immensely. the leads had absolutely no chemistry. not for a second could i believe that there was anything deeper than lust between them. the story just didn't ring true. add to that stilted conversation, tons of stereotypes, and an incredibly slow plot that basically leads nowhere, and you've got yourself a real stinker. kay lenz's nude scenes might be worthwhile for those seeking some salacious fare, but otherwise this is a colossal waste of time. my thoughts as i watched the movie was that itwould have been better titled "cheesy."
