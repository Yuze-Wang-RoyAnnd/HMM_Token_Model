really, truly, abysmally, garishly, awful. but actor clayton moore (the movie lone ranger) acquits himself competently as an actor. he's the only one.<br /><br />a rare treat, for five minutes, if you want to plumb the depths of grotesquely transparent special effects, southern california as "the moon" (again and again and again), and acting so woodenly inept that it may be a spoof . . . except that it's clear that it isn't--no humor here, except unintentionally.<br /><br />the dialogue may be worse than any of these other aspects, and the costumes . . . well, enough said. plot? what plot? bad guy (well, head bad guy) and his henchmen, including his earthly agent called krog (listen carefully or you'll suspect it's a spoof on the name of mcdonald's founder ray kroc)and his unbelievably inept gunsels (who, however, have handguns that never need reloading; as does commando cody, so there are numerous firefight standoffs).<br /><br />enjoy.
