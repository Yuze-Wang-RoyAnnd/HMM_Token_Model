i didn't really like this movie that much at all. it wasn't really funny and in some cases it was just downright stupid. rob schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his acting was fine in this, it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in. i mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but that's about it. the only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and i'm not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found. all in all it was a couple notches below an average movie!<br /><br />final query:<br /><br />theaters: so glad i didn't squander too much money on this.<br /><br />dvd purchase: ummm, let me think....no!<br /><br />rental: if you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not.
