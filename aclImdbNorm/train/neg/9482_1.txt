don't even waste your time, let alone pay rental for this piece of dreck! how it got made is beyond me. (i don't know why there's a minimum of 10 lines... i've already summarized this trashy movie, but, oh well...) the acting was awful, like they all needed lessons. the plot was weak, the ending... feh! i think the cinematography was the only thing that didn't totally suck... well, maybe the sound was minimalistically ok. the one good thing is, if they could make this movie, even make some money with it, there may be hope for any screenwriter with a real idea. so, you-all take heart! i guess the same holds true of actors... if these people actually got paid, then you can, too!
