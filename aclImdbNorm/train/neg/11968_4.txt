this is just typical bruce willis, action movie schtick. watch it with some popcorn and your buddies. rent it, to save money.<br /><br />none of it is realistic. the battles aren't realistic. the soldiers aren't realistic. the victims aren't realistic. and why was tom skerritt's character talking to willis from the deck of the carrier? what's up with that? he can't do that from inside the ship?<br /><br />of course, bruce w. gets a machete wound. there's a bunch of average explosions.<br /><br />if this movie accurately represents the navy seals, then don't get stuck in africa expecting them to come rescue you!<br /><br />the noble attack on the village bothered me the most. "front row seats to an ethnic cleansing"...as bruce looks at the slaughter going on in town. so what does he do? he crawls into town on his belly. yep. how many died while they were putzing around? oh well...a body count was needed, i guess.<br /><br />and if that one african guy was so important, why didn't he get on the chopper with the elderly and children? can he say "duh?" <br /><br />finally, the movie was very dark. not just in plot, but so much happens at night it was difficult to make out what was going on.<br /><br />rent it.
