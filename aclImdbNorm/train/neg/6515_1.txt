this is not a boring movie, the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this selfish character, miles berkowitz, both film-maker and actor here. the storyline is simple : after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian non-career, the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera. the first question is about how true is all that : what is written, what came by chance ? both answers, "yes" or "no" portrays m.berkowitz as a low average human beeing. if you look for a self-fiction about love like this one, i recommand you to read some independant comic books : chester brown, joe matt...<br /><br />beside of this, i felt quite disappointed to hear so much against my country, france. i know american people usually say that the french are arrogant (that might be true then), etc., and for sure the french (and the whole world) have lots of griefs against america, but why so much hate ? don't think i couldn't like this movie only because of that anyhow.
