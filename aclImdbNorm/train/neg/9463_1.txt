mean spirited, and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever. mike myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what jim carrey did but he should give up acting all together. he is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film. the sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor. i have seen a lot of bad film this year, but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made.
