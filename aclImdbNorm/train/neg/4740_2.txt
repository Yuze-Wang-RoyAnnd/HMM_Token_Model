i am so insulted by this movie, it's not even funny... and i thought "mulan" was unbelievable! however low my expectations of disney have become, i never figured they'd do something so stereotypical yet so off. there is no respect here for any true chinese culture, just the hollywood tradition of random martial arts.<br /><br />i appreciate that they tried to make wendy into a normal teenage girl... but, fortunately, most normal teenage girls--particularly asian teenage girls--are much less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life. and from a cultural stand point, it's almost impossible. yes, there are girls who are wrapped up in popularity and fashion, but they're pretty rare. and even the ones who are are still fairly decent scholars. another stereotype, maybe, but a fairly true one. because that's how chinese parents work. that's how chinese values work. if they wanted to go for authenticity, they would've made wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love-hate relationship with her family.<br /><br />this just adds to my frustration with american movies. asian culture isn't about meditation and vague, nature-oriented phrases that sound wise. we don't walk around smiling enigmatically all the time, and we don't all know some form of martial arts. we're a people, and i'd appreciate it if someone would write an asian part that doesn't portray us as some sad caricature.
