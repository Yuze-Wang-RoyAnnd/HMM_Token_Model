this crap is like watching paint dry. i'm so disappointed because i was so eager to see it.<br /><br />there simply is no meaning to this film. if it were never made, no one would notice or care. it's hyped up because of all the big names in it, but if "nobody's" were in, nobody would give this film any love.<br /><br />seriously, i was at the point where half-way through the film i would look at vanessa redgrave and think, "hurry up and die already!" this is like the "joy luck club" without any of the friggin' joy. it's the "ocean's 13" (nothing but a big-named cast) of mother-daughter movies and completely anti-climatic...oh until it's finally over.<br /><br />i'm sure they'll all be nominated for oscars...<br /><br />- 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk.
