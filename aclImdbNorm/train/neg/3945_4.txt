my name is modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of the origins of modesty blaise. it's not that the movie is terrible, it's just not what i was expecting or hoping for. while i've been aware of the modesty blaise character for years, i'm not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels, so i'm coming into this movie as something as an outsider. that may be part of the reason for my disappointment. i was expecting more action and more comedy. the film is dialogue driven. i suppose i was looking for something with a little more camp value. as it is, my name is modesty is a deathly serious film. there are very few, if any, "light" moments. the acting, at least from alexandra staden, is acceptable but nothing outstanding. as others have commented, she does appear a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role. what action scenes there are in my name is modesty are one of the films weakest points. i never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers.<br /><br />i really hope quentin tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the modesty blaise character. i'm convinced the concept has a lot of potential and i would very much look forward to it.
