you believe in god or you don't. you believe in jesus or you don't. you believe he is the son of god or you don't. the choice is up to you.<br /><br />director denys arcand has really done everything he could to bring back jesus to a mere historic figure, social worker, son of two humans, instead of the son of god the holy spirit and mary, who opened heaven again for us. encouraging the big bang, a world come from evolution, instead of seeing the beauty of creation. the film depicts a theologian bringing some "modern findings" to the actor who plays jesus in the passion play, who happily incorporates them in his play.<br /><br />the depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the passion play is performed in montreal has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the passion play instead of showing his love for god through celibacy. more often than not the director's abhorrence of the church is clearly visible.<br /><br />the director has tried to make a parallel between jesus' life and the passion play actor's life. this is an admirable attempt, but depicting the resurrection with the transplantation of the passion play actor's organs in other bodies signifies how the director thinks about jesus.<br /><br />my opinion is not important, god's opinion is, but i wouldn't want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before jesus' throne.
