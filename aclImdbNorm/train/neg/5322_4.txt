there are two kinds of 1950s musicals. first you have the glossy mgm productions with big names and great music. and then you have the minor league with a less famous cast, less famous music and second rate directors. 'the girl can't help it' belongs to the latter category. neither tom ewell or edmond o'brien became famous and jayne mansfield was famous for her... well, never mind. seems like every decade has its share of bo dereks or pamela andersons. the plot itself is thin as a razorblade and one can't help suspect that it is mostly an attempt to sell records for fats domino, little richard or others of the 1950s rock acts that appear in the movie. if that music appeals to you this is worth watching. if not, don't bother.
