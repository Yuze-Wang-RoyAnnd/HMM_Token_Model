the acting wasn't great, the story was full of simplistic turns and transparent characters. it's about the repercussions of the struggle between right-wing flemish block voters on the one side and the moroccon people living in the belgian city antwerp on the other side. is it a political analysis ? is it some kind of belgian west side story or modern romeo and juliet ? the film just isn't strong enough to answer both questions (supposing those were the director's questions, too). still, some of the scenes could function as a kind of ken loach film, set in antwerp. after all, this city has been the starting point of the extremist right-wing flemish block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. it's very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this one isn't successful, unfortunately. still, it's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day belgium. the few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it's not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt belgium, a 10 million people country, in the 2000s<br /><br />dries van dongen
