there are some really terrific ideas in this violent movie that, if executed clearly, could have elevated it from spaghetti-western blandness into something special. unfortunately, a town called hell is one of the worst edited movies imaginable! scenes start and end abruptly, characters leave for long stretches, the performances (and accents) of the actors are pretty inconsistent, etc.<br /><br />robert shaw is a mexican(!) revolutionary who, after taking part in wiping out a village, stays on to become a priest(!)...ten years later the village is being run by "mayor" telly salavas. stella stevens arrives looking for revenge on the man who killed her husband. colonel martin landau arrives looking for shaw. they all yell at each other a lot and they all shoot each other a lot. fernando rey is in it too (as a blind man). the performances aren't bad, but they are mightily uneven. savalas has an accent sometimes as does landau (who is really grating here). shaw and rey prove that they are incapable of really embarrassing themselves and stevens looks pretty foxy (if a bit out of place amongst the sweaty filth).
