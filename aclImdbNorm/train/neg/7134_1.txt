so it has come to this. fast, expensive cars that only the upper 1% will ever drive. the girls that pose next to them in gearhead magazines. second-tier and no-name actors. cheap promotional appearances by people from niche culture. <br /><br />this is the garbage that hollywood has to offer. don't get me wrong; i love the mindless action flick with hot chicks as much as the next guy. but please, will the collective braintrust that greenlights this stuff please stop, count to ten, breathe, have a hearty "woooooosaaaaaah", then rewind twentyfive years and recall what made movies enjoyable once upon a time? then actually make some movies like that again? <br /><br />i have nothing against poker, but the entire pop-culture explosion it has enjoyed over the past five years is ridiculous. everyone and their mother thinks their maverick now (not that half of them even will get that reference). some executive said, "hey, what demographic do you want to leach $9.50 out of?" "i know, sir. the 18-35 market." "ok, let's give them poker, girls, and fast cars." "brilliant idea, sir." the result? a film that i've seen a hundred times late at night on spike tv, and more often than not, starring dolph lundgren. <br /><br />now don't misunderstand me;i am not a film snob. over-the-top artsy flicks like the english patient don't float my boat, but generic films that should not have even been made straight to dvd bother the hell out of me too. only adolescent gearheads will have their engines revved by this, and i imagine the ones in the higher end of their iq range will see this for what it is: a junkyard.
