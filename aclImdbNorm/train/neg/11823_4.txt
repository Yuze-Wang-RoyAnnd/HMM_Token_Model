tom brown's schooldays <br /><br />aspect ratio: 1.78:1<br /><br />sound format: stereo<br /><br />in late 19th century england, young tom brown (alex pettyfer) is sent to the public school at rugby where he experiences the reforms of a radical new headmaster (stephen fry) and stands up to the school's resident bully, flashman (joseph beattie).<br /><br />already the subject of numerous screen adaptations - most notably gordon parry's superior 1951 version - thomas hughes' evergreen novel gets the early 21st century treatment, courtesy of screenwriter ashley pharoah (tv's "where the heart is") and director david moore (the forsyte saga). it's pleasant enough, and watchable, but it's also rather staid and dull, distinguished only by fry's sincere performance as the new principal determined to sweep away some of the school's most dubious 'traditions', and by the introduction of a possible new star in 14 year old pettyfer, a talented kid with the kind of effortless charm and vivid good looks that should take him all the way to hollywood and beyond. otherwise, this is typical uk tv fodder, the kind of stuff favored by executives eager to fill the schedules with 'prestige' product, even one as thoroughly unremarkable as this. the uk publication 'radio times' described it as "daintily odd" and raised a querulous eyebrow over "all of that fagging and brutality and a handsome, rakish villain torturing the life out of sweet young boys". quite.
