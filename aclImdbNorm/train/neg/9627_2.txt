okay, i absolutely love ben stiller, although i am lukewarm about jennifer aniston. i do not think this girl can act in the least. every movie or sitcom i've seen her in is very hard to get past her fake acting. it sounds like she is just standing there reading right off the script. this movie only had one good thing about it, and that's that ben stiller was in it. this plot is so used and abused it's ridiculous. how many movies have this same type of plot?? can we say "forces of nature??" not only is the plot so old, but the outcome is so predictable, it's boring. i knew everything that was going to happen before it did. it was a bore, but watching stiller is always a delight!!!
