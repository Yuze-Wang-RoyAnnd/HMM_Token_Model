what a disappointment... admittedly the best of the prequels, but the story is weak, the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces, poorly realised and tacked together amateurishly. there are numerous continuity errors that clash glaringly with the original films, and the emergence of darth vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a cheesy goof that will be ridiculed for many years. i won't complain about the abysmal dialogue, as this is star wars... the original three films had style, cult feeling and cracking stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. the prequels were shallow attempts to make more money, and this lack of love shows in spades. utterly disappointing.
