having read some good reviews about this film i thought it was about time i go and see it. well i don't know why i bothered. basically this family is entrusted with a clue that leads to a whole big stash of ancient treasure, hidden by the knights templar during the war of independence. apparently it had to be kept out of the hands of the british at all costs. firstly, why did said knights move the treasure from europe to america? how did nic cages character figure out that 'charlotte' was in fact a ship? how do they figure out all the clues and riddles in about a minute? and how could two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best guarded bit of paper in the world? these are just some of the plot holes in this inane bit of hollywood action gone wrong. cage has been in some great action movies - 'face-off' and 'the rock' - so why has he lowered himself to this? is he getting too old?! his character is pretty annoying really - somehow this 'ordinary' guy steals the declaration of independancd, outruns thieves with guns, escapes from the fbi and generally seems invincible. the whole film doesn't really make any sense and all in all it was quite a disappointment.
