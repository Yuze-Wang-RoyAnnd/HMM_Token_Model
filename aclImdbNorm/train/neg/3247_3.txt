i was seriously looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed truly promising from the coming attractions: jim carrey with godlike powers was an idea that most definitely worked for me. as a huge fan, i was sure he'd be supremely in his element with such a promising premise, and what could go wrong? yesterday, my bubble got burst big-time, boys and girls, because i saw the movie. <br /><br />the first act (where it's set up that he hates his life, he's a disgruntled employee and a majorly unhappy camper with an ax to grind against god) is serviceable, the second act (where he's summoned by god via telephone and receives powers almighty) is great - carrey gets to have fun with his new 'toys' and it's a pleasure to watch, really funny. but the third act is wretched beyond belief.<br /><br />the rot starts setting in after the dinner scene between bruce and his girlfriend grace (jennifer aniston, who comes off exceedingly well in this movie considering her part is merely a plot device; even her name reeks of unsubtlety) - she thinks he's gonna pop 'the question' but instead, he tells her (on bended knee, yet) that he's finally getting his news anchor job, and isn't it so exciting?<br /><br />she doesn't think so. she wants him to marry her, see, so she winds up leaving him, see, even though she still loves him very much, see, and the rest of the film is spent banging us over the head with one pathetic, beyond-heavy-handed spiritual-sounding cliche after the next, until by the end i was praying, too. . .for it to be over. <br /><br />i didn't mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts (one example - in the 2nd act, after he gets his powers, bruce prances into the room singing "what if god were one of us, just a slob like one of us", blah blah blah), and i was even willing to overlook the amazing amount of contradictions being hurled at us (for openers, morgan freeman - a/k/a god - tells bruce he can't violate anyone's free will but he does this, a lot). those choices were forgivable - this is a jim carrey comedy, directed by tom shadyac - it aint the remains of the day. <br /><br />or rather it was supposed to be a comedy. when the script writers lose track of that (in the dreaded act 3) and try to turn the proceedings into some sort of (gag) message movie, what we get instead is hell on earth. bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways, he realizes that grace is his saving - have to say it - grace, and that his priorities in life had been severely misconstrued. all this could have been conveyed in a far less heavy-handed way, however. the film didn't have to go into the dumper to make these points. unfortunately, the writers and shadyac apparently had no idea how to resolve the story in any sort of clever, light-handed way, so they went the bang-'em-over-the-heads route in hopes that we wouldn't notice. they even tacked some surprisingly unfunny out-takes at the end, in the further hope that this would lessen the bad taste. it didn't work for me.
