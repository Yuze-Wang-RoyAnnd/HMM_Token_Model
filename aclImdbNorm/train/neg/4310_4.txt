this movie is about a very sexy olympic track star who is hired to coach a high school boys' basketball team. similar to goldie hawn's wildcats, it stars cathy lee crosby in the title role, and she does as about as well as the script allows. i think racquel welch would have been a better choice, but considering the film's apparent tv movie budget, they probably couldn't afford her. cathy lee does look great in every shot, but we never get to see her completely nude. the story is pretty predictable, to say the least, offering no surprises. a young and lucky michael biehn has the male lead role. he is the star on the team and also the love interest for cathy lee. keenan wynn has a few amusing scenes as the rich old man who runs the athletic program and doesn't think a woman should coach sports. this point is brought up throughout the film, and, needless to say, is dated. ironically, cathy lee doesn't put her team through any unorthodox practice sessions; she doesn't do anything a male coach wouldn't do. there is a funny subplot involving a tall and not-so-bright player who undergoes hypnosis in order to pass his classes and play like pro basketball player sydney wicks. it looks like everyone had a good time making this film, but the only real reason to see it is for cathy lee crosby. she's not that great an actress, but she has a dazzling smile, beautiful hair, and a very tan body.
