this collection really sucks!<br /><br />i rented it, thinking i'd really would enjoy some good fighting. man this sucked! quick flashy cuts, an extremely annoying speaker, and the fights them selves were heavily edited and shortened (i'm thinking especially of jet li's fight in fists of legend and jackie chan's fight from drunken master 2).<br /><br />and what's the deal with those brawling streetfighters?! what's so "cool" about that? i've seen more interesting fights on martial law!<br /><br />this a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people.<br /><br />do not ever buy this film! do not encourage the people who made this crap to make more of this crap!<br /><br />instead, go buy the movies the fights were from and wath the fights in their uncut glory!
