first of all, i'd like to tell you that i'm into comics, anime, animation and such stuff. it is true that everyone has his own preferences, but you can trust me on this movie. i'll be objective. to begin with the story - it's ok. follows the story line of the comic books as far as i'm familiar with them. but the animation... well, it's not actually terrible, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. it would be a lot better if they didn't try to imitate the anime style and sticked to the original comic book style drawings. if we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightnings you could tell that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more. looks a little bit like the original vampire hunter d from 1985. take a look at heavy metal fakk 2000 for instance - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better! in addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable, the music is nothing special. so all in all - it lacks atmosphere. i watched it, but i cannot tell i really enjoyed it. it just does not capture you. there's plenty of blood and violence, but that does not impress me at all. may be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time (is there anyone around?), but i don't think this is the audience for this movie. so they could add a little nudity and spice to it. the chicks around lucifer were quite tasty, and hell, we have lady death herself! there are few sexy looks, but that's not enough. instead of bill brown's music i think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. all in all - the movie isn't that bad, but if you want something better take the original heavy metal, heavy metal fakk 2000, ralph bakshi's fire and ice or wizards maybe. and of course - vampire hunter d: bloodlust
