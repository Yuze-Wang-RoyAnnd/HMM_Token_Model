getting lost in space frozen for 15 years, that's unlikely. falling into a star... improbable. falling into it the day it goes supernova and explodes... ludicrous. getting rescued by a ship just then... priceless.<br /><br />no, it's not zaphod beeblebrox's heart of gold to the rescue. it's also not the parent of the year awardees. after sentencing her daughter to two years' solitary confinement on an abandoned spaceship, the mother encourages her to get drunk and wander off alone with the strange man they've picked up. this foreshadows their prowess in hand to hand combat, which makes up most of the film's action. combat highlights include for example the psycho talking close up face to face with one woman while blindly pointing the gun behind him at the other about six inches away, who obligingly simpers in the line of fire.<br /><br />in the end, the family of three abandons the metropolis-sized ship they were planning to use to observe the supernova until the last instant because it is too slow to escape the blast wave, instead using the psycho's fighter ship which they've refueled in one minute with 1600 pounds of gas propellant from a 0.7-kiloton missile. you have to love those hard sci-fi statistics! <br /><br />as long as hollywood treats writing as an irrelevant frill, they'll continue making movies not fit to run at 3 am on the sci fi channel.
