this is 30 minute show about one joke. the joke, cavemen are not treated fairly. hahaha!!! he can't dial a phone because he is a caveman. cavemen are not as smart as human beings. oh jeez, those cavemen are so unsophisticated. there is no humor in this show. they can only run off this one joke for so long and they already have with the geico commercials. this show does not deserve a time slot on national t.v. <br /><br />this show tries to hard to be funny, but it just isn't. watching this show, i was thinking that it was trying to be like a "bachelor's gone wild show." meaning they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women. the crying caveman is annoying. the caveman with the glasses is too smart to be a caveman(hahaha!!!). all three of them have personalities, but i can't figure out why i don't care about them.
