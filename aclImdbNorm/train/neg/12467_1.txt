this movie was slower then molasses in january... in alaska. the man who put togeather the preview should get an award for managing to put every one of the 30 seconds that were interisting into the preview. i had to wake up the people i was watching it with, several times. after it was over, i felt bad for having woken them up. <br /><br />most of the film is taken up with hoping something will actually happen, but nothing ever does. it was easy to loose track of people's motives, and the characters were flat and uninteristing. by the end of the movie, you just hoped everyone would died. everyone runs around either being contemptible, petty, or pitiful, and usually all three. <br /><br />and worse, we watched a minute or two of the added features, just for kicks and giggles you understand, and all that we saw was people being smug about how socially aware they are. if they had spend the time on the movie that they did patting themselves on the back, it might have been worth watching. <br /><br />i was brought in expecting the excitement of '24.' i got a lecture on social awareness through the blery eyes of the sandman.
