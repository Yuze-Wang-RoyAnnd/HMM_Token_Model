"that 'malcom' show on fox is really making a killing... can't we do our own version?" i speculate and paraphrase, of course, but in our hearts we all know it's true, and that the only thing nbc added to the 'malcom' metric was sex. and, boy, did they add sex...<br /><br />thirteen-year-old tucker gets a boner and covers it up with his skateboard. tucker accidentally walks in on his aunt in the shower and she accuses him of watching her and beating off. he spies on the cute girl in the next house from his bedroom window, and she knows he wants to see her topless but she teases him by smiling and closing the window. and this is all in the pilot.<br /><br />take it from a grown man- a boy's puberty is so sex-crazy and testicle-driven it is impossible to make it funny for a mainstream audience. the only times anyone has ever come close has been in movies, and you can count those on one hand. so it's no surprise that "tucker" has the warmth and appeal of a strip-club bathroom. did the network actually think we would like watching kids grapple with puberty? isn't this the stuff people go to jail for? if you doubt the show's depravity consider this: 13 episodes were filmed but nbc canceled it after only 4 episodes aired; they then made the unprecedented move of "burning off" the remaining episodes by airing them at midnight so no children could see them. ironic since kids were originally the target audience. <br /><br />apart from its general scuzziness tucker features a running voice-over from the lead character to flesh out the shoddy writing. even in 2000 it was horribly dated, with it's ska incidental music and super-sarcasm. i couldn't like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes didn't exactly come a mile-a-minute... shame on nbc for this dirty rip-off... they're better than that.<br /><br />grade: c-
