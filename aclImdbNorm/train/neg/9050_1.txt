i saw this film in its entirety in the 1960s & 70s, yes it is gruesome, and could be the progenitor of the "faces of death" series popular in the 80s & 90s. considering the state of so-called "driver education" these days, this one should be required viewing for everyone preparing to learn to drive. when you see violent death in all its gore & horror, you certainly (if you have any sensibility at all) get a truer perspective on the responsibilities required to drive safely, what one instant of thoughtlessness or inattentiveness at the wheel can do. i worked for bell telephone in the 70s & 80s, and at one point was assigned to conduct a safety class. i found this film in the company library, showed it at the session, a number of people got physically sick and had to leave the room! incredibly, most of them later said "i never knew a car accident could be so terrible!" this film, and another, "red asphalt", is certainly reality in its most graphic form. i'll never forget it, i only wish i could have found a copy when my children were attending "driver's ed" in high school!
