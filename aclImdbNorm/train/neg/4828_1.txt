i picked up tran scan from the library and brought it home. we have considered taking a trip out east and thought it would give us a feel of what it was like. the film was a total waste of time, if i went out to buy it i would call it tran scam when i saw that it costs $49.<br /><br />the dvd ran for 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride across canada with my stomach feeling ill as they went up and down and around curve with the film at high speed.<br /><br />there was a lot of footage they probably shot on this and you would think that they could have made a better product. if i would of done this project i would of provided more footage, paused on road signs to let people know where they were and linger in places to view the scenery. to make a film like this it should of been 60 to 90min. oh yes the case said it was in stereo, the whole film was a hissing sound from sped up car sound, thet could of at least put some music to it.<br /><br />if you want a good cross canada film watch the railrodder / national film board of canada starring buster keaton (the one of the last film he made) in this comical film buster keaton gets on to a railway trackspeeder in nova scotia and travels to british columbia
