warning: avoid this super duper awful movie...if you watched it you will be sooooooooo disappointed.<br /><br />pam and denise are grandma age now what are they doing? trying so hard to be young innocent and sexy, just not working at all. pam and denise act so horribly in this movie.<br /><br />plus the script is absolutely atrocious, i can't believe someone can came out with such crappy ideas. with the development of movie industry, movie lovers are not as easy to satisfy as the ones in the last century. i bet the movie goers from last century will hate this too.<br /><br />stay away from it. i think watch "white chicks" from 2004 it's so much better that this...make no mistake at that time i thought that's the worst movie i have ever seen.
