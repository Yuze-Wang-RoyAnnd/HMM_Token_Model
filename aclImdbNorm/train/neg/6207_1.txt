this movie commits what i would call an emotional rape on the viewer. the movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in cannes, but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed. hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue, for that matter).<br /><br />the main character's metamorphosis from good, but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent, whereas the rape scene (being an over-dragged, exaggerated version of the rape scene from "a clockwork orange") is unbearable and i refuse to comment on its aesthetic values. there are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve his/her goal. at least in my opinion.<br /><br />to wrap it up: shockingly brutal, revolting and not worth your time. see "a clockwork orange" or "le pianiste" instead.
