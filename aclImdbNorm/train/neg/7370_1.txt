i've seen a lot of seagal movies, and while most aren't great, or even good, this steamy pile lowered the bar for bad movies.<br /><br />the plot: not sure really. something about a drug that makes you all crazy and strong or something. who are the good guys and bad guys? hard to tell. most of the movie is cut scenes going back and forth between people in darkly lit rooms complaining about how good seagals character "mashall" is.<br /><br />acting: blows.<br /><br />voice dubbing ,,,,,, what was with the horrible voice overdubbing?! could they of found anyone who sounded any less like seagal? may as well had cheech or chong doing the voice overs, might of at least been entertaining then.<br /><br />this movie is boring, and completely stupid. avoid it at all costs!!!!
