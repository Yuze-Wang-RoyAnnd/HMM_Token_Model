this movie made me really mad because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent. i've lived in iowa for 29 years and i know that people don't have a southern accent here. this movie is about a guy who does meth and i don't know the real plot or what the movie is suppose to be about. it has some pretty graphic drug use in it and it's really insulting so see these people use meth like it was sugar. i lost my brother to meth and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because it glamorizes the drug. the movie makes it look cool to use the drug but i was happy at the end when the guy almost made it across the state line. i also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape don't want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day. the movie is just wrong in all directions. i would suggest "the basketball diaries" if i was going to suggest a movie about drugs.
