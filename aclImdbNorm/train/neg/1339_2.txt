a sad, sad sight indeed is the munster's revenge. the munsters are brought back one last time(fred gywnne received a huge paycheck to come back to the role of herman munster)in this made-for-tv movie about a pair of wax replicas of grandpa and herman that are robots "terrorizing" the city as preparation for a robbery of a mummy's stash at an exhibit. with the police on their heels, the two elderly television icons try to find out who is actually behind the crimes in order to clear their names. we get to see them dress in drag as waitresses(a minor highpoint in the film), grandpa turns into a bat with attached wire a couple times(one time even flying to transylvania with herman somehow invoking his frequent flyer miles i guess), and a most annoying relative "the phantom" constantly sings and breaks glass ad nausium! what is most sad is hard to pinpoint: is it that gywnne(especially) and al lewis look so haggard in every scene and so indifferent to the material. is it the hokey costumes of the robots that have that school production values look about them. maybe it is the ridiculous script. sid caesar's crazy, mostly unfunny antics. or perhaps it is seeing something which brought me joy and fond memories as a child being treated to a super k-mart fashion makeover. at any even, the result is decidedly disappointing and silly even for munster standards. as for the rest of the cast, yvonne de carlo is adequate in a most vacuous role(though showing more cleavage than usual for a woman of her years and experience). k. c. martell makes an ever-so-not affable eddie munster. jo mcdonell is an attractive marilyn. bob hastings as the aforementioned phantom looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd manner. the film has a real cheap feel about it even for a made-for-tv movie.
