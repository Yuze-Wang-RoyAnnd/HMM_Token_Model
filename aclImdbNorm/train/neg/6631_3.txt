ram gopal verma has proved himself as a very innovative and competent director. he had done a remake/reworking of godfather with sarkar, and succeeded tremendously. ditto for lolita which he made as nishaabd.<br /><br />sholay is been the movie he repeatedly says has inspired him the most. unfortunately, he has managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake.<br /><br />the acting ranged from decent to very good, with amitabh bachchan being suitably menacing as the villain babban.<br /><br />the songs were awful and forgettable. the mehbooba mehbooba song came off as a second rate music video.<br /><br />the worst part was the pacing, and the dialogues - which were forgettable.<br /><br />watching the movie in a theatre, i found myself waiting for the intermission, and then for the ending. some viewers were wise not to wait, and were seen leaving throughout the duration of the film. ultimately, one of the worst movies made by ram gopal verma.
