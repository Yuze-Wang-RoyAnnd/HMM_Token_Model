hubert selby jr. gave us the book "requiem for a dream" and co-wrote the screenplay to aronofsky's movie of it. that movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate, and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the vices that destroyed them. "last exit to brooklyn" still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives, but it hardly does them the same justice aronofsky did.<br /><br />the film seems laughably anti-gay at times. especially when in the film homosexuality equals death. one gay character gets stoned, is launched skyward by a speeding car, and lands dead on the pavement. another is crucified and still more are simply beat up. another exaggerated piece of shock value, that might actually have been compelling if it were done well, are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strike-breakers. who'd have thought a drama about brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosions?<br /><br />the director, uli edel has a skill level like that of a tv director, but he is far below the cut for real movies. the film is clunky that can't even seem to settle on a genre. lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part. and then comes jennifer jason leigh as our lead, a loathsome hooker named tralala (believe it or not, i'm not joking). her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least. poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper than it is, and also takes the "real" edge off the more provocative bits. a failure.
