i'm actually watching this film as i write this . . . if the following comments "prove my lack of development as a true, artistic film maker", then so be it . . .<br /><br />but . . . i thought (am still thinking as i'm presently viewing) that this film . . . to put it mildly, is very, very overrated. again, very.<br /><br />it looks like a really, really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources . . . and who didn't pay that much attention to detail.<br /><br />i don't want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that i find this film lacking, but . . . well . . . i just don't get it (rememeber, i fully admit that maybe it's me that's the idiot here - not the film maker - for not getting this "piece of imaginative genius") . . . i rented this on a whim because the reviews were very, very outstanding . . .<br /><br />sheesh . . .
