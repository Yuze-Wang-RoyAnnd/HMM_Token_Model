this film is self indulgent rubbish. watch this film if you merely want to hear spoken gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack. watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed. it should be charming but isn't - it's just irritating. the characters are difficult to care about and the acting is poor. the stories within the film are also charmless and sinister. i was expecting a heartwarming family film but this also held no appeal to my fourteen year old daughter. it is rarely that i cannot see a film through to its conclusion but this one got the better of both of us.<br /><br />although the film is set in current times it has the look and feel of a cheap east european film made during the cold war. there isn't even enough in the way of beautiful scottish scenery and cinematography to redeem it. a real shame because as a film this is an embarrassment to scotland.
