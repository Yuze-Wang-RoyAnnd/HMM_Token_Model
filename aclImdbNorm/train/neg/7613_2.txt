the small california town of diablo is plagued with mysterious deaths after sheriff robert lopez unearths an ancient box.legend has it that the box holds the sixteenth-century mexican demon named azar.fbi agent gil vega is sent to investigate the murders and joins forces with the sheriff's daughters,dominique and mary to fight with evil and bloodthirsty demon."the legend of diablo" is an absolute garbage.the film lacks scares and gore,the acting is amateurish and the direction is bad.the animation is the only one aspect of the film i enjoyed.i'm a big fan of indie horror flicks,for example i loved "torched","live feed","bone sickness" or "neighborhood watch",unfortunately "the legend of diablo" is a huge misfire.definitely one to avoid.
