this movie is hilarious. the problem is that it's not a comedy. one classic scene involves kurt thomas just happening to find a pommel-horse in the middle of a village square (which he uses to pummel the bad guys.) another is the trek into the "village of crazies." too bad this movie wasn't made to be a farce, or it may have gotten better ratings.
