connie hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at times.<br /><br />that's it, folks. the sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or not.<br /><br />these 70s sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness (flared trousers, big hair, zapata moustaches etc.). this one isn't.<br /><br />the script is bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad, and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally bad.<br /><br />the title, hinting at a sex comedy, is grossly misleading.<br /><br />i heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague.
