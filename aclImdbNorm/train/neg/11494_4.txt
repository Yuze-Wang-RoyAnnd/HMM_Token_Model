richard dix is a big, not very nice industrialist, who has nearly worked himself to death. if he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him, can he find happiness for the last months of his life? well, he'll likely be better off if he disregards the voice of the whistler.<br /><br />this william castle directed entry has some great moments (the introduction and the depiction of richard dix's life through newsreel a la citizen kane), and some intriguing plotting in the final reels. dix's performance is generally pretty good. but, unfortunately, the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do. also, the movie veers from a dark (and fascinating beginning) to an almost cheerful 30s movie like midsection (full of nice urban ethnic types who don't mind that they aren't rich) and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so.<br /><br />this is a decent movie -- worth seeing -- but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role.
