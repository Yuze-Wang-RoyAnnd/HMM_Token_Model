there are laughs in this film, that is for sure. michael keaton is a talent and he used to be funny (before he decided he was a serious actor). however, what bothers me so much about this film, is how unlikable practically all of the characters are. other than the main two leads, everybody is a jerk. i mean, these small town losers are about as uncouth as you can get. you just watch and think, man, these losers should be unemployed. moreover, the american factory worker is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slob. it made me wonder if this film was made by japanese nationalists. oh sure, in the end they all come together as one, but i just did not enjoy the trip to get there.
