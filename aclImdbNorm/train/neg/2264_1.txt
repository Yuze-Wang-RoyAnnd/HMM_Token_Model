to preface this review, i must say that i was, i suppose, a little curious about this movie.. however, i probably would not have seen it had i not had my arm slightly twisted.<br /><br />in my opinion, this movie shows just how depraved man can be. in my eyes, the worst thing about this whole springer phenomenon is not that type of people on the "jerry springer show" act as they do (which in itself is eminently reproachable), but that many people are so curious and excited to watch them and hear about their lives (yes, i suppose that includes me.. to whatever extent it is true). if not glorifying that kind of behavior (as some might say) at the very least we may be subtly corrupting our minds and/or desenstizing ourselves to this type of behavior.<br /><br />but enough soapbox (sort of). here's the skinny: the movie has an r rating, and while it may deserve only that (i did look away at some scenes, so i'm not completely sure), i feel that an nc-17 (tip of the hat to the other reviewer) might be a little more appropriate for the immense sexual content (a cynic might comment that the movie was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen). the plot is very bizarre, tying together the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks upset who will appear on different springer shows. at the end, the movie leaves one with some resolvement- and springer rhetoric about the need for us to see the real world (evidently as seen through his show). i agree with him there- it is important to know how the world really is so that we can seek to effect positive change. having said that, let me just tell you- the world's pretty bad- glance in a newpaper or the news to see that, but let's not shell out good money to support the kind of sensationalistic and perhaps formulaic titallition that springer seeks to give us.
