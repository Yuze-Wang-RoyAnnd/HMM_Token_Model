i recently watched belle epoque, thinking it might be wonderful as it did win an oscar for best foreign language film. i was a bit underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film. maybe the conflict i had was that from the time the movie was filmed to now, the plot of a man falling for beautiful women and eventually falling for the good girl has been done so many times. aside from predictability of the plot, some scenes in the film felt really out of place with the storyline (ex. a certain event at the wedding). at times the film was a bit preachy in it's ideas and in relation to the franco era the film was set in and the church. the only thing the film had going for it was the cutesy moments, the scenery, and the character of violeta being a strong, independent woman during times when women were not really associated with those characteristics.
