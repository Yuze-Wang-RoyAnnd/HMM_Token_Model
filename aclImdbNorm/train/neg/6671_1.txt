i felt this movie started out well. the acting was spot on and i felt for all the characters situation, even though the true family unit was not completely revealed. we never got enough info on the father to truly feel his pain for his whole involvement or the build up for his animosity with tobe. i mean in one scene you see him admiring her for tensity and in another scene he just about takes her head off. another problem with the movie was it just unraveled and lost all focus by the end, and i was begging for it to just be over with. any movie with such a long drawn out , and painful ending should never get an automatic rating of 7 or above just for the acting. we are looking at the over all quality of the movie experience. in the case of this movie the end is so bad i seriously contemplated just walking out of the theater. this movie pulled me in then just spit me out.
