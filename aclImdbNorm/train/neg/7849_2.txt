the film picks up after last years remake with the military setting up electronic surveillance equipment in the desert where the attacks in the first film happened. the crew is killed not long before a group of soldiers on a training exercise show up to find no one around. you can fill in the rest.<br /><br />this is a paycheck picture all around. there seems to be no passion in anyone's performances, nor in anyone behind the camera. this is a movie that was made for the money and nothing else. on some level this should have worked, it could have been a more horrific southern comfort (where national guardsmen run afoul of some people in the swamps), but instead its not much of anything. in large part you can blame the script, written unbelievably in part by wes craven, which hits the same old targets again and again. add to the mess the fact that the direction is dull and the set up of sequences is so lack luster as to remove any inherent tension in any scene.<br /><br />its not bad as such, but badly made and dull. let me put my feelings into context: the reason i saw this film was because a local multiplex screwed up and ran this film instead of the kids flick the last mimzy and i wanted to see what caused the out cry(i mean the films have so much in common-he says sarcastically). i'm convinced that this film will only scare those who like the last mimzy.
