there is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film. let's just face it, though, the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for leo and cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. i'm not saying they're not good actors, i'm saying they stunk in this film. the special effects were decent (and i will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye-pleasing), but it even has several major flaws. for instance, right before the ship goes under, you can see an unfinished blue-screen image behind your main characters.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, i love the story of the real titanic, but i find this movie an insult to that story. editing was atrocious--there's no reason for any film to be over 2 1/2 hours (with the exception of maybe a biographical movie), and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted.<br /><br />i will say that the music was perhaps better than i could have predicted (and not just the "my heart will go on" song either). there is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard. that could very well be the highlight of the film. as for the mood throughout, it was extremely dull. i was more relieved than sad when jack died, which i know cannot be what the director intended.<br /><br />in a nut shell, i find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the titanic into an over-hyped chick flick.
