when i saw the preview, i thought: this is going to be a great movie. and indeed it could have been. the actress playing the main character was very credible, and the beauty of the filming is undeniable. however the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture. the level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in 1610, and it took away most of the magic of the film. however, i must congratulate the translator, because the english sub-titles were more refined and appropriate that the original french cues, and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd!
