another friday the 13th ripoff, even featuring some of its music! a group of young adults get together for a small high school reunion and start getting slaughtered a la jason voorhees. could it be that nerd they used to torment in school?<br /><br />routine slash-fest is fun for fans of the genre, and contains the usual t&a quota for films if its ilk. the ending is a bit more imaginative than your standard slasher.<br /><br />mpaa: rated for violence/gore, language, sexuality, nudity, and some drug content.
