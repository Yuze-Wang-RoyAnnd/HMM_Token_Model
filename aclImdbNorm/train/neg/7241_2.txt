... you can't exactly shove her out of the way, because she's old; and if you were being charitable you might say that the ponderous gait she ambles along with isn't really her fault. nevertheless, in these circumstances it's often difficult not to become irritated when you find yourself dragging your heels in her wake. so it is with "the pallbearer", an attempt to do something 'different' with a romantic comedy that in this way is chiefly hamstrung because the venue is all wrong; sort of like showing off your 'breakdancing' skills at a grandparent's funeral.<br /><br />to further extend the metaphor (perhaps unwisely!); like the old lady, one starts to feel with the set-up of the film that its demise cannot be far away. sure enough, this particular 'death' is agonizingly protracted, slowly chipping away at our reserves of empathy in tiny little increments, as depressingly we come to the realisation that the proceedings are only headed in one direction: downhill. its laboured attempts at 'humour' can be seen coming a mile off - again, not unlike the grim inevitability of death!<br /><br />returning once again to the image of 'dragging heels', the main character, tom, is shown to ceaselessly repeat this action throughout his life. if there are indeed degrees of 'pathetic', then this sap is possibly a good few notches ahead of schwimmer's other - more famous - role. to find oneself in the awkward position of having to align audience sympathies with a character even more 'clueless' than ross is certainly a tough ask even for as 'able' a comic performer as schwimmer, but i guess he can find fault with himself for signing on to some seriously 'echoing' situations in the first place.<br /><br />how will he ever escape his most famous portrayal if he's picking scripts where the characters could almost be 'interchangeable', even if the situations aren't? a man with a longstanding high-school crush on someone he hasn't seen for years. sound familiar... ? paltrow is nothing else if not bland in her 'rachel' role, but all of this going over old ground would perhaps be forgivable if the noticeable differences present weren't so incongruous as well. unfortunately, the romantic element is so well-worn it's threadbare, and the 'backdrop' is so inappropriate that it seems the best way to describe the resultant film is as something of a 'stiff'... ! 2/10.
