about 4 years ago, i liked this movie. i would watch it over and over and over. but now... i don't. actually, i think this movie would have been great for mystery science theater 3000. it has a bunch of comment-heavy actors (macaulay culkin, christopher lloyd, patrick stewart, whoopi goldberg), and a pretty cheesy plot. my favorite part is when culkin is riding his bike and he comes across a gang and a gang member says, "hey, tyler! where ya goin'? the moon??" also look out for the classic line, "do you have feeling in your toes?"<br /><br />on the other hand, it's better than "the good son".
