just bought the vhs on this film for two bucks, did i waste my money! hey, i dig adam "batman" west and tina "giligan's island" louise, but hello! this third rate production is a rehash of a dozen other biker films; crazed bunch of bikers psychos ride into a hick town, beat up everybody and everything, and then are defeated in the man by a dashing hero. adam west looks the part as a hero, but he's missing cape, and his batman uniform. sorry, just isn't the same. tina l. looks really nervous and frightened the whole show, but at least we know what happened to "ginger" once she was rescued from the island...lol! the bikers are a motley group, and known of them ever acted again or at least shouldn't have. hell riders is hell to watch!
