this romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day. a wealthy upper class english woman schemes, plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction. she uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly anti-social kind. there's a clever sex-role reversal as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters. but naturally there's a tall, dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest, and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right man.<br /><br />the wishy-washy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme, but those who thirst for romance will overlook that.
