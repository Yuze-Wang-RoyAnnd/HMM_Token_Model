a painfully protracted, maudlin and predictable drama, my twenty-fifth sidney lumet film, garbo talks, gets filed precipitously on the low quality end of my quest.<br /><br />the film documents a harried young working man named gilbert (ron silver), who is son to estelle rolle (anne bancroft), eccentric, feisty and above all, an obsessive fan of greta garbo. when estelle becomes afflicted with a brain tumor, her son decides to go on an obsessive quest of his own: track down greta garbo, and bring her to his mother.<br /><br />anne bancroft is in full-on, chew-the-scenery auntie-mame mode here, that kind of feisty ol' gal that film loves, where she mouths off to people, and stands up for her ideals, and ends up in jail all the time. she stands outside of the film as an obvious artificial construct, and every scene with her is yuk-yuk lame; every note striking false. the rest of the characters are equally as one-dimensional, but tremendously less-interesting. ron silver is flat as can be, and his attempted love triangle is as telegraphed as anything else in the film: he is dating affluent lisa rolfe (carrie fisher), but becomes smitten with oddball co-worker jane mortimer (catherine hicks), and i called every scene three scenes before they happen.<br /><br />that's the other problem. one-dimensional characters can survive if they are posited in an intriguing and captivating story, but there's simply nothing here. the film's pace is glacial, resplendent with extraneous material that strengthens absolutely nothing, and when the film does begin to follow a linear plot, it's both plodding and uninteresting. there are plenty of guest stars, so to speak, including harvey fierstein as a gay new yorker (imagine that) in yet another highly inessential scene.<br /><br />late in the film, it attempts to make a halfway-decent statement on the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives, but by that time, none of the characters exist as real people, and the film had bored me into submission, so it functions as a case of far-too-little, far-too-late. the film is my twenty-fifth lumet-directed film, making him easily my most-viewed director, but outside of a couple egregious misses (a stranger among us, anyone?), he hasn't plumbed the painfully uninteresting depths of garbo talks.<br /><br />{grade: 4.5/10 (c/c-) / #21 (of 24) of 1984 / #23 of 25 lumet films}
