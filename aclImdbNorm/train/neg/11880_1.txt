office work, especially in this era of computers, multi-functional copy machines, e-mail, voice mail, snail mail and `temps,' is territory ripe with satirical possibilities, a vein previously tapped in such films as `clockwatchers' and `office space,' and very successfully. this latest addition to the temp/humor pool, however, `haiku tunnel,' directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth, fails to live up to it's predecessors, and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door, waiting for a chance to sneak in. unfortunately for the audience, that chance never comes; so what you get is a nice try, but as the man once said, no cigar.<br /><br />	as the narrator/star of the film, josh kornbluth (playing josh kornbluth), points out in the opening frames (in a monologue delivered directly into the camera), this story is pure fiction, and takes place in the fictional city of `san franc'l'isco.' it's an innovative, if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer, and not all that funny. it is, however, a harbinger of what is to follow, all of which-- like the disclaimer-- just isn't all that funny.<br /><br />	kornbluth plays kornbluth, an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a `temp.' it's a job that suits him, and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time. but when he goes to work for a lawyer, bob shelby (warren keith), he does too good a job on the first day, and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d'amore (helen shumaker) to kornbluth to persuade him to go `perm.' the thought of working full time for the same company, though, initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth, but he caves in and signs on for the position. he's nervous about it, but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence (which, of course, they would never do with a temp), and if things get too rough, he has seventeen important letters he's typed up-- that now just have to be mailed out-- to fall back on (he's been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part, and he needs that `something easy to do' in reserve, in case it all gets to be too much for him). these are `important' letters, however, and by the end of the week, kornbluth still has them in reserve, on his desk. and it doesn't take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it, kornbluth's days as the fair-haired boy are going to be over. and quick.<br /><br />	the brothers kornbluth, who not only directed, but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film, should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy, where it says `if you play it straight, they will laugh.' but, they didn't, and the audience won't. because in comedy, even looking at it as objectively as possible, when the main character (as well as most of the supporting characters, in this case) `plays' funny-- as in, he `knows' he's being funny-- he never is. and that's exactly what kornbluth does here; so rather than being `funny,' he comes across as insincere and pretentious, a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths, because by allowing it, they sabotaged their own movie. <br /><br />	in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn't work, it comes down to two basic reasons: the directing, which-- if not necessarily `bad'-- is at least careless; and secondly, the performances, beginning with that of josh kornbluth. quite simply, kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here. unlike stiller, or even steve martin-- both of whom use self-deprecating humor very effectively-- kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light; he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he, the real kornbluth, is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character. and being unable to get past that does him in, as well as the film. rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify, kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach. so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting, and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with, with an inexplicably narrow focus (given the potential of the rich subject matter), it's easy to understand why this one just doesn't fly.<br /><br />	the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby, whose subtle delivery is convincing, and which-- in and of itself-- is fairly humorous. the effectiveness of it is diminished, however, inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth, which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project. <br /><br />	shumaker and sarah overman (julie faustino) also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances, which are commendable, if not entirely memorable; they at least make their scenes watchable, and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth's performance, if only momentarily. but it's still not enough to save the day or the film.<br /><br />	the supporting cast includes amy resnick (mindy), brian thorstenson (clifford), june lomena (davonne), joe bellan (jimmy the mail clerk), with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer, as the orientation leader-- a role that begs for an answer to the question, `what was he thinking when he agreed to this?' in any work environment, there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone's comedic cannon, and the films depicting said situations will always be with us; the good ones (see paragraph one) may even become classics in their own right. `haiku tunnel,' however, will doubtfully remain very long amongst them, for it's destiny lies elsewhere-- in a realm known only as: `obscurity.' i rate this one 1/10. <br /><br /> <br /><br />
