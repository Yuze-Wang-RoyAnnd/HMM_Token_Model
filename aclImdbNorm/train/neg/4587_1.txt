well, what can i say.<br /><br />"what the bleep do we know" has achieved the nearly impossible - leaving behind such masterpieces of the genre as "the postman", "the dungeon master", "merlin", and so fourth, it will go down in history as the single worst movie i have ever seen in its entirety. and that, ladies and gentlemen, is impressive indeed, for i have seen many a bad movie.<br /><br />this masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts, alternating between a silly and contrived plot about an extremely annoying photographer, abandoned by her husband and forced to take anti-depressants to survive, and a bunch of talking heads going on about how quantum physics supposedly justifies their new-agy pseudo-philosophy. basically, if you start your day off meditating to the likes of enya and kenny g, this movie is for you. if you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who know how to have fun, and a sizable portion of good weed, then this movie is for you as well. otherwise, stay away. take my word for it.<br /><br />the first thing that struck me about "what the bleep do you know" is that is seemed to be edited and put together by the same kinds of people that shoot cheap weddings on camera, complete with pink heart effects, computer-generated sparkles across the screen, and other assorted silliness. who let these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me. i guess this is what too much kenny g does to you. the movie was permeated with cheesy gci, the likes that you or i can produce on our own computer via over-the-counter video editing software, but never would, because it's just way too ridiculous.<br /><br />the script was _obviously_ written by someone with no writing experience whatsoever. not only were all the characters and conversations cumbersome and contrived beyond belief, but the "writers" felt like they had to shove every relevant piece of information, or rather disinformation, which is what most of this movie was all about, all the way down your throat. well, given the target audience, that may not have been too bad of an idea. the main character, for example, spends half the movie popping pills. apparently, though, it was deemed not convincing enough, so there are at least a couple of dialogs in throughout, which refer to her anti-anxiety pills specifically, just in case the viewers should not be able to connect her overacted pain and suffering with little white pills she takes whenever she feels down. the acting... well, i've seen better acting in ed wood movies, and no, this is not an exaggeration. heck, the little play i was in when i was 12 featured much more inspiring acting than this. it really did.<br /><br />the story is interrupted here and there with a bunch or random talking heads, a strange mix of kooky scientists, kooky doctors, and self-proclaimed mystics, go on and on about how quantum physics supposedly provides an "explanation" for how ever man or woman created their own reality just by participating in the experience of life. reality, you see, is a probability-field of a bunch of different possibilities, and is only set in stone once you the observer chose to notice it. what happens when more than one observer observes they didn't say, but then again who cares. listen to enya, meditate, observe, and you shall be god, and nobody gives a damn about such silly and archaic things as critical thinking, logic, etc. all reason is immediately dismissed as people being stuck in their ways and unable to achieve a "paradigm shift" and "go down the rabbit hole". furthermore, the heidelberg uncertainty principle supposedly is proof positive of alternate realities, parallel universes, and such.<br /><br />speaking of rabbit holes, the analogy permeates the movie. all of these people keep talking about going down rabbit holes. i'm not sure what that had to do with anything else they were saying or showing, but one thing i'm certain of is that it somehow involves anal sex. actually, the movie is _extremely_ anti-sex. throughout, sex is presented as dirty, ugly, and anti-enlightening.<br /><br />in any case, the talking heads talk, the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over her body with a magic marker, and proceeds to walk around with an even stupider look in her glazed over eyes than she started with.<br /><br />i want 2 hours of my life back.<br /><br />here's a couple of random quotes which i happened to remember:<br /><br />"what i think of as unreal has become a lot more real to me, and that, which i used to consider real, is oftentimes a lot less real than the unreal." - some talking head on the spirituality of quantum physics.<br /><br />"what does it take for one man to have an erection? it takes just one thought. nothing changes on the outside, all the changes are within. an yet he has an erection" - some self proclaimed mystic, head of her own school of enlightenment.<br /><br />[while looking at herself in the mirror] "i hate you! i hate you! you're fat! you're ugly! i have you!" - main character, the fat and ugly photographer.
