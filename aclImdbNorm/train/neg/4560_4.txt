men in black 2 was a real disappointment for me. while the actors did a pretty good job, especially smith, there just isn't a cure for a poor script once in production. the movie really had a "sequel" kind of feel, playing off partial events of the first film. the story was, in a word... bad, at best. it wasn't thought out well, and seemed very choppy and incoherent at times.<br /><br />in the first flick, the mib organization had a kind of "elite" force feel. you had a few special agents, and it had a "clandestine" kind of feel to it. in the sequel, the mib organization has a jrotc summer camp vibe.<br /><br />the movie wasn't terrible or anything.. it just lacked the "coolness" (for lack of a better phrase) of the first movie. a lot of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second, and didn't really add any originality to the mib universe.<br /><br />a perfect analogy would be episode 1 to the first 3 films. was it decent? yeah. is it worthy of bearing it's title? not really.
