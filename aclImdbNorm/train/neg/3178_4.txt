with movies like this you know you are going to get the usual jokes concerning ghosts. eva as a ghost is pretty funny. and the other actors also do a good job. it is the direction and the story that is lacking. that could have been overlooked had the jokes worked better. the problem only is that there aren't many jokes. sure i laughed a couple of times. apart from the talking parrot there wasn't an ounce of creativity to be noticed in the movie. i blame the director not using the premise to it's full potential. eva certainly has the comedic skill to show more but did not get the opportunity to do so. overall this movie is ideal for a sunday afternoon. other than that it can be skipped completely.
