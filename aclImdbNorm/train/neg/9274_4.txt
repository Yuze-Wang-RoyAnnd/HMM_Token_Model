this sequel is a total rehash of the first film. a completely pointless movie. it basically just took every single sceanrio of the first film and they redid it in omen iv except with a female antichrist this time. it even ends the same way as the first one! the music is too busy and interfering, and because its pretty much a copy of omen i, it's extremely predictable. it's not a horrible movie, it's not terribly made, there is much worse movies out there, this just had absolutely no point in being made. the omen remake from 2006 is much worse, even more pointless than this, so i guess it has that. if you someone pointed a gun to your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 reamke, i guess i'd choose this.
