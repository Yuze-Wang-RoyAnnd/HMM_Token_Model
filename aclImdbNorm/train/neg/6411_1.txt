the return is one of those movies for that niche group of people who like movies that bore and confuse them at the same time. sarah michelle gellar plays a lame buisnesswoman who does not kill vampires or get naked at all throughout the movie. i was willing to put up with this, however i was not willing to put up with the worst editing ever combined with pointless flashbacks. at the end it turns out she crashes her car into herself when she was young. or maybe i'm wrong and that was just a flashback. with this movie it's impossible to tell. can you believe the same dude who made army of darkness produced this crap? a much better idea is to stay at home and watch army of darkness on sci fi channel. that movie had it all: sluts, zombies and a dude with a chainsaw for an arm. the forgotten didn't even have one of these things.
