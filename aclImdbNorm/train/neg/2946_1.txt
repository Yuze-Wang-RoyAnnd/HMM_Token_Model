i must say that during my childhood i'm quite proud of a lot of the movies i've rented. the exception being theodore rex. talk about the all time swindler movie in any actor's resume. could you just imagine what whoopie's fired agent must have told her to sign on to this piece of crap "hey whoop, you ever seen that show dinosaurs, yeah well they're making a movie out of it, and you get to see germany!" after that that agent must have referenced star wars a lot.<br /><br />this movie was so bad i figured whoopie must have bought out every copy of this film and had it destroyed. i just wish she could have done the same thing to my memory, because my sister still gives me crap for watching that movie. i mean c'mon, i'll even admit i watched mr. nanny and kazzam in theaters (good reasons why i gave up on both hulk hogan and shaq for awhile), yet this one sticks out in my mind as the worst of my childhood, and the biggest rental regret of my life, and that was 16 years ago. i'm 24 now if you want to do the math.<br /><br />whenever i think of my all-time list of worst movies i don't even mention this one, because like a raped step-child, i try hard to repress that it ever happened. screw you whoopie, just be glad people only acknowledge eddie and sister act 2 as your worst you lucky stiff.
