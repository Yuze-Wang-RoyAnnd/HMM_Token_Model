the title should have been the walker. the guy expend 90% of the movie walking. he doesn't know what he wants, or what he is. go through life stealing peoples identity for nothing. he gets no benefit, no money, nothing pretending to be another person.<br /><br />no body was able to understand why he was pretending to be somebody else.<br /><br />the only thing that was clear in this movie is that he love his father and was a good son. but the rest was crap.<br /><br />may be director is a looser that would like to be somebody else. but what he really should do is to get a real job, because after his movie, i don't think he has a chance to make as a movie producer.
