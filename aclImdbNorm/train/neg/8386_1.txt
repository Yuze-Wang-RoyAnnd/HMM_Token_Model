ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel. it's too easy. so i'm going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of little man. first, i'm impressed with the special effects. it really did look like marlon wayans' head was attached to the body of a little person. i never doubted it for a minute.<br /><br />secondly, i loved some of the unexpected cameos. david alan grier played an annoying restaurant singer, and his renditions of "havin' my baby" and "movin' on up" were priceless. john witherspoon, who, coincidentally, played grier's father in 1992's boomerang (if you remember, he "coordinated" the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket) now plays vanessa's father in little man. so that was fun.<br /><br />beyond that, this movie is about as believable as white chicks. how dumb is it when even the doctor can't tell that it's a 40-year-old man and not a baby? he's got a full set of teeth!!! how is it possible that no one seems to notice that it's not a baby? little man is so bad that there's a rob schneider cameo. and please, if you're stupid enough to waste $8 on this movie, at least do me a favor and do not bring your children. this movie is way too sexual for small children (lots of jokes and innuendo about sex, going down, eating out, etc.), and i felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to the screening i was forced to endure. if you insist on seeing an idiotic film, as least spare your children the pain and suffering.
