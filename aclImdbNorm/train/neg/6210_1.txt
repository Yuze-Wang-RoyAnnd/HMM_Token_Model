this is the worst movie i have seen since "i know who killed me" with lindsey lohan. <br /><br />after watching this movie i can assure you that nothing but frustration and disappointment await you should you choose to go see this. hey, tim burton, i used to be a big fan of yours... did you even screen this movie? i mean seriously, what the f%#k?<br /><br />without giving anything away, here is the story in a vague nutshell... nine wakes up, he does stuff, his actions and decisions are irrelevant... and the movie ends. oh wait... here comes a spoiler...<br /><br />spoiler alert! spoiler alert! at the end of the movie.... it rains. i think a part of my soul died while watching this movie.
