the minute the forward started, i knew we were in for trouble! the premise is laughable at best. the story line was even worse, if that is possible.<br /><br />the acting was stiff and the actors gave off a sense of inexperience. you expect more from the likes of slater, reid and dorff. lines were delivered as if from a robot. and i'm sorry, i like reid but she was very unbelievable as an archaeologist. slater and dorff picked a lousy film to try and stage their comebacks. <br /><br />the continuity was off through out the entire film. the creatures weren't bad, but they really weren't good either. <br /><br />bottom line, i want that ninety minutes of my life back. they can keep the money, but give me the time! what a waste.
