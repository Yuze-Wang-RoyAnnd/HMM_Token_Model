up to this point, gentle rain was the movie i found the worst in history. it has been supplanted by this 'blockbuster' out of asia. it has one "star" and it is john rhys davies. he is way out of shape to be the swashbuckling, magical flying baddie he is cast here. the rest of these people couldn't act their way out of a junior high school play. no clich'es were missed in the dialogue, and the special effects were phoned in as often as possible.<br /><br />it is fairly easy to see that somebody in asia had some bucks and needed to create a vehicle for some actors they wanted to throw money at. or maybe it was a director or a writer that needed a credit. my guess is that any career with this movie in it's credential<br /><br />do yourself a major favor and don't watch this movie. a hundred thanksgivings couldn't consume this turkey.<br /><br />the one funny scene was unintentional. the brother of the king appears on the scene. the king? a handsome, older, short asian actor. (bad actor.) the brother? a six foot european. (also a bad actor.) no excuses were made for this. they just expected us not to notice that this poor man's jet li's brother was a wannabe pierce brosnan in a cheap dimestore "injun" wig right out of an old western movie from the forties.
