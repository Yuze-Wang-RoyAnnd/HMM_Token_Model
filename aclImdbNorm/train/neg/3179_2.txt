i saw this movie by accident yesterday at a cinema. i had some hopes for the movie because i really like spoorloos (the vanishing) and the book it's based on. the movie starts out okay as it at first seems to be a nice thriller. quickly though the movie becomes a mess with uninteresting plotlines, characters that are never fleshed out and nobody in the audience cared for (like marjoke) and terrible editing. the movie has fade to black bits that are just way too long, a messed up chronology that jumps back and forth and lots of scenes that just don't add anything to the story and could easily have been dropped. after suffering through the story you'll get treated to one of the worst endings i've seen in a very long. it should also be mentioned that the movie has lots of explicit sex scenes which you're probably used to if you watch a lot of dutch movies. it's hard to mention any good things about this movie. about a third of the audience had already walked out of the theater halfway into the movie and i didn't hear a kind word after the movie was over. avoid this movie at all costs. it really destroyed any faith i had left in the dutch movie industry.
