after finally viewing this movie in its entirety, i am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike. is it the worst western ever? no, i wouldn't say that. but "the last great american western", a phrase i saw applied to it more than once? not even close.<br /><br />a movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clich'ed that i've ever seen. the movie can be measured in groaners per minute; as in, how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life? there's so many instances of this that it's distracting. cheesy lines come at you in waves; predictable, unoriginal, and often. <br /><br />if bad dialogue doesn't bother you, then how about bad gunfights? few westerns can show you gunfighting that's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously. it's okay if there's a comic edge to such gunfighting, such as in silverado, but in tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good westerns. the final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score, but by then, i was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving.<br /><br />other than those flaws, i can say the visuals are stunning - the movie's well shot and the settings all look great. the acting is passable, especially considering what the actors were given to work with. however, if you're looking for the last great american western, do yourself a favor - go rent unforgiven instead.<br /><br />3 out of 10
