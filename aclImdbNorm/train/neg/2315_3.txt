years have gone by since don wilson used his martial arts expertise to take down a robot who was programmed to destroy him, he's also married to the blonde reporter (stacie foster) who led the rebellion in the first film, now a new conspiracy is in the works, one that involves look-alike droids who frame our two heroes, and a corporation looking to rule the world (there is no plot to back any of this up) and cyber tracker 2 becomes a virtual replay of the first movie. i admit that i have bought dvds from the bargain bin that were made by pm, pm was a company that specialized in cheap-jack action flicks (like this) which had tons of explosions, little story and overall nothing but mean edged action. some of these titles have been (mildly) enjoyable (last man standing and the sweeper) however cyber tracker 2 is stuck with the casting of the charisma-less don wilson. when comparing the protagonists of similar pm efforts both jeff wincott and c. thomas howell are oscar nominees when compared to don wilson. another telling sign is that this was directed by richard pepin who has none of the flair joseph merhi seems to have in crafting action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets. then again though both c. thomas and wincott are probably more expensive to obtain. cyber tracker 2 is a rip off with a capitol r, there are so many steals from better movies (robocop, terminator, universal soldier to even halloween iii!) that it's almost as if richard pepin is trying to infuse a sense of identity to the pedestrian material yet without the intelligent ideas or at least the mindless zip of great action, cyber tracker 2 falls flat. there is literally no good idea that isn't borrowed from a better movie and the supporting cast overact. the only exception comes from tony burton who is miles better than the material. also stacie foster looks like she could be better with far better material. however cyber tracker 2 comes off mainly as noisy, bland and lackluster as its leading man, however with no real martial arts sequences to fall back on, all there is, is lots of cars tipping over and that alone is no substitute for the bankruptcy of ambition expressed here.<br /><br />*1/2 out of 4-(poor)
