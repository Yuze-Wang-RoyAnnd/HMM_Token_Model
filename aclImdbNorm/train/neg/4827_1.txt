if this movie as meant to discourage people from doing drugs, it fails. i was ready to start using them i got waiting for something to happen and nothing ever really did. this movie is neither horror or drama. it's just the paranoia of meth users. this movie may win an award for the using the "f" word so many times and so uselessly. it was not well stated, but i felt like they were making meth to replace meth they owed to someone. hector just got worse and more paranoid as the movie went on and the girl just got more hopeless. the ending really made no sense. the movie made no sense unless it was just showing how annoying is is to be stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a meth-head. i relied on the other feedback when i decided to watch this movie and the rating on this movie should be a much lower average.
