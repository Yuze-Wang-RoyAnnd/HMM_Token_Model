well, what was fun... except for the fun part.<br /><br />it's my second least favorite so far, i even thought it was worse than 'lazarus' and 'ghost in the machine'.<br /><br />let's start with the good. the teaser, it was incredibly well done and also emotional. being the great animal lover that i am, it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode.<br /><br />but then there's all the bad, and believe me there is a lot of it. little made sense, so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated? whaaa??? the dialog was also pretty awful. there were about one or two quotable lines. <br /><br />and worst of all, having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me. in the end... what's the point? they all pretty much died. we didn't learn anything, we weren't entertained, and i couldn't even find sophia's death sad... just very frustrating.<br /><br />* star. shame because season 2 was doing so well.
