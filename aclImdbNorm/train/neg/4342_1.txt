i have to say this is one of the worst films i've ever seen. they had a pretty good storyline to go on, but than the messed it up so badly. first of all the cast is all wrong, where did that van peeble(crap actor btw) and puff daddy come from??? it looks like carlito has come from the hood, and used to hang about with some real idiots. this film doesn't do "carlitos way" any justice. im so happy that the sequel "carlito's way" came out first, if i had seen this rubbish first, i would have never given the pacino version a chance. and anyway, pacino is supposed to have read this story, thought it's crap and did the sequel instead. carlito's way: rise to power - 1 out of 10. carlito's way - 9 out of 10.
