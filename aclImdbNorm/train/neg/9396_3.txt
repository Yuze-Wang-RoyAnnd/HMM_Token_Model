the radar men from the moon is a pretty typical fare of 1950's serials. the special effects are pretty cheap, the lunar rovers are obviously world war ii surplus jeeps with painted plywood over them, and the like. the acting is only so-so. it does inspire the imagination of children, to whom i believe this was directed to. by today's standards, it's boring, cheap, and bad. there's also a hefty amount of stock footage in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters.
