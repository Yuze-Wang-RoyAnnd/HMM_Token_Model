there have been more interesting polish documentaries on worm farming, in brail_!! the competition (worm farming) had a better plot and more interesting characters. i was physically ill after watching this movie. the cheating husband (i think dougray_scott_) was a joke in every meaning of the word. poor jennifer must really need the work, and what was with the accent!!. the locations and random meetings reminded me of a high school prank, and showed the humility of a 10 year old in cooking class. it was that bad that i think i will write the sequel named "this is not a laxitive". thank you for listening it was a great weight of my conscious.
