i first read "lorna doone" about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it! it is a classic historical romance set in the 1600s when the west country was several days' journey from london and law and order was much harder to enforce. sadly, this version of the book takes several liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion. the acting and production values are ok but the way the story was messed about with was dreadful. why do television adaptations do this? why would they think that the thousands of fans of a book would want them to change the story??? one of life's great mysteries!!! the bbc made an excellent version which was televised at christmas in the early 1990s which i am still trying to track down a copy of! take my advice, read the book and don't bother with this paltry version!
