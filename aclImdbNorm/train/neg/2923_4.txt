the plot was quite interesting, with the russian revolution background. i also enjoyed seeing budapest as the movie was partly filmed there. sadly, there was zero chemistry between the 2 main characters so it was hard to believe the love story between them. the love scenes were forced and mechanical. jordan kirckland was really stiff, almost icy. rob stewart was quite charming and boyish, so she looked like his older sister rather than his girlfriend. the ending, when we finally figure out who was actually after them, was quite weak and made no sense whatsoever. i think i would have enjoyed this movie a lot better if the relationship between the 2 actors was slightly more credible.
