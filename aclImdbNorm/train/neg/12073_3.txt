***spoilers*** with a gathering of family members and servants of the late christopher dean, john carradine, to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the dean fortune, some 140 million dollars. the money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the dean mansion. there seemed to have been a mix-up in the story when we later find out that it's really an overnight sleepover, not a weeks vacation, at the mansion for the guests to qualify for dean's money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise.<br /><br />the first victim of the dean curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed christopher dean estate the local sheriff dan garcia, rodolfo acosta. acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests. later that evening cute little chin greg and laura's,jeff morrow & marry anders,little pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pond.<br /><br />the movie has all the people staying at the dean mansion being picked off one by one until it's revealed who the killer really is. we then have what seems to be a double-twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest. the real killer ends up not only getting all the loot, 140 million dollars, but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him, or her, in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot.<br /><br />nonsensical who done it, and haunted house, movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother, much less the audience, would have trouble liking. there's everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest s&m sadism and of course double-dealing and back-stabbing not even counting murder. you just couldn't care less who of the guests survives to collect the dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do.<br /><br />even the big surprise at the end isn't really that much of a surprise since the killer's identity is divulged with the film-maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself! we then have a plot-twist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is. the final plot-twist, that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away, was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie.
