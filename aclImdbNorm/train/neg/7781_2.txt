tough guys, sexy women, lots of swearing, and a most unconvincing monster that rises from the depths of a polluted lake. you'd think "monster" would be fun...but it isn't, really. it does star tony eisley and john carradine, however, and in my book that makes it worth viewing at least once. in an interview with "fangoria" in 1987, eisley recalled that herbert strock had directed the bulk of the film, but somehow kenneth hartford--who only directed the footage featuring his children andrea and glenn (portraying characters named andrea and glenn, in a particularly inventive turn)--received full credit. considering how awful the end result was, strock was probably glad that he hadn't been credited! "monster" has the look and feel of a mid-to-late-seventies tv movie, which is why i like to leave it on in the background every so often. as entertainment it falls flat on its face, but as a reminder of another age and a vanished type of film-making, it's very effective. the only thing that's missing is a car chase.
