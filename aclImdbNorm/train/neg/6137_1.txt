whew. what can be said about gymkata that hasn't already? this is nothing but pure halarity from beginning to end. if you want a movie that will keep you on the floor laughing, this is the perfect movie to get. from cabot's wild-style mullet/sweater combo to parmistan (and it's four billion assorted ninjas), everything about this film reeks of crap.<br /><br />directed by robert clouse, the infamous mind that brought you the mirror scene in bruce lee's game of death, he once again showcases his complete lack of directing talent. a few other faces you most likely won't recognize will appear for your enjoyment as well, from buck kartalian to tadashi yamashita, although you won't remember them or care about them after the movie is done.<br /><br />supposedly based on a book called "the terrible game," which, if i could find a single trace of it's existence anywhere i would be interested in reading it, to see where this thing went wrong. instead, the book apparently is a figment of gymkata's imagination. probably something clouse made up in order to sell his lame idea.<br /><br />pick this one up and yakmallah it for yourself. it is easily one of the best bad movies i have ever seen, and that is saying quite a bit.
