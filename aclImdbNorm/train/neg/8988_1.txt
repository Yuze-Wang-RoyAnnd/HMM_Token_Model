until now, the worst movie i had ever seen was ben & arthur. you really should check the reviews for that movie instead of this one. the review statistics for this movie have been skewed positive through a relentless and unscrupulous push by some of the people involved in making it, evidence for which is fairly easy to uncover online. at least the people who made ben & arthur were honorable enough to let it stand on its own shaky legs, instead of unscrupulously promoting it so suckers like me would buy it.<br /><br />everything about this movie is terrible, the script, the story, the casting, the acting, the direction, the photography, the editing, the music... what else goes into a movie? whatever it is, here it's as bad as it gets. if it weren't so unpleasant it would be ridiculous. i kept watching it thinking it must get better, because i hadn't yet discovered that none of the positive reviews for it are reliable.<br /><br />it does not take a lot of money to make a great movie, nor does a low budget mean a movie has to be bad. my favorite example of a shoestring-budget masterpiece is gus van sant's amazing mala noche, but there are many others. sideline secrets
