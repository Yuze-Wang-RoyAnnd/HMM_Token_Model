it's hard to say what was the worst thing about this show: the bad acting, poor acoustics of different portions, bad cgi, improper sets for the period, the poor script. it would have been nice if the script followed the original tale a bit closer -- there's enough tension and good material in beowulf to provide a great deal of good material, and a better story line, than the scriptwriters could come up with.<br /><br />and why introduce a strange new weapon like a crossbow that fires explosive bolts?<br /><br />i see that this movie was made in "only" 21 days. it shows in the lack of quality. i'm beginning to think this is general (poor) attitude taken by sci-fi channel (and others) when it comes to making movies out of classic tales in the past few years.<br /><br />what a waste!
