here's the good news first. "spirit" is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release. the artwork and effects are revolutionary, and i recommend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visuals alone.<br /><br />and now for the bad news. i really mean it when i say that the animation is the only thing this movie has going for it. you may remember that "spirit" got badly trounced by "lilo and stitch" last summer. the first person who argues that it was because disney is more well-established and had better advertising can write me a four page long essay entitled "why 'lilo and stitch''s script didn't stink".<br /><br />for all the incredible new animation technology on display in "spirit", the story is almost *astonishingly* dull. there is a lesson here, and (needless to say) it doesn't just apply to animated movies. you can have the most mind-blowing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, we don't care about your characters, it's bad film-making. simple as that. the animation is still mind-blowing; i just can't wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it.
