with this cast and budget you will expect more.<br /><br />john cusack has made a number movies that border on the strange, yet still work. neither he, his sister, nor sir ben could do anything to save this travesty of trite poorly written garbage.<br /><br />the movie is nothing more than a series of sight gags and poor ones at that. the plot goes nowhere, the writing is contrived, senseless and the characters paper thin. if you think of a movie as being three dimensional where the story and characters bring a depth to the imagery, this stinker comes across as flat as steamboat mickey.<br /><br />dan akroyd's appearance in this brought back memories of another truly awful movie, 1991's nothing but trouble. frankly this movie is the type of project that kills careers and gets agents fired.
