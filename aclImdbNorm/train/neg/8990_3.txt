steven vasquez directed and co-wrote with james townsend, the star, this strange little drama cum horror flick with evidently very good ideas and intentions: make a gay film that takes a different storyline than the usual fare and make a drama that wants to be judged on its merits as a thriller. so why doesn't it work? for starters the film loses direction from the opening frame and wanders rather aimlessly throughout the film, dead set on making a suspense thriller but getting sidetracked into satisfying an audience who wants to see nude encounters. not that that is a bad thing: it can certainly enhance some films that have been hollywood successes. the film also tries to talk about coming out experiences in young men and women, relationships, disturbed parenting, the club scene with all the wild antics that accompany such events - and murder. it is all a bit much to cram into a 96-minute film.<br /><br />devon (james townsend) by all appearances is a successful kid with a kind girlfriend jenna (sarah kelly) but he has an eye for boys and visits a bar where he meets brian (alex wilson) who has been down the same path and can offer devon assistance on every level. they bond, devon comes out, and the mysteries begin: boys are missing in the neighborhood, devon's stepfather psychologist dr. kirk tyler (dan swett) is not at all what he appears to be and despite devon's consoling mother donna (sonja fisher) devon is cast into the streets because of his new relationship. it seems dr tyler is in a dark business with hunky detective cunningham (earl mcdougle) who apparently is investigating the missing boys... devon gathers his resources from his understanding girlfriend jenna and her cronies and together the group unveils the dark doings of dr. tyler and his detective sidekick. and through it all donna radiates warmth and understanding as the perfect mother of a gay boy, etc.<br /><br />some of the actors are pleasing to the eye (and there is very little the eye doesn't examine frequently!) but the degree of acting is at an all time low. the only thing that makes us forgive that (and in some cases it is just too poor to forgive) is the feeling of commitment on the part of everyone involved. yes, this is a low budget movie and yes, the director needs time to learn his trade. but in the end there is something to be said for the involved people to try to take a gay film to a different level. maybe their next one will be more polished. grady harp
