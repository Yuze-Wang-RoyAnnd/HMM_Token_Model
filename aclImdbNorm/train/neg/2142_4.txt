if you are under the age of 6 or 7, then you're going to really enjoy this movie. my youngest daughter is glued to the tv when she watches it. as an adult, i can't stand it!! i'm all up for sequels....when they have a decent storyline. but this is nowhere near up to standard. please forgive me for slating what is after all a kid's film, but when you have to sit through it nearly every day when your kids who love it so much, you'll understand why. my daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her.<br /><br />i've given this film 4 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained.
