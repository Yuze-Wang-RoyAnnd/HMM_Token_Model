...from this awful movie! there are so many things wrong with this film, acting, writing, direction, editing, etc. that it's amazing that something rises to the top and proves itself to be the absolute worst. the music! i noted that the film has two composers listed. this must be the reason why every single frame has music, of the absolute worst "d" movie style drivel. they have never heard of the expression "less is more". it got so painful to listen to, i muted the sound every time there was no dialogue, not that the dialogue was that good. you have to feel sorry for robert wagner and tom bosley, i'm sure they didn't see roles like this in the twilight of their careers. see it at your own risk.
