pretty bad movie offers nothing new. the usual creaks and moans attempt to make-up for a muddled, but thin story. acting is barely above pathetic. why liam neeson signed on for this is anyone's guess. owen wilson truly turns in one of the worst performances in recent horror-movie history. catherine zeta jones is fun to look at and not much else although lili tayor did an above-average job. the special effects were fairly memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and hauntingly gorgeous. however they can't makeup for the poor acting and the storyline which appears to have been thrown together at the last minute. don't bother.
