i thought that my favorite martian was very boring and drawn out!! it was not funny at all. the audience just sat through the whole movie and didn't laugh at all!!! not even the kids laughed!! that is sad for a disney movie!! i thought they could have found somebody better to play the martian rather than christopher lloyd!! he was really stupid!! and he was not funny!! i thought the talking suit was really dumb!!! in the original television series the suit doesn't talk and move around!! in my opinion they should not have wasted their time on this movie!! i give it two thumbes down!! really a waste of time and i would not recommend the movie to anybody!!! thank you!!
