julia stiles is a talented young actress, who with guidance from a reputable agent has a lot of potential. obviously, the person who guided her into this travesty is not someone who cares anything about her career. i sat in the theater surrounded by teenagers who left in droves to find another movie to sneak into wondering who thought this movie would appeal to anyone. it was poorly written, the casting director could only have put 1 or 2 minutes of effort into the characters and the director obviously didn't care.
