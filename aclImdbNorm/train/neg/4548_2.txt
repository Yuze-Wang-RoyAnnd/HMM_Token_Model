boring. minimal plot. no character development. i went into this movie with high expectations from the book. it could have been an awesome movie. it could have probably become a cult classic. nope, it was a giant let-down. it was poorly cast and had horrible special effects. it was difficult to determine who were the bad guys: the rebels or the military or the church or all of them? i am still left puzzled by certain mini-plots from the movie. i am left dumbfounded as to certain aspects of this so-called "prophecy", which is never really fully explained. i felt like i was watching a corny episode of a mini-series on the sci-fi channel. it seemed very much like a made-for-tv movie. don't go see this movie. it is a waste of time and money.
