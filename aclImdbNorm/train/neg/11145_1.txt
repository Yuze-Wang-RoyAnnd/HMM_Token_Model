where to start ?! . . . i feel ... violated! thats right, violated! i just spent 1.5hrs of my life, 1.5hrs that i could have spent doing something more useful, like watching paint dry, on this so called horror flick.<br /><br />its not scary, its not funny, its not dramatic, its no action, its nothing...<br /><br />its predictable, its boring, its tragic...<br /><br />i might come of a bit harsh here, but watch this movie and you will feel the same way ... or ... no, don't watch it...unless you want to feel violated also.
