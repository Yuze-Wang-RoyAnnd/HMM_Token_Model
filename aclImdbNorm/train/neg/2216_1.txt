i am a lover of b movies, give me a genetically mutated bat and i am in heaven. these movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world. even a stupid b movie will usually make me laugh and i will still consider it a good thing. then there was hammerhead, which was so awful i had to register with imdb so i could warn others. first there was the science of creating the shark-man, which the movie barely touched on. in order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes. during one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead (what fabulous special effects). back to the science, i thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue. anyway this movie had poor plot development, terrible story, and i'm sorry to say pretty bad acting. not even william forsythe, hunter tylo or jeffrey combs could save this stinker.
