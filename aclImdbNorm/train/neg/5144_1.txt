the orange tone to everything was just yucky. oh yeah, the main character lives in a ghetto that is all orange-tinted with orange-tinted people. meanwhile, to mentally escape from this crushing poverty of the body, she plays a full-immersion video game (which sucks in that no rules are clear and no logic follows the gameplay). she apparently earns an income playing the game but she is revealed to not be an employee of the game company?. lots of non-speaking pauses later the story drags on slowly. she uses a glitchy orange computer interface with an operating interface that is so visually annoying and i can only suspect a microsoft future release.<br /><br />meanwhile, i the viewer, ask basically why she is wasting her precious time in some moronic game when she barely has the necessities of life? oh yeah, playing games is fun, but what is the point when you're almost starving? while she is piddling her life away playing some lousy even-more-orange-tinted lame full-immersion video game her dog runs off (probably looking for an owner who pays at least a moment of attention to it and feeds it regularly) or is stolen from the woman (while she is ignoring her lousy orange-tinted reality).<br /><br />meanwhile she obsesses over some game her game-playing team lost the entire uninteresting movie. yawn. so she wants to be the best of the best, go get them ash catchem (got to bore us all). golly, this main character sucks as a human being as well and has no redeeming qualities aside from her physical beauty (which she could barter for some manner to escape her crushing poverty).<br /><br />so she reaches the "real" level and it, at least, not sucks horribly and she is sent to kill a former comatose teammate mentally living in the "real" level. finally the sucky boring bland orange-tinted movie is no longer a tedious chore to watch, but has the potential to say something along the lines "the main character is trapped in imaginary computer-generated poverty and she is actually in the real world now". perhaps she will do the murder deed and live in the real world now? well, she kills the guy and he vanishes in a digital effect. wow! thanks idiotic director. you suck, you suck so very much, director.<br /><br />here the director had an iota of a chance to redeem himself slightly by burying this lousy lame moronic cruddy movie with a philosophical twist.<br /><br />the director could have said, "the real world is there and if you live in it and contribute to it to make it better, it won't be some cruddy orange-tinted poverty land." a clever way to make this suck-tacular movie a agonizingly slow lesson on basic civic pride (for the 1% of the viewers that haven't found something actually entertaining to watch at this point or are movie-masochists).<br /><br />nope, director. the director had to screw this all up by tossing in some cruddy digital effect and ruin all chances of redemption for this awfully lousy movie which was a waste of money, a waste of time, and a waste of viewer trust.<br /><br />after that, it ends. good riddance. i hope the director chokes on it. i'm putting this hack on my "avoid at all costs" list for any other films his name is attached to.
