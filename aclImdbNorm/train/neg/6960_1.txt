after watching the first 20mn of blanche(sorry i couldn't take more of it), i have now confirmed she does not. <br /><br />basically, this "movie" is an insult to the real french actors participating in this farcical piece of junk. it starts from a concept successfully used in french comedies ("deux heures moins le quart avant jesus christ", "la folie des grandeurs",...): a historical movie with anachronic tone / dialogues. this can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a "finesse" of direction avoiding the dreaded "heavy comedy" stigma.<br /><br />unfortunately, the horsey-faced lou doillon ruins everything and blanche, instead of a comedy, just turns into an horror movie. horror to cinephiles who want to be puzzled and shocked watching fine actors such as decaune, zem or rochefort struggling in the middle of this gaudy burlesque kitchy-prissy farce.
