the legend of bloody jack is set in the alaskan wilderness & starts as a relative of some murderous deceased occultist lumberjack reads incantations (the evil dead (1982) style) from an ancient spell book in an attempt to resurrect him, he succeeds & not being a big believer in family unity the lumberjack dude kills his relative. two days later & ray (travis quentin young) along with his sister dawn (erica hoag), her boyfriend nick (craig bonacorsi) & four of their friends pull up outside a cosy log cabin (the evil dead style...) with a view to a relaxing weekend in the wilderness. unfortuntaely the killer lumberjack dude show's up with his axe & starts to slaughter the friends one-by-one...<br /><br />edited, written, executive produced & directed by todd portugal this is a pretty rotten modern slasher flick the likes of which are killing the horror genre for me, i'm just not a big fan of ultra low budget horror films with the production values of a holiday video. the script is absolutely terrible in every way for 80 minutes, it has every bad slasher clich'e, the character's are awful, the dialogue is terrible & it's hard to care about anyone or anything in this pretty worthless excuse for a teen slasher film. the teens are even more annoying & stupid than usual, the script is more moronic, predictable & flawed than usual & the killer lumberjack dude is just lame. then there's the final 10 minutes or so which, if you make it that far & believe it's tough going, produces one of the worst twist ending in slasher film history which as far as i'm concerned pokes fun at us the paying audience who has just had to sit through 90 minutes worth of crap. i will now spoil the ending so anyone who doesn't want to know it stop reading now. basically just before the end of the film it cuts back to ray telling a story & it turns out he was telling the story of what we had just seen & nick & dawn & everyone else berates him for telling such a bad story (i felt their pain) & then proceed to pick holes in it & laugh at it. from saying why did they stand around & argue, why didn't they pick the axe up & such things, i felt like this was poking fun at the audience as those were the sorts of things i was asking myself while watching this crap & to have it shoved down my throat & made perfectly clear that the makers knew the script was crap & could see all the holes in it & went for a twist ending which unashamedly rubbishes the preceding 80 minutes (which we have just had to sit through remember) is just a little grating. then to add insult to injury the lumberjack dude turns up & kills everyone within two minutes, why didn't he do that to start with? it would have saved everyone a lot of time.<br /><br />director portugal turns in a real mess, this has the worst continuity between night & day in a film i have ever seen. the whole film is meant to set at night & i suspect the makers tried to use the day for night process but it didn't work & most of it looks like it is set during the day. for example, look at when lisa is trapped in the bathroom & she climbs out of the window. it is clearly pitch black outside when we are looking out from inside the bathroom but when she falls to the ground & the films cuts to an exterior shot it's bright daylight. then there's the fact ranger vince says we can't get a search party out here until 'the morning' indicating it was supposed to be night, then several minutes later when he walks outside & it looks like it's the middle of the day he is actually carrying around a torch which is clearly on & he is clearly pointing it in the directions where he is looking like it's night. anytime there is a scene set in the cabin look at the windows, it's pitch black outside & when the ranger walks in through the door to start with is also another clear example. the continuity in this film is simply the worst i have ever seen. there isn't much gore, there are a few scenes of an axe going into people bodies but nothing memorable. it's not scary, there's no tension or atmosphere & the appalling day & night continuity is just so distracting because it's so obvious.<br /><br />technically the film is rock bottom, again the continuity between night & day has to been seen to be believed how bad it is. the special effects are poor & they couldn't even afford to show a car blowing up even though it's pretty vital to the plot. this has amateur hour written all over it from start to finish. the acting is absolutely brilliant & everyone involved should get an oscar, nah only joking, not really they were utterly awful & even the girls who got their breasts out weren't very good looking.<br /><br />the legend of bloody jack is just an awful teen slasher flick, it looks like it was shot on a camcorder without the use of a tripod or steadycam, it has awful effects, is boring & has a twist ending which is either the most insulting in horror film history or i've got it totally wrong & it's the most clever. not recommended, watch a decent slasher from the 70's or 80's to remind you how they should be done.
