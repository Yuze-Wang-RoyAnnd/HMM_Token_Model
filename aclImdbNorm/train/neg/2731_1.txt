truly bad and easily the worst episode i have ever seen....ever.<br /><br />they tried to make up for it by giving it the, 'we know we are doing this' routine. that would have been funny if it weren't for the fact that 'the simpsons' had already done it. and it still wouldn't make up for it if they had come up with the idea in the first place.<br /><br />the flashbacks took place as part of the usual character's (mainly j.d's) fantasies. the flashbacks weren't even of actual events that occurred, just compilations of say, j.d falling over or, i don't know.... elliott falling over. if i wanted to watch a scrubs compilation i'd go on youtube and not waste half an hour of my life.<br /><br />scrubs has ultimately fallen into the trap that most sit-coms have to, and it disappoints me, they managed to go 5 and a quarter seasons without an episode like this. <br /><br />i was hoping that scrubs wouldn't have to be that kind of sit-com.<br /><br />and just as a passing thought, why the hell was dr.cox bald?
