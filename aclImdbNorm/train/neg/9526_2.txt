way back when i was renting videos for free i picked this one up. oops the things i wanted to mention outside the summary already given were these. 1: someone who had a lot to do with making this movie had a strange and sick fascination for food, it was gross and unecessary. 2: there is some kind of a soundtrack in the background of the film that seems to be there the entire time and by the way i felt for days after viewing this trash i figure they had something subliminal going on in the track. either that or it was just traumatisingly bad or both. many times throughout the movie you can tell the writer and director did not have much experience or talent. and don't even ask about the acting.
