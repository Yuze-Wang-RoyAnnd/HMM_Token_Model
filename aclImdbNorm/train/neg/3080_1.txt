hee hee hee. this movie is so bad that it doesn't even try to hide the fact that it sucks big time. i remember the day i first saw this on mst. sun was shining, looked like a good day. then, i saw this product of rick sloane which consisted of horrible plush dolls wreaking havoc in the crappy 80s fest land. kevin, wussy extraordinaire, tries to impress his girlfriend, manages an assistant security guard job, fights with rakes, and plenty more stuff in this very badly made series of images. no plot or story is needed. obviously no acting is necessary as the film proves. an army guy and his sex crazed girl will make you wanna leap off a cliff, and the dorky friend who gets his kicks off phone sex will make you say, " he has got some nice red shorts". plus, i really hated the old security guard and wished he had an accident in his supermarket cart. just when you think it's over, wait until the club scum scene. ask for road rash.<br /><br />i advise that after viewing this film, a good month to regain senses and sanity. and if you see rick sloane, give him a good kick to the groin to show how much we appreciate this crapsterpiece called hobgoblins.
