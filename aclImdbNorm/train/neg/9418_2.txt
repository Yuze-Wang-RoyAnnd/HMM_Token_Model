this is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and re-naming. it doesn't work at all. firstly the dramaturgy is all wrong. it's very slow moving at first and then hastily and unsatisfactorily moves to an end. but there is also (and that may have to do with the cuts) an uneasy moving between genres. it starts off with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire. the ending may be funny but it's also so blunt that i almost felt it insulted my intelligence (what little there is). so the film tries to be everything but does not really succeed on any level at all. you can also see that in the very unsteady character development.you almost get the impression connery plays three roles rather than one.
