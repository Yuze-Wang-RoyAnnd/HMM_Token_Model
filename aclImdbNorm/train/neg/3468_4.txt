a student filmmaker enlists a b-grade actress (a delectably diva-ish molly ringwald!) to complete the horror film that her mother (a dreadfully dull kylie minogue!) tried to make 12 years ago. it's a curious plot choice to say the least, as any aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors. the film has a curse on it, because molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set. but she's back, because she needs the exposure. unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start dying on the "set." cut is an aussie attempt at the modern "slasher," but unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table. in fact, it rips half of wes craven's 90s filmography. lots of film-world name-dropping a la "scream" (except it's aussie name-dropping--jane campion...see how this isn't as funny) and lots of "is this real or is this a movie" a la "new nightmare." the editing is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are laughable, almost everything is bad about this. fortunately, the film can have a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at: "don't worry, we'll treat your house as if it were our own," to which he responds, "that doesn't mean anything to me, you look like you live in a dump!" ha! and molly's ridiculous one-liners were enough to not regret renting this one. "you got any diet coke in here?" (as she rides in the film professor's car) and "does anyone know where i can buy any tofu?" (the first thing she mutters on the set) and "where the hell is my agent?" (oh wait, that's what i was thinking for her.)
