i am a big movie fan. i like movies of all types. this is arguably the worst movie i've ever seen.<br /><br />i get that it follows the book closely, which raises the point that not everything should be made into a movie. especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book have been called into question more than once.<br /><br />these characters are not quirky, they are mentally ill. the things that happen are not funny, they are disturbing; especially considering they are supposed to be true.<br /><br />this movie had the feel of the royal tenenbaums, another movie i hated, only running with scissors was even more dysfunctional and less funny.<br /><br />i will never get those hours back. i wanted to wash my brain after watching.
