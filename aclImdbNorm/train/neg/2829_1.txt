the worst, and chock full of people who really ought to know better, (the cast have six oscars between them). it's set in 'contemporary' africa, (it was made in 1979), and is about the slave trade. it's appallingly scripted and acted, (michael caine, peter ustinov and william holden reach a career low in this one), and completely lacks excitement never mind any moral focus. it's also ludicrously plotted. you don't for a minute believe that any of the characters would behave in the way they do under these circumstances. richard fleischer directs but you get the impression it was over the telephone. this is as bad as it gets.
