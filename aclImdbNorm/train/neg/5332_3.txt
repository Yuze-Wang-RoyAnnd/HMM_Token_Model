ok, the portrayal of the stereotyped 'indians' in this story is just plain wrong. i do agree that elvis looks rather good here, but yeah, his skin color does seem to change during the movie. i was thinking, ok,...he was never that tan in real life. it's some of the most obvious brown 'indian' makeup that i have ever seen. it's as bad as the 'indians' on 'f-troop' and the old hollywood westerns who were played by jewish and italian american actors and not real native americans!<br /><br />this movie is o.k., but typically lame story and mediocre songs, like in all of elvis' later films. he just did them because colonel parker had him tied down to long term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of elvis as possible! i keep thinking 'thank god' that elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out. it is cool to see character actors joan blondell, katy jurado, l.q. jones, henry jones and burgess meredith in this movie, though.<br /><br />burgess meredith's 'indian' makeup is absolutely awful. it's the worst of the bunch for sure. what were the filmmakers thinking? was mr. meredith doing this one just for the money or what? i do love certain elvis movies, though. for example: 'love me tender', 'jailhouse rock', 'viva las vegas'. i can even stand to watch his movie with future tv co-stars mary tyler moore and ed asner,'change of habit' in which elvis plays an inner-city doctor.<br /><br />oh well, at least elvis made a few good films, but the mediocre and bad ones overwhelm the decent and good ones.<br /><br />i'll always love elvis! thank you, thank you very much!
