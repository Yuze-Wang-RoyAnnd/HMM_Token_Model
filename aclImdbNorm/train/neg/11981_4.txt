yes, marie dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is poison and she exits running.<br /><br />dresler is good. never my cup of tea but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screen.<br /><br />i watched this for polly moran, whom i've seen elsewhere. here, moran is ok -- just ok -- as dressler's shrewish friend/foe. too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion.<br /><br />the plot is good hearted. bad guys try to rob the townspeople. dressler triumphs and all ends well.<br /><br />i do wonder about the central plot mechanism: bonds. this came out during the depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly. i, however, not of that era, am vaguely familiar with them. they're like stocks only different, right? it seems odd to build a story about the little man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity.
