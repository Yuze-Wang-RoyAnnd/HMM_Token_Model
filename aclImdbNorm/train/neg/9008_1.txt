there have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that i really liked. this was not one of them.<br /><br />it was overacted and used camera techniques that made me feel like i was watching a soap opera. it was ludicrously predictable and took most of the movie to get going then left you asking "that's it?". once i decided not to take the movie too seriously and watch it from a purely corny point of view it became more enjoyable. this is one movie that would have wound up on mst3000 if it was still on.
