ohhh the brutality, ohhhhh the dying breed, ohhhh the sense of loss, ohhhh the prejudice! jeez, when are all you whiney revisionists going to stop analyzing westerns for crying out loud? s**t happens. if it offends your socially engineered sensibilities then go back to the comfort of your meryl steep collection.<br /><br />boring, tedious, and very tiresome waste of celluloid-particularly in light of coburn/hackman/bergen's presence. nothing interesting or intriguing here, unless you are obsessed with 19th century desert dentisty. may have been a little better without the constant diversion of the out-of-place mexican guy with the bad tooth. a monument to the stupid ultra-left creeping sensitivity of the 60/70's. virtually impossible to sit through the entire film. i think i'd rather have my eyes stapled open for the entire lucky luke/trinity series. 4 horses/10-all deader'n hell.
