i was utterly disappointed by this movie. i had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations. i expected a drama with more intense character development. but that never happens in the movie. daniel-day lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe. i tought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. i would rate his performance 6 out of 10.<br /><br />acting: 6 out of 10 direction is 5 out of 10. script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /><br />i deleted the movie from my dvr at 70 mins. into the movie. much better movies out there than this...
