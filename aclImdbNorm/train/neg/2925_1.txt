after reading several good reviews as well as hearing nice things about it by word of mouth i decided to rent come undone. i must say i was rather disappointed. the story was hard to follow because the film is set as a series of flashbacks between the present and recent past that are very poorly executed. the characters, despite the actors best efforts are flat and uninteresting. the sex is and nudity are more explicit than they need to be. i've never seen a film where they seemed so unnecessary to the plot. the ending is very anti-climatic and leaves many unanswered questions to a story line that wasn't explained well to begin with. in my opinion, a waste of time.
