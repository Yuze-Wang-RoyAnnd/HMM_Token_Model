i just want to start by saying this is the first review of a film i have done on the net. i felt the need to warn people about this film because it truly is one of the worst films i have ever seen. after reading interviews with the director he says he respects constructive criticism and so i will try to avoid bashing the film just for the sake of it and offer my opinions as to why i found it to be so catastrophically terrible.<br /><br />1. the actors. i know the budget may not have allowed for great thespians but with nicholson working in the industry for over ten years surely he knew some actors who were at least average.<br /><br />2. the incredibly lame make up and special effects. once again budget obviously interfered with what was originally intended but after working in make up for so many years there is really no excuse.<br /><br />3. the obvious similarities to hostel. whilst not being exactly a rip off it sure does try to cash in on the former films success. only problem is roth knew where he was going and exactly how to get there...<br /><br />4. the music. not at all creepy or haunting not even sickening just plain annoying.<br /><br />5. the script in general. all dialogue was forced and terrible! also the sub plots about the theatre and the guy who comes in to save them were weak as and almost like an afterthought.<br /><br />6. the editing. wtf. how jarring, and not in a good way. nuf said.<br /><br />seriously i would like to hear the director's thoughts on my post (he no doubt frequents his pages on imdb.) cause buddy... what were you thinking. surely at some point during either the shooting or editing you realised what a turkey yolu had on your hands... sorry i don't want to be harsh but you must have more talent than this i hope your next feature that gutterballs movie or wahtever is better, hopefully practice makes progress.<br /><br />but in the mean time avoid this like the plague. i want my 81 mins back with interest. (at least i didn't pay to watch it.)
