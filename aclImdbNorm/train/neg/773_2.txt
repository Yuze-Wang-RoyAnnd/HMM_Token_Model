no, not the administration of gwb, the decider/strutter/smirker--but the mini-series "monarch cove." lifetime must have realized what a dog this was because the series was burned off two episodes at a time, most of them broadcast between 11 p.m. friday nights and 1 a.m. saturday mornings. as to why i watched the whole thing, i can only plead to weekly sudden convulsive attacks of masochism.<br /><br />most of the cast are unknowns who are likely to remain unknown. the only two recognizable names are shirley jones and rachel ward, who turn in the only decent performances (jones doesn't make it through the entire series--lucky woman). ward, by the way, is aging quite well since her "thorn birds" days.<br /><br />the one main thread to the plot--who murdered the father of the heroine who is wrongly convicted of dad's murder but is freed after six years in the slammer--is stretched out for so long and concluded so hastily that you won't especially care who dun it. there is a great deal of "steamy" sex, several murders, and all sorts of rude behavior--virtually none of which is either interesting or credible. most of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely not talented. the writing and direction is on a par with the cast.<br /><br />if you stick around to the end, the post card is a (very minor)hoot.<br /><br />consider yourself warned!
