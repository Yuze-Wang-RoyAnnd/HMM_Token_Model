written and acted by sincere amateurs, produced by some exploitation monger, this is dull and hard to watch.<br /><br />not the worst movie ever, but at least schlock like _plan 9 from outer space_ usually had a real actor or two. i'd recommend _a thief in the night_ only to hardcore ironists and hardcore dispensationalists. i'm neither.<br /><br />don't believe me? watch it for free (albeit sourced from poor vhs) here: http://www.archive.org/details/thief-in-the-night<br /><br />relevant links added mostly to reach imdb's 10-line minimum: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dispensationalism http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3199/thief-in-the-night-se-a/
