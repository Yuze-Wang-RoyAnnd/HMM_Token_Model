this was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it, the fast-moving story, an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths, etc. funny thing is, you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but "white" as anything else would be deemed racist by the pc police. <br /><br />nonetheless, woody harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players, is interesting as is his main counterpart wesley snipes.<br /><br />snipes had a lot of funny put-down lines, providing much of the humor. the bad part of the film - which doesn't bother a lot of people - is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters. that includes woody's girlfriend, played by rosie perez. there are no really clean, nice people in this movie. for that reason, i can't honestly recommend the film, at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity
