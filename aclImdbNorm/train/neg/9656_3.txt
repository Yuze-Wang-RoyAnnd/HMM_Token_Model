this movie has the made for tv stink all over it. though, it started out with great intentions, featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes. the film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue, and rushed tv sappy melodramatic acting. the characters were so sappy that at times i thought that they are about to degenerate into a bilious puddle of goo, and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another. the germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to watch. the only thing that the german officers talked about was how wonderful the americans are. please take my word for this. i am a huge fan of the war genre, and this movie is crap. nevertheless, this dvd does have an excellent extra feature, covering letters from the wwi front lines, thus making this rental not a total waste of my time.
