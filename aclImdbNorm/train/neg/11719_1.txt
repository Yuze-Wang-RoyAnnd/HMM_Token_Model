in the words of charles dance's character in this film, "bollocks!" no plot, no character development, and utterly unbelievable.<br /><br />full of stuff that just doesn't happen in the real world (since when were british police inspectors armed with handguns in shoulder holsters?). full of mistakes (bulgarian trains in london?). full of dull and artificial dialogue. and the directing/editing is awful - wobbly hand-held camera shots that add nothing to the film except a vague feeling of seasickness; confusing jump-cuts; no structure.<br /><br />wesley snipes' character is totally unsympathetic - why should we care what happens to him? direct to video? direct to the dustbin!
