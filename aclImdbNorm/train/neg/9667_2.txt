this film is justly famous as one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced. the insistent equation of jews with disease is simply<br /><br />pathological, and even worse it almost becomes believable for brief seconds<br /><br />through its sheer repetition. the fact that something this crude works, even<br /><br />briefly, is an object lesson in itself. you have to have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through this, and i wouldn't recommend trying unless you have a good reason.
