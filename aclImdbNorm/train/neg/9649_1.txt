who were they kidding with this? there was just too much in this film that was hard to digest. right from when arjun (ajay devgan) unknowingly wishes death on his father to when he arrives in london with his uncle(played by om puri) only to abandon him minutes later. the only problem with that theory is that anybody who has ever passed through london heathrow knows that such a f^ete would be impossible to pull off and especially not by an indian. but the film problems do not end there, there's the issue of the two main leads (salman khan and ajay devgan) passing as rock-stars on the verge of achieving their dreams. i mean yeah we saw success come to susan boyle (a woman in the uk achieving her dreams after age 50) but that was a rare case. it was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief because i felt that the casting of salman and ajay was just ill-conceived. they would never cast madhuri dixit and sridevi to play the same roles so why should we be forced to watch ajay devgan and salman khan (men well into their 40s) prance around desperately trying to hang on to their 20s? let's not even talk about the most self-conscious actress on screen today, asin. this is her second film (that i have seen) and she is just hopeless as an actress, so conscious of her looks that she only concerns herself with looking good and voguing for the camera rather than giving in a good acting performance. it's just hard to believe that she turned down all those other movie roles to star in this fluff and then be so fluffy as an actress, nothing to write home about at all. and to top all of that, the film just boringly dragged on. there's nothing special about it at all, trust me you will predict every clich'ed thing that is going to happen in it.
