we all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books. while not particularly accurate adaptations, these movies were nonetheless excellent films. some great examples are the harry potter series, the lord of the rings trilogy, and, to a lesser extent, almost every disney film ever made. however, i must regretfully announce that a wrinkle in time is not one of those movies. not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of madeleine l'engle's fan base, it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting, acting, special effects and, ultimately, respect for the audience. mind you, i'm not trying to be mean; on the contrary, i went into this affair with an open mind. i figured that a made-for-t.v. movie would make up for its lack of razzle-dazzle in its script. after all, the star wars spin-off ewoks was decent, if a little silly. come to think of it, the original star wars was made on "a lunch money budget", and look where it took george lucas! however, from the first scene onward, disappointment started enveloping me as if i'd gotten too close to the black thing while tessering. <br /><br />the same way greedo shooting first became the symbol of the star wars special edition of 1997 (a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic), mrs. whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is a wrinkle in time. the reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief. aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting alfre woodard (star trek: first contact and radio) as our favorite star-turned-mentor, the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow. that's right, a crow. moreover, the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight-year-old; the majestic half-man, half-horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle. had i been five, this would have psychologically traumatized me for life. the worst part is the fact that when it spoke, it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync, resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single, unmoving cheek, thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than e.t.<br /><br />having gotten the most painful part out of the way, i must go on to the tear-inducing one: the characters, the acting, and the story. i, personally, had always imagined meg to look somewhat similar to moaning myrtle from the harry potter films: plain hair, glasses, and a figure most supermodels would find laughable. she was always a slightly anxious, humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of nicaragua. in the film, she is an unpleasant know-it-all for whom i have no sympathy whatsoever. in fact, she makes me feel sorry for poor mr. jenkins, her school principal, who continuously has to deal with her. calvin, the kind, intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has become
