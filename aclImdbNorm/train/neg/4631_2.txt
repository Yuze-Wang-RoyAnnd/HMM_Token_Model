although misty ayers (burlesque stripper) is certainly attractive as the blonde lead, this flick is just an excuse to let her strip down to her underwear a few times (no nudity in 1954 when this film was made; not 1965).<br /><br />the guy who hires her to work in a whorehouse resembles bud abbott of abbott & costello. most of the other woman are unattractive, and the drunken woman is semi-amusing in a creepy way.<br /><br />a 2 out of 10. ms. ayers has a curvacious physique, but you can't judge any acting talent because the entire film is post-dubbed. some of these "exploitation films", usually made later than this one, are interesting in some way, but this is really a bore fest. sid melton (make room for daddy) directed. there are some samurai-like facial expressions and interesting apartments, but there's really nothing here.
