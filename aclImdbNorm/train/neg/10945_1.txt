words can't simply describe how awful this film is. i watched it on video last night, and i simply could not believe what i was seeing. basically, "snakeeater" is about an ex-military man (lorenzo lamas) and his search for his kidnapped sister who has been held captive by deliverance-style rednecks. the film's acting, writing, direction, photography, and editing are deplorable along with a song called "soldier" that has to be one of the worst theme songs of all time!<br /><br />however, there is one treat. "horshack" (ron pallio) from "welcome back carter" is in the film playing a laughable bad guy. otherwise, please avoid this mess at all costs.
