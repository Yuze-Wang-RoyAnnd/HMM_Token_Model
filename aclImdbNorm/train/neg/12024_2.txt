quite the most boring nonsense i have seen in a long time. the plot was full of irrelevance, and the acting was the worst i have seen in a long time.<br /><br />to make it worse, camera angles that made me feel sick were used , the incidental music was terrible and drowned out the dialogue (maybe not a bad thing then), and the shots of san francisco looked as if they had been stolen straight out of the city tourist board's promotional video.<br /><br />oh, and the obligatory sex scene was not even half well done. better lighting next time, please.
