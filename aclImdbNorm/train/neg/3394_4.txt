this film features ben chaplin as a bored bank employee in england who orders a mail order bride from russia, recieves nicole kidman in the mail and gets more than he bargained for when, surprise, she isn't what she appears to be. the story is fairly predictible and chaplin underacts too much to the point where he becomes somewhat anoying. kidman is actualy rather good in this role, making her character about the only thing in this film that is interesting. grade: c
