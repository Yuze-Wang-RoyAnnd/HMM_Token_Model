as an actor i really like independent films but this one is amateur at best.<br /><br />the boys go to vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree - were the directors aware that palm trees are not in vermont? pines yes - palms no. and the same for the wedding service - again nice grove of palm trees.<br /><br />when the boys are leaving vt they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is federal express. did they ship themselves overnight in a crate? come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur.<br /><br />the christian brother is far gayer than arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo. the two should have switched roles.<br /><br />the minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible.<br /><br />applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time
