my brother tom <br /><br />aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />sound format: dolby digital<br /><br />following an episode of sexual abuse at the hands of a trusted neighbor, young jessica (jenna harrison) forms a relationship with a strange boy (ben whishaw) she meets in the woods. unfortunately, whishaw has secrets of his own, no less troubling and far more dangerous...<br /><br />dour drama, sparked by brave performances by harrison and whishaw, in which two kindred spirits immerse themselves in a mutual love of nature after being traumatized by their experiences in the 'real world'. unfortunately, their friendship unravels as harsh reality begins to intrude, leading to an inevitable tragedy. directed by dom rotheroe and photographed in digital video format, the movie looks ragged in places (too many awkward close-ups and sloppy hand-held camera moves) and takes a while to find its feet, but the dramatic pay-off is quietly rewarding.
