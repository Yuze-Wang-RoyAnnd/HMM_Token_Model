before watching this film i had very low expectations and went to just see the cars. eventually i even regretted going for that reason. plot is almost non-existent. character development is non-existent. so many clich'es and so much jaw-dropping cheesiness existed in the movie that i could only stare and wonder how it was even released. if not for the exotics, i wouldn't have even rated this movie a 1. an attempt at a coherent story line is destroyed by the sheer absurdity of this elite racing cult and the laughable characters that make up its members. in fact, the movie's plot is so predictable and simple-minded that an average child could foretell the majority of the storyline. bad acting, bad plot, bad jokes, bad movie.<br /><br />don't see it. play gran turismo hd instead and it'll satiate your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste.
