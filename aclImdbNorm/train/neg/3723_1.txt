the sects that capitalise on this film are well known for their claim to take the 'message' of the bible without any alteration or extra-biblical influence. the existence of this film is solely due to the fact that there is no such thing.<br /><br />if you want to know what the born-again branch of christianity were harping on about in the seventies just look up the word 'rapture' in a dictionary of cults and sects. it's quicker than sitting through this waste of celluloid.<br /><br />poor acting, uneven sound quality and a script that could just as easily have been written by jack t chick (paranoid christian conspiracy theorist for those not familiar with the evangelical scene). you could not really put this into the 'so bad it's good' category so its only audience are either those with a pamphlet collection looking to branch out or the extremely paranoid.
