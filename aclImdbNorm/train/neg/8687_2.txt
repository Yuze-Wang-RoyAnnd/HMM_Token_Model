when anti-bush jokes get really easy to do, a show like this had better make sure it has something extra. when that something extra is kid versions of political figures making jokes about the future they don't have yet, it's just plain nonsense. dick cheney and george bush are done well but dick cheney mutters mostly. there's also condoleeza rice who has a crush on bush for some reason and donald rumsfeld who isn't really that similar to donald rumsfeld at all. the democratic characters rarely give their names so it's a mystery as to who could be who aside from barack obama and hilary clinton.<br /><br />the episodes have coherent stories but that's not nearly enough to keep this from sinking.
