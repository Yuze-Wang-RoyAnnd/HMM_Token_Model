...because this was simply awful. 101 dalamatians was funny even if formulaic, but this is nothing more than puerile drivel. the same plot except with the story excised from it; the world's most intelligent and horribly annoying macaw; tim mcinnerny proving that he really can't do comedy (everone remembers percy in blackadder but that was his high spot - it's all been downhill since then); direction so poor that if a group of college students had made this you'd throw it in the bin and tell them to do it again - properly this time. ieuan grufford better go back to hornblower sharpish, whilst glenn close and gerard diepardieu ought to go into hiding for several years.<br /><br />perhaps i could be too harsh; after all i didn't manage to sit through the whole film. it gets 1/10; only because i can't give it 0.
