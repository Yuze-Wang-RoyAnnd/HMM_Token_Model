okay, during this past thanksgiving break, whilst having the whole family together everybody decided to go see a movie, and since fred clause was voted majority, thats what we went and say. <br /><br />to start off the movie had so many plot holes it was pathetic. simple explanations of why a certain event was happening was void. example; who the heck is trying to 'shut down' santa clause? is it some sort of corporation? a little explanation would of been lovely. <br /><br />second: the movie tossed you flimsy characters that evoked no sympathy from you about their feelings or actions. example: the little elf named willie and the only tall girl in the elf village. they see each other twice and then they are a couple and i could of cared less because this movie didn't make me care. <br /><br />third: i suppose this was suppose to be a family film? its rating was low at just pg. for a family film there were several articles of suggestive conversation. it didn't bother me, but if i were a parent i could see a problem. <br /><br />through the whole movie paul giamatti looked extremely bored with his role, but honestly he was the only one worth watching in the movie. vaughn had a few funny moments but played the same character he has for the last two movies. mouthy frat boy. (nothing against vaughn, he's been good in other movies)<br /><br />so this movie gets a 3 out of 10 stars from me, just because somebody had to put in the effort to produce, film and release this flick. <br /><br />in my opinion i would definitely pass on this flick, or if you have to see it save it for a rainy day rental.
