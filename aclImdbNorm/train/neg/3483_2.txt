surviving christmas (2004) ben affleck, james gandolfini, christina applegate, catherine o' hara, josh zuckerman, bill macy, jennifer morrison, udo kier, d: mike mitchell. dumped by his girlfriend, a hotshot yuppie doesn't want to be left alone on christmas so he decides to return to his boyhood home, imposing on the dysfunctional family that now lives there and bribes them to pose as his family. an obnoxious and one-dimensional performance by affleck, who mainly acts with a flashy smile, makes his character come off as a mentally unbalanced creep, but gandolfini and o' hara breathe some life into this mess. even for farce, its silliness is lumbering, not much makes sense from scene to scene, and its sentimental messages are as phony as affleck's grin. 91 min., rated pg-13. *  1/2
