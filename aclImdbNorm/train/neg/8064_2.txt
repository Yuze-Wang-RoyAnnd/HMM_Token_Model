...had i watched it in my teenage years. this movie was mildly entertaining. what i liked about soul survivors were the gothic atmosphere during the party scenes, and the constant flips between 'dream' and 'reality.<br /><br />had there not been movies like 'the 6th sense' and 'don't look now' i would have been surprised by the ending.
