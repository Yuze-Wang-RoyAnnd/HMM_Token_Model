i still don't know why i forced myself to sit through the whole thing. this "film" wasn't worth the memorex dvd-r it was burned on; i thought i was watching the end result of a group of middle schoolers stealing their parents' camcorder. this is by far the worst movie ever made. i truly, from the bottom of my heart, want to sue aaron yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life.<br /><br />so apparently, it's supposed to be bad on purpose; however, if you should end up in hell and are forced to watch this 90-minute coil of doo-doo, you'll see that yamasato is really trying hard to make an awesome flick. the actors attempt dramatic kick-ass performances comparable to crimson tide but come closer to the marine.<br /><br />the crap acting is just the tip of the iceberg. the camera angles are awful. the story is c-movie at best-- the plot isn't even good enough to be considered b-movie caliber. the dialogue attempts to be dynamic and witty, but is crap like everything else. rumor has it that a hard copy of the screenplay actually attracts flies. plus, the techno score is annoying... not because it's techno, but because it's non-stop. that's right, the music plays in the background the whole time, acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is. i don't care what the disclaimer claims, i don't buy it. bots was not made this bad on purpose, because it takes itself way too serious for what it was: a joke.<br /><br />this "film" was very low-budget. but that is no excuse for its record-setting suck factor. great films are born of substance, not budget. bots had neither.<br /><br />allow me to further articulate the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time: if i were having a three-way with jessica alba and jessica biel in front of a tv and blood of the samurai came on, i'd be out of there quicker than steven seagal in executive decision.<br /><br />undoubtedly, some people will try to defend the movie. two, maybe three. they'll say, "it's grindhouse chop-socky!" or "cheesy in a good way!" or "it's so bad, it's good!" those people are idiots. a movie is either good, or it's bad. there's no such thing as a good bad movie. but there are such things as idiots that like crappy movies. don't get me wrong; there are lots of cornball not-to-be-taken-seriously movies out there that are enjoyable and entertaining. slither is one. bots is not.<br /><br />this suckfest runs about an hour and a half, and in my humble opinion, it's 90 minutes too long. the best thing about this "film" is the dvd cover, so next time you're near the wal-mart dvd bargain bin, take a look at it-- don't touch it, just look-- and quietly walk away.
