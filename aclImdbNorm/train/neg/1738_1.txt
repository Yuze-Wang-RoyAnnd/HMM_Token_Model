this miserable film is a remake of a 1927 film. they should have let it remain that way.<br /><br />what a colossal bomb! douglas fairbanks displays absolutely no charisma here. cesar romero is subjected to a role as a real jerk and bette grable sings with a chorus- what i'll do to that hungarian!<br /><br />the ridiculous plot deals with a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 rome that saved the day by killing a conqueror. (fairbanks) now, let's fast forward to 300 years later, where grable, just married to the count romero, faces a similar situation, when on her wedding night, there is an invasion by hungarian soldiers.<br /><br />romero acts cowardly and flees before the army arrives. he disguises himself as a gypsy and is made to remain at the castle when his violin playing pleases fairbanks. the ending is worse than the entire wretched film when grable meets fairbanks to tell him the good news-an enraged romero has annulled the marriage.<br /><br />this poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948. as harry davenport, a veteran supporting player who is in it, died in 1949; this must have been his last film. what a bomb to go out with after such a distinguished career.<br /><br />walter abel co-stars but he can do little with such poor writing. the costumes look more like those that would come out of the stone age. i can't fathom what fairbanks was wearing.
