i would give this movie 5 rather than 3 if it would be at least in time... when i've seen it in first time it was just what you could wait from the work that is based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or i would rather say idiotic habits of our (kazakhstan) government... it's a shame, because 'qazaqfil'm' was been shooting nice movies when it was not honoured by the name of shaken aimanov, but it was actually ran by him. the movies like 'konec atamana', 'kyz zhibek' or even 'aldar kose'. but after mr aimanov's death the production of quality movies went down almost dramatically in 10 years time there were very few films produced. however, in late 1980s, 'assa' was shot, it was a film about first organised crime groups in the big country, one year later mr. rashid nugmanov shot another film with the co-staring of the same actor/singer v.tsoy, at that time he was already a soviet/russian rock legend, - the movie called 'igla' (the needle or something) it was completely new, somebody called that period as resurrection or a new kazakh movie wave. unfortunately nowadays we do not have a quality movies, our directors shooting movies on the french and japanese financial support, and thus movies are not for the public but for the authors professional critics, some of them take a price on international author movie festivals but there a very few of them become a business asset products... and again back to our 'nomads'. such movies usually unpopular because of vast aspects. the same effects was with nikita mikhalkov's 'sibirski cyrilnik' about russian tsars, that was also shot on parities with foreign partners, i think they were french or maybe british. nobdy liked it, even in russian public it become as a main topic of a comedians and comedy shows like 'kvn'. imho
