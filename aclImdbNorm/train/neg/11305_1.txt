this is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate. it looks as if it were shot on a back lot in california instead of where jack slade lived and died, idaho, colorado territories, and montana. it fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious 'bad man,' 'good man.' the script is horrible; there is very little direction, and lousy acting. dorothy malone is completely wasted as his wife. mark steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious jack slade. in real life, jack slade was a very good stage line superintendent. he was feared by his local townsmen for his hard drinking. when drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in virginia city, montana. to insure that he could never terrorize them again, vigilantes lynched jack slade after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately. this is a horrible movie. i can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how hollywood butches history at will, even to this day.
