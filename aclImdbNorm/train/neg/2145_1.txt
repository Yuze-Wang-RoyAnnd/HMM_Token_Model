i've got a question for those who thought of this idea. why? what made them think to make a second movie of this. if memory serves, didn't cinderella end with "they all lived happily ever after"? i'm pretty sure it did, or it was implied. wait a minute, if they all lived happily ever after, how could there be a sequel? unless they were trying to make the most boring story in history, there couldn't be a sequel. i mean sure, they could have cinderella singing about nonsense for two hours, but why? a movie that ends in "happily ever after" can not have a sequel; if it does then they don't live happily ever after! something's got to go wrong which causes problems with the first ending! why? that's not right, it's evil. that's my final word on the matter.
