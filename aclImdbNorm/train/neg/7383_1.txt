i feel blessed to own what is known as the worst steven seagal movie ever made. i knew i was on to something special when steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out. by the middle of the film my eyes were beginning to hurt and i was almost falling out of my chair with uncontrollable laughter.<br /><br />steven is steven (with an ever changing voice) and totally unbelievable in his role (as always). who the hell lets people with bad nappy-hair pony tail mullets into the forces anyway? he also always writes himself into totally unbelievable love interests with women at least 20 years his junior. the supporting actors all look like they've been shot in the dark - btw, did they shoot this movie in the dark with just a penlight torch for lighting? <br /><br />this is truly abominable in every way possible. invite all your friends around and make a social event out of it - this one's truly special.
