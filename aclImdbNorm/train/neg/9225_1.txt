cq could have been good, campy fun. but it commits the only unforgivable sin: it is b-o-r-i-n-g! the pace is deadly slow and the plot is fairly confused and so artificial that it's next to impossible to care where it's going. the story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class from a thoughtful and sensitive eighth grader but this video should have carried a warning label: "caution: student film. fit for viewing only by relatives of the film maker."
