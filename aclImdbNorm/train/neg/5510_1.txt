rodney dangerfield isn't the main character of this movie. he's barely in it. most of the screen time is dominated by unfunny jokes. one running gag is that a character is named jerk off. there are also lots of erection jokes, where the punch line is someone has an erection. this movie is as funny as kirstie ally's british accent is convincing.<br /><br />this movie started off like a weak action movie: five minutes of back story and then bam! unfunny jokes. but, aside from the terrible writing, the movie is also poorly directed and the acting is terrible. also, this movie does the old bad comedy clich'e of having lots of well-known b-movie actors. harland williams, gilbert godfried, randy quaid, and phil la mar. these are just some of the people that spend more time on the screen than rodney, even though he's billed as the main character. don't be surprised to find this movie at a drug store selling for five bucks. even that is too much.
