i don't know if the problem i had with this movie is that i was not able to capture the way movies were done in the past but i believe that this one did not miss to make use of any of the the fashionable conventions available in the 40s to make a film. if you don't have anything better to do my advise is not to watch this movie but to read a book or to go out for a walk.
