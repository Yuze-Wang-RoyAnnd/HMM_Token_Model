a lot of horror fans seem to love scarecrows, so i won't be very popular in saying that i found it to be rather boring. the idea behind it was interesting, but it seems to drag so much. i think the main problem is that it is all set in darkness. sometimes horror films set in darkness can work (such as humongous), but scarecrows is in darkness for the whole film. a lot of the time it's hard to figure out what's actually happening, and although some shots of the scarecrows were creepy, most were hard to even see. if a little more lighting had been used, perhaps it could've been better.<br /><br />there's not many films involving killer scarecrows to my knowledge, apart from dark night of the scarecrow, which is much better. i would recommend that over scarecrows any day.
