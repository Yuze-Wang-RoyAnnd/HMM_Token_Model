apparently, this is what happens when a director allows his 14-year old nephew to rewrite the dialogue on the set while he indulges himself alcoholically in the meantime; as i said earlier, although i've always wanted to catch one of paul naschy's werewolf pictures, this atrocity served as my introduction and, as awful as it most certainly is, i still intend to pursue other entries in the series, albeit very gradually.<br /><br />despite some high profile disappointments like joe dante's the howling (1981), i love werewolf pictures in general but, to be honest, i quickly lost interest in this film's "plot" and just stood there gazing at my tv screen counting its absurdities as it were. there were far too many to mention them here but i have to say two which struck me as particularly hilarious were the schizophrenic nature of the werewolf persona (i.e. going from a raging beast in one shot to a dazed, zombie-like state in the very next one - as if he's on a casual midnight stroll in the countryside, and sporting an entirely different wardrobe to boot...and, yes, i did know the reasons for this beforehand), as well as the "phantom of the opera" look of the wolfstein character! but what do i know - perhaps the elusive full-length version of this mess could very well have been a bona-fide horror classic!
