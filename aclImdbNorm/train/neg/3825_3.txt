i saw this film over the weekend and while i was impressed as always with the beauty and polish of church-produced films, i left disappointed that this one fell so short, failing to inform members and leaving investigators with many unanswered questions.<br /><br />the film is 70 minutes of vignettes from the life of joseph smith. it's not a true biopic because there's no real coherent narrative. most of the episodes concern joseph doing good deeds, playing baseball, running races and laughing with children, often in sloooow motion. what a great, just folks kind of guy that joseph was, huh? look at him out there beating rugs for his wife emma. well, howzbout the rugs of his 33 plural wives?? no mention whatsoever is made of polygamy. a glaring omission.<br /><br />and it is in such omissions where the film falters. it supplies too little information and leaves critical thinking audience members wondering why is joseph getting tarred and feathered, why is he getting thrown in jail and why does that mob want to kill him? the film's climax is of course joseph and hyrum's trek to carthage jail (riding past a veritable united nations of faces looking out from nauvoo's doorways). but no mention is ever made about why. nothing about smith suppressing the nauvoo expositor newspaper and ordering its press destroyed for its revealing the secret teaching of polygamy. the audience is left to wonder or to assume it's just more baseless persecution of the church. no mention of joseph being charged with treason for declaring martial law and calling out the nauvoo militia.<br /><br />of course i certainly did not expect this church-produced film to present the joseph of richard bushman's recent biography rough stone rolling, but i was surprised and taken aback at just how little of substance was actually presented.<br /><br />and worse, what substance that was presented was often inaccurate. two examples jumped out at me. first, the translation of the book of mormon. the film shows joseph reading right off the golden plates in their two-ring binder, which plates in reality were hidden far from the site. it's well known that joseph did his translating by burying his face in his hat, peering at the seer stone in there. the second inaccuracy occurs at carthage jail, where the mob storms the cell. the history of the church reports that joseph had a six-shooter and even fired off a few rounds before jumping out the window and giving the masonic signal of distress (as reported in times & seasons).<br /><br />maybe showing the reality of the gunfight would have shattered the heart-tugging mood the filmmakers had created, but by omitting it they were unfaithful to history and failed to show joseph as he really was: handy with a gun and able to defend himself. in fact, the impression the film gives is that joseph was a nice guy, but also something of a milquetoast that everybody beat up, tossed in jail and eventually murdered in cold blood. he was far from that; joseph was a disciplined and determined man who endured a lot of hardship and struggle to bring to fruition that in which he believed.<br /><br />see the film, but know going in that's it's cotton candy. then get your meat and potatoes by reading a copy of bushman's biography of smith, rough stone rolling <br /><br />ps: church-produced films have no credits, but seasoned eyes can pick out a couple familiar faces. rick macy is excellent as joseph smith, sr. and bruce newbold, beloved as thomas in finding faith in christ, here plays the cranky methodist minister who failed to show christian love to a young seeker after truth.
