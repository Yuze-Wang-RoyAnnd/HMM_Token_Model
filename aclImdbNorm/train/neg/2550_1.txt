it was the tag-line "in the tradition of american pie" that fooled me into renting this movie. what i got was a piece of junk in the style of jackass, with the major difference that compared to this jackass the movie seems like a citizen kane.<br /><br />this movie made me regret that i rewarded other movies with 1 out of 10, because now i can't go beneath that. this one makes quite some bad movies look like cinematic feats.<br /><br />i actually turned it off after 45 minutes, and that's something i very rarely do. but it was just too plain boring, stupid, uninteresting and unnecessary.<br /><br />can't believe some people actually reward this with 10 out of 10. what did your parents do? drop you on the head when you were just a child? or was it the very first movie you ever saw, so you got nothing to compare it to? are you still a virgin and are breasts all you ever think off? something must be wrong, at least.<br /><br />my advice: stay clear of this one. even if your in the mood for a simple movie that doesn't require thinking, choose something else, or you'll regret it for sure.
