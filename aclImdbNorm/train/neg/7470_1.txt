in s~ao paulo, the upper middle class teenagers cristiano, chico and gabriel have just joined the university and on the eve of the opening class, they go to a party with drugs and booze. on the next day, after their classes, the date of cristiano in the previous night comes to his house and the three friends rape the girl. the girl dies, they panic and decide to get rid off the body, but cristiano's mother arrives, startles with gabriel and rolls the staircase, breaking her neck. the trio decides to dump and burn the corpses in a garbage landfill, but along the night other tragedies happen.<br /><br />the polemic and shameful "cama de gato" is an overrated pretentious crap about alienation of the youth, and is certainly the worst brazilian movie that i have seen along many years. the shallow, tragic and dark story is actually a black humor comedy of bad taste. the screenplay is not funny, with stupid lines and dialogs, and boring, manipulative and silly footages with interviews with morons teenagers in the beginning and in the end. the acting is terrible, apparently with many improvisations, but no talent, and i was disappointed with presence of the promising caio blat in this trash. the camera, framing, cinematography and edition are amateurish and of very low quality. the sound is awful and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are speaking (probably it is a plus, since this flick sucks). the gang bang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre movie in a very poor marketing of sex-exploitation. my vote is one (awful).<br /><br />title (brazil): "cama de gato" ("bed of the cat")
