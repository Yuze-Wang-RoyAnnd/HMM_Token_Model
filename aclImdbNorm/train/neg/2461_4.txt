there are probably more people afraid of the dentist than of, let's say, little monsters or scary looking dolls. which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie, really.<br /><br />dr. feinstone (corbin bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years now, but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the poolguy he snaps, and he brings his anger and frustration to his work. well, give a mad dentist a drill and a mouth, and you can probably guess what happens next...<br /><br />as i said, brilliant idea but not delivered as well as it should. in particular the ending is a huge let down. last note: watch for mark ruffalo (you can count on me, eternal sunshine...) in this one.<br /><br />5/10.
