i've now just realised that by watching this film i have lost valuable precious moments of my life i will never get back. thsi film isn't just poor its dire. it reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made.<br /><br />i regret watching this film.<br /><br />flixmedia reckons its a race issue, apparently "white" people don't like it because it doesn't have white actors. mate, i think you'll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of drivel.<br /><br />please stop making crap films
