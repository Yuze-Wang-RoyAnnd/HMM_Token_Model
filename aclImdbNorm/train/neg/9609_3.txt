i started watching this movie expecting some barely tolerable hammer horror film wannabe... and i wasn't far off. there's a fair amount of glimpsed gore, and they threw in lots of nudity, but the latter half of the movie presents a few ironic twists. holy cow, they actually put a little thought into the story, and didn't completely fall into the predictable stuff one expected at the outset. and dare i say it, some of the "gratuitous" nudity wasn't so gratuitous after all, because it fit in with the story and setting.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, it's still overall a bad movie, but as bad movies go, it's a shade more intelligent than the really horrible tripe like mesa of lost women and robot monster.
