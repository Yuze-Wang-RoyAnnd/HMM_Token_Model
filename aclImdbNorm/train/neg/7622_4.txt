one can only assume that robert osborne is contractually obligated to express delight at even the least appealing films in the tcm library as this would explain him extolling the 'virtues' of this "charming" film during his introduction when i saw this on cable tv. seeing as any old film on imdb receives 'classic' status from a number of fawning amateur reviewers, i thought there was a dire need for a more honest review of this film.<br /><br />this is not your father's 'shop around the corner'. for all my quibbles with 'you've got mail', it still outshines this as a remake in just about every way imaginable. for those who have seen the original, the flaws will only be all the more obvious.<br /><br />from one of the lamest meet cute sequences i can recall seeing (a sad slapstick attempt at 'humor'), this film gets off on the wrong foot and it never really gets back in step. this 'musical' only qualifies as one in the sparsest sense of the term. there are a sprinkling of instantly forgettable musical numbers and then there's judy singing "i don't care" while flailing her arms around as if in a seizure. the christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her better numbers here. miss garland was wonderful in a number of musical films, but here she seems horribly miscast. the role was originally to have been filled by june allyson and judy is definitely unable to fill the shoes of margaret sullavan's old part. van johnson also turns in a rather bland performance as a second rate jimmy stewart type. the leads never achieve the chemistry of stewart/sullavan or even that of hanks/ryan.<br /><br />this is a film that knows (some of) the notes, but not the music. it doesn't really seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add another possible love interest for van johnson's character to complicate things unnecessarily. the remake's substitution for the original's infidelity subplot is a hackneyed plot device involving a priceless violin. it is almost embarrassing to watch and feels as if it had perhaps been lifted from an episode of three's company by someone with a delorean and a flux capacitor. it's really just an excuse for a keaton pratfall. even the big resolution scene between the romantic leads is mishandled. after seeing both films, you'll understand why they called it 'the lubitsch touch' and not the 'robert z. leonard touch'.<br /><br />avoid this and rewatch either the original film or one of judy garland's earlier films unless you're an iconoclast who enjoys seeing a once great star falling down to earth.
