as a former submariner, this was one of the worst submarine movies i have ever seen. first of all, a mutiny aboard any us naval vessel, particularly a nuclear powered trident submarine in unthinkable. these men are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission. the responsibility they carry is awesome and they take it very seriously all the way from the captain to the most junior crew member. i could never see a crew of any ship split their alliance between the captain and the executive officer. an executive officer who acted as the character played by denzel washington did would be relieved of his duties and court martialed, then drummed from the navy. it is no surprise the navy refused to send a technical adviser to help in making this film. lastly, if any member of a submarine crew made the amount of noise made underway on this vessel they would be severely reprimanded. submariners learn early in their career to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. they don't slam doors and even speak quietly and wear soft soled shoes when underway. i was amazed at how loud they portrayed the crew while underway. loud music would never be tolerated. i know portraying submarine life in reality would not sell movie tickets, but this is over the top to the point of being ridiculous. i would not recommend this movie to anyone.
