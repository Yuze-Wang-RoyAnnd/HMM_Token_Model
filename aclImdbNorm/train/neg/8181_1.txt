i went to see this movie (actually i went to see family portraits, which contains cutting moments + 2 other short films by douglas buck) at the mar del plata festival (argentina)... i just couldn't watch it! i had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of cutting moments and take a peek every once in a while. by the time it was over, my stomach was upside down and i felt light headed. i just had to leave the cinema a few minutes after the 2nd short begun (btw, of course i was not the only one who left the room). it was waaaay too violent and disgusting for me! i am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it. i just don't get how you can love that kind of movies! the shocking and bloody and horrible images i saw got really stuck in my head for like two days!! i also try to analyze the story (my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it) and i just don't think it makes any sense. i mean, that amount of violence and stuff, makes no other sense than to try to shock people. and that's not a good enough reason, i think. there's absolutely nothing in this movie that i can say "well, at least 'x' thing about it was good". but well, i guess i will never understand that kind of films.
