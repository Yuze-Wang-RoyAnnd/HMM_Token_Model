"fly me to the moon" has to be the worst animated film i've seen in a long time. that's saying something since i have taken my son to see every animated release for the last 4 years now. the story is to be generous...trite. the voice acting is atrocious, too cute sounding. the humor is of the romper room variety. the animation is passable for a nickolodeon type of cartoon but this is being released on the big screen not cable television.<br /><br />it gets a 2 only because of it's ok 3-d visuals. some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating image but we've seen much better in the past. i also question the insistence of the filmmakers to have characters fly away from the screen rather than into it in most of the scenes. while that is interesting at first it became tiresome after the 3rd or 4th time. it seemed to smack of indifference to me on the part of the creators.<br /><br />i will say this though, it had a pretty cool soundtrack. and for the record my son wasn't too crazy about it either. bad movie.
