lets make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically have everything that happens on the show! well if that idea doesn't intrigue you, which it shouldn't, stay away from ringmaster. i had the displeasure of seeing this in the theater and actually being able to sit through this mess of a movie. i guess jerry springer doesn't play himself as it shows from the cheap props for his show (yes it looks even cheaper than the real jerry springer show) and he is only known as jerry in the film. the plot (if you can call it that) is about a daughter while living with her mother decides to start sleeping with the mother's live in boyfriend. so the mother's brilliant idea is to call the jerry springer show as well as getting it on with her daughter's boyfriend. (is it any coincidence they live in a trailer park). meanwhile somewhere else in america a woman finds her cheatin' man with her friend in bed together. so of course call america's therapist jerry springer! i'd talk about the rest of the film but even thinking about the film now is giving me a headache. jamie pressly who plays the daughter looks totally unattractive in the movie. and remember michael dudikoff the kick ass karate master from the american ninja series? well take a look at him now as a white trash drunk. the thing is he really looks too horrible and out of shape to call it "getting in touch with his charecter". but if your idea of fun is seeing jerry springer sing a country song about his own show or guys hooking up with transvestites...well...just watch the show instead! ... at least steve was smart enough to stay out of this flick.
