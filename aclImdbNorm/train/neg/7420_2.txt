a romance without feeling, a drama of issues without point (or drama).... this film is supposed to be all these and fails on each and every account, as if it isn't trying. or as if the director/editor/scriptwriter team isn't really trying. the actors are able--they need better support.<br /><br />one element that doesn't fail is the score by george delarue. beautiful and moving. what a shame it's attached to this film. in a good film actors' words and movements and music synchronize and enhance the impact. this editor plastered on music with no regard for dialogue and movement. the love scene is particularly grating in this respect: an insult to the talents of the lead actors.<br /><br />there is another element in the film that works: location photography. notably one moment in grand central station. i'd guessed in advance what was going to happen; but how it was filmed in that setting was breathtaking.<br /><br />some commentators on this board have pointed out that us assimilation of criminal nazi scientists actually happened during these years of the maccarthy scare. the moment the film seems to start looking seriously at american society, it switches into conventional romance; before any human feelings can move us, it's away on a (predictable) 'thriller' escapade.<br /><br />just as the film insults the talents of the actors, it insults the issues it's pretends (and fails) to take up.<br /><br />you are warned.
