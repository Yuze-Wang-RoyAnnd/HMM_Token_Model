the book that this movie is based on seriously changed my life. but saying this movie was a disappointment is an understatement. the acting, directing, cinematography, and storyline were all horrible. i would never recommend this movie to anyone. i've told countless people about the book but will now be telling them all that they should definitely not see the movie! i did not expect the plot to follow the book exactly, but they have left out too many key components of the book. the movie tried, but failed, to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only demeaned the central theme of the prophecy. while putting myself in the position who had not read the book, i saw the celestine prophecy as a bunch of hoaxy b.s. i am thoroughly disappointed with redfield for the way this movie turned out.
