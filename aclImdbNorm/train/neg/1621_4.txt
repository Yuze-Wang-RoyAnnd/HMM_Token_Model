'the fox and the child' is the new film by french director luc jacquet, who brought us the oscar-winning documentary 'march of the penguins.' it focuses around a young girl (wonderfully played by bertille no"el-bruneau) and her blooming friendship with a fox.<br /><br />there are some truly mesmerizing moments here; badgers mucking about, a lynx chasing the fox through a snow-littered forest; one scene in particular when the fox is being tormented by a pack of wolves is quite intense and even frightening at times. however, there's simply not quite enough of them.<br /><br />beautifully shot; the cinematography is dazzling. the bubbly kind of look of the film is wonderful. it's undeniably a very lush production.<br /><br />the english version is narrated by kate winslet, but what little dialogue there already is has been very poorly dubbed. the score is also far too fluffy, or at least it is for my liking; and the screenplay, while subtle, seemingly jumps from one scenario to another, ultimately leaving me almost baffled.<br /><br />while there's a nice moral at the heart of the film, and the rather quiet performance from no"el-bruneau is quite lovely, the real star is the fox. those captivating moments focusing solely around our furry little friend are tremendous. however, again, there's simply not nearly enough of them.<br /><br />- to keep up to date with all the latest in film, including reviews, news, discussions and more, be sure to visit www.mybluray.com.au
