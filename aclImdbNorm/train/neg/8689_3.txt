the main problem with "power" is that it features way too may pointless characters and subplots that add absolutely nothing to the movie whatsoever. it gets boring after awhile, sitting around waiting through scenes that don't connect to find something that drives the movie forward. you could probably pass it all off as character development, but all of them are either recycled from earlier scenes in the movie, or are just simply to flat and uninteresting. lumet never gives enough time to let any of the supporting cast blossom. he should have cut a few of the characters (hackman, the wife) and concentrated harder on others (billings). it could have been a great, hard political thriller instead of a jumbled mess that loses any message in a sea of bad writing and acting, a fact that amazed me considering the cast. even gene hackman performance wasn't up to par. denzel washington is the only real actor of note here. gere and the others have all done much better performances elsewhere. <br /><br />sidney lumet needs to go back to the fierce one man shows he did in the seventies (i.e, serpico) and stop trying to recapture his success with "12 angry men" and "fail safe". it hasn't worked yet sidney, and it most likely never will. leave the ensemble dramas to altman. <br /><br />3/10<br /><br />* / * * * *
