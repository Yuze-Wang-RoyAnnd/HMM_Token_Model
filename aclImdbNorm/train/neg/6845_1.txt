"i went to the movies, to see 'beat street' / it wasn't bad, it was kinda' neat / 'krush groove' was a flick, that i didn't mind / but when it came to 'rappin', i drew the line." word to your mother.<br /><br />want me to stop?<br /><br />that's just a small sample of the stupa-fly style of rhymin' on display in this waste of film and location permits. this movie is seriously wack (thats 80s-speak for just f*cking awful). as an emcee, mario van peebles is one hell of an actor. and as an actor, mario van peebles is one hell of a bodybuilder.<br /><br />any film calling itself "rappin'" had better deliver at that genre's highest standard of the time. so why were 6 year olds rolling in the aisles, even back in the day when standards were so knee-high-to-"webster"-low? because this rap is weak. so weak that not even b.e.t. or comedy central will touch it with a 10-foot gold-rope chain.<br /><br />blondie's "rapture" is def poetry next to this bit of dr. suess in the hood. so don't be a boobie, avoid this movie!<br /><br />
