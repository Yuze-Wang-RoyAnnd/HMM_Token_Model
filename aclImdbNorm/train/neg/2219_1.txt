perhaps one of the most overrated so-called horror classics ever made, halloween does feature the memorable michael myers and some great acting by jamie lee curtis.<br /><br />however, its rewatchability factor is very close to zero, as there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on dullness/culmination to the actual events.<br /><br />this is the sort of movie you can walk away from to microwave popcorn and not miss anything at all.<br /><br />how it spawned so many sequels, i will never comprehend.<br /><br />thank god rob zombie is remaking this. and generally, i hate remakes.<br /><br />surely he will more than compensate for all the random time-filling gaps with some quirky points of interest that the original severely lacks.<br /><br />this is a movie we feel we have to like, much like the way we're taught that we should enjoy dickens.<br /><br />don't assume this is a classic.
