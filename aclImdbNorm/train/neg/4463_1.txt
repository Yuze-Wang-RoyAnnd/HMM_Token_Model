this is one of those films that makes you want the time you spent watching it back, and then some, like the time you spent accidentally picking it out, the time you spent getting to the video store, etc.<br /><br />first off, the look: it's grainy, it's low budget. now that in itself doesn't make for a bad film. but the way it was filmed makes the action look unnatural, so that's kind of distracting.<br /><br />then, the story. 3 gals go on a gal's weekend away from guys. of course, as everyone does when going on a camping trip, they stop on the way to get earrings. when they arrive at the area in which they're going to stay, they get pulled over by mr. ranger sir, who scolds them for throwing a lit cigarette out of the car at fire season, and then drives them where they're going (a remote cabin). of course, 2 "cute guys" wander into their vicinity, and bambi (yes, bambi) and aubry are immediately smitten, but apparently bambi is smitten by anything with two legs. mady is rather disappointed by this development because she was looking forward to a weekend of forgetting about her ex by getting sh**-faced and stoned with her gal-pals.<br /><br />oh, and i almost forgot, there's a mean old hermit that lives up that way, that's perhaps someone to not tangle with, and the area & cabin in which they're staying have a sort of "reputation".<br /><br />so of course, sooner or later (unfortunately, much later) some of our weekend wood-visitors begin to die, and find various booby traps (although a couple of them actually hit a little lower than that) and of course, the remaining campers are understandably upset. no cell phone reception of course (who would miss out on a chance to check their cell phone for reception in a movie anymore?). mr. ranger sir keeps popping up at odd times & his behavior seems a bit odd but he has said he will get help.<br /><br />there's a fantastic twist to this that you just won't want to miss too, if you're still awake. pray that you wake up to a blank screen.<br /><br />the acting in this is terrible, the production values are terrible, and the whole undertaking is just lame & i find it amazing this was even released. avoid at all costs, 1 out of 10.
