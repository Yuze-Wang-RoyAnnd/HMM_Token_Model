unentertaining, uninvolving hybrid of "cruel intentions" and "wild things", but it isn't nearly as good as either of those trash min-classics. it's about the acting sheriff, artie (taye diggs) being called in to investigate a near-fatal drug overdose at a posh upper-class univesity, but to keep it on the down low. as he digs deeper he thinks it's much more than it at first glance seems to be. we follow alicia, the girl who overdosed in flashbacks as well. at about 90 minutes, if this film was welcomed to begin with, it would have worn it out. this film brings absolutely nothing new to the table. but it is the only movie thus far that has miss swain topless so the grade is higher just for that.<br /><br />my grade: d<br /><br />eye candy: dominique swain gets topless( fixing a mistake of "happy campers"); another girl is topless <br /><br />anti-eye candy: more men ass than girl tit
