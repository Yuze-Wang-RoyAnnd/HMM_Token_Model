only the most ardent doris day fan could find this one even bearable to watch. when one thinks of the wealth of material available for a story about new york city's most famous blackout, a film that could have dealt with numerous real-life stories of what people had to cope with, this scrapes the bottom of the barrel for lack of story-telling originality.<br /><br />once again doris is indignant because she suspects she may have been compromised on the night of the blackout when she returned to her connecticut lodgings, took a sleeping potion and woke up in the morning with a man who had done the same, wandering into the house by mistake.<br /><br />nobody is able to salvage this mess--not doris, not robert morse, terry-thomas, patrick o'neal or lola albright. as directed by hy averback, it's the weakest vehicle day found herself in, committed to do the film because of her husband's machinations and unable to get out of it. too bad.
