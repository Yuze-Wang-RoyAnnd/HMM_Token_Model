this is one of them movies that has a awesome video box but has wired camra work and unknown actors that speak with bad dialogue.its so dark when the killings happen you can hardly see it plus the movie is hard to understand.the only star in this is wcw`s vanessa sanchez (tygres in wcw before it folded) and she is a good actress. i like low budget film especialy ones that has errors because they are fun to watch but severed unfourtunatly isn`t one of them.this movie is ok to see if you like voodoo and severed heads but this is no blockbuster but if you need something new to watch then rent severed.
