okay, so the previews to this film only tells you that a rebellious young girl goes to live with her grandmother for the summer in order to straighten out. that is actually not the case! it's about a young rebellious 17 year old girl who reveals a secret and it's up to her mother to believe if she's telling the truth or not.<br /><br />to be honest, i really enjoyed the concept of this movie. they had a really good plot and a really good theme of a love/hate relationship between mother and daughter. i did not however, enjoyed watching lindsay lohan's acting. in reality, this movie would have been great if they had someone else, perhaps a better actress. the character of rachel (lohan) is a very sexually aggressive person and it sort of reminds us of the real lindsay so it takes away a lot from the film.<br /><br />i do however, think that if you put lindsay aside, you will enjoy this film. the ending is pretty great (and sad).
