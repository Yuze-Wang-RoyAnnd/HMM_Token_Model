this is one of the worst movies i have seen this year. you should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here, there are spoilers. gray matters centers on gray and sam baldwin (heather graham and tom cavanagh). only gray and sam are brother and sister; living together in everyone else's eyes as man and wife. no sex but just about everything else. early on, the movie starts with its theme: 'the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions'. gray and sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch. rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him, she does it and gets to the nitty-gritty questions too. when she signals her brother to come over they start a 3-way date. charlie (bridget moynahan) is the girl of their dreams, like all the right things etc
