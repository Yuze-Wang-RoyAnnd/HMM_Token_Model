ok, where do we start with this little gem? mutant slugs begin to take over a small new england (?) town. only one man can stop them... and that man... is mike brady! now, if that wasn't laughable enough, stay tuned.<br /><br />the footage of the slugs is what's known as stock footage. no matter who the slugs attack or where they are, the same shot of piles of slugs oozing everywhere is shown. keep in mind, this singular shot occupies at least half the movie.<br /><br />the acting in the movie was knock down, drag out, steal your wallet, punch your girlfriend, kill your dog, bad. i'm sure there's worse, but you're going to be hard pressed to find it. the only gem was... you guessed it.... mike brady! he must have taken a few night classes at the ymca, because he was the best in the bunch.<br /><br />as for horror? this film is not to be taken seriously. there isn't horror! they're slugs for crying out loud. the entire rising action could have been avoided with a salt shaker or two. only watch this film in a mst3k type environment, otherwise i can see some major damage to the brain.
