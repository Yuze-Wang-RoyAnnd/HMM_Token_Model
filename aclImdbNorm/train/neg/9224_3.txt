style but no substance. not as funny as it should be. not as deep as it wants to be.<br /><br />this is another in the genre of films about the difficulties of filmmaking. a young filmaker is hired to finish a campy 60s sci-fi movie called codename:dragonfly. think barbarella, or danger diabolique.<br /><br />but jeremy davies is an angst-ridden filmmaker. he's no hack he's an artist. the movie he wants to make is a diary of his life. hardly original.<br /><br />all the characters outside of jeremy davies filmmaker are as thin as rice-paper. characters that might be interesting, such as his father, his doppelganger, or jason schwarzmann as a hack director are introduced and then shown the door without adding a thing.<br /><br />this movie is full of eye candy but when compared to other films about filmmakers such as stardust memories or 8 1/2 it pales in comparison. those movies are funny, provocative with well-developed characters. those movies have lessons that apply outside<br /><br />the movie wants to be comic and campy but its just derivative and there is not one funny scene. the filmmakers describe it as a send-up but what's the satirical target? the actors say it's an homage but i think i would rather a full-length version of codename:dragonfly.<br /><br />coppola is clearly amused by the setting as is evident by the visual humor of the sci-fi movie within a movie. but he fails to share why we should be amused.<br /><br />outside of the sci-fi movie its just a mess. there are continuity errors, the filmmaker chooses a sci-fi weapon after its already been chosen. what?<br /><br />just because he has a scene were the filmmaker is confronted by the critics complaining about the lack of story, lack of a point, a scene where he admits empty cleverness does not mean that he has addressed those criticisms.<br /><br />i guess if your roman coppola you can get away with making a movie about an angst-ridden idealistic filmmaker who doesn't know what he wants to say and so ends up saying nothing. in that sense it may be considered autobiograhical.<br /><br />i would watch it at circuit city on a wall full of tvs if i had a choice. watch the 15-minute codename:dragonfly movies included on the dvd as extras and then send it back.
