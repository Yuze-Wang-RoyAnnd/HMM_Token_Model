i don't know who got the idea that orcas go around killing people and bashing and destroying things for revenge but my god is it absurd. orcas are most definitely not the cold-blooded killer this movie makes them out to be...its silly. orcas are extremely intelligent, don't get me wrong, but i highly doubt they know and understand a concept such as revenge. so i have to say all i got out of this movie was the entertainment of how preposterous it was. so i was at least somewhat amused by it. personally, i'd recommend going and seeing jaws if you're wanting to see an animal-killing-humans type of movie. but if you're like me and want to laugh at something this far from realism then i'd say go ahead. :d
