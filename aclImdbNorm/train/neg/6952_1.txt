the most horrible retelling of a great series. it should not have been named battlestar galactica, because it's only the same in name alone. too many changes to just have changes. you have characters turned from male to female, black to asian to cylon all in a way to "attract female audiences," when there was already strong female characters that could have just been made stronger. gone are the egyptian feeling. gone are the quest for earth. the lack of cylons to go to terminator rejects takes away from the film, especially when one is made a fembot. granted the original show had a lot of cheese to it, but it had a large following. they tried to hold onto this following but give the fans nothing to work with and basically spit in their face as they make it "their own story." changes are good, when they make something better, not to just make them.
