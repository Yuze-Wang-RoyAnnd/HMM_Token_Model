it was a disappointment to see this dvd after so many years. for me the main problem's the uneven script.<br /><br />while some of it is witty and hip, quite a bit of it is dull, unfunny and lifeless. many of the gags just sit there, lacking spark and energy.<br /><br />of the cast, mae west and rachel welch come over well. roger herren in the role of rusty shines (too bad he didn't make more films). but for my money, there's just too much of john huston, and poor rex reed isn't hardly given a fighting chance. his character seems relegated to skim around on the sidelines, wondering what he's doing in this film.<br /><br />the low user rating should give an idea as to the public's opinion of this piece. vidal's original provided much potential that was pretty much wasted. not even the 'classic' film clips did much. all in all a rather sub par effort, and it's not likely to get much better with time.
