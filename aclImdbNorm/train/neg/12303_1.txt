this movie is so bad it's good -- in an unintentionally funny way. i couldn't stop watching it, i was laughing so much! it's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except it's not a parody. <br /><br />alexandra paul plays emily wendell, an oppressed preacher's wife who falls hard for luke (corey sevier), a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison; the only thing sevier is guilty of, though, is bad acting! mind you, he's no worse than the other actors. you get the sense that the actors have *no* idea they're in a really awful film; they're playing it straight. everything about the film is bad: the acting, the script, the love scenes, the pacing, the plot twists, the choice of music. the climactic scenes are just so ludicrous -- first the shootout in the church, then luke's final words to emily -- i was howling with laughter. <br /><br />evidently luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison, and we get to see plenty of his naked torso. that's probably the highlight of the film.
