this is the first film of the horrorfest i have watched and after im almost thinking i don't need to see any of the others. i was told its a "thinking mans horror movie" and have to say that if this was supposed to make me think i shutter to think what the splatter/gore films in the collection will be like. don't get me wrong not even the gore in this film is worth sitting through.<br /><br />the plot is very washed out with way too much art for arts sake. the camera effects and music are out of place most of the time and the characters are banal to say the least. several characters and scenes seem worthless in the end when they start to reveal some of the hooks of "the hamiltons". i figured out who lenny was about half hour in when i figured out the movie. i was so visually under whelmed and confused by the lenny reveal that i completely felt ripped off. i expected what i got but they could have gone so much further, in fact all the gore falls completely flat. with movies out there like "hostel" and "saw" you need to come a little better for a film that is "considered to graphic or too disturbing for general audiences".
