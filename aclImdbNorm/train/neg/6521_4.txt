i'm probably not giving this movie a fair shake, as i was unable to watch all of it. perhaps if i'd seen it in a theater, in its original presentation, i might have appreciated it, but it's far too slow-moving for me.<br /><br />i read the book some 25 years ago and the details of the plot have faded from memory. this did not help the film, as it's something less than vivid and clear in its presentation of events.<br /><br />this is really four linked films, or a film in four parts, and was, i believe, intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation. i found part i to be enjoyable enough, but it was all i could do to sit through part ii, which drags interminably. reading tolstoy's philosophizing is one thing. if you get a good translation or can read it in the original, his brilliant writing far outweighs any issues one might have with the pace of the story. on film, however, it's hard to reproduce without being ponderous.<br /><br />i have other issues with the parts of the film that i saw. it's very splashy, with a lot of hey-ma-look-at-this camera work that calls attention to itself, instead of serving to advance the story.<br /><br />clearly, i'm missing something, but i just couldn't summon the enthusiasm to crank up parts iii and iv.
