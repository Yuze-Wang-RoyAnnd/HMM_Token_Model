i gave 1 to this film. i can't understand how ettore scola,one of the greater directors of italian cinema, made a film like this, so stupid and ridiculous! all the stories of the people involved in the movie are unsubstantial,boring and not interesting. too long,too boring. the only things i save in this movie are giancarlo giannini and vittorio gasmann. hope that scola will change radically themes and style in his next film.
