after hearing about george orwell's prophetic masterpiece for all of my life, i'm now 37, but never having read the book, i am totally confused as to what i've just seen.<br /><br />i am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel, as i'm sure most are, but only through hearsay and quotes. without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery, and even with it i'm still no more educated about the story of 1984 than i was before i watched it.<br /><br />on the plus side...<br /><br />the cinematography is amazing, hurt & burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate. the prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making.<br /><br />now for the down sides, and there are plenty...<br /><br />there is a war going on, (at least as far as the propaganda is concerned), but why & with who? nothing is explained. there are a couple of names bandied about (eurasia etc), but they mean nothing without explanation.<br /><br />who is winston? what does he do? where does he come from? where does he work? why is he changing news reports? why isn't he on the front line? why doesn't he eat the food in the canteen? what is that drink he's drinking through the entire film? why is he so weak & ill? why isn't he brainwashed like the rest of them? what's the deal with his mother & sister? what happened to his father? a little back story would have been nice, no scrub that, essential for those like myself that haven't read the book. without it, this is just a confusing and hard to follow art-house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on.<br /><br />the soundtrack was dis-jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the big brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on. i accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it's very annoying all the same.<br /><br />also, i know this has been mentioned before, but why all the nudity? it just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage.<br /><br />i personally can't abide the way hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days. we are not all brainwashed simpletons, but this is a few steps too far the other way. i can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you've read the book because if this film really is the 'literal translation' that i've seen many people say, i would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it is.<br /><br />there's no denying that it was light years ahead of it's time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date, (maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be?), but many sci-fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline.<br /><br />i guess i have to do what i should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i'm to make any sense out of this.<br /><br />all in all, very disappointed in something i've waited for years to watch.
