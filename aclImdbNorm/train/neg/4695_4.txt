i have watched this movie a few times and never really thought it was that funny, but it's still fun to watch and good for a few laughs.<br /><br />its about women that work at a company and their boss is a jerk and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine, and try to get the respect they deserve.<br /><br />the acting is really good. dabney coleman is one of those 80's stars that plays a good bad guy, not really evil, just unlikeable. dolly partin is lovable and fun to watch in comedies and her down south wit really shines here. jane fonda is so-so and does little for me. lily tomlin is the best thing about this movie, she has the funniest lines and made me laugh out loud several times, gotta love her.<br /><br />i could recommend this to anyone that likes 80's comedy. i like the movie but it has things about it that i don't like. it starts off great and has a nice flow and then everything starts coming together all at once and made me care less about the characters. they all have little fantasies about what they would like to do the boss and although 'cute' i just thought it slowed down the flow of the movie. as the movie goes on it once again picks up and the funniest things happen and then once again it slows down, only to wrap up in a quick manner thats too good to be true.<br /><br />4 out of 10 stars, but give it a try if you haven't seen it. i think depending on ones mood it may be more or less likable.
