the fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour. in fact there are more questions than answers in this one-sided tale of romance and murder; and since we are only provided with the prosecution's side, none of these questions will be answered. this is the type of fare that appeals to the "he woman, man hater" clubs of america. as presented, it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be "caught up" in a romance with a married, high-profile attorney. is it possible that if, she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man, the whole nasty murderous, sordid incident could have been avoided? when you watch this, don't worry about going to the 'fridge, you won't miss anything.
