"a damsel in distress" is definitely not one of fred astaire's better musicals. but even astaire's bad films always had some good moments.<br /><br />in "damsel," astaire is jerry halliday, an american musical star who is in london on a personal appearance tour. he meets lady alice marshmorton (19-year-old joan fontaine), a beautiful english heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers.<br /><br />jerry believes that alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. he tries to rescue her from her family's country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor lady alice will marry. keggs (reginald gardiner) the conniving butler, and albert (harry watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging lady alice's romance with jerry to make sure they win the bet.<br /><br />this musical has numerous problems. first, there is the plot, based on a novel by p.g. wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). the story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. when fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) fred romancing joan fontaine or (b) keggs and albert conniving against them and each other.<br /><br />the butler and the house boy are especially irritating. they are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. you wish they would get off the screen and let fred dance.<br /><br />astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, ginger rogers. joan fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. she has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.<br /><br />george burns and gracie allen are along for the ride, as jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. the duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times.<br /><br />the direction of the movie by george stevens is not well done. at times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. there are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in london, not hollywood. (they must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) on the plus side, the songs by george and ira gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. and of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to astaire and his choreographer, hermes pan.<br /><br />but the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. at times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. the musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (at one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) the numbers include:
