jeffrey combs is an insane scientist whose stem cell research has morphed into a diabolical scheme to create a hybrid hammerhead shark humanoid life form, hoping to breed a brand new species using hunter tylo's womb. it won't be easy for tylo is a tough broad and her boyfriend, william forsythe, isn't about to give her up without a fight.<br /><br />you see tylo and forsythe are two of business executive arthur roberts' employees, brilliant minds who meet combs(..a scientist who once worked for roberts, and whose vacated position went to tylo)at his island fortress where he conducts his research and experiments. this island affords him the opportunity to recruit fresh victims for his work and "son". they think it's a professional affair in regards to a breakthrough in stem cell research which could lead to cures for a variety of diseases. combs' son was dying of kidney cancer when he decided to perform his mad science on him, creating this blood-thirsty, flesh-eating creature which can both swim and walk on dry land(..although, at first the hammerhead could only remain outside for short time periods). tylo was dating combs' son, hence the connection besides the two having worked for roberts, who brings along his trophy wife, mariya ignatova. also accompanying tylo and forsythe, roberts and ignatova, are their colleagues, elise muller and gr johnson. combs traps them in a conference room, but they are able to escape onto the island as he sends after them his well paid mercenaries and hammerhead shark son.<br /><br />like similar sci-fi channel creature features of it's type, hammerhead:shark frenzy has some rather unappealing computer generated effects and the attacks(..where the shark rips apart limbs)are shot in a quick-edit, frenzied camera format where you have a hard time ever seeing any of the ensuing gory carnage. you have this vague notion that a person is being eaten(..ripped to shreds), but the attacks themselves are shot in a very erratic fashion which, truth be told, is rather infuriating. the monster itself is never seen in it's entirety, just momentary glimpses of an eye or a body part being gnawed on as the victim screams out in horror. one thing's for certain, you do see teeth. we do get cgi shots of the hammerhead shark swimming toward the screen, all menacing, ready to feast on flesh. a constant is while(..and after)victims are attacked, we see a great deal of blood and bits of flesh bubbling to the water's surface(..this is really director michael oblowitz's main cue as to inform the viewer that those being torn apart are goners).<br /><br />combs doesn't break new ground as the scientist, but he's always had an ability to convey a quiet madness under this cold-blooded resolve. it's fun seeing forsythe in a rare clean-cut hero role, very against type as an electronics wiz(..to his credit, he actually pulls it off)who must assume a leadership position when the group faces unprecedented peril. tylo is also in a very different kind of role, a scientist who can defend herself quite well. roberts can play the millionaire businessman roles in his sleep, and it's kind of neat seeing him firing off a machine gun at combs' soldiers(..although, his fate is not pleasant). mentioning that, it was also really entertaining watching forythe and tylo downing combs' hired goons with confiscated automatic machine guns. as expected, the screenplay allows those who created the murderous fiend to put themselves in unnecessary danger just so that they can pay for their sins..i mean, seriously, would these people knowingly leave themselves so vulnerable to attack after seeing just what damage to the human anatomy it could do? beautiful exotic setting is quite a nice backdrop.
