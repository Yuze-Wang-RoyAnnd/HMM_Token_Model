this movie was advertised on radio, television, magazines, etc. almost every hour or every issue. so when we went to the kinnepolis multiplex our expectations were very high. but oh boy, how sad this movie is! it is a movie in hollywood style about a movie in a movie. shades shows so clear we aren't ready to produce 'big hollywood movies'. i am not a movie critic, but i think a good movie starts with a good script. and the script is a nightmare. like my subject line says, it is nothing, and then looped. you could just stare to the television as well, without really seeing anything. that was the feeling we've got when we saw shades. shades is a bad production!!!
