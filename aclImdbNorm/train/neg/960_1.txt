oh dear. i was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of japan's ringu. well, i guess the u.s. made their version of it as well, but at least it was an outright remake. so, so sad. i very much enjoy watching filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country, so i can't believe this had to happen. claudine and kris are such big names there, surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism. to any aspiring movie makers out there in the philippines: you do not have to stoop this low to make money. there are many movie buffs that are watching the movies filipinos put out and enjoying them!
