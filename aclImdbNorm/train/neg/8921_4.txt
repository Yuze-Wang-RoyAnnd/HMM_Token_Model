the premise of an african-american female scrooge in the modern, struggling city was inspired, but nothing else in this film is. here, ms. scrooge is a miserly banker who takes advantage of the employees and customers in the largely poor and black neighborhood it inhabits. there is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. part of the problem is that story's roots don't translate well into the urban setting of this film, and the script fails to make the update work. also, the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly, the audience becomes tired of it well before the movie reaches its familiar end. this is a message film that doesn't know when to quit. in the title role, the talented cicely tyson gives an overly uptight performance, and at times lines are difficult to understand. the charles dickens novel has been adapted so many times, it's a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant, in spite of its very relevant message.
