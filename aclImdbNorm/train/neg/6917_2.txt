once again the same familiar story about a man (writer here) who sell his soul to the devil in order to have his most desired ambition in life: success. unfunny script (we should "go home and write better"), ridiculous lines in order to understand the "strong" "christmanish" message (our only aspiration in life is to find love, respect and a good friendship) and a very long trial scene at the end where the agent hopkins beat the devil (jennifer love hewitt is no sexy or evil at all) for all the bad things she made to this unlikable character. not bad efforts from the actors (baldwin also as a director, cattrall in a "sex and the city" role again, aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role). p.s. try also a not so popular film from greece called "alloimono stous neous", a brilliant adaptation of this myth (an old man give his soul to the devil to get back his youth)
