<br /><br />once i ignored some of the implausibilities, this was actually a fairly decent horror/monster flick. so, i'll give some of the good points first: - the dragon was quite convincing, especially as she prowled through the tunnels looking for lunch (hint: she likes humans). - the action was fairly non stop, and, after a weak beginning, i got quite absorbed in the storyline. - sorry to say, i was kind of rooting for the dragon - she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the movie.<br /><br />now for the implausible stuff **maybe some spoilers**: - if you were hunting a fire-breathing dragon in 1100 ad, would you charge into its cave with a barrel of gunpowder under your arm? duh. - a female character with an all-american name, blonde hair and obvious slavic accent, trying to pretend she's spanish? huh? - a lead scientist whose slavic accent you can cut with a knife, and he's supposedly born in chicago, educated in usa? - a military helicopter pilot who does his own repairs, flies a huge transport copter with no other crew, and is an expert marksman and combat soldier to boot? ok. uh huh. i won't even mention his giving 3 different call signs in 2 minutes while communicating with his base.<br /><br />it's still better than some of the japanese monster flicks from the 60's, but not by much. if we're lucky, we won't see dragon fighter 2, though naturally the ending left that possibility wide open. or, maybe, they'll hire a real director next time.<br /><br />in spite of everything, i gave this flick a 4 out of 10. add 2 more if they rewrite the plot, and dean cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes. <grin>
