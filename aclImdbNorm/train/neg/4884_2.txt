criminally insane 2 is included on the new dvd of satan's black wedding/criminally insane, and it's a good thing too, because when i've seen a movie and know there's a sequel (especially something that's as obscure as this) i'm always curious. i've now had my curiosity satisfied and will never watch this again. most of ci2 is nothing but "flashbacks" to ci, and footage of ethel asleep, recalling fond memories, i guess. thanks to proposition 13 she's released from napa state (wonder if she got to see the cramps play while she was there?) and sent to a halfway house run by a nice old lady that ethel promptly takes to calling "granny". this is all filmed with a video camera so the picture and sound are rather pathetic, and it's even complete with a couple of "rolls". of course ethel does her thing, which is to dispatch anyone between her and food, especially the guy that witnesses one of her acts of mayhem and extorts her dessert. also, you have to wonder about any halfway house for murderers having a big drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink. guess that's all a matter of misguided "trust". if you liked or disliked criminally insane, either way there's no good reason to watch this except out of curiosity. one wonders why the makers of this even bothered. 2 out of 10.
