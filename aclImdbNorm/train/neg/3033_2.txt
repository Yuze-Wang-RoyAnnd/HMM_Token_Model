i am a very big fan of jenna jameson, but this movie is horrible. at the time jenna jameson was married to brad armstrong and he was the director of this film and jenna was the hottest porn star ever. so, of course, brad tried to make as much money as he could off her by making this big budget porn film. now i know why they don't make big budget porn movies anymore. in a fantasy world, porn stars could act, but this is the real world and they can't act. that's why there porn stars, if a women as beautiful as jenna could act, then she would have tried to go into mainstream movies instead of porn. just because your beautiful doesn't make you a movie star. a fine example of this is traci lords, when she was a teen thru her 20's she was one of the most beautiful, sexy women on earth. she made her move into low budget mainstream films and couldn't act. where is she now? i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because jenna is so hot, but there are better movies she has made then "dream quest". come on jenna, we don't want to hear you talk, as much as we want to see you have sex. also, you jenna, would have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you would have done anal on film.
