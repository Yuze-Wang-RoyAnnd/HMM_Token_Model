i just watched this movie. in one word: sucky! the story is bad, the acting is, if possible, even worse. the movie has one or two nice moments, but thats it and having those two small good moments, doesn't make up for anything in between, before or after those moments. a montrocity of a movie, not even worth watching on tv...
