when i found out there was a movie that had both my favorite actresses meryl streep and wynona ryder, i went through the roof!but i had a hard fall after watching this lame movie and i still have the bruise.first of all the character that jeremy irons (an actor i still admire even after this disappointment)plays was just awful. he treated his family like crap, especially his sister, played by glenn close. i could not get close or sympathize with any of the characters and i'm no prude, but the sex scenes were really unnecessary or they could have been toned down. wynona and antonio's characters could have been developed a lot more and their romance could have been much more passionate. and what was with meryl's character and her "mystical powers"? why didn't they go into this more? this film had a lot of dead ends and the bottom line is that this is a really lousy movie and there was a lot of wasted talent here.
