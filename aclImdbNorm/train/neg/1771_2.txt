this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen without a doubt. the only thing interesting in this film is the cameo appearances from some great genre directors and king himself. the film has a great premise, but falls apart about 15 minutes into the story. i did like madchen amick in this film and think she could have a very good career in film.
