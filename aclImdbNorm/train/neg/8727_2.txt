let me start out by saying i can enjoy just about any bad italian horror movie or jungle exploitation flick from the 1970's. seriously. this one was downright awful.<br /><br />there are way too many elements that martino tries to inject and none of them work (except for the croc-gone-wild thing) very well at all. there are some ignorant westerners, of course, who set up a resort in the jungle somewhere. i don't even remember where it takes place...how sad is that... basically, people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its' ceremonies but eventually they upset the 'alligator god' of the river who then proceeds to go on a rampage, killing said vacationers and some tribesmen as well. sounds good, yeah? well, don't get your hopes up. there is minimal violence until the end, the special effects are so bad it was like a kindergarten class performed them and the love story thrown in is laughable.<br /><br />there is seriously a few scenes where it appears they set up a camera underwater in a pool and threw a toy alligator, like a dart, into the water and that is supposed to be the gator attacking. i'm not kidding. in another wonderfully crafted special effect, a matchbox van is targeted by the incredible sinking plastic gator, who all of a sudden is five times the size of a van. (a few minutes ago, he was only big enough to eat a human, but now he dwarfs a full-size cargo van...) it is really pathetic. the only other flick i can think of where the effects were so bad i was pulled out of the story was bruno mattei's masterpiece, "rats," what with the plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all who couldn't be terrified.<br /><br />normally i'd say anything sergio martino was a solid must-see but this one is a must-pass. waste of time and definitely not worth buying for the $15+ sticker price from no shame. this one is a shame.<br /><br />2 out of 10, kids.
