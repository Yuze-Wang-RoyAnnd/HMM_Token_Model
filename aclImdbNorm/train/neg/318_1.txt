i stole this movie when i was a freshmen in college. i've tried to watch it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it. "sweet, adam sandler, i've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny its gotta be funny." wrong! i can't make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing match/insult war, where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain. you would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous, but after watching this you'll know its true. this movie isn't worth the price i paid for it. i've watched a ton of steven segal movies, and i've even watched crossroads twice... but i still couldn't watch this.
