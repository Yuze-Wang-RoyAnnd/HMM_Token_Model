the definition of an abomination as defined by webster's dictioary is "a cause of abhorrence or disgust." if someone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than this for alone in the dark, please let me know because this is the best i can come up with. however, i do no feel that in anyway this word describes how truly awful this film is.<br /><br />i went to see this film with two of my roommates. one has very similar tastes to me, the other is an action/adventure flick guru. this latter guy usually doesn't care about the size of the plot holes, as long as the movie contains lots of explosions he will walk away satisfied.<br /><br />that being said we entered the theater for the friday viewing of alone in the dark. little to my surprise we were the only people in the theater. when it started i knew why immediately.<br /><br />it begins with the worst opening scene of any movie, and unfortunately i have to admit it only gets worse from there. the opening scene is a 5 minute scroll text that is narrated. yet, i understand why it was narrated. the director must have understood that only illiterate people would even ascertain the thought of paying to see this movie. yet, not only is this first scene the longest scroll text in the history of cinema, but it also makes no sense. it seems as if in the same sequence we are hearing about to completely separate movies. one is about an ancient civilization and its tampering with a portal, the other is about a crazy scientist and his experiments on orphans. if you are reading this and are confused, you are not alone.<br /><br />then the awful storyline, acting, effects, and camera work begin. tara reid is horrendous as an actress. she does nothing to even for one second make you think that she is a museum curator. slater is just bad, not convincing, and has no chemistry with reid.<br /><br />the plot is probably the worst thing ever created by man. the entire time myself and the roommate with similar tastes are asking questions like: what is this? and what is going on? other than this scrolling garbage we have a few narrated sequences by slater himself. are they good? no. do they explain anything? no. do we at any point as an audience have the slightest inkling as to why we should care what happens? once again, no.<br /><br />then we have a random sex scene. we are told that slater and reid are together, yet at no time do they act as though they even care about on another. but then bam...sex scene. once again i don't know.<br /><br />a good, oh i don't know, 30 seconds after that woeful scene ends we have a gunfight with 20 or so military and a similar number of alien things. this is set to a heavy-metal track and causes more brain hemorrhaging than one ever thought possible.<br /><br />and if that wasn't enough...<br /><br />there exists no main villain. there is the scientist and there are the "alien" things. at one point the scientist controls the alien things and stands on a hill commanding them to attack the military outpost. why? how did he become the supreme commander of these things? why do they listen to him? once again i have no idea.<br /><br />the movie ends with slater and reid walking in an evacuated city. why was the city evacuated? did the alien things break through? did the military tell them? who knows...and by this point who cares? i didn't and you won't.<br /><br />but to top it off, slater and reid are attacked by an alien thing. even though it was stated that alien things will be killed by exposure to sunlight. and thats right, you guessed it, it the middle of the *&%$ing day and it's bright as can be. maybe the alien thing bought a pair of sunglasses, i don't know and i don't care.<br /><br />now after the movie ended i ran outside the theater, all 6 foot 6 inches of me, waving my arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to go see this movie. even my gung-ho action/adventure roommate (who would consider a movie that just cut and pasted 2 hours of explosion into 1 film to be the greatest thing ever created) admitted that plot holes were very evident in this film.<br /><br />to sum up this crap-fest i give it a 0.0/10 and would give it lower if i could.<br /><br />unequivocally, the worst movie ever made. i wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.
