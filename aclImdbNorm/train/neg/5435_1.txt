...they bothered making this movie? anyone? i didn't think so.<br /><br />if you are looking for a coming-of-age movie, go rent summer of '42. this is no summer of '42.<br /><br />when your big stars are nolte & sarsgaard, & sarsgaard gets more screen time, that is your first warning sign and, of course, for such an "artsy" movie, there is plenty of cursing & skin flung around, just to make it look "artsy".<br /><br />sarsgaard did his usual uninteresting, cardboard character, punctuated by moments that were supposed to be intense. the intensity is that of someone with bi-polar disorder.<br /><br />miller is most famous for her looks & what she had to say about the city of pittsburgh after this movie. pittsburgh should hold a grudge against her. she misrepresented an actual pittsburgh native.<br /><br />foster gave sarsgaard a run for his money in the cardboard acting style. wow! was this his first role after high school graduation?<br /><br />so, we have this weird triangle. foster has a crush on miller, but is with his boss/girlfriend. he can't take miller to bed, & won't take his boss to bed. so, he hangs with sarsgaard & miller, & watches them get it on.<br /><br />then, after one of sarsgaard's pseudo-intense moments, foster & miller get it on, a scene that we are "treated" to in every sloppy, moaning detail. finally, just to round it all out, foster & sarsgaard get it on, with foster in the miller role. now i know how 2 guys get it on (as if that was ever anything i needed to know).<br /><br />after all that, all that's left is the tragic ending for one character & the retrospective views of the remaining 2. it gets me right in the pit of my stomach. oh, wait! that was the pepperoni pizza i just had.<br /><br />i'd like back the time this movie took out of my life, please.
