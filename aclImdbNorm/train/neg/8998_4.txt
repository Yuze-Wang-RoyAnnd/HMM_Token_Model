stephen feinberg, who played the proctologist and was one of the writers of the movie, passed away in early 2006. i met steve in portland in 1993, it was a year latter when he told me that he had been a writer in hollywood years earlier, working mostly on tv promos. he asked me not to see 'tunnel vision', but it was too late, i had seen it already! actually i had seen it years before, when it was released. at that time i didn't think it was that bad a movie. however seeing it as an adult my opinion was somewhat different. yes is is a bit puerile as well as dated. steve admitted it was not a very good movie. that said he was just a little proud of 'the proctologist' sketch.
