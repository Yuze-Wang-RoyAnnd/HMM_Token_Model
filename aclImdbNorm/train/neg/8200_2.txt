this movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be. there were a couple of sub-plots that for awhile made you think these items would all come together in the end... but they didn't. if you want a "alien in the frozen waste" story, stick with the 1950's version of the thing (not the abomination that was remade in gore-o-vision 20+ years later).<br /><br />i couldn't get over the fact that the "alien" looked pretty much recycled from independence day. <br /><br />the "bare minimum" sets would have been more effective if they had hired actors who could actually act and carry off the intended mood.<br /><br />lots of scenery chewing with little payoff.
