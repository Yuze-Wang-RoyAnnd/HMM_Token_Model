sorry, not good.<br /><br />it starts out interesting, but looses its way a few minutes into the movie.<br /><br />it does not help a lot that none of the normally great actors (quaid, glover, ermey, leto etc.) delivers a really good performance. <br /><br />it might be owed to the fact that i saw a dubbed version (german), but dennis quaid's character was especially wooden and annoying, and danny glover does not really make for a believable villain. moreover, jared leto's character does not really contribute to the story whatsoever (except saving one main character's life at one point, but that scene is as necessary as a windshield wiper on a submarine in the first place ;-)<br /><br />speaking of unnecessary scenes - the main complaint is really the tangled and clich'e-ridden storyline: the detective (of course!) has to settle a personal matter with the villain and is (of course!) suspended from his official duties courtesy of his personal entanglement. the killer (of course!) *wants* to be tracked down and plays a cat-and-mouse game with his opponent for years ... i don't know how many movies build on a similar plot - most of them better, however.<br /><br />the plot has got holes galore and many completely unbelievable and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute to or work well with the storyline at all (e.g. the truck stop scene or the car at the cliff's edge etc.)<br /><br />to top it off, the ending tries to be original and exciting, but fails completely in these regards. we've seen *much* better finales with a similar kind of ultimate-battle-on-a-train-in-a-forlorn-winter-landscape setup ... in the end there is the supposedly moving reunion of parent and child ... hokey, at the least.
