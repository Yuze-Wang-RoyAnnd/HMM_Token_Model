i'm 47 years old and i've spent as much of my life as i can remember, a fan of horror and sci-fi films. be they silent, black and white, no budget or big budget, there are very few of them that i can't find something to like about. that said, i'll give this movie credit for good gore and creature effects but that's all. this is a case of effects over story. truth is we live in a time where there is very little left that hasn't been seen in a horror film. therefor for a film of any kind to really entertain it must have a good, original story. a good story can overcome poor effects and bad acting but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie. this movie doesn't even have good acting, only good effects. so unless you can only about the gore, pass this one up.
