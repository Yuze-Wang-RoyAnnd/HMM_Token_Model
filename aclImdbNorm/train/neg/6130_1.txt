during the early 1980's, kurt thomas was something of a hero in the united states. inevitably, men in his position get offered film roles that exist solely to capitalize on that. i have no idea what thomas was paid to make this film, but i would have to be paid a big heap of money to agree to make a national fool of myself in a motion picture. the film is obviously derived from "enter the dragon," as are most martial arts pictures. only instead of a real martial art, they concoct an absurd new martial art, accurately described by one critic as "a cross between kung fu and break dancing." a gymnast (thomas, of course) is hired to rescue some lady from an impenetrable fortress, yet every room has a prop that is exactly what thomas needs to kick the assistant baddies. of course, he fights his way to the lead villain, and of course they have a fancy-dancy fight, with an ending that will surprise only those who have never seen a marshal arts film. there are touches which nostalgic types will like, particularly the mullet haircuts of thomas and many of the male co-stars have. but the only reason to watch this film is if you have a grudge against kurt thomas, who now wishes he had never set foot on the film set.
