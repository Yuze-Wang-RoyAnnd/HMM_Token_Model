come on, what is the deal with this show, power rangers anyways? i always felt that the show, which was originally brought over from japan in a better form, took what was great in japan, and turned into one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in toy merchandising history! there is absolutely no point with this show whatsoever.<br /><br />the bad haircuts, bad costumes, earrings, etc, all show what was ridiculous back in the 1990s from the two idiots, bulk and skull, to the "duhs", of the main cast, jason, trini, tommy, kimberly, billy and zack, i just want to say one thing: give me a break!<br /><br />saban brought this from japan, and then disney bought the rights to this show around five years ago.<br /><br />now the public has to endure reruns of this show on the disney channel and such.<br /><br />all i can say once again is give me a break!
