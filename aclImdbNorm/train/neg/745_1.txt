i'm not really sure how to even begin to describe how bad this movie is. i like bad films, as they are often the most entertaining. i love bad special effects, bad acting, bad music, and inept direction. with the exception of the music (which was better than i had expected), this movie had all of those qualities. <br /><br />the special effects were amazingly bad. the worst i've seen since my nintendo 64. some scenes to watch for include the thunderchild, the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot, the big ben scene, the train wreck... wow, there are so many bad effects! on the plus side, though, some scenes of the alien walkers are well done.<br /><br />the acting was about as bad as it could possibly have been, having been based directly on h.g. wells' book. for having such good source material, it's almost as though the actors were trying to be so over-the-top as to make it funny. and then there's the mustache... the single most distracting piece of facial hair i've seen in a long time. of course, only half the movie contains acting. the rest is characters walking around aimlessly and poorly rendered effects shots.<br /><br />to say that timothy hines is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors. with the use of different colored filters between shots for no particular reason, the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside scenes, the bad green screening, it's amazing to me how this man ever got approval to direct a movie. i wouldn't imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this bad a movie. bravo, mr. hines. bravo. <br /><br />my advice to anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what i did: have some friends who enjoy bad movies over, drink, play poker while watching it, keep drinking, and maybe you'll make it all the way through. it does make for an excellent bad movie, so have fun and laugh yourself silly with this disaster.
