i had the misfortune to watch this rubbish on sky cinema max in a cold winter night. i am not a big fan of horror movies, because most of them are just trash. this one is even worse: it is one of the dumbest pieces of crap i've ever seen in my whole life. horror movie? yes, there are horrible things in this: the acting, the script and the special effects - gosh, i laughed at this ludicrous attempt to make a flick for 90 minutes. actually, had it been a comic movie i would've given it a 5. don't you even think about renting this unless you want to mock at the producers.<br /><br />vote: 2 out of 10 - didn't vote one because it made me laugh all the time ;-)
