have you ever seen a movie made up entirely of long wide shots? no? me, neither. well, i've finally seen one in "spring in my hometown," and i must confess, now i know why people don't do this. the technique is "arty," to be sure, but it's definitely not ripe for public consumption. the technique is heavily flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and perhaps that might be the director's whole intentions. i don't know, i can't read minds, and i certainly don't know enough about the director to make a judgement.<br /><br />but one thing about this movie that is painfully obvious is its ridiculous anti-american sentiments. as an american, i'm well aware of my country's participation in the korean war, and i'm very well aware that we weren't always angels, but i'll be damn if i'll take this guy's version of how things happened. according to this blind fool, americans were not only at the root of the war, we were the cause of the war, and we almost singlehandedly destroyed the country. whatever, mister director. and i suppose you'd still be making this film in communist korea if we hadn't interfered, right? talk about forgetting your history. this is almost akin to making the nazis the "good guys" while turning the allied forces into the "bad guys." this movie is so historically naive and so factually inaccurate that it's almost embarrassing to watch. for a man who comes from a country that owes its very existence to american interference, he sure comes off as high and mighty and judgemental.
