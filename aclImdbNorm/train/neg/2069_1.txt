i went to go see this at the esquire theatre in cincy, oh, and - i hate my life now.<br /><br />christopher reeves would have been a more believable boxer.<br /><br />as a film it was painful, but seeing bret carr in person was to see desperation at its pinnacle.<br /><br />my favorite part of the movie was seeing bc slammed in the face with what appeared to be a "c" battery. the jury is still out on this. it was from a dildo and it was in slow-mo. yep.<br /><br />"shoot the left side of the face only...people become famous by demanding things!" - bret carr b. carr donned a chicken suit for a bit of reverse psychology, roaming the streets of clifton bashing his own film. he should. this is correct to bash the film.<br /><br />my soul felt chafed after this movie.<br /><br />bret carr is not charismatic enough to be the leader of a cult, or smart enough for that matter. that is the feeling you get from the what the bleepesque trickle of brainwashed, impressionable neo-yuppies that came to see this bret carr piece of work.<br /><br />it's an emotionally draining experience just thinking about writing about this film, so goodbye.<br /><br />-anonymous
