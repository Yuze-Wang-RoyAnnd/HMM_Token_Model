if i have to give this movie a score on a linear scale, then i have to give it a low score 3/10.<br /><br />but it was entertaining, and there are several good things to say about the movie.<br /><br />the psychiatrist candidate james bishop is assigned to st. andrews hospital for his resident, and is exited and eager to "change the world".<br /><br />from the beginning of the movie you know that the hospital is hiding an evil truth, but james thinks he can make a difference and doesn't recognise this evil. <br /><br />the story builds fairly well, you know all the time that there is a truth in what the patients are telling about some resident evil, and wonder when and how james will discover this. also when the break comes, james is in a way hunted by the evil, and you feel some suspense until "the fight" is over.<br /><br />add an innocent beautiful girlfriend that arrives at the worst possible time and other standard horror elements, and you get the picture.<br /><br />the character buildup is actually fairly good, you are introduced to most of the people that gets killed, some of them you "get to know".<br /><br />the film sets an unpleasant scene, this is also done fairly well. there are mysteries that are unveiled - in an acceptable way.<br /><br />the main character, james is very believable - the story about an eager student starting to work is good in this setting.<br /><br />what kills this movie is: * stupid special effects - a modern version of "plan 9 from outer space"-type bad (the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * some bad acting (or probably very few takes when filming) - the main characters sometimes acts badly, and somtimes good. * the sound is at times very cheap.<br /><br />i kept thinking "i could make a movie like this with my home video camera" throughout the film.
