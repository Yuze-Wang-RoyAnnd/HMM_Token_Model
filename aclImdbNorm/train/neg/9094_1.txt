okay, let me break it down for you guys...it's horrible! <br /><br />if roger kumble did such a fancy job on the first cruel intentions then why did he do such a bad job on this. i'm sorry but this movie is stupid, true it may have improved if its series was ever aired but lets be realistic...this movie a crock! a lot of bad acting *note the shower scene* "kissing cousins" ?????? what kind of line is that? "slipery when wet" ?????????? can we say duh-m! this movie had effort, i'll give you that, but it was too stupid! they even tried to make it funny by giving the house servants stupid accents which actually....wasn't funny! it was pathetic. not to mention that they made everyone in the this one look absolutely nothing like the original cast. it's as if they made them look different on purpose or something! i like watching it when i'm really really really board which doesn't happen occasionally. for those of you who did like it...okay, what were you thinking? could you possibly choose this movie over the other one which had great acting and the fabulous sarah michelle gellar? a movie is gold if it has sarah michelle gellar in it, duh! but this movie doesn't, no offense amy adams. oh, yeah since when does sebastain have a heart????? ugh!
