so, i got a hold of this as an assignment for trent harris, who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the u of u. i guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his film...<br /><br />the documentary section at the beginning dragged on. yes, the kid is a nut-job from no where, but that's not good enough to keep it interesting.<br /><br />seeing sean penn dressed as a onj is the only highlight... and after about thirty seconds it loses all humor.<br /><br />when crispin glover takes on larry, the story-telling was better, but i just couldn't take anymore...
