i was very excited about seeing this film, anticipating a visual excursus on the relation of artistic beauty and nature, containing the kinds of wisdom the likes of "rivers and tides." however, that's not what i received. instead, i get a fairly uninspired film about how human industry is bad for nature. which is clearly a quite unorthodox claim.<br /><br />the photographer seems conflicted about the aesthetic qualities of his images and the supposed "ethical" duty he has to the workers occasionally peopling the images, along the periphery. and frankly, the images were not generally that impressive. and according to this "artist," scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful.<br /><br />in all respects, a stupid film. for people who'd like to feel better about their environmental consciousness ... but not for any one who would like to think about the complexities of the issues surrounding it.
