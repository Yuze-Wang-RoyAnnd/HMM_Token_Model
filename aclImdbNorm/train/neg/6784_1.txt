i attempted watching this movie twice and even then fast forwarding the irritating parts but still could not make it to the end.<br /><br />i don't understand how this movie *genuinely* got any good reviews. i think these people giving such good reviews are just trying to hype the movie for marketing purposes. their reviews seem very unrealistic and it looks like an inside job, which makes things more pitiful. movies should get true positive comments on their own steam and not contrived ones!! <br /><br />the acting was reminiscent of a cheesy porno movie, and not in a funny way. i don't mind low budget movies with bad acting if they know how to work with it. <br /><br />i found the lead character to be irritating. his facial expressions and humor was unbearably childish. i thought this was intentional to make the womens conspiracy seem more enjoyable and founded, but they were even worse. <br /><br />the script was also very awkward (his bosses overdone business speech) and the unfunny sarcastic remarks. <br /><br />i did not find anything redeeming about this movie other than some of the attractive women.<br /><br />never have i felt that a rating was this misleading. i was interested by its premise but scared off by everything else. of course see it if you want, but i just didn't want anyone else to get their hopes up/waste their time. <br /><br />maybe it is just me... probably not.
