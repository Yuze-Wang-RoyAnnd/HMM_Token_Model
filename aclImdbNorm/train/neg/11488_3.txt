it's hard to imagine that anyone could find this short their favorite if they have seen most of their shorts, but i know that humor is very subjective. i have seen all of their sound shorts (by far the best of their stuff imo) and i found this one of their weaker efforts.<br /><br />in the year this was made (1930) stan and babe made 15 shorts and one feature. they were extremely popular and their boss hal roach took full advantage by keeping them working constantly. in addition, this was a time of experimentation for the writers and stan. i would say this was an experiment that really did not work. as someone else said, it does not play to their strengths. too much dialog and plot.<br /><br />the best part of this one for me is the largely improvised sequence with stan as agnes the maid and the great thelma todd talking about "girl" stuff.<br /><br />if you really want to see the boys at their most creative and funny check out blotto, or brats from the same year.<br /><br />they made so many shorts in such a short time that i think they can be forgiven for turning out a few less then par shorts. they made something like 108 films altogether. very few (except for the ones made at fox) were outright failures but there are some. county hospital, me and my pal, the live ghost, the fixer uppers come to mind as essentially weak ones. but other then those i find something wonderful in just about all their shorts. quite a record in my book.<br /><br />if you have seen and enjoyed all their other shorts then by all means check this one out, but i would be willing to bet that this one was less then memorable to stan and babe.
