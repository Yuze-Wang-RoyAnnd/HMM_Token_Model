please don't rent or even think about buying this movie.they don't even have it available at the red box to rent which would cost a $1 & i think its worth less than that.the main reason why i rented this d movie was because jenna jameson is in the movie lol between 2-5 min.i will give credit that the movie had hot chicks and quite a bit of nudity but other than that you might as well buy another d horror movie that has the same thing with nobody you know.ginger lynn has more acting time in this movie than jenna & she's not even on the front cover of the movie nor her name.i recommend people to watch zombie strippers because you see jenna almost throughout the whole movie & nude most of the time.this movie is a big disappointment & such a huge waste of time.
