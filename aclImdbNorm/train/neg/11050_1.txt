terrible use of scene cuts. all continuity is lost, either by awful scripting or lethargic direction. that villainous robot... musta been a jazz dancer? also, one of the worst sound tracks i've ever heard (monologues usually drowned out by music.) and... where'd they get their props? that ship looks like a milk carton... i did better special effects on 8mm at the age of 13!<br /><br />i'd recommend any film student should watch this flick (5 minutes at a time) so as to learn how not to produce a film. or... was it the editors' fault?<br /><br />it's really too bad, because the scenario was actually a good concept... just poorly executed all the way around. (sorry malcom. you should have sent a "stunt double". you're too good an actor for such a stink-bomb.)
