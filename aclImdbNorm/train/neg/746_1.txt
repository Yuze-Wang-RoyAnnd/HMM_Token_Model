save the $8.97 you'll spend at walmart to buy this dvd and go see the real film by steven spielberg.<br /><br />i'm a filmmaker, and being an avid fan of h.g. wells, i had to buy this hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment. instead, it took four days to finish watching this because i couldn't stand watching more than 10 minutes at a time. it's horrible.<br /><br />there are reports that timothy hines had a $20 million budget for this production. where the heck did it go? did he use most of it to buy a new house? finance his retirement? or what? let me start with what is actually good about this film. it does stay true to the book and there are a few good performances in it. i can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film. but good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible... and i do mean horrible special effects. any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with the cgi. to me, most of it looked like "stop action" card board cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated cgi software that a $20 million project should be using.<br /><br />there's no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film. my own partner and i sat down and recreated our version of the ferry scene using software that cost less than $1500.00 and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what hines created. i've seen films with budgets of less than $2 million look better. much better.<br /><br />in my opinion the special effects used in the original king kong were more sophisticated and better than hines' special effects in this film. in fact, i have a much better appreciation for attack of the killer tomatoes because of this film. there's no excuse with today's technology for a film to look like a 50's b-movie unless that was the intention, which shouldn't have been with this particular project.<br /><br />a problem i had with the dvd transfer was that the film is jerky, another demonstration of amateur film-making.<br /><br />overall, i have to say that i produced a $45,000 project in 2003 that have better cinematography and special effects than this film.<br /><br />i strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good film-making or who is a fan of wotw to leave this film on the shelf and watch attack of the 50 foot woman instead. it would be easier on the eyes.
