bela lugosi is not typecast in this fantastic twelve-part adventure serial, playing the lead as frank chandler/chandu the magician, enjoying his role as a representative of the forces of white magic pushed against those of black, while displaying vigourous fighting skill, successfully wooing a young egyptian princess, and cutting a lean and dashing figure in yachting gear, complete with nautical cap. the somewhat lumpy plot engages chandler/chandu in an ongoing series of escapades pointed at achieving the rescue of his fiancee, princess nadji(maria alba) and others from the clutches of the idol-worshipping sect of ubasti, which covets nadji's blood in order to revivify an ancient mummified princess entombed upon the mysterious island of lemuria. director ray taylor, an old hand at such entertainments keeps events moving briskly, but repeated scenes and footage, a good deal of which is to be found in the previous year's skull island setting from king kong, and the port locale from son of kong, reduces original action to less than 60 minutes from the serial's running length of over two and one-half hours and, if viewed at one sitting, becomes lacking in effect to most viewers, unless insomniac.
