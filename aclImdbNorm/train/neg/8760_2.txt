this film concerns purportedly non-establishment types (aesthetically and sexually) who apparently cannot resist basic romantic needs. although some excellent players take part, including jon tenney, timothy olyphant, and cynthia nixon, they are grounded by a puerile script which relies nearly totally upon clever dialogue; which isn't. nixon's role possesses the best lines, but she often homes in on them too quickly, a timing flaw which must be saddled upon the director. the grotesque climax utilizes every available cliche, spent or not, and fittingly ends this drab attempt at comedy.
