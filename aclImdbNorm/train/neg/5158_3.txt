sometimes, making something strange and contemporary doesn't always work to everyone's advantage. while i will admit that the set design and concept of the film was rather interesting, the execution of these ideas into one congruent story just didn't work. this film was so hideously slow and pointless, not even robin williams could save this garbage. it's obvious barry levinson's dream fell flat on its face, but he should have warned the rest of the world about this slop.
