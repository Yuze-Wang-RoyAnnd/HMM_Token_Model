first, i am not really a fan of the whole "things eating flesh in disgusting new ways" genre of film but i am a bad movie afficionado so my next door neighbor said he had the worst movie ever. this one. so we start watching it. first and foremost - it is recorded on a camcorder sans tripod! second the voice of the skinny white doctor is dubbed by a large black man! third, none of the dialogue makes any sense. fourth, the zombie scenes, though unconvincing and chockful of poor makeup and tomato paste, lead me to believe the director (and my next door neighbor) are in need of psychological help. it's funny for about 5 minutes but it gets old fast. it's so amateurish it's like watching a poorly dubbed high school video yearbook.... with zombies. a note to anyone involved with this movie - i want the 20 minutes of my life i spent watching this, before i fell asleep, back.
