this movie was exactly what i expected it to be when i first read the casting. i probably could have written a more exciting plot, it's a pity that they left it to a pack of howler monkeys. alberto tomba was surely a good skier but he has to thank god (and we too) that he does not have to rely on his actor skills to earn his living. he can't play, he can't talk, he can't even move very good on mainland without his skis... michelle hunziker is a pretty blonde girl, and that's all. she obviously wasn't chosen for her astounding competence in dramatic roles but most probably for her nice legs. nevertheless i must admit that she could be the tomba's acting teacher, because he's even a worse actor than her, and that's funny, especially considering that she isn't italian. i laughed all the time, watching this movie. i found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it actually made me laugh, loud, very loud.
