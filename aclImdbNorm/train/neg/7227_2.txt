while others may contend that by viewing other works by bilal, one will better appreciate this movie, it does fail in one major way. it does not stand on its own. the plot is a mishmash that is confuses symbolism with substance. here's an idea start with a definite story. then craft symbolism around it. we start with two different narratives, this female that is somehow turning human, a "god" that is for some reason being judged, but getting one last fling on earth, and this mysterious john character who seems to be developing some sort of "resort" just beyond the bounds of the city. why? none of these questions are answered. but do we care, no. there is no development to want us to empathize with any character in the story, the closest we get jill and even then the development is spotty at best. unfortunately the movie gets caught up in the the whole visually impressive (which it is,) but at the expense of motivic development. i would love to see this rewritten by someone who could distance themselves from the material a bit and not have to feel that every image has to be in the picture.
