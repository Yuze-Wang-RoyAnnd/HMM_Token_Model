if this film had a budget of 20 million i'd just like to know where the money went. a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage, although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really, really cool on an original play-station 1 game, and early pc games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made. what puzzles me is where did the money go? pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa 1975-83, and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing (or ruining in this case) for about the same 20 million. this is quite possibly the worst film ever made! i would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again. i hated it completely! i regress. i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan 9 or killer tomatoes, or santa claus conquers the martians, these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them, you love them. there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it. i sold it to a guy for a dollar. i'm betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew. shame on you pendragon films! i want my money back!
