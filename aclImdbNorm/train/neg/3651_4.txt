i was expecting a very funny movie. instead, i got a movie with a few funny jokes, and many that just didn't work. i didn't like the idea of bringing in sherlock holmes' and moriarty's descendants. it was confusing. it would have been more funny if they just had someone new, instead of moriarty resurrected. some of the things were funny. burt kwouk was very funny, as always. mccloud on the horse was funny. the mcgarrett from hawaii 5-0 was not even mcgarrett-like. connie booth obviously is very good with accents. she is from indiana, but played english and a new yorker pretty well. unfortunately, she was not presented much into the script. i was expecting a more funny film. instead, i got a rather confusing movie with a poor script. rather ironic, since both booth and cleese were together on this one. maybe they were about to break up in 77.
