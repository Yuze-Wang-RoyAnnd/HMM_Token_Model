mislead by the terrible lie on the cover, "fun as american pie", my girlfriend and i sat in front of the tv waiting for a comedy... and this is definitely not one. you probably won't laugh one time if you're not one of those jackass-like ever-teeny minds. it's not even an erotic movie, which would at least been something, given that it's about sex...<br /><br />so, what is this? the erratic plot deals with a guy who wants to lose virginity (zero in originality, i remember "losing it" for one) and his gang of friends. the rest of the characters (i.e. the girls) just come and go for no credible reason. come on, there are even dwarfs (so simple: "dwarves are fun ho ho"...) the acting is very tv-like (as is the video look throughout the movie) and definitely amateur in the case of most of the girls...<br /><br />awful movie. amateurish, badly produced, and over all not funny. kids and teens will love to watch it with friends because of the swearing and sex jokes. other than that, don't even think of renting this movie.
