the only previous gordon film i had watched was the kiddie adventure the magic sword (1962), though i followed this soon after with empire of the ants (1977); he seems to be best remembered, however, for his sci-fi work of the 1950s.<br /><br />anyway, i happened upon this one in a dvd rental shop: hadn't i noticed orson welles' unmistakable figure on the sleeve, i probably wouldn't even have bothered with it - since i know the film under its original title, necromancy! i'd seen a still from it on an old horror tome of my father's: the actor's presence in a film about diabolism seemed like a great idea which couldn't possibly miss, but the end result - particularly in this bastardized edition - is a disaster! i honestly felt sorry for welles who looks bored and, rather than in his deep and commanding voice, he mutters the inane demonic invocations almost in whispers!! <br /><br />the plot is, basically, yet another retread of rosemary's baby (1968): a couple is invited to a remote community under false pretenses and soon discover themselves to be surrounded by diabolists. the girl, played by pamela franklin, ostensibly has supernatural powers (passed on from her mother, who appears intermittently throughout to warn her - though, as delivered in an intense manner through clenched teeth, the latter's speeches end up being largely incoherent and the fount of immense hilarity every time she appears!) and is expected to revive welles' deceased young son from the dead!! for what it's worth, franklin - a genre regular, right down from her debut performance in the innocents (1961) - isn't bad in her role (which requires some nudity and experiences several semi-eerie hallucinations during the course of the film); hubby michael ontkean, however, isn't up to the challenge of his john cassavetes-like character. some of the other girls look good as well - notably lee purcell, whose belated decision to help franklin in escaping from town eventually proves her undoing.<br /><br />events come to a head in an incredibly muddled climax, which sees the satanists ultimately turning on franklin and have her take the revived boy's place in the coffin (that's gratitude for you!). while the added scenes do stick out (the hilarious opening ceremony and other would-be erotic embellishments), the overall quality of the film would have still been poor without them; then again, this particular version is further sunk by the tacked-on electronic score - which is wholly inappropriate, and cheesy in the extreme!
