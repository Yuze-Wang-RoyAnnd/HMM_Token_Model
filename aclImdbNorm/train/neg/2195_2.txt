the brain that wouldn't die is one awful piece of film that stinks from the opening credits. it's got all the classic signs of being bad: unbelieveable plotline, terrible acting, low-grade sets and lighting. the plotline goes like this: when a doctor and his fiancee get caught in an accident, she gets decapitated and he picks up her head and takes her to his lab, where he sets up her head in a pan with some special liquid that keeps it alive. i'll bet virgnina leath, who played the head in a pan had to spend a lot of uncomfortable time wearing that pan around her neck and squatting under a table. anyway, the doctor then tries to find her a new body, and hires two strippers so she can chose one to have her new body. bad all the way through, so bad it was torn to pieces on mystery science theater 3000.
