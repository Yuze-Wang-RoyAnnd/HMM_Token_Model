i admit, having come of age in the hippie-dippy age, i am a sucker for these kind of movies. i can enjoy some of the schlock of the hippie genre far more than most "normal" people. however, this movie is simply awful in every conceivable way.<br /><br />every trite perception of the hippie silliness is presented as gospel, cops kill a young long hair when he peacefully lands a plane. this movie is so horrible that it is not even funny to watch as a goof on the excesses of the hippie drone. it is like a left wing version of dragnet, except without professional actors. the only reason i gave it two stars was because there are some obscurities of interest on the soundtrack, besides, i couldn't find a selection for negative stars.<br /><br />no actors, almost no plot, sheeze, barely even a script...you got it, an "art" movie....all this done at root canal drilling slowness, dragging out each meaningless scene just to fill up time.<br /><br />in a bizarre twist of life imitating art, the star "nonactor" of the movie joined a commune in real life and robbed a bank in boston, one of his co-robbers was killed and he was sent to jail where he was killed in a suspicious weightlifting "accident".....and just think, he got to leave this behind as a legacy....oy vey.
