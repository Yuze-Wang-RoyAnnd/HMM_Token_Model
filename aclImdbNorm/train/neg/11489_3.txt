in the u.s., very few films have been made about rome that were not set in the time of julius caesar or shortly thereafter. hollywood's sword and sandal epics mostly have a christian theme, which makes it difficult to get into earlier roman history (spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule, and encountered some resistance in hollywood because it did not have jesus in it).<br /><br />it's interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of caesar and christ, but is set when rome was only one city among many on the italian peninsula, and had just ousted the hated king tarquin and formed the republic.<br /><br />however, this is not a historical film; it's peplum, and while the production values aren't rock bottom, the acting and characterizations are cardboard. i can only imagine what the dialogue was like in italian, but with wooden english dubbing it's very campy. i got a few good laughs out of it at first.<br /><br />i haven't seen many films of this genre, having missed most of the hercules movies of the 60s. it's amusing up to a point, but as the film goes on, it gets somewhat boring.<br /><br />one thing's for sure: if i'd seen this movie when i was ten years old, i would have loved it. at that age, i went for anything with romans and swordfights in it. so at least, this flick brought back some childhood memories.
