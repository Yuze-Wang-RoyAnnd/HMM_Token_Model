this is without a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie steven seagal has ever made. and that says a lot. don't get fooled by the rating, it's way too good. this abomination hadn't even been worthy of a 0/10 rating, if such a thing existed. <br /><br />- absolutely no plot <br /><br />- worst action scenes ever, and there aren't too many of them either <br /><br />- seagal doesn't do anything himself, including the fighting, talking (lots of dubbing), and so on. as always. <br /><br />- seagal is fat, lazy and couldn't care less about this movie. something which is very obvious all the way through<br /><br />take all the other garbage dtv movies seagal has made, multiply them with each other, multiply this with a thousand billions, and all the badness you then get won't even describe 1 % of this absolute crapfest.
