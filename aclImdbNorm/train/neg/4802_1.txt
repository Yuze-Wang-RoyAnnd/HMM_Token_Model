i give this marriage 3 years and thats stretching it. adrianne curry is fouled mouth, spoiled, controlling, loud, and her bi sexual past makes me laugh. she tells chris he has an image to protect and must avoid strip clubs. he married her. chris has low self esteem and from a different time warp. i have nothing against adrianne curry but this combination is not gonna have a happy ever after ending. her mother said he was an old rooster and thinks this is his last attempt to recapture his youth. here 2 very good people who are gonna end up in a nasty divorce. i don't think his old " brady family" is gonna fit into his new life. i see them being shut out. chris said his friends were more important than his family. the supported him and was there for him.
