before the internet this movie could never have been made but the idea that the web is full of evil is the idea behind it.unfortunately thats all it was-the generally opinion that nowadays the web in the wring hands can create as much chaos as anything in real life. since the late 90s somebody found out that you could create a virus which would disable a computer.the point? just to do something plain evil by remote control so its the cyber equivalent of robbery with violence.which is basically what spam is without the violence-its conning you into parting with your money and has been going so long its a wonder anybody takes any notice of it nowadays so they get cleverer and use real names as doing something illegal isn't a priority, we see the internet get worse by the week-the social networking sites or chat room which lead to evil and the child porn sites which are illegal. so the idea of a movie which invites people to click a name is just the same old thing-there actually is a site called horrorvision which is a porn site-but this one kills the people who enter its portals. the story though is so disjointed its boring with it and comes to no conclusion. the definitive movie on this theme of destroying an internet service provider has yet to be made but clearly many do need destroying as they won't be shut down when there's money to be made. calling this a horror film is rather misleading as it bores not frightens
