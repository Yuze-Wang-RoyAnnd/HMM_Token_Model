the original lensman series of novels is a classic of the genre. it's pure adventure sf with some substance (here and there) and i've always wondered why hollywood hasn't filmed it verbatim because it's just the kind of thing they love: massive explosions, super-weapons, uber-heroics, hero gets the girl, aliens (great cgi potential), good versus evil in the purest form, etc etc. instead (and bear in mind i'm a japan-o-phile and anime lover) we get this horrendous kiddies movie that rips the guts out of the story, mixes in star-wars (ironic as the latter ripped off the books occasionally) pastiches and dumbs the whole thing down to 'thundercats' level. to see kimball kinnison, the epitome of the galactic patrol officer and second stage lensman portrayed as a small boy is pitiful (etc). i just can't understand why the makers did this because they obviously had the rights to the story and could have made far more money (far!) by telling straight. it makes no sense.
