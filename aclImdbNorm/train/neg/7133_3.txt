i felt like i was watching the fast and the furious again, but with different actors and a little bit different plot. i will say the cars in the film are very cool. so, if you like fast cars, then you will probably find this movie mildly entertaining. i also liked nadia bjorlin because i've seen her from days of our lives. she is a really good singer, but too bad they gave her such lousy songs to sing in this movie. i mean songs about cars; not exactly what you would here on the radio. since it is a hollywood film, you have to give this story a little lee way, but in real life i don't think any average joe would come across such a hot girl as nadia bjorlin who can drive a race car, fix a car engine, and be a lead singer. it's just all very silly.<br /><br />another side note, any one willing to wager 25 million on a car race is a nut. but it was kinda of cool at the end when natasha stops right before the finish line and screws michael over. priceless.<br /><br />final verdict: this movie is for car freaks. so, if you like fast cars, then i'd recommend this.
