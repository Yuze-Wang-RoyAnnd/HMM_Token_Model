i knew my summary would get you. how is this movie like a pet rock and disco?! well, unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s, you probably can't understand why anyone would like a new coke or own a pet rock (and frankly, at least in the case of pet rocks, i still don't understand it completely). they're just a couple things that seemed to make sense at the time but really baffle the younger generation. the same can be said for kay kyser and his band. at the time (the 1940s mostly), they were very popular and had enough clout that the studio starred them with boris karloff, bela lugosi and peter lorre in this film. yet, if you didn't live at that time (it was well before my time), you wonder why anyone liked this sort of "entertainment". after all, kyser and his band mates are incredibly obnoxious and their humor is very, very broad (i.e., unsophisticated and cheesy). frankly, i couldn't stand their antics nor did i appreciate that there were just too many musical numbers in the film. because of these factors, the great supporting cast was given a back seat and fans of these actors will probably be disappointed.<br /><br />the film involves kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live. once there, the bridge is washed out and strange happenings begin. eventually, it culminates in some attempts on sally's life and a s'eance (of sorts). it's all played for laughs--and it's really not a horror movie despite the cast.<br /><br />overall, it's passable entertainment at best. as a lugosi and karloff fan, i sure felt cheated having to watch kyser and his knuckleheads.
