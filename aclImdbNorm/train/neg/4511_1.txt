rather then long dance sequences and close ups of the characters which made the film drag on - the movie would have been better served explaining the story and motivations of the characters.<br /><br />the marginalisation of nubo, the minister, auntie, mother - and the dumbing down of the dynamic and important rivalry between hatsumo and mameha and hatsumo and sayuri made the movie lack any real depth. if you hadn't read the book you would not really understand why sayuri loved the chairman and why mameha became her mentor at all.<br /><br />visually the film was stunning - and the actors all did the best with the c rate script they were given, but that was all that was good about this movie.
