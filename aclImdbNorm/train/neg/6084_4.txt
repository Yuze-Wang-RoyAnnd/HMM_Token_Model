it's possible that a man called sledge might have been done irreparable damage on the cutting room floor. maybe someone will demand a director's cut one day, but i seriously doubt it.<br /><br />james garner decided to cash in on the spaghetti western market and in doing so brought a whole lot of americans over to fill the cast out. folks like dennis weaver, claude akins, john marley. and of course we have vic morrow who both wrote and directed this film.<br /><br />garner always gets cast as likable rogues because he's so darn good at playing them. but he has played serious and done it well in films like the children's hour and hour of the gun. he can and has broken away from his usual stereotyped part successfully. but a man called sledge can't be counted as one of his successes.<br /><br />he's got the title role as luther sledge notorious outlaw with a big price on his head. after partner tony young gets killed in a saloon and garner takes appropriate eastwood style measures, he's followed from the saloon by john marley.<br /><br />marley's spent time in the nearby territorial prison and it seems as though gold shipments are put under lock and key there on a rest stop for the folks transporting the stuff on a regular run. garner gets his gang together for a heist.<br /><br />here's where the movie goes totally off the wall. usually heist films show the protagonists going into a lot of methodical planning. certainly that was the case in the war wagon which some other reviewer cited. but in this one garner decides to break into the prison as a prisoner of fake us marshal dennis weaver and cause a jailbreak at which time the gold will be robbed. <br /><br />that was just too much to swallow. if taking the gold was this easy it should have been done a long time before. but i will say for those who like the blood and guts of italian westerns, during that prison break there's enough there for three movies.<br /><br />that's not the whole thing, of course the outlaws fall out and we have another gore fest before the film ends. but by that time the whole film has lost a lot of coherency.<br /><br />the great movie singer of the thirties allan jones is listed in the credits. but for the life of me i can't find him in the film. maybe a chorus of the donkey serenade might have made this better.<br /><br />couldn't have hurt any.
