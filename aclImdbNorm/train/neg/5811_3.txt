i have not seen this movie in ages but figured i'd comment on it anyway, mostly because the memory of disliking it so intently is burned into my memory cells. the original the getaway was no prize to begin with but at least had the distinctions of being 1) a sam peckinpah movie, 2) featured steve mcqueen, ben johnson, and slim pickens, 3) was a relatively painless way to blow away an hour and a half of time.<br /><br />by comparison, the 1994 version comes across as little more than a vanity piece for the then red hot alec baldwin and his soon to be divorced wife, kim basinger. mcqueen and his then wife allie mcbride also split up soon after their version of the film was made and one can sort of picture the baldwins at their marriage councilor arguing over who's stupid idea it was to make this movie.<br /><br />let's just get it said and out of the way -- alec baldwin never was and never will be anything close to the cooler king, and one of the reasons why this remake annoyed me so much is the perceived arrogance on baldwin's part to presume to challenge our memory of steve mcqueen in the lead role. like someone else points out, peckinpah's 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece meant to sort of parody the action/adventure heist genre. by contrast baldwin, bassinger & company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone, with only michael madsen's and james woods' slimy unprincipled villain characters coming off as real people.<br /><br />the movie is also decidedly mean spirited and unlikeable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words. one viewing was more than enough, not just because it didn't have anything new to offer but because of how artlessly it was made. peckinpah's movie was actually a stylish little entertainment that had an upbeat mood, where this version is a slog that takes too long to amount to little or nothing. there's no artistic urgency to it's existence and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the film difficult to enjoy.<br /><br />so i don't know, this was probably one of the films that helped to initiate the wave of pointless, artistically vapid big budget remakes propped up around a then name brand actor/actress, which in itself isn't a really good thing. i'd always rather see a filmmaker at least try to come up with a new idea for a movie & fall flat with something original. this movie just made me want to pull my eyebrows out, and it's revealing that over the ensuing 15 years since it's release mr. baldwin has become widely renowned as one of the biggest jerks in hollywood. thank god for "team america" for putting him in his place.<br /><br />3/10
