i watched this film last night with anticipation, but really wasn't very impressed.<br /><br />with the exception of 'combo', i thought the acting was poor and the narrative was limited. it came across like a 'made for tv' drama.<br /><br />i felt that the film was very contrived. the whole set up of hammering in the context at the start (yes, we get that this is 80s britain - you can stop now) was tiresome, and gave a very one-sided view of what life was like in 80s britain - poverty, war juxtaposed with royalty, margaret thatcher, yet nothing in between? there were actually middle-classes who existed back then - just ordinary working people, with a decent wage and a mortgage. the falklands clips also seemed to be added randomly towards the end, for 'dramatic effect', i presume.<br /><br />the sequence of events felt a tad disjointed, as the characters moved one one action to the next without us seeing how their mindset could've changed so quickly.<br /><br />the relationship between 'shaun' and 'smell' was toe-curling. i couldn't even look during the snogging scene. i find it very hard to believe that she would've been attracted to a boy who was not only so much younger, but also looked so much younger. i know there were only four years between them, but four years is nothing once you reach your twenties, yet it's a huge difference in your teens! in my experience, that kind of teen age difference only occurs when the girl is the younger one, since girls mature so much quicker, and are more on the wavelength of boys a few years older. sorry, but i didn't buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for shock value.<br /><br />the ending was somewhat abrupt and, again, contrived. if the flag throwing incident was supposed to be iconic, then it fell somewhat short in my eyes.<br /><br />it bugs me that british films only concern themselves with either the upper classes or the poverty-stricken. don't get me wrong, i love trainspotting, and four weddings has its charms, but can't we brits come up with anything different? why are our films always so hung up on the class system? i was born in 1973, so wasn't much different in age to 'shaun' would've been in 1983. i grew up in a single parent family on a fairly down-trodden council estate in a city in england. however, my childhood experiences were vastly different to those portrayed in the film - i don't even remember racism being an issue (although i'm not saying it didn't exist). 'this is england'? not in my experience.<br /><br />the bottom line is that i felt this film lacked substance, and i was completely bored and unimpressed throughout.
