i appreciate the need to hire unknowns for these kind of 'horror' movies, but they should at least hire some proper actors. the sergeant especially is guilty of using his monotone to bulldozer every single line he has. but let's face it, the lines aren't really important. there isn't really a recognisable plot, so most of the writing involves the words f**k, s**t, m*****f****r and other assorted bad language in place of proper dialogue.<br /><br />the 'story' as it is, is mostly made up of seemingly random gore and death, with a couple of cringe-worthy 'surprises', which happen around 10 minutes after you see exactly what's going to happen. not only this, but there are several glaring plot holes and continuity errors (why are they going in there? didn't he have a weapon? wasn't he dead?), so it makes the whole film seem as if it has been cut down by the several hours it would take to fix them.<br /><br />another film which simply relies on blood and gore instead of any real cinematic experience.
