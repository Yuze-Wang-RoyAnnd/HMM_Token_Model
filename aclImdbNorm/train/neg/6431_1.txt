this movie is a horrible distortion of lies and exaggerations that were put together by the most shameless lunatics to ever work on a tv movie. the story is wrong and a complete lie. there is nothing in this movie that accurately portrays senator mccarthy. it's just a horrible scam and it amazes me that anyone associated with this production ever got another job in the industry. the marxist-leninists who wrote this trash did so in order to attack a man who has been vindicated by history and their fear that anyone would dare to destroy communism. unfortunately for these communist nut jobs, ronald reagan took over where mccarthy left off and they couldn't stop him, thus the end of the soviet union and its' cohorts.<br /><br />never, ever watch this film if you're looking for truth regarding sen. mccarthy. read ann coulter's book, "treason" for a better look at the truth about sen. mccarthy.<br /><br />it will also help if you read about what really happened to senator mccarthy by reading http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
