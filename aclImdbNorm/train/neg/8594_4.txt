at one point, violet (lucy liu) tells neil (cillian murphy) that why she constantly seeks out for an adventure. she said "because i'm bore-phobic". it mean that she can't really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities. well, i think her reason and the way this film go is very ironic. because "watching the detectives" is a cheer boredom. <br /><br />have any of these characters actually doing something exciting for once? neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental shop. he and his other geek friends usually hang out around the shop and watching movies together while debating about them afterward. but neil's life is completely turned around when violet walks into his store. she's an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him. anyway, after some dates, they decide to see each other. the problem is violet is a person who keep doing prank jokes on neil and can't really doing something normal, whereas neil is completely opposite to hers. the question is. is they are going to be in love at the end? you bet.<br /><br />"watching the detectives" is a clich'e romantic-comedy to its core. and they made it even worst by pretending to be something else. from the first couple of set-up, we know that neil is pretty laid-back guy who didn't really commit to anything. and then, violet enters the scene, looking all weird and annoying. so at this point, we all know that we're going to sit though all meaningless situations to find out how they're going to end up in the end. is it worth waiting for? i would say no.<br /><br />as i said, they tried to give something more for the audience. "watching the detectives" is trying to talk about commitment. to observe how far people go to reach for something they desire. we knew in the end that insane things that violet has done is all the test how far neil is ready to go to win her heart (or whatever). well, i think it is completely bullshit. this movie will end pretty quick if neil just said to himself "forget about it, that girl is one of a nutjob !" after collaborating with many great directors recently (danny boyle's "sunshine" and "28 days later", ken loach's "the wind that shakes the barley" and neil jordan's "breakfast on pluto" to name a few), it's pretty weird choice for cillian murphy to make a movie with one of broken lizard comedy troop, paul soter. by all means, he's not bad (as usual), but such a talent actor like him shouldn't be wasting his time in the movie like this. on the other hand, lucy liu is dreadfully awful as violet. her acting is a mess. i mean it's all over the place and so over-the-top. tony montana would have been proud.<br /><br />the last but not least mistake that movie made is a completely irrelevant title. you simply can't really connect a dot between the plot and its title; and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all. in short, "watching the detectives" is pleasant if forgettable motion picture that you might have a chance to catch it on cable tv so quick that you couldn't imagine.<br /><br />bloodymonday rating: 1.5/4
