i will start this off by saying i couldn't get all the way through it. i picked it up on a rainy day from walmart like the rest of the reviewers on this site. i figured there wasn't any way i would regret my purchase. was i wrong or what? seriously now, who approved this project? they need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity. that's the only fitting punishment i can think of for releasing something this bad. the shooting reminds me of the movies i used to make for class projects on a big old vhs cam. the acting isnt much better. i think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos. yay, who cares... shecky moskowitz is unfunny, and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser. that's about as much of the plot as i understood.<br /><br />overall it's the worst movie i've ever seen. i own it on dvd and have given it to many co-workers to watch. each comes back and laughs and says "wow i didnt think i'd ever say i shut off an adam sandler movie 15 minutes in...."<br /><br />my response is always "well now you can"<br /><br />
