this must be one of the worst swedish movies ever made. <br /><br />it is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and shown in cinemas as recently as year 2006.<br /><br />i've never seen so many visible sponsored products in one and the same movie. it shouldn't be that obvious. <br /><br />i can't understand why so many known actors even thought the idea to even be visible in a movie like this. if i had any respect for some of the known actors in this movie before i saw the movie, it is gone for sure now. <br /><br />i've heard that there will be a follow up movie to this one and i can't understand how that is even possible.
