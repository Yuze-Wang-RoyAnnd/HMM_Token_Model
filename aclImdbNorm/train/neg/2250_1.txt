rock star john norman howard (kris kristofferson) turns lounge singer esther hoffman (barbra streisand) into an overnight singing star. esther's star rises while john's goes into decline, thanks to drugs and alcohol. after about two hours, john does the self-destructive-red-converible-160-mph-crack-up-on-a-desert-highway thing. the best thing about this movie is the music, especially the song, "evergreen." barbra streisand sings well, but you can't take her seriously as an up-and-coming star, when she is *already* a star. the very first time she appears, singing in a back alley bar, she looks like an established singing star who is slumming for the night, not like a struggling unknown who is trying to launch her singing career. she is too confident, too professional. her apartment looks like a page out of "apartment living," not some hole-in-the-wall apartment where a real struggling singer would live.<br /><br />kris kristofferson handles the self-centered, out-of-control rock star role like...well, like a singer who is trying to be an actor but doesn't have much acting talent. the direction is tepid, the story is slow and dull.<br /><br />but the worst thing about this movie is not the acting, or the lame direction, or the slow story. it's the hair! after staring at kristofferson's and streisand's awful 70's hairdos for 2+ hours, your eyes hurt.
