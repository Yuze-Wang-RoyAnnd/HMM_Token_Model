alone in the dark is one of my favorite role-playing-games of all time. i remember spending whole nights facing the pc screen, trying to escape that mansion and actually being startled at times when monsters came surprisingly charging in. now, mind you - i am weary of "computer-game-generated" movies. i don't remember a single success story in this new hollywood genre, although some are entertaining enough to be watchable. and yet, i am such a big fan of the game that i couldn't resist. my rationale was that if the movie had a plot that so much as resembled the game's, it would be ok. <br /><br />man, those were 90 minutes (which seemed like 300) of my life that i'll never get back. if i had that chance, i would have gladly spent them rearranging my sock drawer instead. this isn't even in the "so bad it's funny" category. you would think even christian slater had a bit more sense than joining this stink bomb. now, tara reid... i'm not complaining about her presence. however, if the purpose of putting this chick in a starring role is to have a sex scene, - which i totally understand and support (hey, i'm a guy!) - i've seen more of her body on press conferences.<br /><br />there is no plot to speak of. won't waste your time pitching it to you. the credibility of the story sinks below 'i did not have sex with ms. lewinski'. the acting is but a few notches above 'street fighter', which, by the way, being one of the worst movies i've seen, i would recommend over this one.<br /><br />kids, i recommend the video game. it has far better story, acting and much more thrills. as for the movie, here's a spoiler - it stinks! wait for the porno version.
