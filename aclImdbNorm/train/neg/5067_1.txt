it is quite simple. friends is a comedy of very basic humour aimed at teenagers and young adults, with unsophisticated sense of humour.<br /><br />it is also painfully obvious that towards the end, they were desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons, most likely so they could say they beat seinfeld's 9 season run. the trouble with this is, seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing, friends had (and i'm being very generous here) at most 5 or 6 ok seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons.<br /><br />it became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that weren't that good so start with, then got worse at the 100th time you saw them. i find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly. it is truly awful.
