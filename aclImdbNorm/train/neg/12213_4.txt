like 'first blood', this attempts to make a point about the treatment of vietnam vets, but there really isn't much time for that in between the monotonous gunfire, burnings, stabbings, torture and explosions as an impossibly indestructible rambo takes out half of asia, a ton of vietnamese soldiers, most of the russian army, various vehicles and anything else he can point a rocket launcher at. the only woman in the middle of all these boys toys is soon bumped off, allowing the testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script to degenerate into a succession of loud noises. helpfully supplying a few hackneyed musical cues is jerry goldsmith, who carefully checks off all the clich'ed themes from russian rat-a-tat to chinese ching-chang-chong just in case we don't quite understand who we're looking at. stallone has a brain in his head; this empty nonsense is beneath him.
