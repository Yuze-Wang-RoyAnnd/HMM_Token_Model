if this guy can make a movie, then i sure as hell can make one too.<br /><br />in fact, if you hire me to make a movie for you, i promise to do the following:<br /><br />1) i will add more naked women. this movie had none. i think cheesy b-class horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body. i wouldn't want to let my viewers down.<br /><br />2) i will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out it's only a dream. i think horrorvision had about 4 of these scenes. and, considering the movie was only like an hour long, the dream-to-movie-length ratio was quite high. and, if i do decide to do a dream sequence, i will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes on. i mean, who sleeps in leather pants??<br /><br />3) i will not rip off any movies like star wars or the matrix because i will know that my budget is small and i will not want to mask my contempt for big-budget hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in mine. <br /><br />4) and finally, i will not mix modern technology with the undead. i mean, a palm pilot can only be so scary ... at least they turned it into an evil rolly-polly monster before the screen blew up or something.<br /><br />so, if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production, count on me: wanna-b-movie director extraordinaire.
