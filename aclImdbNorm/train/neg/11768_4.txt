this reboot is like a processed mcdonald's meal compared to ang lee's very good but very underrated 2003 "the incredible hulk".<br /><br />ang lee's "the hulk" is a comic book movie for the thinking person. the hulk takes some time to appear (about 40 minutes), but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonist's core. he does his best to avoid losing control, but as he admits, when he does give in to his rage, he likes it.<br /><br />now compare this to edward norton's turn, where there is no display of conflict in his personality, and he turns into the hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute (not 183, not 197, but exactly 200). to this reviewer, this felt akin to the introduction of midi-chlorians in the phantom menace, which tell how strong the "force" is with one, as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test. in the 2008 movie, all ed norton's bruce banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200, as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist. and for the record, it is extremely difficult to get one's pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run, especially for a physically fit person.<br /><br />emotions drive eric bana's hulk. he has repressed memories of his mother's death and his father's role in his early life. on the surface he is calm, but there underneath there is significant anger, enough rage to fuel the hulk when it is unleashed. but the hulk never kills intentionally, even his attackers. mostly, he just wants to get away or close to betty ross (jennifer connelly). he incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene, saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collision.<br /><br />in the 2003 movie, the visual effects are there, but as necessary. the action scenes (and there are plenty of them) are necessary to the plot, unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of action.<br /><br />in his quest to turn it into a "fugitive" story, ed norton loses focus on how bruce banner feels about the hulk. to him, the hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment went awry. and louis leterrier, the director picking up on ed norton's cue, fails to add any emotional dimension to the banner-hulk relationship. the story can be summed up as: banner is pursued and hulk kicks butt, banner is pursed and hulk kick butt. repeat as necessary.<br /><br />the only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version. however, even as i am a fan of the comics, i would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboy's dream but has heart over the comics-loyal but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any day.<br /><br />perhaps ang lee should have read more comics. iron man, also released in 2008, is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic-book roots and has heart.
