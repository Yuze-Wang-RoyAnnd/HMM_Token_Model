just okay film about a woman who is a twin having disturbing visions of her sister in danger back at home. she then returns home to find all is not well and that she is going to have to find out what happened to her sister and why.<br /><br />this is the sort of thing that kind of almost works but doesn't quite. i can't really put my finger on why it didn't work but it was good enough that i kind of wished it was better, or at least had gotten the little things right- like having the girls who play the twins in the flashbacks be closer in size. i think perhaps thats whats wrong with it there are lots of little things that just are wrong.
