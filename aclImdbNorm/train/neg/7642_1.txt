everybody just seems to be raving about the subject, and not really noticing how the movie was made. the deaf, mute guy is fine, the underdog wins - that's good, the cricket aspect is great, but the movie is average overall. i think it could be made much much better than it is.<br /><br />the plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a real life event. i'm sure the movie could have been made more interesting. the songs are just stuffed in there, and i had to literally forward the scenes where the same thing would be shown from different angles.<br /><br />good acting, though. watchable.
