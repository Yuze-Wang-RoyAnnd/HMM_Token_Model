i wish more movies were two hours long. on the other hand, i wish more american civil war movies were merely two hours long. "gone with the wind", "gettysburg" - that's about the length i've come to expect; although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted; and even "gettysburg" lasted as long as it did because things happened in the course of it.<br /><br />by contrast ang lee's film is bloated and uneventful. it actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours. that wasn't a compliment. it's really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation: at the time it feels as though it will never end, afterwards it seems to have taken no time at all.<br /><br />the film gets off on the wrong foot, as lee plays his interminable credits over the opening footage (bad mistake) in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe. the central two are jake, the son of german immigrants who are staunch supporters of lincoln, and jack, an equally staunch southerner whose values jake shares. (i had to re-read that sentence to make sure i hadn't written "jack" instead of "jake" at some point or vice versa.) the two go off to become "bushwhackers" - southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they can't even be bothered to join the official southern army, which i presume they think is for sissies. i'm afraid lee lost me right there. it's easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes: if we have some independent reason to like them, or feel as if we know them in some way, then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more. not so here. we aren't properly introduced to jake for at least an hour; when we are, it becomes clear he's a gormless pimple of a man, who isn't a confederate by choice so much as by habit - the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does, whose psychology is purely immitative. the people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way. i found myself cheering whenever the northern cavalry appeared on the screen. i thought: good - kill the rebels, end the damned war, let me go home.<br /><br />aggravating this problem is the horrible, horrible dialogue. everyone speaks in the same whining southern accent. i've heard accents from all over the english-speaking world and this is the worst of them all. i don't care if southerners really did talk like that, it's simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours. and believe me, we do listen to it for the full two hours: lee's picture is a talky one, largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical, say-everything-three-times, folksy drawl. it would help if they talked faster, but not much. can't these people find a more efficient language in which to communicate?<br /><br />in short: the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life, who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech, who don't bathe often enough, to whom nothing of interest happens, despite their being involved in a war. good points? jewel was nice to look at, and so was the scenery. but i have complaints even here. the cinematography, nicely framed, looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake; and as for jewel, we were teased with her body, but never actually allowed to gaze upon it, which i think is the least we were owed.
