another too bad the lowest they can go here is one. otherwise this would get an easy zero. truly one of the worst films i have ever seen. in fact were peckenpah's name not on the thing i would never have guessed he did it. actually one of the people in san francisco i know was on the set a lot and from nearly sunup on he says that sam was just plain snockered. it shows in spades. the laughing bit at the early part of the film is the only thing in this entire mess worth a second look. not even gig young is watchable. this is a true test of masochism. had i been forced into the confines of a theatre to see it i would have jumped up screaming. and now i truly feel guilty having watched it all from the confines of a very comfortable couch that was just too nice to leave. what a mess, it seemed less written than made up as they went along. it's not only a bomb but a bmob spelled backwards. yikes!!!!!
