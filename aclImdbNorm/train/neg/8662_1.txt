what an awful movie. i love monster flicks but i couldn't watch even half of the terrible acting, cardboard characters and abysmal special effects. there is nothing redeeming about this movie. the characters come from either an endless supply of suicidally stupid cannon fodder or else they are vacuous, uninspiring sock puppets. the plot is formulaic, cut and paste, standard science-run-amok drivel. even the cgi is horrible. you know it's bad when you can't even depend on the movie to provide some good eye candy. no surprises here,just same old same old. this is truly one of the worst films ever made. director roger corman should be hung from a lightpost so that children can use him as a pinata.
