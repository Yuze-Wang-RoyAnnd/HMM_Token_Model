arg. the shuffling dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our sanity in this all-awful third film. this time, european terrorists(irish i'd say) hi-jack an army convoy supposed to be transporting uranium. they pull into a shipyard, open the truck and discover our old friends the carnosaurs. pandemonium comes visiting then when the rubber dinos chomp the terrorists, the cops and some marines. the whole film seems to be (again) largely inspired from alien(as carnosaur 2 was) with the pathetic marines going through the "claustrophobic" shipyard? guns at the ready. this third opus is probably the driest and ungoriest film of the lot, with only one spurt of blood when a rubber dino rips a marine's head off. the dinos are stiff, shuffling creatures as usual and the t-rex sounds like an enraged elephant when it roars(it also appears to have no eyes). one of the goofiest scenes of the film is when the coppers arrive on the scene: they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear some weird noise coming from another truck. on opening it, surprise! the rubber reptile gang burst out and devour them. why were the dinos locked up in the second truck after escaping from the first? how did they get locked in as the truck door could only be locked from the outside? what was the point of filming this scene???? oh bother, who cares? both thumbs down for the over-sized rubber iguanas.
