this movie is a mess, but at least it's not pretentious. the box art for the video markets it as a "fun throwback" to 1950s giant bug movies. in reality, it's a transparent bargain basement ripoff of "aliens".<br /><br />the producers clearly wanted to make an "alien" picture, but they mustn't have had much money. in fact, it doesn't look like they had any money, really. i hope everyone got paid who worked on this thing.<br /><br />the basic plot is retained--group of people isolated with murderous insectoid creature--and an earthbound location is inserted for budgetary reasons, i presume. instead of setting the film in space, where no one can hear you scream, they set the film in a hospital, where everyone can see your budget laid bare. the amusing thing about "blue monkey" (and there is only one thing amusing about it) is, the filmmakers didn't abandon the "alien" aesthetics. even though we're in a hospital, we still have an improbably cavernous annex where science fiction experiments are being conducted, in this case the venerable "growth hormone" plot device. the annex also doubles as a boiler room (or something), so we can have an explanation for the monster seeking out the warmth. the boiler room is so large that it is laced with multi-leveled steel catwalks, perfect for allowing slime to drip down between the slats.<br /><br />the idea is that a man working in a greenhouse is attacked by a drooping flower from a rare imported plant that grows in an exotic location. he touches it and says "ow", so we know he's been hurt. the cut on his finger causes him to lapse into unconsciousness in a matter of minutes, and at the hospital he gives birth to a white worm through his mouth (i guess in an "alien" picture this would be called the "mouthburster"?). the worm is isolated, but some naughty little kids (leukemia patients) sneak up on it and "accidentally" give it some experimental growth hormone. you know everyone's in trouble when some fornicating hospital staff workers are attacked by a camera on a crane, and pretty soon a maintenance man finds some obligatory cocoons, right before he's grabbed by a pair of semi-convincing insectoid arms. the rest of the movie is dominated by the semi-offscreen monster, semi-obscured by the semi-darkness.<br /><br />which brings us back to "alien". how, you ask, can a movie set in a hospital incorporate all those flashing strobe lights that are always in the "alien" movies? no problem...a power outage (or something) causes the electrical system to go awry, which apparently causes strobe lights to blossom in every room of the hospital and flicker constantly throughout the movie. this doubles as a convenient cloak for the less-than-special effects (although the bugs are pretty neat looking, they don't move too well, and the baby bug looks charmingly like a cootie toy).<br /><br />ok, so what "alien" bases haven't we covered...oh, water dripping down the walls! check...we'll divide the massive hospital into two parts, then send some of the characters through the damp, drippy basement to get to the other side. problem solved, we now have the opportunity for numerous "foreboding tunnel" shots. and don't forget the fog...well, you never really need an excuse for this in horror movies, do you? ok, maybe inside of a hospital you do, so we'll create smoke by having lots of things spark & burn.<br /><br />i haven't said anything about the negligible acting, not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow. i take it "blue monkey" was supposed to be lighthearted and fun, and if so then it is a nice try, but the pieces don't come together and the movie ends up being a real drag. see a film called "return of the aliens: the deadly spawn" if you want to see a film of this type that gets it right, with even less money and even more marginal acting talent. this one falls flat on its alien.
