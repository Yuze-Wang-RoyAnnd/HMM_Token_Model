... and i actually gave it a zero on my personal 1-10 scale. i have been attending movies since 1952 and have seen well over 1000 in the theater (i don't rate movies that i see only on tv). this is the only movie i have ever rated zero.<br /><br />my wife and i took our four children (then aged 15, 11, 8 and 6) and even the kids thought it was terrible. in fact, it was my daughter (now 26) who alerted me to this site (amazed that the movie was getting an overall rating of 4+).<br /><br />the animation of the dinosaurs looked amateurish at the time (and is even worse in retrospect), the acting (particularly by sean young) is atrocious and the story line is simply silly.<br /><br />
