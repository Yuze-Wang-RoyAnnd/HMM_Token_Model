when you get your hands on a british film you expect some sort of quality. and when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; this film does the business. it's done by highly skilled craftsmen. that alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours. but when you look under the layers of professionalism, you don't really find anything. apart from making you feel good and advocate a drug liberal view, there's really nothing there. the script is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the ending must be one of the worst east of hollywood. in all it's english cosiness, it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another "full monty". why they made this film? i haven't got a clue, apart from making money of course.
