the acting is good, the women are beautiful, and the men are handsome, so if you're looking for well-acted soft porn, this movie is for you. otherwise, you are wasting your time. the motivation of the main characters, in particular the eponymous lead, is often a mystery. she could have just told the truth - the truth as presented in the film, not necessarily the historical truth - and her lover would have been spared time in jail for a rape he did not commit. was she protecting her father, who went off half-cocked, as it were, when he impetuously instigated a malicious lawsuit? was she protecting herself, with her reputation suddenly of concern when heretofore only her art seemed to matter? during the trial, this strong-willed woman turns to mush before our eyes. conversely, her lover, who starts off as a narcissistic jerk, becomes a selfless hero during the trial. at least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices himself for love. naturally, since no good deed must go unpunished, we are told that she never sees him again.
