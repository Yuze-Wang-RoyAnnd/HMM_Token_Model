i've seen a lot of crap in my day, but goodness, hot rod takes the cake. i saw a free screening in ny the other night. i can only hope they show the funny version to the paying customers. the big laughs were sparse, the plot was uninteresting, and the characters were one dimensional at best. one highlight is a hilarious dancing scene with adam samberg. it was priceless and was the only scene i truly had a hearty laugh at. other than that, i can only recollect randomness and dead air. snl & samberg fans may be disappointed. i know i was expecting more from it. but it short, i definitely would not recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this film.
