howling ii (1985) was a complete 180 from the first film. whilst the first film was campy and creepy. the second one was sleazy and cheesy. the production values on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious. the brother of the anchorwoman werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his sis'. the "scene" from the first film was badly re-created. a skinny plain looking woman accompanies bro' (reb brown) to the old country (romania) to uncover the mystery to her sister's murder/transformation/death. christopher lee appears and disappears over now and then as sort of a sage/guide to the two. sybil danning and her two biggest assets appear as stirba, the head werewolf of the romania. she also suffers from a bad case of morning face, ewww!<br /><br />bad movie. there's nothing good about this stinker. i'm surprise philippe mora directed this picture because he's usually a good film-maker. the film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it (no, not the content but the film stock itself). to round the movie off you get a lousy "punk" performance from a damned wannabe "babel". maybe if they forked over a couple of extra bucks they could've got the real deal instead of an imitation.<br /><br />best to avoid unless you're desperate or you lost the remote and you're too lazy to change the channel.
