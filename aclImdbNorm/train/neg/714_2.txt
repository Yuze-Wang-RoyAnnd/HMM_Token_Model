this is a movie of tired, yet weirdly childish, clich'es. there's a nazi witch master performing sf-related experiments in the basement? oh please! <br /><br />aiming for a creeping sense of horror and fear, the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright. not having any expectations beforehand, i am left with: an aged xander from buffy and a heroine with ape-like face who doesn't seem to know how to act. said adrienne barbeau have i only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable "cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death".<br /><br />camera and editing adds to the general impression of lame.
