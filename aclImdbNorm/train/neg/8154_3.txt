the long list of "big" names in this flick (including the ubiquitous john mills) didn't bowl me over to the extent that i couldn't judge the film on its actual merits. it is full of stereotypes, caricatures, and standard, set scenes, from the humble air-ace hero to the loud-mouthed yank flyer. the music track was such that at one point, about an hour before the end, i thought the film was over: loud, rising crescendo, grand flourish and finish then silence, but then the movie continued! i found no real storyline, haphazard writing, but smartly-pressed uniforms and the pretty jean simmons (pre-nose job) with a rousing little ditty. i cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great. i found it maudlin, mawkish and minor.
