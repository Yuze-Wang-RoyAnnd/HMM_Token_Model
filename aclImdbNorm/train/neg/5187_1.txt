i'm not going to approach and critique the theories of raw. i mean, this is a site about movies and whether the movie delivers or is well-made, and not a site debating philosophy.<br /><br />having said that, this video really blows. it's one talking-head shot of raw after another. some of it is archival video, so you can see how he has aged over the years, and that's pretty cool. but, otherwise, the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous.<br /><br />it's a strange comparison, but i kept thinking of the sunday afternoon when i watched some of the barbra streisand star vehicle *funny lady* (another really bad movie). after a while, i was so od'd on barbra, i kept wishing there would be one scene that she wouldn't appear in: you know, a "meanwhile, other characters in the movie were up to something else..." moment. but it was all about barbra. well this video is raw's *funny lady*. <br /><br />so, if your idea of a good time is to look at multiple takes and angles of the face of raw while he prattles on with his theories, assembled in a lame structure that doesn't add any interest or insight, then be my guest. for me, i couldn't take it after 20 minutes.
