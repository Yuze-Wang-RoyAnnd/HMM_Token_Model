i have recently watched this movie twice, and i can't seem to understand why the h*ll the makers made this pile of crap. i mean, yes, it gives a great impression of hitler's environment, and i mean the way they reproduced austria in the late 1890's, wwi and the inter-war period. what i can't understand is why they pictured hitler as a 100% pure evil, mad, unreliable, mentally unstable freak. he was after all a very thoughtful, loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides, no doubt about that. but why in heaven's name portray him in this way? all of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario, leaving nothing but a very propaganda-like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever. yes, he threw germany into the devastating 2nd world war. yes, he was racist, and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war. all true. but again; why the hell did they plain lie to the public? to warn us?<br /><br />i absolutely don't think this movie was a warning. the true danger of hitler and the nazi's was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness. the fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every german alive (not to mention austrians and a lot of other people) makes it a warning to modern civilization, not the fact hitler was such a 'weirdo'. if it would have been like the makers make us believe - i would have been convinced that the german people were retarded. a man like the one in this movie would have never gotten anywhere near party leader - not to mention reichskanzler. <br /><br />4/10
