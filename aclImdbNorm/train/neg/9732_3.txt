first off, the lead, brad dourif is a kook. if you're trying to take this movie seriously, then, i guarantee he's going to ruin it for you. if you don't take him too seriously, then he's actually kind of fun to watch. as with another reviewer, i loved the scene where lisa (cynthia bain) and dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car. another great campy scene was watching john landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room. in fact, i found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laugh-riot - i'm just not sure if tobe hooper meant it to be that way.
