why bother seeing this movie, if you have great movies to see. it is a total waste of time and money. the movie is so bad that i felt bad for wanting to watching it. everything in it is bad. actors were bad. script was really bad. the story is stupid. and the worst cgi ever. the only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club. one interesting thing that, there is a characther that we wish that he dies because, he is so stupid that we get enough of him.(i don't remember the name but was the boyfriend of the "chosen one".)<br /><br />note:if you want to see a good movie, this movie isn't the right choice. 0-stars out of 10
