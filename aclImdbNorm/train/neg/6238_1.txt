oh man, it is amazing how somebody can claim global warming to be a science, well, i guess this elitist nonsense is now replacing the science of eugenics! al gore tries to make this issue sound complicated, even though it just needs common sense to see this whole thing is a big hoax by a man with his own moneymaking agenda!<br /><br />how have scientists estimated historical temperatures of this planet? by estimating the sun spot activity. has nobody ever questioned if this method has been accurate? no, not even gore himself! so how the heck would it not be accurate to forecast future temperature with sun spot activity if it has been that accurate in the past? according to sun spot activity the temperature today is totally in line with what it should be. how come the temperature in the entire universe has risen (relatively) equal much as on earth? does our suvs cause temperature on jupiter to rise?<br /><br />use some common sense! you do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this can be nothing else than a hoax. please research it yourself. what does al gore and his elitist friends like rothschild (banking family that arranged live earth event) to gain from this? well, the new world bank will be founded on carbon credits, that is tax on everything that gives co2 omissions, and it is easier to get away with these taxes if the people are lured to think it is to save the world when it is only about money, centralized control and more power to the elitist bankers. al gore has even a company that sells carbon credits! is it not noble to pay voluntarily carbon credits to save the world, especially if it goes into his own company? <br /><br />i do not want you to blindly believe me, please do your own research and use your own common sense and i am sure you will come to the right conclusion!
