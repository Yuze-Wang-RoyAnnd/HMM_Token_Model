i am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in material for film can be made into a ho-hum event . wm c quantrill was barely shown in the film , probably the most intriquing figure of the period. frank james was never mentioned, cole younger , ditto , and bloody bill anderson , who would weep for his murdered sister every time he went into battle was completely absent in the script. instead we were forced to watch fictitious characters that never developed into anyone we cared about. how sad. the costumes were wonderful however, as was the location shooting in missouri. i hope ang lee will make another film from the period and try again, or some other film maker will look into the tremendous wealth of material to write a screen play on .
