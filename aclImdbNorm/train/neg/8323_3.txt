from the beginning this movie did have a few flaws. the main character played by hayden christensen is a the rich young mogul who has inherited his father's considerable wealth and power, and he is struggling to both fill his father's shoes and cut the apron strings mother (and co-executive) keeps too tight. he also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in the limbo that is the organ donor registry. there are also minor back stories which your first instinct is to mostly ignore that become important later, such as his friendship with his surgeon (terrence howard) and his romance with a middle class girl (jessica alba). uncreative story lines, but not bad enough to ruin the movie. the only real "oy vey!" moment was the name of lena olin's character. overbearing woman named lilith...subtle!<br /><br />the surgical scenes are not at all censored. i appreciated that, people who find surgery scenes scary might not. the horror of being awake during anesthesia was done well at first. you watch in emotional agony as christensen screams inwardly through the chest incision and the rib spreader. the moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia, he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him.<br /><br />the big twist, however, is very predictable and sends the film delving into the conspiracy and his memories of the little signs which were there but he, like us, initially missed. <br /><br />there are two more twists at the end involving his relationship with his mother. one is an impressive gesture by olin, which comes of as unimpressive due to poor writing. the other is a secret about the family's past which seemed very tacked on and pointless.<br /><br />the initially well done anesthesia awareness drama gets lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama. there is a one final attempt to bring it back which falls flat, taking the entire movie with it.
