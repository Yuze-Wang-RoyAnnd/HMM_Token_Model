ok, anyone who could honestly say that this movie was great or even good is either delusional or knows the director, writer and producers and is trying to boost the buzz on this film. i watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was horrible. i'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie bored me to tears. the reason i'm being so harsh is because this film was clearly a different take on "of mice and men" and they should sue because it is such a horrible rip-off of the story. in an industry where hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt...for someone to take a classic book and film "of mice and men" and destroy it with a new spin bugs me so much. the actors, the accents, the dialog and the direction were amateurish and the writing was dismal. i mean if your going to take a new spin on an existing story make sure its just as good or better than the original to make the new spin justified. did not like this movie at all.
