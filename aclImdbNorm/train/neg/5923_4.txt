during the civil war, there were many cases of divided loyalties; obviously, many occurred "in the border states", where north met south by happenstance of geography. from the border, young father owen moore goes off to join the union army. shortly, confederate soldier henry b. walthall, separated from his regimen, wanders onto the enemy's property, desperate for water; he finds a supply where the unionist's young daughter gladys egan sits. when the yankee soldiers track him down, little gladys innocently helps the confederate hide. later, when he returns to kill her father, the little girl's kindness is remembered. a sweet, small story from director d.w. griffith. location footage and humanity are lovingly displayed. <br /><br />**** in the border states (6/13/10) d.w. griffith ~ henry b. walthall, owen moore, gladys egan
