what in god's name happened here? how does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of redneck zombies? was zombie '90 ever supposed to entertain someone ...anyone, or even make a dollars profit? but mainly, what happened here? <br /><br />zombie '90 extreme pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of andreas schnaas, who specializes in earth-shattering gore films, such as goblet of gore, and anthropophagus 2000, and some of which contain profanity in the titles. in the gore department, this one isn't much different than the rest. although, the level of ineptness ...well, earth-shattering.<br /><br />zombie '90 extreme pestilence is as bad as peter jackson's dead-alive is gory, think about it.<br /><br />getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time. an accident, involving chemicals causes the dead to come back, and eat the living. never has the concept been treated in such a manner. the gore effects are a whole, new low. just a z-grade nightmare. i can't tell whether, or not this was originally meant to be funny, somehow, i doubt the english dubbing was being very true to the original script, but stranger things have happened. the whole thing just reminds me of a shot-on-video introduction to a troma movie, except it lasts a hell of a lot longer.<br /><br />i've seen only one film that was worse than this, the chooper.<br /><br />for proof that andreas schnaas is an actual director, i would highly recommend nikos the impaler if you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie, give extreme pestilence a try, but you've been warned. it takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through. but if gore is all you're here for, then you might be able to stomach this one. other than that, no atmosphere, no, and i mean no budget, no entertainment value, but mostly, no pride. show some pride, schnaas. 1/10 <br /><br />updated 7/5/09: after a few more viewings of zombie '90, i've had a change of heart, or i guess i just get it now. zombie '90 is hilarious, so nevermind the harsh words, although, extreme pestilence still only deserves one star.
