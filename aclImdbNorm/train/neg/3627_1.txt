i'm never much for classic films. movies like patton, going my way, how green was my valley, the godfather, casablanca, annie hall, gone with the wind, lawrence of arabia, and citizen kane bore me. however, i would much rather watch any one of those films 3,469 times while being tied up on a chair than watch an american in paris once in the most luxurious suite ever. if i did the latter, i'd probably be sleeping the entire time.<br /><br />the color art direction and the music didn't interest me, gershwin or non-gershwin. the dancing and the singing could help an insomniac fall to sleep. the dialogue doesn't match up to singin' in the rain. basically, this movie is boring. the only other film that i fell asleep while watching was butch cassidy and the sundance kid. but you can't blame me. i only slept 5 minutes the night before.<br /><br />1 star/10 (too bad we can't give zeroes.)
