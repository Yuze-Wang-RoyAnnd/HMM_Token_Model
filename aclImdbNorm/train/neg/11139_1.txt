there isn't much to say about this film, it is horrible.<br /><br />the acting and dialog are way far away from even decent, the story of the hybrid werewolf's is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there.<br /><br />cgi is something you wouldn't like to see. it so amateurish that it makes me vomit.<br /><br />the only good thing on the dvd was in the extras. the gag reel. everything else, just waste of time and money. i hope noone will buy this, this is not even worth renting.<br /><br />just stay away of this.
