the movie has only one flaw, unfortunately this flaw damages all credibility of the piece.<br /><br />it starts with the condemnation of the israeli occupation of disputed territories. it fails to address the reason israelis are there. egypt, syria, iraq and jordan attacked israel. this is why israel "occupys" their land, because those countries lost it in a war they started.<br /><br />the film also claims that israel has defied the u n by not complying with resolution 242. problem is, 242 was rejected immediately upon it's inception by.....the palestinians, making it void.<br /><br />many films are put together well, and can really show footage that changes minds, but remember, when watching anything, believe none of what you hear, and only half of what you see.<br /><br />all participants in this film are known critics of israel, and some have made many antisemitic public comments, removing any possible credibility to their words.<br /><br />all participants are in dire need of a actual history lesson taught objectively, not by some palestinian sympathizer.
