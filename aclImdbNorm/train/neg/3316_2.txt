this was the first ewan mcgregor movie i ever saw outside of star wars. since then i have become a very big ewan mcgregor fan but i still can't bring myself to forgive this movie's existence.<br /><br />my sister has always been a huge jane austen fan and because of that, i have been subjected to various of the classics, emma being one of them. i've always considered them irritating, stupid and boring. however, after watching this terrible rendition, i was forced to admit that the original emma was delightful and charming. ewan mcgregor scarcely serves a purpose in this film after they hacked and mutilated the part of frank churchill. gweneth paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupid.<br /><br />my recommendation to anybody who is remotely interested in english period drama... go see the originals. if you're a ewan mcgregor fan... believe me, by skipping this film, you haven't missed anything but five minutes collective of him in a silly hat and a bad haircut.
