i've seen all four of the movies in this series. each one strays further and further from the books. this is the worst one yet. my problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! the directors and producers should have named it any thing other than "love's abiding joy." the only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (willie, missie, henry, clark, scottie and cookie). the names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. the entire story line is no where in the book.<br /><br />i find it a great disservice to janette oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. the music is too loud. the actors are not convincing - they lack emotions.<br /><br />if you want a good family movie, this might do. it is clean. don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. i hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but i doubt it. if there are more movies made, i wish michael landon, jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. the books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!
