utterly predictable silly show about a man who has killed his wife by mowing her down when driving and claimed he had blacked out. why was he still driving a car? why did he still feel able to drive a car having killed his wife with one? this question has not occurred to the writers. the story then witters on about a psychologist and her failing marriage which is tied into the failing marriage of wife-killing blackout driver. an omniscient mother and one dimensional child are thrown in for good measure, and the whole builds up to a predictable denouement and crashing finale. are police psychologists so easily taken in? deadful writing that the actors do their best with, but they are doomed to failure. this is on a par with a harlequin romance. don't waste your time watching this one unless that's what you are aiming for.
