ok we all love the daisy dukes, but what is up with this cast. lets start, jessica simpson as daisy, there is not one thing country about this girl and daisy was not ditzy! uncle jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original. no offense to burt, but i never noticed boss hog being so tall. that was part of the humor of boss hog was his size. did they even try someone like danny devito?!? ok , now get this they cast jessica simpson did anyone take a look at her husband? he matches luke duke to a tee!!!!!! cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members. the screen t's were never present on the dukes!! this made the movie a turn off from the beginning. i give this a huge thumbs down.
