this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. however, the little slave girl, alice and jared harris imitating christopher walken is what makes this movie entertaining. alice's smoking, drinking and uncanny way of showing up when her name is called is strange and interesting. i have to applaud jared for his christopher walken imitation, and christopher walken for allowing this to be in the movie.
