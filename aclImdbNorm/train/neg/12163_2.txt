absolutely putrid slasher film has not one redeeming quality. it has camp councellor angela(pamela anderson..awful as the killer;her quips when she wastes people aren't even amusing)on the warpath slaying teenagers who act the least bit naughty or resist her pleadings for good behavior. we run the gamut of boring, clich'ed killings such as the slashing to the throat to one kid looking for his freddy clawed glove, a kid who gets a chainsaw, one girl who gets drilled, one who gets shoved into the crapper(filled with leeches), one who is roasted, etc.<br /><br />it doesn't have one original idea to offer and is merely a waste of time. that is unless you want to see valerie hartmen's(who plays the slut ally)tits. most of the violence occurs off-screen so even that will not satisfy.
