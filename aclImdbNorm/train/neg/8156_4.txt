prom night 2 is an ok horror movie but prom night is way better and this movies about how the prom queen mary lou in 1957 gets killed by her boyfriend and comes back 30 years later for revenge.the best actor in this movie is micheal ironside and the movie stars other ok actors and actress like justin louis (i),wendy lyon,lisa schrage and richard monette(i).and there are some good gore scenes like when mary lou kills the girl that is trying to hide in her locker by crushing the lockers together and how one of the students are on the computer and mary lou electrocutes him to death.over all this is an ok/good horror movie and my rating is 4 out of 10.
