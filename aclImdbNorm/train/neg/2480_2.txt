the opening scene of this film sets the pace for the entirety of its ninety minutes. the shots are generic, conventional, and of television movie quality. the snow drenched scenery is gorgeous, yet the characters held with in it have a similar quality to that of looking at a photograph of such scenery, the overwhelming feeling being that of distance. some of the editing is fairly high quality and the work of an veteran professional, the dialogue however is clunky and artificial, having little bearing on 'real' conversations at all seemingly. any emotional insight is displaced in favour of swearing, which is of course the way in which everyone shows their true feelings. the action is slow and underwhelming, the overall feeling being one of someone trickling cold water over your head, but so slowly that you barely notice, yet eventually you feel pathetic and slightly sorry for yourself for being caught in such a incomprehensible situation.<br /><br />the mixture of genres that the fessenden has seemingly tried to use; psychological thriller, horror and family drama, although commendable suffers from a serious lack of tension and interesting dialogue. the way in which the husband, wife and child trio interact is particularly unrealistic. the themes of family relationships being played out in haunting setting have been covered countless times before by far superior films, an instant example being that of the shining (1980). the family unit here are torn by innocuous troubles which are hard to understand or sympathise with considering the relative ambiguity of the script.<br /><br />the family unit is hardly stalked throughout the film, fessenden playing down the thriller possibilities of the narrative in favour of a slow family drama for the majority of the running time. the 'stalker' figure otis has few apparent motives for his behaviour and despite being perhaps the most interesting and well acted character is still very underdeveloped. the main characters are empty husks of people who it was extremely hard to relate to, their relationships with each other being particularly void of any sentiment or feeling. although the ignorance of the erik per sullivan's young character by his parents is presumably part of the story, surely any reasonable person would question their son if he allegedly spoke to someone who seemingly doesn't exist? people can accept this film as intelligent because of its relative lack of conventional aspects regarding creature based horror movies but this film fails in respect of whichever genre you wished to pigeonhole it in. you can read deep psychological meanings into every single minute detail of anything if you should so wish to but i think people would be better off over analysing their carpet for some deep emotional meaning, rather than these vacuous sub-human creations.
