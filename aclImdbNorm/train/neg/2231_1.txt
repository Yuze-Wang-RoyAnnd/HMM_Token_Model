all i can say after watching snitch'd is please stop mr. cahill. it is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about. if you insist on making movies about gangsters i urge you to do research. it's comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they speak.<br /><br />i laughed at the part when mr. cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion. this movie was tough as an after school special. who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular gangbanger was from?. i suspect real gangbangers do not wear hats claiming there gang. that would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related. <br /><br />snitch'd is the worst gangbanger movie ever made.
