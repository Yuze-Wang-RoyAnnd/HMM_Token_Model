the easiest way to describe this movie is as a satire. the target of the satire is quite vast, from the us government to corporate america. it is also not a stinging satire, but rather a silly one.<br /><br />think of this movie as a mix between the kentucky fried movie, airplane and police squad series, done with a much smaller budget and not as funny. i can see how this movie is a satire of many sci-fi disaster movies from the 50's and 60's. i see this movie as a big influence on tim burton's mars attacks.<br /><br />the plot is simple enough. genetically engineered giant tomatoes go "crazy" and start attacking people and cities. at first there is a cover up and then it blows over into full blown war.<br /><br />the movie runs the gamut of characters and characterizations : lois "fairchild" (a lois lane clone), a very ambitious presidential press secretary, clark kent, mason dixon (fia agent who hasn't worked since the bay of pigs), a useless president (who only seems to be able to sign his name and attack new york), an even inept congress, a sleazy marketing ceo, and mason's team consisting of an obese east german "female" swimmer, a scuba diver, a crazed wwii paratrooper and an african-american disguise expert (disguised as george washington, abraham lincoln, hitler and finally as a tomato). did i also forget to mention, lots and lots of tomatoes? there are all kinds of tomatoes from small tomatoes, to giant plastic tomatoes, to smashed tomatoes, to tomato juice and finally to people dressed up as tomatoes.<br /><br />on top of all this, you have a couple of musical numbers as well. they aren't that good and seem to be dubbed. the best tune is by far the theme of the movie ("attack of the killer tomatoes"). it is way too catchy and you might end up humming or singing it in public. be warned.<br /><br />most of the movie is quite amusing and shows the absurdity of various real life situations as well as various entertainment genres. i don't believe i was induced to laughter, but mostly smiled and scratched my head. i definitely recommend this movie for fans of b and c grade movies, but only as a rental.<br /><br />-celluloid rehab
