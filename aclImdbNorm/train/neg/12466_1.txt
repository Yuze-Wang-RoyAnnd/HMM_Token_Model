i couldn't wait to receive the dvd after hearing so much about the film. what a disappointment! this became one of the most confusing films i've ever viewed. there were so many characters introduced, some resembling others, that it became impossible to follow the story line. i could not understand how george clooney received an acting award for the film since he was hardly involved, at least in the first half of the movie. my wife and i gave up after about an hour of misery and stopped the dvd. i might have considered fast forwarding to see if the ending was any better but after so much confusion decided that chances for improvement were slim. a co-worker told me that a lot of the movie "comes together" in the last minute or less. i was glad i didn't waste another hour, waiting. i gave the dvd away the following day.
