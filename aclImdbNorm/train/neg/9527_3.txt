i've been trying to track down this film just by googling bad phrases about "teenagers seduce and kill man in his house" and such. i think i first saw parts of this film when i was about 10 years old when it was running on cable. it made quite an impression! it's the kind of film that kids know they shouldn't be watching, and switch the channel when their parents come in. when i saw who the cast was, i couldn't believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie. then again, if you like to see men who cheat on their wives get murdered, then this is an interesting film. also, if i recall, there's some pretty interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. probably the dumbest ending of all time, but still...memorable.
