right up until the end the bad guys have the upper-hand - always - which kind of put into question the competence of the good guys. a couple of innocent-man-accused-of-a-crime plots are irritating. some unnecessary dialogue in which various dull legal issues get debated. this is just a mediocre dumb old western, so what's this nonsense about trying to keep things "realistic"? cagney's atypical presence in a western is one of the few - if not the only - entertaining thing about the movie. somewhere around the middle there is a ridiculously-timed marriage proposal; sort of like "where is the kid hiding??!! where is he?!... oh, and by the way, will you marry me?"
