...which isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. overall, "dinocroc" was a much better movie. sure, in that movie matt borlenghi played a complete wuss-bag who spent the entire movie crying about his little brother getting eaten by the dinocroc. but the special effects in "dinocroc" were better, the plot lines were better, and the acting was better. here are the problems with "blood surf" -- 1) the killer crocodile looks like a kid's model with a retractable jaw. 2) the plot is ridiculous. matt borlenghi & co. get shipwrecked on a deserted island, in which they encounter a rabid group of ugly filipino natives who try to force themselves upon the women in the group. which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film. and 3) there's not enough croc time. there are a couple of redeeming qualities of "blood surf" -- the actresses are pretty attractive and matt borlenghi gets eaten by the croc towards the end of the movie. but if you're on your deathbed and only have enough time to watch one matt borlenghi/killer crocodile movie, skip this one and fire up "dinocroc" instead.
