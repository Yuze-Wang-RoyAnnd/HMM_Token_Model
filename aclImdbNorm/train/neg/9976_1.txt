the first scene in 'problem child' has a baby peeing into a nun's face. for this movie, that's witty. a nasty, mean-spirited 'comedy', it's inept on so many levels it beggars belief. john ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from hell, and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one-note, annoying performances and puerile humour. and what the hell's jack warden doing in this mess? slackly directed by dennis dugan and obnoxious in its attempts to turn on the sentimentality when it's done with the crudity, the movie is made so badly it's quite a bizarre experience. but never mind all that. the lowlight of the whole thing is michael oliver, the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever to hit the screen
