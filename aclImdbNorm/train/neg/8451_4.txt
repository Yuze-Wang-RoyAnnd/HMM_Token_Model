i have to admit that i liked the first half of sleepers. it looked good, the acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. a superior hollywood film. but...no one mentioned this so far (at least in the latest 20 comments), when it came to the courtroom scenes and brat pitt's character followed his plan to rescue his two friends, who are rightly accused of murder, i felt cheated. this movie insulted my intelligence. <br /><br />warning spoilers!!<br /><br />why did anyone accept their false alibi, witnessed by the priest? if these two guys had been with him, why shouldn't they tell this during the investigation? amnesia? if you were the judge or member of the jury, would you believe it? is it wise to give the motif of the murderers away?<br /><br />i am sorry, but in the end, the story is very weak, and this angers me. this movie had great potential. 4/10
