in the comic, modesty is strong. alexandra staden who plays modesty blaise looks more like an anorectic fashion model. she does not either have the moral or personality that modesty have in the comics. modesty would never give a woman an advice to show more skin to earn more money. i cannot see any similarities with my comic books with modesty and this movie. its like a mission impossible movie would be about ethan hunt locked in the detention room in high school talking with the janitor about when he went to junior high school and hunt would have been played by dj qualls (in road trip). soo if you are an modesty fan do not see the movie you will just get angry. if do not know much about the modesty comics rent an other movie do not wast your time with this one.i cannot understand how quentin tarantino can put his name on it. i will ask for a refund at my dvd rent store tomorrow.
