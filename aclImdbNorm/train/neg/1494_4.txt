yes, definitely better than my viewing of death tunnel. actually some of the deaths were pretty original and the gore was decent. it was kind of like wrong turn meets the hills have eyes.<br /><br />but: 1.) when the "kids" (high school or college?) are discussing horror movies in the kitchen, everything shae says is almost an exact quote from scream (1996). the thing about the big-breasted girls etc.<br /><br />2.) was steve not a bootleg randy from scream? 3.) besides the fact that it took place in october, what the hell did the movie have to do with samhain? pretty unnecessary if you ask me. i find it humorous when i see those horror movies from the 80's that explain away loose ends by pointing the fingers at the druids or a pentagram.<br /><br />4.) wow they made a sam raimi reference!!! 5.) why was gary and his sister in the movie? they're characters had nothing to do with anything. and hes so psychic that he couldn't even see his own death? 6.) when gary was being killed in the bathroom (at that point, the deaths became simply troma-licious) how could she hear the screams when she was downstairs but not hear them when she was standing outside the door? 7.) gary's sister commented on haggis- thats primarily a scottish dish, not irish.<br /><br />8.) so the lesson is if you are like shae and don't have any fun or crack a smile through the whole film, you'll be the one to live? 9.) the mutants were pretty cool, but they looked like walking dishes of chili con carne.<br /><br />10.) when they brought in gary's sister, did they forget that steve had been strapped there and wonder where he went? 11.) was there not more than one killer? shae beat that one, but never encountered any more of them.<br /><br />12.) what was with the flashbacks to those other people? half of them shae didn't know if they were dead or alive, so what was with that? 13.) why didn't they kill gary and his sister before? 14.) why did no one ever call the police? and apparently everybody knew those people lived in the woods, why did they never organize some kind of raid? 15.)as far as i know, they were not zombies or vampires- so how could she "turn into" one at the end? i'm with everyone else on the giant "huh?" at the end.<br /><br />way better than death tunnel, but still quite sloppy. i still don't understand why they even placed it in ireland, considering samhain had close to nothing to do with the plot.
