this movie is horrendous. decent fight scenes or not, the acting is really bad, like you can tell they're reading their lines from a card. with painful line delivery by everyone in the cast. think watching a high school play and cringing at the obvious lack of smoothness in the actor's interactions (weird pauses between different character's lines, combined with hurried line delivery by others). if the movie were all action, this might be forgivable, but a lot of the movie includes plot set-up and family guy style, irreverent cut aways (oh, wow, are they badly done). i'm assuming they were attempting to be funny with these, but it again came off as a bunch of high-schoolers/ college entry students goofing off for the afternoon trying to set up a funny youtube clip. <br /><br />now to the fight scenes. they're not too bad, considering the level of quality seen everywhere else in the film. nothing great either, certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters have stated (nothing like drunken master). the fights have an overly staged feel, with lots of cuts to different angles with blatantly different positions by those involved. <br /><br />in sum, the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the guy's friends involved with this very, very cheap production. which guy you may ask? oh, the same guy who wrote, directed, produced and stared in this middle school masterpiece.
