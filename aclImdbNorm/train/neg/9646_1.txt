the lack of content in this movie amazed me the most. first i though that people was going to compare this to rock on! but i'm really surprised myself to say that this was worst than rock on! so-so story horrible cast ajay devgan jamming with salman khan and asin you gotta be kidding me. the music was okay khanabadosh was the track of the movie the rest was bad! vipul shah hasn't still learn from singh is king's critically bashed comedy. now asin.. where do she come from sorry for asin's fan out there but she suck*d big time in this movie seriously bad acting she didn't look good at all overdose of make-up! my final verdict go watch aladin with your family instead wasting your time here.
