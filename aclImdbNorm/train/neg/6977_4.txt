i've read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this film. i can't say that i found much to recommend it. the leonard cohen sound track is not only excessively heavy-handed but dreary beyond measure. the film looks authentic enough, but something's got to happen for it to work, and nothing much does: a cursory plot (not a real problem for me), not much character development, nothing thematically. it just slogs along. flawed as it is, cimino's "heaven's gate" has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film i'd sooner watch again. for a brilliant reconception of the west, hbo's "deadwood" is much superior to "mccabe."
