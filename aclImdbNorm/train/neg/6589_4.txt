i'm afraid that i didn't like this movie very much. apart from a few saving graces, it's nothing to write home about. <br /><br />j-horror has boomed for the last five-six years but the films themselves have on more than one account been repetitive and carbon copies of a previous success. this is one of them.<br /><br />basically this is a supernatural slasher movie. the beginning is promising with chilling scenes from a morgue where a dead girl has her eyes graphically sewn together, but soon after opens them. however, after that, it's quickly downhill for this flick.<br /><br />to be kind i will start with the things i like about "gawi". on the plus side, the visuals are gaudy and the movie looks great for it's type. for those who like their horror movies gory there are a few nicely executed (no pun intended) murder scenes. we also get a few good suspense sequences/set-pieces.<br /><br />however, there are quite a few drawbacks also...<br /><br />first of all, and my major complaint about this movie, is that the plot skips and jumps forwards and backwards in time with an alarming intensity. usually that's not a problem for me, but here, where the students look exactly the same no matter what age they are, i was confused on more than one occasion.<br /><br />the performances are okay i guess (a little hard to tell when you don't know the language), but seem a little stiff. and for a horror movie, i don't think it was scary enough. for a while i was quite bored actually.<br /><br />being a fan of giallo movies, i was expecting quite a lot from "nightmare", but unfortunately i was quite disappointed.
