i thought it was not the best re-cap episode i've every seen (though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the brendan fraser moment...*sigh*). it was nice to see cox outside of the incessantly brittle "coxism state" he is in these days, if only for brief moments. i also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character's hair (or height, in case of jd) and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes. i can also see how zach might be well on the way to a very chevy chase/or is that matthew perry? prat-fall induced chemical slide (already acknowledged on conan). a little side note, the song (now stuck in my head) from the janitor-induced dance montage was "diner" by martin sexton.
