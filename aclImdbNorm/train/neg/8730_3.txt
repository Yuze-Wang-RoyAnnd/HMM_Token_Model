the thing that stands out in my mind in this film (sadly) is the introduction, where john berlin (andy garcia) is driving into town. you see his mercedes pass on a winding road through a forest that looks like its loaded with redwood trees. it's quite beautiful. <br /><br />as to andy garcia playing a character with the last name of berlin, well...andy is just too hispanic/latin for it to be passable. maybe a caucasian father married his spanish mother for this story? who knows. but i can tell you that when you put him in a town of farm folks and hicks, he stands out like a sore thumb, especially with his accent that flares up when he gets angry. yeah, i know, big deal right? he's still a good actor.<br /><br />the title concerns a serial killer who nicknames his victims jennifer. all of the victims are blind and he dismembers them. the killer has taken a hiatus but suddenly resurfaces when a blind witness (don't ask) appears, helena robertson (uma thurman). thurman does a good job of playing a blind person, to my surprise. when i saw lance henriksen playing sgt. freddy ross i got worried. henriksen's played in some pretty strange films, especially of late. i still can't forget him in the bloodbath movie, pumpkinhead. <br /><br />berlin movies into a small town from l.a. as a detective. he begins investigating the jennifer murders after finding body parts in the local landfill. his brilliance in discovering one of the victims was blind seemed far-fetched. so did the irony of *spoiler* freddy's murder, with the recording and name similarities. i got very confused as to the logic of how there came to be eight "jennifers". and the motive of the killer as simply deranged didn't pack much of a punch. in retrospect, this film is probably more true to life in showing an unsuspecting individual as capable of murder simply because they became a little wacko over time or maybe were born looney toons.<br /><br />john malkovich does a stupendous job in his interrogation of garcia! albeit no cop would legally be allowed to press someone that hard and egg them on without rightfully get knocked out. as to the ending, it is a bit of a surprise, but is highly arguable, much like sgt. ross' murder. the killer chooses to walk after his running victim, opting instead to frolick i guess.<br /><br />and there are so many opportunities he has in killing her that it's ridiculous. i won't ruin the very end because despite it's shakiness, it's a good surprise. afterward though, you'll probably say, as i did, "boy was she lucky!" 4/10
