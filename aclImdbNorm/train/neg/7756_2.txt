i remember watching attack when it first came out and caught it again recently. the sci fi channel has run worse, but not by much. a shameless ripoff of jurassic park, attack substitutes sabertooth cats for dinosaurs. and they are on the loose, devouring as many extras as possible. the cgi is pretty bad, and closeups of prosthetic cat heads are laughable. we get some gore, which helps a little. wait until you see how the mad scientist who started this whole mess gets it. other than robert carradine, who has very little to do, the cast is unknown. apparently this was shot in fiji. nice work if you can get it. reminds me of all those low-budget monster stvs that were popular in the 80s and 90s.
