mercifully, there's no video of this wannabe western that a stay-afloat vehicle for big frank at a time when his career was floundering. the story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to rally his townfolks with a new found courage must have been written by a back-room writer. all in all, this show stinks. the story is basically boring, ill-conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. i must depart complete from the other reviewer who found it "...underrated..." the critics slammed it at the time and deservedly so. you'll have to catch it on the last show, if you up late and having a bout of insomnia. but, if you can sit through it, you've more fortitude than most of my movie buff friends.
