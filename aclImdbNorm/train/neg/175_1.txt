i watched cabin by the lake this afternoon on usa. considering this movie was made for tv is was interesting enough to watch the sequel. so, i tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed. i knew i wouldn't like the movie, but i was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of dv (digital video). the movie would have been tolerable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. i expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (warning: the following maybe a spoiler!!!!) the open ending in cabin by the lake was acceptable, but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous. i can only foresee return of return to the cabin by the lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing, but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.
