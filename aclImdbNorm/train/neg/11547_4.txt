what kind of sh*t is this? power rangers vs freddy? it was watchable and as good as the first film in the beginning but from the part where the protagonists get super powers in theirs dreams, it started to become childish. this sh*t should have been rated pg or pg-13 rather than r. i expected to see some very mature stuff but it was only for the 1/3 of the film. the rest are for little kids. plus it's focused too much on christianity. i know freddy's a demon but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons. why does it always have to be christianity? this is total orientalism and filled with white men/westerner's superiority. don't' watch this, show it to little kids who loves power rangers.
