animal farm (1954) was a very good read about the dangers of totalitarianism. how good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who are ignorant or rule with an iron fist and an empty head. sadly this movie does not portray either of these. what we're shown is a propaganda piece with a lot of finger waving and pointing. the animation and the direction were good considering the budget and the time period but the very essence of george orwell's novel is sorely missing.<br /><br />if you're one of those who want to see how not to adapt a novel or are just interested in seeing an adaptation of this brilliant novelette then by all means watch. i just found this one to be somewhat mediocre. just one man's opinion however.<br /><br />the remake is a notch below but not by much.
