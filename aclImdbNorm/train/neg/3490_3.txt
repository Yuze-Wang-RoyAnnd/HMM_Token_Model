having enjoyed jean arthur in "the devil and miss jones", my interest was peaked, so i tried sitting through this second-string screwball outing about an investigation into the death of a jockey--but i didn't make it to the end. arthur, photographed in a gauzy, movie-magazine fashion, either wants alimony from ex-husband william powell or another shot at marriage, but i never felt for her because the character is just a string of wisecracks (she's the type of heroine prone to comical curiousness, but once inside a morgue--like all women in these '30's comedies--she faints). william powell reportedly had a high time working with miss arthur, but you'd never know it from the end result; they look awkward standing next to each other, hesitant over their banter. the actor playing powell's valet is excruciating, and the pauses for viewer laughs are pregnant with unease.
