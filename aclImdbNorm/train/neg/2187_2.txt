i bought this film on dvd so i could get an episode of mystery science theater 3000. thankfully, mike, crow, and tom servo are watchable, because the film itself is not. although there is a plot, a story one can follow, and a few actors that can act, there isn't anything else. the movie was so boring, i have firmly confirmed that i will never watch it again without tom, crow and mike. as summarized above, however, it was better than the film featured in the mst3k episode that preceded it; mitchell.
