expecting a combination of scifi and period film about ada lovelace, charles babbage, the history of computers, etc, i was disappointed by this movies nonsensical pseudoscience and mixture of real and fabulous history. it gives the impression that its writer (lynn hershman-leeson) has no real understanding of the math, technology, or history constituting the film's subject, but is working instead from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them. this hits a sore spot with me, as i've long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to glom onto and awfully misuse science terms and ideas to the point of confusion, eg: emmy coer: "information waves have a half-life", ada: "i'm not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all".<br /><br />this movie does worse than fail to entertain - it misinforms. the only redeeming value i can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it so badly distorts. it's more likely, i think, to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement as indistinguishable from magic.
