lets first start this review with the fact that i signed up just to write the review and warn people to save their money!!<br /><br />this was one of the worst pieces of trash i have seen since the hulk. the storyline was the most predictable garbage you could possibly come up with. if you are expecting 24 but on the big screen, flush that expectation down the toilet immediately along with the money you would use for a ticket.. you may get more enjoyment that way. the acting was terrible, the plot was completely unrealistic, (along with the so called "twist" in the end. i must say this.. the ending did surprise me. i am not referring to the plot twist that surprised me, but instead the effortless manner that they put together what could be considered the only scene of somewhat decent action in the entire movie. they rushed the ending so quickly that i didn't even realize that it was over until i saw the credits rolling and at that point i considered burning the reel of film if i could just figure out how to get into that screening room.<br /><br />casting was awful for a few reasons. first of all, they must have accidentally switched the character assignments, because michael douglas played the roll that clearly keifer sutherland should have been playing. while douglas was sneaking around agents, tapping phone lines, hacking into systems and taking out people who are chasing after him, sutherland plays the less capable agent who is always in a bad mood even when things aren't going that badly for him. he plays a very bland agent, nothing like his jack bauer type roll us 24 fans love.<br /><br />i can just about promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas. it can be best compared to a remake of the "the fugitive" / "in the line of fire" but written by people with mental disabilities
