"cut" is a film about some film students making a film. it's very much in the "scream" mold, an ironic, self-referential horror flick which, for me at least, falls down because for all its irony, it's still just a bad horror film, same as the films its referring to.<br /><br />but it was not without its charms. well, one charm anyway. molly ringwald was fantastic as the spoilt, bitchy american actress hating every minute of working with the amateur australian film crew. she was so convincing that its tempting to believe it wasn't an act, although everyone involved with "cut" says she was lovely to work with. :-)<br /><br />seriously, every scene of her pouting, sulking or snapping was great. everyone else, however, wavered between being ok and being terribly wooden.<br /><br />anyway, "cut" has some laughs, a few buckets of gore (some of it surprisingly gruesome), and ultimately is.. just another bad horror film.
