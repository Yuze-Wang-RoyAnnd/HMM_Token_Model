...but this just isn't working and i am surprised to see how many people consider it good. on what grounds? there are some loose hints here and there, but the whole material is self-indulgent and unconvincing. lynch's movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet, are very playful when doing that. there is some visual sense, there are some subplots, characters, ideas etc. but this is dull and yes, pointless. because whatever there is to explore is either to "small", either too far-fetched, or simply told before in a superior manner. it's just lynch exploring dv, nothing more so it should be treated like this. 1/10
