well, i had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this puddle of ooze. why? because i have to let it be known to all of you just how bad this movie is. it's unbelievably bad. just to let you in on how bad it is, i'll offer this little detail about the movie. during scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game. yes, you heard me right. this movie really sucks. in fact, it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days. and to see corn filled crap like this? there is no story to speak of and the movie basically has nothing to offer other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kills. i'm really disappointed with this, knowing that i watched it. ok, i'm dumbstruck. it's so bad i can't even find the words. rating: zero out of *****.
