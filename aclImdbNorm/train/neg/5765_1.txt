scary movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to begin with. the last film was a mediocre effort. put it next to this load, it's a comedy classic. whilst part two was filled with a lot of dated humor and cheap shots, at least it was funny. there's nothing funny about forced humor. jokes, pratfalls and sight gags are supposed to be naturally funny. hitting the viewer over the head with tired jokes is not cool. the humor in this film was caters to juvenile imbeciles who'll laugh at anything. when they catered to the junior high school crowd, any sense of self respect was tossed out the window. ring parodies are not funny. i have watched them in comedies since 1998. they're so dated. michael jackson jokes are not cool either. what's even worse is making fun of two broken down has been "performers" whose best days were never.<br /><br />the death of american cinema has been a slow one. films like this are the nails that are being pounded into it's coffin. whatever happened to real humor? i haven't laughed out loud in a movie theater in a long time. too many bad movies rot the brain. you want proof? go to your local mega chain video rental store and see what's on the shelves. this movie is bad. don't believe the hype. i would rather watch scary movie 2 in a continuous loop than to suffer through this poor excuse of a comedy ever again!<br /><br />definitely not recommended (unless you have a handful of brain cells).
