i have read all of the love come softly books. knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book,but generally they at least have the main point of the book. i was highly disappointed in this movie. the only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that missy's father comes to visit,(although in the book both parents come). that is all. the story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes, sad, from the book, that i just couldn't enjoy it. even if i didn't read the book it was too sad. i do know that pioneer life was rough,but the whole movie was a downer. the rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.
