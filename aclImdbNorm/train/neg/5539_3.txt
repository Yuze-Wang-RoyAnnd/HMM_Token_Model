wimpy stuffed shirt armand louque (blandly played by veteran character actor dean jagger in a rare lead role) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies. armand falls for the lovely claire duval (fetching blonde dorothy stone), who uses the meek sap to get armand's colleague clifford grayson (the hopelessly wooden robert noland) to marry her. furious over being used and spurned by claire, armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge. sound exciting? well, it sure ain't. for starters, victor halperin's static (non)direction lets the meandering and uneventful talk-ridden story plod along at an excruciatingly slow pace. worse yet, halperin crucially fails to bring any tension, atmosphere and momentum to the hideously tedious proceedings. the mostly blah acting from a largely insipid cast doesn't help matters any; only george cleveland as the hearty general duval and e. alyn warren as the irascible dr. trevissant manage to enliven things a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionics. the drippy stock film library score, the painfully obvious stagebound sets, and the crude cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive as well. in fact, this feeble excuse for a fright feature is so crummy that not even the uncredited starkly staring eyes of the great bela lugosi can alleviate the brain-numbing boredom. a dismally dull dud.
