the wonderful "z" channel in los angeles showed this pia zadora film about six months or so after "butterfly". i had such high hopes for the actress, and then she goes from bad to obviously worse in this film.<br /><br />again, it was the 80's and i gotta tell you harold robbin's work had been eclipsed by smarter writers. jacqueline susann ripped into him (she hated his way of writing women), irwin shaw's work caught on with many women, and of course sidney sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70's early 80's and then came jackie collins who made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books, even more so. which is why this work smelt. harold robbin's work in the 80's just didn't catch on with audiences. pia zadora acting in one of robbin's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire. the supporting cast was not a help either.<br /><br />oooooh... this was awful to look at then and even 20 more years later, it looks even worse. i had a hope for pia as an actress and it all got shot to heck when this was done. it would be tough for pia to redeem herself as an actress (although john waters casting her in "hairspray" was a spark) although she has a nice singing voice.<br /><br />hey, pia, wherever you are...hairspray may go on tour! join the show. you may be the biggest comeback story yet.<br /><br />i just hope they burn this film for ya if you do.
