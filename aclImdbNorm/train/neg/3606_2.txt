this film is the worst film, but it ranks very high for me. it is how a slasher movie should be. it takes place at a university in which there only seems to be a handful of students. the teachers are dumber than a sack of hammers. it is filled with good catholic priest, sexually repressed humor. bad hair, bad clothes. the dialogue is so cliched it is hard to believe that i was able to predict lines in quotes. the slashings have some creativity and seem to revolve around stabbing people in the genitalia. a lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve to die because they are so bad, i recommend this film for a fun time. get a case of cheap beer and some friends, watch it and laugh.
