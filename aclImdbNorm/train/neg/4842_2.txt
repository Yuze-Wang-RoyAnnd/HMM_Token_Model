who did the research for this film? it's set in baghdad in 2004, however all the soldiers are wearing acus and have all universal camouflage pattern gear. no one was wearing that stuff in 04. <br /><br />i just saw this film while deployed overseas and i can say that the overwhelming feeling from the audience was wtf? this movie made no sense, had characters come and go with no explanation, and people doing ridiculous things that would never happen in real life. i realize that it's a movie, but it's obviously trying to portray something realistic. it fails miserably, but it's trying. <br /><br />it's like someone came up with a bunch of random ideas, chewed them up and swallowed, then vomited out a film. i would not recommend this film to anyone. i'm still not sure why i sat through the whole thing. gi joe was one that really made you think compared to this. stay away!
