film version of sandra bernhard's one-woman off-broadway show is gaspingly pretentious. sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars, but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting, and fitfully funny. her fans will say she's scathingly honest, and that may be true. but she's also shrill, with an unapologetic, in-your-face bravado that isn't well-suited to a film in this genre. she doesn't want to make nice--and she's certainly not out to make friends--and that's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way. but even if you meet her halfway, her material here is seriously lacking. filmmaker nicolas roeg served as executive producer and, though not directed by him, the film does have his chilly, detached signature style all over it. bernhard co-wrote the show with director john boskovich; their oddest touch was in having all of sandra's in-house audiences looking completely bored--a feeling many real viewers will most likely share. *1/2 from ****
