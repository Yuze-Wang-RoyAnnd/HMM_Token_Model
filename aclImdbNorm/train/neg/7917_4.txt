"cement" is a bad movie about a bad cop (penn) with a bad attitude and a bad disposition who has a bad guy in a bad way up to his cajones in fast drying concrete. while we're waiting for the cement to dry and the film to figure out what it's about, we're periodically jerked back in time without rhyme or reason so we can watch events leading up to the cement thing. a boring junk flick overall, "cement" suffers from lack of a story, a clumsy execution, and that most ubiquitous of filmdom's faults; no reason to care. a time killer for the needy couch potato at best.
