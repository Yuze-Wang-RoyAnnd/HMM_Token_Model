i have been waiting for this movie a long time. especially because juhi chawla is in this, she's a great actress.<br /><br />this movie contains six stories. it's a new concept flew over from hollywood. so it's not a new item.<br /><br />1. khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. she wants to get famous and makes up a boyfriend to let news reporters be interested in her. but then rahul (salman khan) appears and he claims to be her boyfriend.<br /><br />priyanka chopra is still not a good actress. when she yells, i get annoyed. salman khan cannot play comic roles. but in his serious parts he is marvelous.<br /><br />2. vinay (anil kapoor) is married to seema (juhi chawla). he gets in a midlife crisis and gets attracted to a much younger woman, with forgetting what he really has in life; his wife and kids.<br /><br />anil kapoor en juhi are natural born actors / actresses. they are great. but this story is to thin for them.<br /><br />3. shiven (akshaye khanna) is going to get married to gia (ayesha takia), but he gets cold feet and blows the wedding off.<br /><br />4. ashutosh (joh abraham) is married to tehzeeb (vidya balan). she gets an accident and suffers a memory loss. now she doesn't know that she loves her husband anymore.<br /><br />5. raju (govinda) is a cab driver. he meets stephani (shannon esrechowitz) who is a white woman who is in love with an indian male but he is about to get married with an indian woman. raju has to bring staphani to that man, but falls in love with her.<br /><br />i never liked govinda's movies. he is very annoying, not funny. but in this movie i liked him very much, like he has been growing up the last years.<br /><br />6. oh yes! there is sohail khan! he plays ram dayal who is just married to phoolwati (isha koppikar). he want to get some serious action with her, but every time her family comes in between.<br /><br />sohail khan is not a handsome actor, but he is funny! i like his movies.<br /><br />now here's the problem. all these stories aren't interesting. to make one story from six not interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting! here and there the stories touch each other, but is not significant for the characters.<br /><br />my conclusion; priyanka cannot act! loose that woman in the bollywood industry. sohail khan should make more movies, this role for him was too small. salman khan cannot act comic roles, but real serious movies. that's written on his life as an actor. this movie sucks, and is a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like anil kapoor, juhi chawla, akshaya khanna and john abraham.<br /><br />it's just like you have the ability to make a movie with amitabh bachchan, and you only let him sing a lullaby.
