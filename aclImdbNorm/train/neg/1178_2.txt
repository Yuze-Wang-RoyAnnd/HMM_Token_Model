completely ridiculous "period" film is only a thin excuse for its extensive, graphic depiction of the heroine's affair with "the beast", a monster who supposedly appears every century to rape some women. that's pretty much what he does, and the film's depiction of the beast is really really awful; it's basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge pvc tube for a hard-on that squirts copious amounts of white liquid. for fans of fake animal porn, i guess maybe this is a real turn-on. i was amused, however, by the opening shots of horses having sex in a public square.
