my favorite memory of this show and the band was when i got together with a bunch of my friends which are nbb haters and had a big bonfire and we took a cd of their songs and the dvd of the movie and a bunch of pictures of the band members and threw them into the fire and danced a happy jig around the burning stuff while singing "ding dong the witch is dead". that was the best thing about the show and this show is stupid with a capitol god this show sucks. i hate it so much. get rid of the crappy car. you guys really suck! you really ruined the whole channel! no offence or anything but you guys need to get a life, i mean, really, who makes a stupid show with a stupid lead singer that can't even sing! you guys really sound horrible and need to get a life as hobos or something, except roselina. she's really pretty. but still, you guys reak!
