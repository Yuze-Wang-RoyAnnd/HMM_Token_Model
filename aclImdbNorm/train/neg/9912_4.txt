i agree totally with another of the reviewers here who was pleased "for the birds" won the oscar in 2002 for "best animated short," not this sick material, which is pretentious at best and appealing to anyone, of course, who has no belief in heaven or hell.<br /><br />the animation was good, but so are a lot of animated shorts. and, by the way, i love dark humor but this just was unappealing from the start.<br /><br />as for the story here: a guy walking around and surrounded by nothing but grey (symbolism here) is told by a tv set (which appears every few hundred yards away) that he is in either heaven, hell, or purgatory. each time he puts a gun to his head and shoots himself after hearing the news. i guess that would be funny in two of the three instances.
