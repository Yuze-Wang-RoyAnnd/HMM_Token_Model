i've been a fan of all things bill maher for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting. of course, i am catholic, come from a well-educated family and go to church of my own volition, which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of bill's opinions.<br /><br />bill's problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative. he's correct to document the sociological aspects of it i.e. one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion (or, more accurately, by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of god), but that said he never looks at its positive side. quite frankly, i think that hell would freeze over before bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of calcutta where mother theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor. she's dead now of course, but he could easily visit the jesuit priest in east la who runs homeboy industries, which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills, get their tattoos removed, and to become responsible members of society, or he could visit usc's institute for advanced catholic studies, which has brought together some of the world's finest theologians, diplomats, and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the world's poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the world's people who live on less than $1 a day. of course he won't do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion, and it's so much easier to continue to make snide, superficial jokes.<br /><br />that fits into the other large problem with bill's movie, which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is. in this movie, you have maher the cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational christian truck stop service, in a night club with a dutch guy who smokes pot all the time, with the minister of a storefront church in miami who claims to be the reincarnation of christ, and with an actor playing jesus at a "holy land" theme park.<br /><br />what you won't see in bill's film, beyond some superficial speculation alongside a ph.d in grand central station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses, is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like notre dame, byu, or wheaton college, who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter. you won't see any serious discussion of any of the writings of c.s. lewis, g.k. chesterton, or any papal encyclicals, and of course you also won't find any discussion whatsoever of any of the non-abrahamic (judaism, christianity, and islam) faiths whatsoever. all you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending, snobby elitist from the west side of la who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gut-level understanding whatsoever of how the other half of america that elected george w. bush (twice) lives their lives or about the school of thought behind it.<br /><br />i get a lot of what bill's saying, but for someone possessing his intellect and influence, this film was nothing less than pathetic. anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the teletubbies.
