i'm a big fan of b5, having caught on only at the end of season three. i faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was syndicated, concluding that it was one of the most well-thought out story arcs to ever hit television. even the filler episodes were interesting. the movies, also, were well produced and as entertaining as anything to hit the theaters.<br /><br />which brings us to 'river of souls'. naturally, after seeing everything else, i had high expectations. martin sheen appears to be acting in an ed wood movie rather than a serious sci-fi story. the story itself, might have looked good in outline form, even made it to the story board. however, it suffers obviously when it came time to filling this notion out into a two hour movie. there are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story. there are places where they were obviously short of time and just improvised the dialog to fill the story out. had this made the regular season, it would have rated among the worst of the episodes.
