this is only the second time i've felt compelled enough to comment at imdb about a film. the first time was for probably the best movie i've ever seen and that was for memento.<br /><br />seeing darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to memento, as in the worst film i've had the misfortune to see. apart from the two scenes containing naked women there is nothing in this movie to raise it from the trash-pile that it is.<br /><br />let's see, apalling effects, cliched script, bad acting and about 90 minutes too long. my wife and i laughed through most of it in disbelief at how bad. amazingly i watched it to the end, how i did that i don't know! avoid!!!
