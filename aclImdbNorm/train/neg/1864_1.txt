i may not be a critic, but here is what i think of this movie. well just watched the movie on cinemax and first of all i just have to say how much i hate the storyline i mean come on what does a snowman scare besides little kids, secondly it is pretty gory but i bet since the movie is so low budget they probably used ketchup so my critical vote is bomb!!! nice try and the sequel will suck twice as much.
