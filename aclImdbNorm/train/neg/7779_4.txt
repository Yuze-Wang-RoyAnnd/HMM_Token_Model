"true" story of a late monster that appears when an american industrial plant begins polluting the waters. amusing, though not really good, monster film has lots of people trying to get the monster and find out whats going on but not in a completely involving way. give it points for giving us a giant monster that they clearly built to scale for some scenes but take some away in that it looks like a non threatening puppy. an amusing exploitation film thats enjoyably silly in the right frame of mind. (my one complaint is that the print used on the elvira release is so poor that it looks like a well worn video tape copy that was past its prime 20 years ago.)
