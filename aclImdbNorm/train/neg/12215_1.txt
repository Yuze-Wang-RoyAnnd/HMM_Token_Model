in what i can say was a theft of my time i was taken to see this movie and i must say what a horrible experience. fay ann lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie. larryjoe76 is obviously a shill reviewer. the plot is thin to say the least, the cantonese dialog is not funny. see this movie at your peril.<br /><br />david tang from shanghai tang should be after the movie for the little or no revenue this movie will generate. the banal plot attempts to compete with other rom-coms out there, and just blends into the scenery. it was like watching paint dry. <br /><br />in short this movie was a total waste of time and space. i've seen better movies on youtube.
