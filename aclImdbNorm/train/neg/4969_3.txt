first off, this is no where near as bad as some of the other trash the sci-fi channel has produced; that isn't to say that grendel is a good film, in fact, it is very bad, but it definitely had potential to be a lot better. the flaws of the film come from character design, character, absurd additions to the story, the visual effects, the music, and for the most part: the acting.<br /><br />when speaking of character design, i, of course, mean the way our heroes and villains look. beowulf and the other danes seem like ridiculous vikings, rather than warriors of brute strength -- that helmet our main protagonist wears is just too silly. grendel looks like the hulk but with strange tentacle-attachments to his elbows.<br /><br />the characters are very limited. beowulf is same from beginning to end, however finn -- a useless sidekick -- achieved some two-dimensionality, due thanks to his romantic subplot, and unferth gets some notion as well, as he becomes less conceited.<br /><br />much like finn, there are useless additions to this story to make it its own, while still holding to the source material. the crossbow that is gifted to beowulf is so ridiculous, i'm surprised the cast didn't walk off the set. besides additions, there's omissions, such as the underlying themes of christianity and paganism, as well as the consequences of lying.<br /><br />the special effects are mighty terrible. grendel and his mother hag are poorly conceived, and as such, they're portrayal on screen is less than believable.<br /><br />the music is overbearing, especially when a character dies.<br /><br />all in all, this is not sci-fi's worst film to date. no. it is actually one of the better films, though trash it still it is, it is good trash, making it a guilty pleasure at best. the only thing that works is the dialogue, which is still wooden here and there.<br /><br />i highly recommend you skip this film and watch robert zemeckis' take on the ancient story of beowulf, simply because this film (grendel) is only half the tale, and not the whole thing, which garners this movie a three-star review.
