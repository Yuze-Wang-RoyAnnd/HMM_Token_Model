five across the eyes ain't worth one off the wrist, i must admit at one point i was really worried, for about 30 seconds nobody made a noise and i thought my speakers had blown or that i had gone deaf with the constant screaming and high pitch yelling, me and the speakers are ok now thanks for asking, funnily enough that was the best bit of the film.<br /><br />i won't waste your time telling you the plot, read the other comments for that.<br /><br />if you have bought this dvd but not yet unwrapped it don't, take it back and demand your money back, i've wasted mine don't do the same.<br /><br />i was actually shouting at the telly " they're over here in the car, look for the camera lights, and get the camera man first ", i have left the swear words out but you can guess where they go.<br /><br />if anybody would like to buy this film (it's really good) it's yours for a ten quid.
