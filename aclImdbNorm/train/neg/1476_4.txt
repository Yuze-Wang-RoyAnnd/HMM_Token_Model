this rather formulaic swords and flying fists movie is a decent early display of john woo's talents. the cinematography is excellent and some of the sword work is truly remarkable. unfortunately the film labours under the burden of a dull story and a glaringly low budget (check some of the setbound fight scenes if you doubt me). nonetheless, it's worth seeing, especially if you can catch in letterboxed.
