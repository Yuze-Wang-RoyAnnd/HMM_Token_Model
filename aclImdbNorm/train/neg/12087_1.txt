i've seen all kinds of "hamlet"s. <br /><br />kenneth branagh's was most ambitious, mel gibson's was quick and to the point, laurence olivier's was the best - hands down. but now we come to maximilian schell's take on the bard.<br /><br />for one, this is a dubbed version of a german tv production of william shakespeare's venerable chestnut. but if there's a slower, more plodding, more lethargic and worse-staged version out there somewhere, it must have been acted at grade school-level. <br /><br />having seen it on mst3k helps, with mike and the robots taking jolly good jabs at the old boy, puncturing the profundity of black and white tv, shakespeare and the wisdom (?) of germans acting out an english play and making it look like an ingmar bergman reject.<br /><br />of course, the best parts are the mst riffs. best lines? "i'm gonna unleash the great dane", "i don't think so, 'breather'", "meet the beatles", "hey, dad, will you help me with my science project" and, my personal favorite, during a party - "garrison keillor's leaving germany (yaaay!!)".<br /><br />but then there's schell, playing shakespeare's greatest character much like a department store mannequin would, only not as expressive. no doubt he's a great actor, but here he comes off about as well as paul newman in "the silver chalice". ever see that one? you gotta watch these two on a double-bill!<br /><br />in the end, this is one instance where it's true that you're much better off to just read the book. at least the book isn't dubbed by ricardo montalban.<br /><br />one star only for this "hamlet"; ten stars, naturally, for the mst3k version.<br /><br />good-night, not-so-sweet prince.
