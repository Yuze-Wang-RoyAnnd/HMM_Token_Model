the horror channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn gothic flicks each night from 10pm till about 4 in the morning, but their 'scare' factor is very limited, if one exists at all. in fact i am sure i will find a multi-million pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offer.<br /><br />the bloodsucker leads the dance deserves special mention because it is i feel, the undisputed low of a channel full of lows. i cannot even begin to tell you how bad this film is, but for the purpose of completing the minimum 10 lines demanded by this site, i will at least give it a go.<br /><br />firstly the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen. in fact the film might as well have been called 'toothbrush' or 'wallpaper' for all it has to do with the plot. at least they used toothbrushes...at least they had wallpaper.<br /><br />there are no bloodsuckers for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances, not one. i'm sure they were making two different films by mistake here.<br /><br />a more suitable title would have been, 'horny italian count leads five people to a scary castle and bores us silly for ninety minutes.' yes that fits better.<br /><br />the acting is terrible and and the dubbing appalling, and that guy who plays seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his character....abysmal.<br /><br />the only saving graces of this film are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene, two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes, and the added attraction in that every single female character gets her kit off. bonus.<br /><br />otherwise steer a wide birth away from this one. no vampires, no dancing, no scenes of a brutal or gruesome nature and no way on gods earth i will ever, ever, ever watch this one again.<br /><br />no word of a lie, this film could put you off motion pictures for life.
