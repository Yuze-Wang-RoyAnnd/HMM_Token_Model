i do agree that though this story by melville just might be unfilmable, this isn't even a credible try. to move the story into the 20th century just outrages the original story's intent and nature; possibly you might have been able to move it over to england, but it must be a period piece. even our story narrator--the proprietor--tells it in a flashback, going back even further, somewhere around 1800. towards the end of the 19th century, a strangely disobedient worker would be discarded without a thought. and the 20th century? come on! give me an expletive deleted break!!! even around 1800, such behavior didn't work very well, in view of the ending. and the movie's ending? i don't know what it was, because i didn't watch the entire travesty--i had to stop. this was like setting "streetcar named desire" in elizabethan england.
