the entire thing is very beautiful to look at..the european location shooting was a good idea. the lead actors are attractive. the score is servicable.<br /><br />but then they spoke! and the non-plot developed! and it was all downhill from there. pacino is sleepwalking and keller keeps talking about how bored she is..hello, dear, you're not alone. when he does a mae west imitation, you might have to hide your face, its that painful to watch.<br /><br />i can't imagine how either actor or director sydney pollack got involved with this, or a better question, why it ended up stinking so bad?<br /><br />since death is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, maybe you're supposed to have low enjoyment here. maybe its supposed to feel as empty and cold as death. but i still can't recommend it.
