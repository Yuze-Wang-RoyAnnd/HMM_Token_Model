i guess this movie is a fitting tribute to the first superman film,as it is just as crummy and painfully long as the original.<br /><br />after an opening scene consisting solely of murky intergalactic visuals, the credits pay homage to the even-crummy-looking-for-their-time futuristic sweeping credits of the original superman film.<br /><br />then there is some more murky stuff. ma kent sees some kind of murky ruckus on the farm, and spends a good portion of my life slowly walking up to some debris in the cornfield. then superman sneaks up on her and faints.<br /><br />next we catch up with lex luthor in a scene about many murky close-ups of an old lady as she dies. we don't see luthor's face until the end of the scene, an early instance of the film's drive to leave no hackneyed stone unturned. lex luthor is a guy who doesn't like superman because he is not human. also, he probably doesn't like humans either, as the movie occasionally features some kind of plot about lex luthor planning to kill most of earth's population.<br /><br />after a while, clark kent shows up back at his old job (i forgot to mention, he had been away on a five year trip where nothing happened). then he finds out lois lane has an illegitimate kid and is dating cyclops. it upsets him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame.<br /><br />at this point we see that miss lane is on some kind of jet attached to some kind of space shuttle. it is some kind of important event on account of it is on television. then we learn that there are people in a control room monitoring this event. there are also people watching it on television and there are pilots in the cockpit. the film then reminds us that these people are involved by cutting between them for most of the summer.<br /><br />as the events leading up to the inevitable disaster started to build, i excused myself to get a soda. i accidentally walked back into the wrong theater and watched that movie about al gore showing slides in its entirety. i tried to find my way back to superman returns, but i somehow wandered into prairie home companion, which i watched twice in a row. then it was time to stop messing around.<br /><br />i walked back into the first theater, found my seat, and looked up to see that the impending lois lane space shuttle disaster was almost upon us. still, it seemed to be taking forever, so i wandered around the theater, met a girl, got married, raised a son and sent him off to college. while attending my son's medical school graduation, i remembered that i should probably check in on superman returns, so i excused myself and raced back to the theater only to learn there was no need to hurry. it still took about another half hour before things went wrong for space shuttle lane. when they did, superman saved everybody, which was pretty cool.<br /><br />. and then there is a a subplot where superman turns really creepy and starts stalking lois lane and her family with his x-ray vision and super-hearing. then he tries to get her to cheat on cyclops, who seems like a good guy.<br /><br />meanwhile, lex luthor is involved in some kind of contest to display every possible generic villain behavior before the end of the movie. i forgot to bring my scorecard home with me (they give you one at the door), but i think he scored damn close to one hundred percent. i hope he wins the million dollars.<br /><br />at this point, things start to gear up for the big murky finale. i think maybe the projector was broken, on account of the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here. i remember seeing murky things growing out of the water, superman getting sick, superman getting better, back to the murky things, he's sick again, no wait, he's okay again.<br /><br />then lex luthor unleashed his final bad guy move: yelling at his girlfriend a little bit.<br /><br />then superman died and came back to life. i thought the movie was over, so i left.<br /><br />ninety years later, the nursing home where i lived felt a little chilly. i realized i left my sweatshirt back in the theater, and i went to retrieve it. when i did, i was slightly surprised to find that superman returns wasn't over yet. i tried to ask some of the viewers what i missed, but most of them were only skeletons with long gray beards by now.<br /><br />i sat back in my old seat and watched as lois lane puttered around her house for a while. then superman showed up and started quoting the beginning of the movie, and since i already saw that part i thought it was okay to leave.<br /><br />so that is my review of superman returns.<br /><br />oh, also, if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about one dog eating another dog, you will love this movie. on account of there are two jokes like that in it.
