can any movie become more naive than this? you cant believe a piece of this script. and its ssooooo predictable that you can tell the plot and the ending from the first 10 minutes. the leading actress seems like she wants to be barbie (but she doesn't make it, the doll has more acting skills).<br /><br />the easiness that the character passes and remains in a a music school makes the phantom of the opera novel seem like a historical biography. i wont even comment on the shallowness of the characters but the one good thing of the film is madsen's performance which manages to bring life to a melo-like one-dimensional character.<br /><br />the movie is so cheesy that it sticks to your teeth. i can think some 13 year old britney-obsessed girls shouting "o, do give us a break! if we want fairy tales there is always the brothers grimm book hidden somewhere in the attic". i gave it 2 instead of one only for virginia madsen.
