***spoiler alert***<br /><br />i love tim roth, i really do, and he does his best with an unbelievable role. i can see how this is a movie that might look good as a script, but it's convoluted, unlikely and ultimately silly. i saw the fake death ending coming a mile away. rene z. tries hard with an underwritten part, and so does patricia arquette. the detective whose name i can't remember (the one that's not chris penn) is a big sweaty over actor. see it if you're not smart enough to differentiate between a movie being so clever you can't follow it, and so confusing you can't understand it. see it if you like cheesy camera work that makes you seasick. see it if you love to watch tim roth work with an unwieldy script. see it if it comes on late at night for free. otherwise, rent the usual suspects.
