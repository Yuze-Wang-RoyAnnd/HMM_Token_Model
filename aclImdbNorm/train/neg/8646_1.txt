this is the worst movie i have ever seen. i was going to get up and leave at tape 4 but i stuck it out. i now consider myself a masochist! afghanistan? come on guys! who's the idiot who forgot to hide the sanskrit billboards? i thought the lead actor(george calil) was particularly inept. apart from the bad acting and over zealous camera shake, i thought using the events of 9/11 as a reason to make "larson the lunatic implodes, all over a screen near you" disgraceful and irreverent to the victims of 9/11. using a phone call from larson's wife, sarah, supposedly from one of the terrorist held planes on that day, was appalling. the camera shake didn't make me feel sick, that cold hearted stunt did.
