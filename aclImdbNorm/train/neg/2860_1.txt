this movie only got a 1 because you can't give a zero! if you have a weak tummy at all don't watch. animal rights people you don't want to watch either. it makes people vegetarians i swear i witnessed it happen! the only cool parts are the case and the fact that its a true story. its really really super creepy that this guy worked at adt while he killed people! still feel safe when you punch in that little code? i don't! he had access to every code in kansas!!!!!! i hated the movie it was not scary it was mentally scaring! do your self a favor and don;t rent/buy this movie i think it cost about $20 to make that includes their over paid actors!!!!
