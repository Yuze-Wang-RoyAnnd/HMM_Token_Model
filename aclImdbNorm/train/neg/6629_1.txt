if you have seen the sholay of 1975, don't watch this movie. if you have not seen the sholay of 1975, go watch it. but do not watch this movie. this movie has all the ingredients that could possibly have gone wrong with making a remake of sholay. <br /><br />amitabh 'babban' bachchan plays the role of a psycho villain to the best (probably the only 40 mins of the reel that shouldn't be burnt). if you remove the rest of the movie and just watch amitabh play around with his character, it would still be worth a watch. but as insp. narsimha, mohanlal doesn't do justice to his talent. ajay devgan(heero) is extremely mundane and the only reason i think, they cast prashant raj in the role of raj is because he has a striking resemblance to amitabh of his young days. sushmita sen carries herself well, with grace and make-up. but the award for the "worst performance and any role till date" must go to nisha kothari. she manages to degrade her acting to such levels that even high-school drama would would outshine her performance.<br /><br />if you have a mortal enemy, take him to this movie. :)
