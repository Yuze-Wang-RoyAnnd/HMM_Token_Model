anyone giving this movie a good review obviously must have had something to do with its creation. this movie is a painful suckfest. the acting is stiff, the stock generic soundtrack is laughable, the direction is bland and strangest of all, the teacher really isn't all that attractive (making the student's blatant advances all the more awkward). the creative minds behind this trash should disband and spread out to prevent further displays of such concentrated craptitude. i'm certain that some starving kids in africa could have used the money squandered on this project. hell, the funds would have also seen a more enlightened purpose fueling a crack-addict; at least someone would be getting some entertainment out of it. for the sole reason that it didn't give me a terminal illness, i'll give this film a two.
