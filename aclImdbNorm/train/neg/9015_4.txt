the first 45 minutes of dragon fighter are entirely acceptable and surprisingly watchable. the characters are believable and interesting. the cloning lab looks really high-tech. after that, it all collapses. the characters start behaving idiotically, and a new subplot is introduced from nowhere about a fusion reactor (and this is supposedly "present day") going critical, the only plot justification of which is that it is required to kill the dragon - only it doesn't. the finish is incredibly weak. one wonders what made a movie that started out so well turn so wrong.<br /><br />all the characters except dean cain are played by russians. this results in some weird situations and details, like the character being played by vessela dimitrova being called "bailey kent" despite her heavy accent (and despite her, on one occasion, inexplicably switching to *spanish*!).<br /><br />because of the decent start, i considered rating this movie a 5, but it really was more disappointing than that, so i only give it 4.
