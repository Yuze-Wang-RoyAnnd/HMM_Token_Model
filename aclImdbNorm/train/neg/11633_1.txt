if i could i would give zero stars for this one, but unfortunately i have to give one...<br /><br />there is no single scene i could laugh about... but the game didn't make me laugh either. so if you're some ill retarded folk, go to your local cinema, watch this movie and give it 10 stars, like some people here already did.<br /><br />but for me... in a movie where children are shot dead to achieve humor... good taste goes over the edge... this was the third time i wasted my time to see a boll movie and it was definitely my last!<br /><br />0/10... i'm ashamed of being from the same country as uwe boll!<br /><br />please please keep him from making more movies!!!!!
