as someone who has read the book, i can say that this is vastly inferior to the big american version starring gwyneth paltrow. there are various reasons for this. firstly, emma is too unpleasant. yes, she has faults, and isn't the easiest person to like - but the viewer shouldn't downright start to despise her. secondly, mr knightly is miscast. his brooding and melancholy in this version are better suited to a bronte or gaskell adaptation than austen, and throw the mood of the whole affair "off". thirdly, samantha morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to the role of harriet; and why was she made to look so sickly? harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming - not to look as if she's going to be carried off by consumption in the next scene. fourthly, the structure has been mucked up and scenes cut. at the end, when emma decides she loves mr knightly, it comes across as utterly baffling because this narrative hasn't been adequately shown and carried along throughout the film. fifthly, what was going on, exactly, with mrs elton's accent? she went from sounding like an american actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning, to all out american half-way through, and then back to english at the end. finally, this dragged at the end. the book and the big film version end with the wedding of emma and mr knightly. this version drags on confusingly after the announcement of the wedding without actually showing us the ceremony.<br /><br />all in all, a rather haphazard attempt. read the book or rent the paltrow version instead
