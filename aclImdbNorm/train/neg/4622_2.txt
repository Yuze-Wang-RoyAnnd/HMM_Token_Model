no wonder this movie never saw the light of day. the timing was of the release was awful. the gong show had already "jumped the shark" by the time the movie came out, so who would pay money just to see a few of the censored clips from the original run of the show? and the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic, 90-minute whine by chuck barris about how hard his life was as host of the show. did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messed-up millionaire life? did he really think we even wanted to know about his life? (obviously so, since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a cia operative.) did he think the gag of having everyone, everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for 90 minutes? or the network executive hounding him at every turn? this might have worked as the plot for a 30-minute sitcom episode, but not as a full-length movie. however, it was nice to see rip taylor, gene gene, and the unknown comic again (although, to make the movie "spicy," they included only his most vulgar routines). and as someone else has pointed out, this is phil hartman's first significant movie part (even though it lasts only a minute). note his name is spelled hartmann in the credits, which is the name he was born with. you can't miss his voice and facial expressions, even though he's much thinner and younger than in the snl days. ed molinaro (hill street blues) also has a tiny part; one of his first after leaving the soap world.
