this is one of the most putrid movies of the 90's. i would not recommend it if you have something better to do. <br /><br />this picture presents african-americans as savage, uncultured, violent, inarticulate, reefer-smoking sociopaths. fudge(ice cube) and his posse of homies are continuously disrespectful toward others in the dorm, not just the white people, but asians too, and are never disciplined for their actions. despite all that tolerance they keep on whining and crying about the evil white oppressors who run their lives and stand in their way. in fact it is fudge's influence that causes remmy to bond with the skin heads, to drop out of college, and eventually to kill malik's girlfriend.<br /><br />the skinheads are presented as a covert group of underachievers who share a pad off campus and generally stay away from everyone else. they never blast their music to annoy people nor do they taunt the police. they do commit serious crime such as battery and rape, yet they're not as repulsive nor as threatening as fudge and dreads(busta rhymes) are.<br /><br />there's a lot of material in this film which almost offended me or made me giggle. some of it is as follows below.<br /><br />fudge and dreads are stated as students at the columbus university yet we never see them in class and it is completely unclear how they pay their tuition. one is only left to speculate that the weed they smoke has something to do with their finances. though they are students at what looks like a private university, they cannot utter a single line of proper english. their characters are developed only through their compulsive whining and xenophobia.<br /><br />it appears that drunken kristen(kristy swanson) knew exactly why drunken billy was taking her to his house. she even asked him to get a rubber so that they could begin. the fact that he penetrated her without a condom became a rape whilst it would be great sex only if he had one handy. later kristen was assured by taryn(jennifer connely) that she holds no accountability in that matter, and despite willfully jumping into a guy's bed she wasn't ready for sexual intercourse and was viciously taken advantage of by a sexual predator. then a week or so later she met, and slept with, an ultra-sensitive do-gooder who knew how to avoid raping and brought a condom. the director stressed contraception thoroughly.<br /><br />this movie is complete and utter garbage that makes black people look like pricks and women look stupid and frail. cole hauser's acting, and laurence fishburne's accent are the only reasons i can think of to watch it. the writer/director is obviously a man of limited intelligence. go ahead and limit your own by watching this crap if you want, but keep in mind that neurons don't grow back. just follow the advice at the end and unlearn.
