i've seen this movie today for the first time and i never heard of it before, probably because of it's poor message. <br /><br />first of all, the directing itself is quite good, the actors played well and the cgi (i'm not a fan of cgi) is magnificent. but that alone doesn't make a movie. no story at all, no message behind beautiful exploited talents.<br /><br />or do i have to make people remember, the art of a director is not only your vision but to know how to tell a story. and this is what's missing the whole 7 minutes.<br /><br />there for a simple 4 rating.
