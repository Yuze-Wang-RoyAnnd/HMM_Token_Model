in fact, marc blitzstein's off-broadway adaptation of "threepenny" was not so "bowdlerised" as is generally believed.<br /><br />(i have a special interest in "threepenny"; my dad was part of the first full production in the us; u of illlinois theatre guild did it around the end of ww2. hjitler had been so nearly successful in suppressing the play that they had to reconstruct the script and score from recordings in two different languages {neither english}, a german prompter's script and similar sources.) blitzstein's adaptation -- not a "translation" -- which had the full approval of lotte lenya -- was a lot closer to the original than generally believed.<br /><br />the problem is that the version thereof that most people know is the mgm cast recording (recently available on polygram on cd)(which includes beatrice arthur {as lucy, the "big complete girl", and can't i see her hands on hips and shoulders thrown back on that line -- bea was a major babe in the 50's}, paul dooley and john astin) was heavily censored by mike curb, head of mgm records -- i mean, 17 (i think it was) "goddamn"s got cut to just "damn".<br /><br />(at one time, mgm also offered a 2-lp set of the *entire* play, doubtless as heavily censored.)
