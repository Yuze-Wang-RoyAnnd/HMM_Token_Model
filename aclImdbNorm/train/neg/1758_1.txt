if you haven't seen this yet, i say just move on, take a walk in the park, don't waste your time. neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money. *spoilers*- i can't decide which was worse: the movie itself or baldwin's hairstyle? ellen pompeo's acting talent is very questionable i hope she can improve it over time. the storyline is just unbelievable. loose cannon american cop fighting criminals in europe on his own?? infamous slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunks??? an emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang??? spanish police executive dumber than a sack of hammers??? give me a break. there's only one good thing about this movie, though: at least, the production costs must be lower than "ocean's 12"'s which was as meaningless and over the top as this one.
