what the hell is in your minds ? this film sucks ! each minute i was getting more and more bored. i strove to watch the end because i hope something at least would at last happen ! but instead of that, i got amazed how dull the end was treated... what is this story about this bloody "bogeyman" ? how comes he doesn't die ? he is a bloody human being for god's sake ! a mere boy that killed his silly sister 15 years ago. then what ? his stay on a psychiatric hospital made him immortal ? this film a fascinatingly stupid... it's a must of silliness. i'm gonna resell it right now to some silly guy who will understand this silly film.
