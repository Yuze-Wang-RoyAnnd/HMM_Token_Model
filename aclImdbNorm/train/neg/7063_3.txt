the guy did a lot of title design for a bunch of movies and i guess one day he said; i should pick a cheap scenario, try to put as much title in it as a can ( cause after all i'm a title designer ) and try to persuade people that this is in fact a movie. one of the worst i've even seen that's for sure. if you fell the urge to see nice titles, go check out some posters don't waste your time watching this.<br /><br />it kinda ironic don't you think, did you saw the poster? the only part of his project that should had title work done have almost none !
