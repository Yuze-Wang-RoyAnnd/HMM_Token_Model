this is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre: action comedy. conceptwise it resembles rush hour but completely lacks the action, the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie. let it be known that i enjoy jay leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, but he just cannot act. he is awful when he tries to act tough - he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one-liners which, by the way, aren't very funny. and seeing him run (even back then) is not a pleasant sight. in addition, i have a feeling that pat morita - at least by today's standards - doesn't give a very politically correct impression of the japanese. don't even get me started about the story. i give it a 2 out of 10.
