"a christmas story" is one of many people's all-time most beloved films. acs was able to take the viewer to a time and a place in such a way that very few films ever have. it had a sweetness and goodwill to it that is rare.<br /><br />so i awaited (and awaited) its sequel, "it runs in the family" . the film was almost released a couple of times, only to be pulled at the last minute. when it finally came out, iritf was (and is, i guess) a total failure.<br /><br />the sets and cinematography were just fine, but the directing totally, completely missed the mark. the film was nothing more than a cash-flow formula of lazy casting, lazy writing, and disconnected acting.<br /><br />the narrator, jean shepard, who was one of america's great humorists and story-tellers, forced upon us a false reprise of the warm wit he used in acs. he over-emoted, and why he did that i'll never know. he somehow managed to become an annoying, overwrought parody of himself.<br /><br />the writing and acting in iritf is inauthentic and forced. the actors may have seen acs, but whatever wit and nuance that was in acs mustn't have registered at all on any of them. the acting was embarrassingly slapstick and bereft of any of shepard's dry humor.<br /><br />acs will always be a real treasure, but to call iritf a sequel is to insult all of the fans of jean shepard and acs.
