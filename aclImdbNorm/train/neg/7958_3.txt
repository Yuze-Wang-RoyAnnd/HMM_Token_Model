prot'eg'e runs in a linear fashion; expect no fast-paced action, and neither will you find yourself with baited breath because there are simply no seating-on-the-edge moments.<br /><br />there is not much of a crux, so don't expect one either. i would not fault the acting - the show would have been much worst if not for wu's acting which was the film's only saving grace. and, oh that cute little girl too.<br /><br />the humour is at best, weak, and the show must as well pass off as an anti-drug campaign which employs the usual shock-tactic (esp in the scenes with zhang) to tell us stuff that we already know - i.e. drugs break up families, heroin drives you crazy, it is not so easy to wean off, you will fall into a vicious cycle.<br /><br />i know it may seem all a little harsh, but i feel that the show is far from seamless and somewhat patchy (*spoiler alert*: take for example when andy lau got brought to the police station: what? we were just told 'oh we have all the tapes and evidence against you since 1997', and that is how he got caught. nope, no chasing-car action, just a jump-of-scene, which kind of undermined wu's role as an undercover in the first place.) i suspect the lack of creativity is attributed to the fact that it is after all, a production of mediacorp raintree - a singaporean production film company.
