garson kanin wrote and directed this look at "modern day" las vegas and the gap between generations, his first directorial effort since the 1940s! david janssen is somewhat miscast as a big-shot casino owner who reunites with his son (robert drivas, who looks disconcertingly like an older jason bateman). janssen approaches every scene the same way: defensively, with a chip on his shoulder. playing this role cool and laid-back is asking too much from janssen, who barks at everyone like a grouchy put-upon husband (he even chews out don rickles and makes him cry!). his son, a ne'er-do-well in search of his own identity, makes hip comments about how young people look down on vegas (give them another ten years), and his disapproval of dad's lifestyle causes friction. brenda vaccaro is cute as a self-conscious secretary and edy willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition. unfortunately, "where it's at" doesn't have much else going for it other than the now-dated ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids, some quick t&a shots and amusingly jaded satirical bits on the high-stakes world of gambling--most of which has been covered by now, ad nauseum. ** from ****
