when i read the summary of the movie, something like what happens when a man gets powers of a god, and how he later learns that having supernatural powers requires giant responsibility and strength, i though that was clever and original concept. casting was promising too, carrey, freeman, aniston... how can movie with a good idea and good actors, not to mention costs of filming, can be bad? it can. idea is good, but script and story itself is terrible. bruce nolan is, let's be honest, a pretty mediocre journalist, with not exactly great stories (like a story of a giant cookie, what a faux pas, and the niagara report is complete fiasco!), he's a man with a job he completely deserves (he's not a good journalist, he's a comedian), considering his potentials, with a nice home, sugar sweet girlfriend, and oh horror!!!! dog who is not house trained!!! yes, as soon as bruce, at the beginning of the movie starts addressing god in a "god, why do you hate me!" manner, average viewer must think: "why, what's wrong with your life, bruce?". bruce is not, and definitely not the man with real problems in life. most the troubles that happen to him are minor and not really worth of all that fuss he makes, and some of them are really only the result of his stupidity. most people have really big problems, worth of attention, most people are more worth of attention that bruce, who doesn't seem too human after all, doesn't look even realistic, too goofy and neurotic, but god still addresses to him. why? though morgan freeman looks nice as a god, i can't help but to ask what is he doing in this particularly bad movie. and what does bruce do when god gives him his powers? god in this movie could as easily give his powers to a 5 year old kid and there hardly would be any difference. no, wait, a smart kid would probably use his god powers better than bruce. what does bruce do? pulls the moon closer to earth to create romantic atmosphere, parts the red soup, lifts up a pretty woman's dress on the street, answers prayers via e-mail and make all of them come true!!!! no more, bruce, please! what bruce did could actually end the world, but in the movie, that doesn't happen, because this is "nice, family, little movie" and doesn't make any sense at all!!! not a hint of sarcasm, of real humor, of wittiness, of some dirty humor at least!!! nothing. just carrey playing silly, which is starting to look pathetic on middle aged actor. aniston here is understated. she plays pale, undeveloped character of bruce's girlfriend grace, and stays completely forgettable in this movie. nobody in the right mind would believe that this two have any chemistry at all between them. when grace says prayer for bruce it sounds not only lame and pathetic, but completely false. these two are not meant to be together. i would give three stars, but i doubt movie deserves a one. bad script, lame dialogs, lack of real humor, wittiness and any sophistication, as well as undeveloped characters and understated freeman's and aniston's roles, total lack of boldness and sarcasm, it all makes movie hardly worth ***. but ok, there were few funny moments, and freeman is always nice to see in any movie so, lets leave three stars.
