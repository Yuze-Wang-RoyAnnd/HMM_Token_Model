i just watched the 30th anniversary edition of blazing saddles, one of my all time favorites!! the tv pilot for black bart stunk. the plot was non-existent and the acting was not good. it was obviously an attempt to profit off of the success of blazing saddles and there have been tv shows that have succeeded in doing take-offs of big movies, but this one would never have worked. considering that for so many years tv would not even play the farting noises when they televised the movie, it is inconceivable that they thought they could put a show on tv with the "n" word thrown around. on the other hand, i enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces!!! there were quite a few actors/actresses that i recognized from other shows over the years. i had to write down all the names and do a few searches. that was fun. i was arguing with my mother if steve landesberg was from barney miller or mash. i won! :)
