first of all, as a long time student of the titanic disaster and member of several titanic clubs, i feel entitled to comment on the film. i don't really care how many awards and accolades the film won, but to me it is still an absolutely awful film. cameron had the resources to make a 'proper' semi-documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po-faced romantic mush. the fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows, to my mind, the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days. whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love? in fact most real events are anything but romantic and the titanic disaster certainly was not one. i feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible. i almost threw up in the last sequence where the 'dead' lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause. is this an intelligent film? ask yourself.
