i guess there are some out there that remember nicole eggert from her little girl days on such tv shows as t.j. hooker, charles in charge, and who's the boss? you perverts, you! maybe you remember her from baywatch when she grew up and got breast implants. no matter, you will certainly forget her in this supposed comedy about man-eating aliens.<br /><br />there are so many things that do not make sense and are never explained. how did she recognize the alien? why was the alien hot for paprika and cinnamon? why didn't the alien eat her? you get the picture.<br /><br />before the alien eats her boyfriend and assumes his identity, you get to see her in the body of alex meneses. this mexican/ukranian beauty is the only reason to watch this trash. stay for the shower scene and the boyfriend, and go on about your business.
