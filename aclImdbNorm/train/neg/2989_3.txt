although the likeliness of someone focusing on this comment among the other 80+ for this movie is low, i feel that i have to say something about this one. i am not the kind of movie-watcher who pays attention to production value, thought-provoking dialog, or brilliant acting & directing. however, i claim that this movie sucks. i don't know why i don't like it... i mean it has almost everything i want out of a horror movie: blood, outrageousness, unintentional humor, etc. according to this evidence it should be my favorite. still, zombi 3 is a baaad movie.<br /><br />there are just too many things that compels you to yell at the screen. like when the girl leaves the army guy when their car breaks down to find water (this spoils nothing so don't worry). she walks into what i see as an abandoned hotel or something. did she not see that there was a friggin' lake in the middle of the building??? yes she's looking for water and passes up a lake. why? cuz she wants to know why the people (who aren't there cuz the place is abandoned) won't answer her when she calls out: "is anybody there?" oh this is just a little, insignificant piece of the big picture i'm painting.<br /><br />there is a reason, though, why i gave this film more than 1 star. it's one of those movies where if you forget how bad it really is, like i have a few times, you'll want to watch it again because it's just so over-the-top in every aspect. i called it blood in the first paragraph, but this movie has no blood, it has an ocean of gore. also, it has pretty weird creatures in it as well: a zombie-baby (with an adult-size hand???) and a magically flying head to name just two.<br /><br />you know when you try to think of the worst and cheesiest movies ever made and you come up with '50's sci-fi movies? i believe that zombi 3 and movies like it should top those. it has all the elements: scientists arguing with the government, warnings of the apocalypse on the radio, armies battling monsters, and so on. this is the plan 9 of the '80's! while i won't say that this is a waste of money if you want to buy it, just expect the very worst. and when you find out that expecting the worst is underestimating zombi 3, it won't be all that bad. you might actually like it, i'm not saying that's impossible.<br /><br />don't think i hate this movie, i don't... really. oh, p.s. killing birds (aka zombie 5) rules! (did i just blow my credibility?)
