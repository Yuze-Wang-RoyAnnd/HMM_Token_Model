the explosion of tv channels must be eternally grateful to the randolph scott western production line, because any any moment there must be one of what seems like a hundred randolph scott movies playing on at least one no-budget station.<br /><br />"man behind the gun" is a typical early 1950's period melodrama with pre-wwii production values that relies on a historically-topical murder mystery plot peppered with action scenes to disguise the script's complete absence of character development, and thus lack of suspense. in years to come the role of these films would be taken over by tv shows like 'gunsmoke', 'bonanza', etc - and these actually did the job better. randolph scott, looking particularly grizzled in this, is the good guy, struggling against the bad guys against whom he will eventually prevail. there's no more interest in what he goes through emotionally than in what his horse is feeling, unless you count wondering whether he'll sort out the initial misunderstanding with the female lead by the end. the music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the 'characters' than the acting is. but it's fine if that floats your boat; and i wouldn't berate you for enjoying 'diagnosis, murder', either.<br /><br />workmanlike, pedestrian, and ageing rapidly. 3 stars for being competently put together; 0 for artistic endeavour.
