and how it made it into production astounds me. the main character is an obnoxious show off who isn't the least bit funny. i can't stand the character at all. he's a dumb ass with nothing to offer the show. <br /><br />this is the worst cartoon to surface in the last 10 years, no joke. the story lines are both poorly written and executed. the jokes are as bad as the ones on disney's sweet life of zack and cody. i could not dislike this show more, it's terrible and should be canceled. even the theme song is bad. the title, even worse.<br /><br />it's as though this show is written by a couple of 15 year olds that based the character on themselves and think they're hot stuff when they're really just arrogant and lack creativity as well as humor.<br /><br />johnny test, go away far and fast!
