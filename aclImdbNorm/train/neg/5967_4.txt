just think, it cost a total of $250,000 to make "clerks". how the hell did they spend $45 million to make this glorified music video? a practically unknown cast, two or three sets, no special effects that i could see... i know, it must have been spent on that expertly crafted, economical, tension filled screenplay. shoot, that bar set must have cost a bundle. anyway, i guess jerry bruckheimer wouldn't be caught dead producing anything for less. i'm just surprised he didn't blow up anything.<br /><br />anyway, it wasn't an awful film i guess. the female leads seemed to have some good chemistry and the soundtrack was ok. imo it just seems a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been made for $5 million without any loss to the production, and 6 more $5 million dollar indy films of merit could have been made as well.
