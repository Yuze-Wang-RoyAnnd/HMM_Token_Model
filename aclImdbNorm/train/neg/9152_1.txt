intrigued by the synopsis (every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover; this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign) i purchased ben and arthur without knowing a thing about it. this is my second (and i assure you it will be my last) purchase of a culture q connection video. as far as i am concerned, this dvd is nothing but a blatant rip-off. i do not make this observation lightly
