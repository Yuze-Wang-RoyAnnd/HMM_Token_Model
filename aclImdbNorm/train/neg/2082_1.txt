what a waste of time and money! my hubby and i saw this movie - after seeing the previews and thinking it "might be funny". wrong! this movie is about 90 minutes too long. the actors are trapped in a poorly written script and can't get out. the jokes are weak and tired, and not even seeing wilson's naked behind can redeem any part of this film. the special effects.....aren't. i half expected to see the harness and wires holding up uma in her flying scenes. and when the effects people apparently could not master the superhero's faster-than-a-speeding-bullet flying or fight scenes, they covered over everything with a swirling vortex of blurred screen - which hid the awful effects quite nicely. wilson's sidekick was a lame excuse for a man and wilson had no chemistry with either uma or his office co-worker. the sex scenes weren't sexy and the funny scenes weren't funny. i guess i just expected too much from these actors. none of the characters were really sympathetic, so i ended up not caring a flying fig about any of them. the only memorable performances were the kids who played bedlam and g-girl as teenagers - at least they had some chemistry. overall, a super stinko movie - i wouldn't even recommend it as a rental - it would still be a waste of money!
