recherche is a good word to describe this movie.<br /><br />let's say every movie has a selling point, a gimmick. transformers' gimmick is the awesome effects as well as fan boys nostalgia. sleepless in seattle's gimmick is situational in their tag-line, "what if someone you never met, someone you never saw, someone you never knew was the only someone for you?" many romance relies heavily on these gimmicks and some through draw of big names. leap years employs both by using the irish folklore as the circumstance and featuring considerably famous names within the country.<br /><br />so now that the audience are in the cinema, besides all the usual elements in characters, conflict or consequences, crisis, resolve and denouement, they also look forward to stimulating dialog, more absorbing situations as a result of the leap years, interesting sub-plots and perhaps, to a certain extent, a good twist in the middle or towards the end of the story that favors the circumstances of the characters.<br /><br />this is what jean yeo is trying not to achieve. if they've tried to, their goal was apparently in the other court, at the other stadium, on the other end of the planet. she and her writer, alain layrac, utterly failed to provide stimulating dialog. most of the lines were contrived. it seems that they have a bag filled with lines which she would like to use in her movie: "okay, these are the lines and quotes which i've heard or read from either movies i've seen or books i've read before and they all sound good to me. if they sound good to me, they will sound good to the audience. therefore, all i have to do is piece them all together. i am going to use all of them." the result is cathartic. i can't say that the lines were unnecessary and bears no relation to the story or in driving the plot on, but they seem to spring out of nowhere, catching you off guard with these quotable quotes.<br /><br />on a personal level, i know people who cite quotes based on most of the situations in our dialog, trying to make it meaningful to themselves while nodding along. i don't go out with them anymore because the urge to punch them is overwhelming.<br /><br />secondly, the characters portrayed are silly and one-dimensional. with exception to the unnatural dialog which implies their motivation (necessary to drive the plot), there was no sense of conviction in them. i haven't an idea who they are. they are all simpletons spouting lines from the advice column of a female-oriented magazine.<br /><br />the gimmick in the leap years is not enough to drive the story on because the circumstances are too shallow. then again, there are movies with less but fared better than this, aren't there. they made it up with my first and second point. moreover, the sub-plots are inconsequential (not that it's a bad thing for movies) and thin (bad thing).<br /><br />jean yeo and the producers are trying to pass off the terrible plot with fancy locations and passable photography. this is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to attain the approval from some viewers than the others with the good use of cinematography, soundtrack and filming location. these non-discerning viewers.<br /><br />it is not even the kind of movie that is so bad that it's good. it is just bad. don't watch this.
