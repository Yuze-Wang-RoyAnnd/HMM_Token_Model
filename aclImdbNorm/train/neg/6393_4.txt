i will admit that i did not give this movie much of a chance. i decided pretty early on that this just wasn't my kind of movie.<br /><br />for the most part, it has an excellent look in terms of its cinematography. the scenes of early 70's manhattan look very good, as does the lead actress. it is a very crisp black and white, which could almost make the movie feel undated and fresh. however, some of the other techniques the filmmakers employ shoot that prospect all to hell. the disjointed editing is very late-60's, somewhere between surrealism and new wave. the story also feels like it came from a very specific time, somewhere between free love idealism and artsy experimentation.<br /><br />the film follows a young girl around the city as she looks for a man who she had anonymous phone sex with. as she meets other odd characters, she reveals her quirks and they reveal theirs. the movie seems to be meant as an off-the-wall, irreverent comedy, but adds an avant-garde feel. i would expect that if you like andy warhol movies, you would be very excited to discover the telephone book.<br /><br />some problems i had: near the end of the movie, one character tells a rambling anecdote that lasts over twelve minutes
