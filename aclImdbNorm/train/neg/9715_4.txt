this program is really overrated. a detective like danny pino's hot-headed character would have been transferred to the "rubber gun squad" years ago. the whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007. every vietnam veteran character they've ever had has turned out to be the killer, unless it was another vietnam veteran. there has only been one black murderer, and he was put up to it by his white boss. the only hispanic killer was a "race traitor" who killed another hispanic to frame a hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two rich white kids committed. what a bunch of propaganda. hey,screenwriters: minorities and poor people commit murder too. only on this show are most murderers upper-class whites.<br /><br />what's more, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. no real-life da will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. the state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor. the prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they won't serve a day. the only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-nazis, whose high-profile convictions boost da's careers.
