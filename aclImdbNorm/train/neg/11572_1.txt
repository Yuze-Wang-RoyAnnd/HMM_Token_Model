slow, boring, extremely repetitive. no wonder the weinstein company did not buy this. this spurlock should eat more mcdonalds while filming himself, and quit producing. there is no way you can watch this and enjoy. the preacher is a joke. the whole idea is not funny. you can make a 2 minute film with this idea not a feature. i am so sorry i rented this movie. i will never watch anything with the name spurlock on it. it is completely garbage. filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never be granted a distribution deal. the film states that the american consumers and their shopping are at fault for the current depression when shopping and buying products, making money circulate in the system are the base of a healthy economy.
