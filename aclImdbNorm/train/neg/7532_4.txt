something i really love about this woman's short films was the elusiveness of theme -- especially in "living with happiness." this film has some nice beginnings -- unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment, but fails to succeed with clunky expositional dialogue, patchy performances and very television coverage.<br /><br />it's once again charming television and very ordinary cinema. the ideas are so fleshed out that they almost feel pat like a television commercial. but the sentiment is good so we can't complain too much.<br /><br />i really would love to see this director make a full length animation and try and work with a producer who doesn't demand so much boring clarity.
