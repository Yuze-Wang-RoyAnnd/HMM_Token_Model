i unknowingly had this movie on my shelf for a while in a mill creek collection, and one night i just decided to watch it; though not expecting much. as the beginning credits roll around i'm surprised to discover this film was made under the filmirage company. filmirage brought the world such amazing stinkers as "troll 2", "ator the invincible", and "quest for the mighty sword", so i was compelled to watch.<br /><br />as the movie started out it had potential to be pretty decent, even though it was unoriginal. the gore scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent. but after a while into the film, the pace started dragging and i found myself thinking "okay someone better get killed soon",or "someone better mutate". at the onset of this drag, when i was having these thoughts, though someone may have gotten killed or have mutated, however as noted, the gore and effects weren't very good. what made matters worse was that the scene transitions were confusing; example: first dr. houseman would be at the zoo, then he'd have a flash back about possibly killing someone, finally he'd wake up in a cold sweat in bed-- making the audience ask "was he dreaming he was at the zoo?". like the movie's pace, these scene transitions got progressively worse.<br /><br />i could try to say the character development of dr. houseman was pretty good, but towards the end of the film, that is, once you've seen what the doctor has metamorphosed into, hopefully you'll laugh-- which really, is the only reason to see this movie at least once; this movie unintentionally runs like a long-winded joke.<br /><br />the costume of the um, thing that doctor houseman becomes can also be seen in joe d' amato's "quest for the mighty sword", which was made in the same year. you've gotta love filmirage movies, they're always re-using the same stuff!
