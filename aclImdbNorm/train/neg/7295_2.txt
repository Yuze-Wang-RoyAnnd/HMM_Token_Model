first of all, the reason i'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least peter falk gave his usual fantastic performance as lieutenant columbo. he alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie.<br /><br />i was initially all fired up at reading one poster's comment that andrew stevens in this movie gave "the performance of his career." to me, it was the abysmal performance by stevens that absolutely ruined this movie, and so i was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment. then i thought to myself, what else has stevens done? so i checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. in the 17 years since this columbo movie was made, apparently every one of the 33 projects that stevens has been in since then has been utter crap, so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career.<br /><br />if you like columbo, see every other of the 69 titles before watching this one. do yourself a favor and save the worst for last.
