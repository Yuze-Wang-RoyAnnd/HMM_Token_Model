i don't know why this conduct was ever tolerated in the movie business! this movie (short) is gross (to say the least)! it is a bunch of 5-7 year old children wearing diapers with big bobby pins, acting like adults (and too much so!). however, it is interesting because it is a good example of how "the good old days" may not have been so good after all! (thank god we have laws against this kind of material now!)<br /><br />{this is one short from the "shirley temple festival"}
