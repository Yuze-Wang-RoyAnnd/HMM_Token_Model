having heard so much about the 1990s cracker series without seeing any of them, i looked forward to this eagerly. surely the combination of jimmie mcgovern and robbie coltrane could not go wrong. how wrong i was! <br /><br />the polemics, backed by frequent, repetitive and violent flashbacks, were overpowering. the production tried to be super-modern, but the flashing boxes and even the childish font irritated. robbie coltrane sleep-walked through the two hours, coming up with unexplained and unlikely "insights", and the police were portrayed as one-dimensional bumbling idiots. as a result, the tension never built up and the next-to-final scene (no details for fear of spoilers) was as laughably bad a piece of tv drama as i have seen for a long time.<br /><br />no, i don't want to see any more of these, but i will go back to the dvds of the 1990s series to see if they match their reputation.
