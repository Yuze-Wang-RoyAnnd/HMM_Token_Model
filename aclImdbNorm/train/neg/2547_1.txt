i haven't seen it in over twenty years. oj was the bus driver, arte johnson was the tour guide, lorenzo was the kidnapper.<br /><br />yea, lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain, a natural. i think i watched it back then most for oj, who i had seen towering inferno and cassandra crossing, but also to see arte johnson.<br /><br />i was a little bored that johnson was so serious.<br /><br />and yes, it shifted plots. in reading other posts, i remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl, but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the blue.<br /><br />i was going, a stamp? if it came on as a late movie, i would probably record it to check it out again, but i wouldn't be nostalgic over it. not yet anyway.<br /><br />there are better movies from the seventies like this to check out.
