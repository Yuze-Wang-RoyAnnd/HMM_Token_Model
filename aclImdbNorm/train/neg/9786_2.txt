ok, i bought this film from woolworths for my friend for a joke present on his birthday, because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it.<br /><br />but we decided it to watch it anyway. just for hilarity purposes.<br /><br />and i'm sorry, but this has got to be, one of the worst films in history.<br /><br />it began off alright, and we thought "ok this might actually be ok". but after about 10 minutes, we were sadly mistaken.<br /><br />it began when the "mysterious paint baller" turned out to be the most obvious character, the scouser/australian (i say that because he had an accent which couldn't be identified), who's acting might i just say, was abysmal.<br /><br />then it got to the end, and by that time, we had all lost the will to live. the paint ball finals.<br /><br />the only thing i did like about this plot is that they didn't actually win, but annoyingly enough they won by default.<br /><br />and i know this has nothing to do with it, but the name the team were given was just awful. critical damage. i mean they could of picked a more awesome name, like "the destroyers of the anti-christ" or something. or that's what the film should of been called anyway.
