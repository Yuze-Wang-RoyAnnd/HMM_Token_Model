there is a lot to like here. the actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit, likable family. however, for that reason the film does not ring true. we see leo, who apparently just learned of his hiv positive diagnosis, essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself. as well, the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what leo, his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him. the young actor who plays leo's brother, marcel, is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast. unfortunately, the scriptwriters could not decide onwhether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of hiv on a functional, appealing family or what the devastation hiv is on the victim - so it only hints at both. while this film provides food for thought it leaves the viewer wanting much more than it delivers.
