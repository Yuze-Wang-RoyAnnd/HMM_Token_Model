this movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects. there are some interesting visuals.<br /><br />aside from that, it's typical nineties/aughties hollywood fare of dazzle without substance. true to the title.<br /><br />it's not worth picking apart the story. that's like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur. there's not much there to begin with. it's nothing original and not very special. so don't go in for the story at all. just look at the effects.<br /><br />as has been mentioned, it got a little flashy at the end, diluting the purity of great fx treatment of an invisible (and at times half invisible) man. however if you ignore the "standard" pyrotechnics, it's a sight to behold (or not to behold).<br /><br />all in all, it's a decent fx film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone.
