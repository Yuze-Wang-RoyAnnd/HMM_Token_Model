for those of us that lived thru those weeks of filming in town and around the valley - lest we not forget the tedious days of road closures and "film-making". as a reminder to those that live here - locales include boulder creek, bonny doon, davenport, big basin. etc. the bank was the bc firehouse; chase scenes included moon drive off hwy 236, empire grade rd, and hwy 1.<br /><br />production: jeffrey jones was the most approachable, matt broderick was above us all - even back then. as far as the film goes - a joke of a script and even a bigger laugh regarding acting and plot - but who cares at this level. a nice time capsule for those that enjoy our coast and valley scenery.<br /><br />additional notes; joe's bar (jed's tavern in the film), original name of the film was welcome to buzzsaw - the old erba's parking lot was the town square, the backyard shots were off of grove street in boulder creek; turn off the thinking cap and see a few actors in their early days.
