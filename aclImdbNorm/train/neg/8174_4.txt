the title of this obscure and (almost righteously) forgotten 80's slasher inevitably reminds me of the cure's mega-smash-monster hit song with the same title, hence a piece of the lyrics in the title-section of this user comment. also, i didn't have anything else to say that was useful, anyway. but hey, "the forest" isn't totally hopeless and not even *that* bad, actually. if nothing else, at least it obeys the, admittedly unwritten, first rule of 80's slasher: kill someone within the first 10 minutes of playtime. sure you've heard about the basic premise of this film a dozen times before, but don't let that discourage you from watching it, as "the forest" has a couple of things more to offer than just an appealingly sinister cover image. it's actually a bit of an atypical 80's slasher! the main characters aren't ordinary brainless teenagers and the script has solid ambitions towards supernaturalism. the concept isn't always successful, let alone plausible, but it's more than interesting enough to hold your attention and there are even are a couple of surprisingly strong moments of tension and plot twists to enjoy. two married couples decide to go camping in the most isolated woods of california, but due to a stupid bet the wives travel separately from their husbands. barely set up for the night, they receive uncanny visits from a mother looking for her two children, the children themselves and finally the father who's out hunting for human flesh. the demented family may be real or imaginary, but the women are definitely in danger and by the time their husbands arrive, they have already vanished. the men too encounter the family, and they find out more about the slightly dysfunction background. "the forest" is a weird and unusual film, to say the least. it's not exactly a masterpiece of plotting, but the thoroughly strange atmosphere will certainly appeal to open-minded fans of 80's horror. the murders are fairly gruesome and will-filmed, including a slit throat and a painful saw-massacre, and the filming locations are stunningly beautiful. the more you contemplate about the story and its abrupt twists, the less it makes any sense, so my advice would just be to enjoy this odd viewing experience for as long as it lasts and not a minute longer. the acting performances are just above average, the music is okay and at least director donald jones (also responsible for the 70's exploitation-sickie "schoolgirls in chains") tried to be a little more creative that the majority of 80's horror films. too bad it ultimately fails.
