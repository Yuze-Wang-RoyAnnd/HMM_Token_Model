i've been a fan since his first album. this film is a disservice to him. the performances, except for one by rufus wainwright and teddy thompson are simply terrible. <br /><br />those by martha wainwright, nick cave, antony, and jarvis cocker were particularly annoying. even the one by the mcgarrigle sisters was ruined by the so called harmony of martha wainwright.<br /><br />i've never seen my wife get up and walk out of the room on a film before and i found myself fast forwarding through the performances to get to the few interview segments, which were also difficult to watch due to the poor camera work. <br /><br />there are many who have been able to interpret mr. cohen's songs, jennifer warnes, kd lang, billy joel, aaron neville, and willie nelson come to mind, but those people selected for this performance were just awful.<br /><br />hopefully there will be another attempt at capturing leonard cohen on film that will illustrate his insight, talent, and intelligence.<br /><br />so sad
