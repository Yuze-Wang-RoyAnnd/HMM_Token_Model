**spoilers**this was an ugly movie, and i'm sorry that i watched it. like jan kounen's dobermann, it suffers mostly from poor editing--or lack of it. it is as if the director was so in love with his work that instead of cutting the movie down to a pace that kept your attention, he added all of the footage he had shot together. there are maybe two cool scenes in the entire movie. one of them is *spoiler* when benkei is petrified and the camera starts spinning around him. that was cool--but okay, we got it! move on please! the camera won't stop spinning around this guy! there's maybe one or two more cool scenes that i forgot about in this flood of mediocrity, but the last duel scene is not one of them! it may be because unlike in the earlier sword-handling scenes, shanao isn't masked--but just because the director couldn't find a stuntman who somewhat resembled asano tadanobu doesn't give him the right to go ahead and make up 80% of the sword fight with extreme close-ups of sword clashes! and all from the same angle, may i add. the director should learn from the american produced 1995 bullet-train ninja movie the hunted! i personally saw the village raid scene as a tribute paid to the social activists of the previous generation who were confronted by the police in the violent demonstrations of their college years. the situation where innocence is oppressed by an authoritative and armed branch of the government unwilling to understand seems to be a message common in the japanese media, due to the strong influence of socialists and communists who are a political minority. the movie versions of gto and salary man kintaro are two other recent examples *end spoiler* i don't understand. i just don't understand why people who don't speak the language of the movie find praise worthy material in this. maybe the worst was lost in the translation.<br /><br />the ending of the movie--on which marketing played a lot, is a different interpretation of the legendary encounter between shanao and benkei. but that legend is not the most popular in japanese folklore, and it is so detached from contemporary themes, that after 138 minutes of over played visual techniques, who cares how the director wants to re-interpret the story!? director sasaki hirohisa of crazy lips said that there was an unpleasant trend among new japanese directors to ignore japanese audiences, and target their movies for foreign film festivals--in order to gain faster international fame. this works, although it doesn't make sense, because the point of an international movie fest is to introduce to the world what kind of movies are being made in other countries-what kind of movies people watch in those countries. certainly not gojoe and the like.
