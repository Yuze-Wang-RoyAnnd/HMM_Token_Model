there are bad movies, terrible movies even boring movies...i can watch most and put up until the end, not this time. avoid this like the plague, annoying music throughout, terrible editing, no comedy, its tackier than a novelty mug...my missus wanted to watch this thinking it would be legally blonde material or something kind of watchable, but never better than average, chick flick. its the first time she was begging me to push the stop button.<br /><br />the girls, well, they were not great to start with (denise done ok in starship troopers and wild things) but you have sank to the gravel. i feel like a mug having spent 30 minutes on this...pamela anderson is almost unrecognisable after much construction work to her face.<br /><br />please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells ranting at the utter mince that is on your screen.
