ben a out-of-town cop is convinced his sister was brutally killed and wants to bring her killer to justice, but he's approached by stefan who believes his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult. so ben, his sister's best friend and stefan travel to transylvania to put a end to this evil.<br /><br />this is incredibly awful b-grade stuff and i wondered how it even got released. it makes the original 'howling' look like a masterpiece. what was christopher lee thinking, as this has to be his worst performance i've seen.<br /><br />there was a lot wrong with this real cheap-ass film, ranging from the really hammy and wooden performances from annie mcenroe, reb brown, marsha a. hunt and sybil danning (not to forgot lee), cheesy fashion (those sunnies), cheap and lame special effects, bad use of lighting, the humour... if there was any, trashy 80s music (with some of the film just focusing on some unknown band playing), werewolf's having orgies which is a sight to see and a tiresome story with flat and annoying dialogue. i thought if it was that bad it would be awfully funny, but i was wrong. <br /><br />the positives were the location and settings of the film looked great, but that's about it... actually i'll add sybil danning short stripping scene too.<br /><br />during the end credits the band plays their crap-house song during a weird montage of scenes from the film, which i beckon the question why?<br /><br />an awful piece of mess, however at least it isn't boring.<br /><br />1/5
