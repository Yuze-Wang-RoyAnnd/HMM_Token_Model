no need to detail what others have written in other reviews - here goes the summary: <br /><br />* much of the nested animation work is downright gorgeous - the colors are superb - would love to have it done in silk as a necktie<br /><br />* the story and execution is a total snooze - it was quite difficult to stay awake at times<br /><br />if you are a student of the fine arts, medieval calligraphy, early religion and so forth - have at it. this is a film for you.<br /><br />if you want an engaging, entertaining movie - look elsewhere - this is a failure as anything other than an artistic statement.<br /><br />vikings didn't have horns by the way...
