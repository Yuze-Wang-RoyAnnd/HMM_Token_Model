the only reason i am commenting is because i finally figured out why dr. cox was bald. although we probably all realized it at the same time this week, dr. cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them. the latest episode when our favorite grumpy, jesus-loving nurse roberts dies dr. cox shaves his head. the must have showed them out of order for some odd reason and forgot they slipped up the continuity. for shame, scrubs. they've made mistakes like this before. i remember when elliot is trying to date scott foley and her hair is wet 2 seconds before water hits her. i try not to notice these things, but my favorite show needs to step it up.
