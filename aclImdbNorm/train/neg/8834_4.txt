there was some truth to this movie. i remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago of 4 fisherman finding a body in the water and they chose not to report it until their trip was finished. i also recall they were charged with interfering with a corpse (or some such charge). i'm not sure if it was in australia. the viewers outside of australia must think we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders. wolf creek and this film would encourage this perception. the film itself reminded me of a simple plan. but as far a being one of the best australian films ever, as someone claimed, i can't be that generous. put it this way, i wouldn't bother watching it again.
