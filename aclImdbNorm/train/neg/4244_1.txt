contrary to my principles, let me first come up with a conclusion, because i have just seen this piece of "art", and still am under strong impressions. the reader is asked to excuse my stronger vocabulary.<br /><br />well, this movie is absolutely horrible, and i would never bother to write a single word about it, if it were not for the fact that "44 minutes" made me sick to death, which rarely happens to me. the fact that i paid for that does not exactly makes me feel better, as well as the fact the movie deserved the high user rating here.<br /><br />so what is wrong with the movie? it has a fashionable title - "44 minutes". one first thinks about "15 minutes", which is by the way a much better movie, but still bad in my book, and indeed the two can be compared to some extent. but, as luck would have it, the things they share are their worst characteristics. they both feature mr. oleg taktarov, who with his strong russian accent obviously meets the popular expectations and prejudices. his purpose is to appeal to the cold war mind. ah, do we miss the good old times. now, i don't imply that he is a bad actor, i am yet to judge his true performance, but he is simply not a true individual here, he is more like an archetype. how anyone can still indulge in such things is completely beyond my comprehension. we can recognize modern american xenophobia here. the point in the movie when taktarov explains to his companion that romanians are not germans, and that they are in america is truly laughable. are we to assume that the greatest desire of the wretched duo is to become "true" americans? <br /><br />then, there is the media issue. yes, it seems that the most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and reporters. the director should have made us feel the rhythm of the presumed 44 minutes. instead he bores us with interviews throughout the movie like in a cheap tv show, trying to reinvent the wheel. in 15 minutes the issue of media is the central one.the point is presented in a way a teacher addresses an obtuse student, but that deserves a separate comment, we are focusing on 44 minutes now. so, i have been trying to identify the purpose of this movie. what is it? to provide good time for the audience? to glorify weapons? to glorify police? portray violence? oh yes, the officer gives the bible to the underage delinquent. so it must promote peace and understanding after all? i don't think so, but don't ask me. i only know i didn't enjoy any of this.<br /><br />ah, michael madsen. i admit, i am a big fan. i hoped he would be a bright point, but i was wrong. it's not his fault though. <br /><br />as the final note, comparing "firepower" to "willpower" at the end of the movie was one of the worst lines i have ever heard.<br /><br />to summarize, on the scale 1-10, i give it a pure, unadulterated 1.
