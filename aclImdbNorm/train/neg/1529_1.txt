if you see this turkey listed in your tv guide, avoid it like the plague!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />a steaming great pile of fetid dingoes kidneys doesn't begin to describe how bad this movie is! there is only one funny scene (the memory eraser scene) but even that rates only .001 on the laughometer (out of 1000). whoever wrote this turkey should be banned from writing another movie for their entire lives.
