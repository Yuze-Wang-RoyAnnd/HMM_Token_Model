seriously, i mean very seriously, when i first started watching the show i thought it was good. but the plots just got worse. the storyline were either too boring or predictable. george isn't always funny, he sometimes acts stupid. his jokes are overdone. his mom is the silliest character of the show. how can a mother treat her own son that way, okay if it was the daughter in law, but this was her own son. i give this show a 4/10 just because the first few shows were a little funny. the actors constance marie and masiela lusha do a great job. don't know how these shows get to play for so long. <br /><br />if you're really bored like i was and have nothing else to watch, i'd suggest you watch this.
