a bum gives a secret serviceman a tip about a secret service man in the presidential detail who plans to kill the president. baloney. how did the bum know? the script then turns to a most detailed examination of how the secret service works, but who cares. most of this just slows down the movie. all the chases that follow are this film's version of the tiresome car chases of many movies. then, after a lot of impossible athleticism in which our hero outruns and out-guns all his buddies, we have a shootout in the toronto city hall. the canadians are clearly marked with maple leafs, but how did they get into this? finally, all is worked out. but it still makes no sense.
