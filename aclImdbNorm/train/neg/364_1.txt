larry buchanan. yep, same guy who did "attack of the the eye creatures" and two (count 'em: two) conspiracy movies about marilyn monroe. he's to blame, here.<br /><br />adding onto his ever-growing pile of folders left over from oliver stone's "eh-i-grew-out-of-it" conspiracy drawer, here's "down on us (i.e.- "beyond the doors") which is the working definition of historical inaccuracy.<br /><br />forget everything you thought you knew about jimi hendrix, janis joplin and jim morrison, says big lar', cuz this is the real deal! y'see, the three big names in rock of the '60s were killed by the government because they were subversives or counter-productive to truth, justice and the american way, or sumpthin' like that there. i knew it all along.<br /><br />anyway, three people (chatman, meryl, wolf) who look eerily like their real life shadows (that is, if you completely close your eyes, turn your backs and walk five miles away from them) show that instead of their recorded deaths, the good old us of a put hits out on them! yep, it's the truth!<br /><br />man, i cannot believed i watched this movie. it's facts, when not stretching credibility to the snapping point, are ludicrous; the acting makes tv commercials look like high drama and if you honestly watch it through to the end, you deserve the "twist" ending. you really, really do; i swear. genius.<br /><br />but like the man said: "rock and roll is dead - long live rock and roll."<br /><br />not this flick, though.<br /><br />no stars for "down on us". and that's the movie audience describing the film, by the way....
