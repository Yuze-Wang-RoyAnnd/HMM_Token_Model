i had heard (and read) so many good things about weeds that i was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable series (like entourage, sopranos or mad men) but that slowly eroded away with each episode i watched from season one. (didn't make it past the first six episodes) <br /><br />the writing was unoriginal, contrived and the portrayal of blacks embarrassing. the dialog felt forced, like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip . it was a rare moment when i actually emitted an audible laugh.<br /><br />the characters never developed enough for me to care about them, they were selfish and unappealing. i absolutely hated the addition of the brother-in-law (who should have been hauled away on to catch a predator) and the removal of the hodes' daughter quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in mexico was so unoriginal and clich'e, i had to conclude the writers were testing the viewer's loyalty.<br /><br />episode after episode i liked the characters less and couldn't get past many of the technical flaws in the story line.<br /><br />add to that i heard that season two wasn't as good, so i lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out.<br /><br />if you're a fan of good casting and writing, i suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like, unless of course you're stoned and then all bets are off.
