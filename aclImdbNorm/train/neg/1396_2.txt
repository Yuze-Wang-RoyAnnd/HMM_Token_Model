this film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie. but for me, it failed. i won't elaborate much on the rather confusing plot line, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the comment by user "reluctantpopstar" gives a good description of it.<br /><br />but it didn't work for me. i found it slow, which would be okay but for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere. the viewer is left in the dark about too many things to really be able to get a handle on this movie-in some films, one can argue that the filmmakers intended to provoke thought and left things ambiguous for that reason. i don't think that this is the case here.<br /><br />as for the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been frequently mentioned by other users...i see that they do have a point-they give the viewer time to get another drink without missing any of the "action". and i suspect many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have several beverages on board to get through this one.
