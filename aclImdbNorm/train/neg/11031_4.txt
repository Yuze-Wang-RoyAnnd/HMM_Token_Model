it's interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film. but the problem is that it's not very good. there was nothing really original in the film and while the plot was well presented, the main characters were all a bit to shallow and you didn't bother for any of them.<br /><br />rather bland (and sometimes downright bad) photo leaves a bit to be desired but i guess you can't expect to much from people who are just doing a low budget film for the heck of it. it's unfair to review the film and compare it to other high-budget films. but alas, that is what one must do. on its own, it's not very good. and compared to others, it's still not very good. but it is not without its good points! i liked the plot. it was built up rather nicely and tied together well at the end. sometimes in the really dark scenes, it managed to build up a creepy feeling as well.<br /><br />however in the end the film fails to impress. the characters are pretty much non-existent and we don't care for any of them. any of them might die, but it's possible to pinpoint the final "survivor" from very early on.
