tenants two writers struggle to complete their books in an all but empty apartment house. they at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to build.<br /><br />this is based upon a bernard malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel. very little of the dialog is natural, its purple and brimming with shades of meaning. its as if a college english major with a head full of pretensions wrote the script. it's awful and i found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say, which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom. snoop dog on down are fine form, unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premise.<br /><br />i can't really recommend this movie. while not really bad, its very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away. i lost interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end. if you're interested i'd try it on cable, but i wouldn't lay out good money to see it.
