i hate plane crash movies...all of them! in fact, i hate them all with a passion! first of all, they are cheap-looking and have no craftsmanship! secondly, they insult the airline industry and say to the audience that all planes do is...fall out of the sky and crash!<br /><br />why i wince at such a film? this could happen to any of us and with worser consequences than those suffered by the characters in said movie...which is the only chilling aspect of an airline disaster yarn such as this. i hate this movie because it's like all the 50,000,000 stupid-ass airplane chaos movies before it! freefall is like all the others: nothing more than boredom before the clich'ed bullshit dramatic scenes take place. <br /><br />first, off we have same cast of retards on this flying death trap: the cleaver-esquire family of three, the yuppie baastard, and the bitch of a flight attendant complete with a big blond hairdo from 1987 scolding anyone who is the least bit frightened! <br /><br />my second gripe is this shouldn't be a full-length movie, but a documentary explaining everything about the air canada "gimbli glider" incident a.k.a "freefall" right down to the safety precautions.<br /><br />my third and final gripe is with all airline films of this caliber(with the exception of fearless) why the hell did the male steward instruct the passengers to remove there shoes? (i could understand high heels and sharp, loose objects, but c'mon!)like that's gonna' make them any more f#*king safer than they are now! this plane if they(the passengers) didn't know any better: knew they were going to crash land. why would you force 100 injured people down a rubber slide that can cause skin to peel and bleed on impact only to walk in their stocking feet on a debris field! does this make any sense to anyone?<br /><br />fearless and the hit abc series "lost" had more depth and realism to air disaster than just "plane malfunctions-people panic-stewards become assholes-plane lands without wheels in a field-people wander without shoes and jackets, etc. the same old crap from airport 1975! freefall was so typical of a air-crash movie that i almost expect to see either charlton heston or peter graves burst into the damn passenger cabin at any moment. could we at least see how these poorly-acted characters go back to normalcy instead of people rejoicing amidst the impending tragedy that is staring in front of them? typical moronic lifetime movie! cheap and stupid! <br /><br />the director of "freefall" should stick to cheap made-for-tv movies with white middle-aged women with stupid teenage kids who do drugs and have marital problems. as for suspense...leave it to the professionals...you hack! why should we the audience sit through over an hour and a half of this airport wannabe rehash. i hope to god they don't make plane crash movies like this anymore. if this were like the abc series "lost" then it would be something to watch. but this is utter crap and then some. stop turning every plane disaster movie into "airport 1975"! this is not "airport" this is cheap pathetic waste of my time. i would not recommend this movie or any made-for-tv air disaster movie to anyone not even my worst enemies.
