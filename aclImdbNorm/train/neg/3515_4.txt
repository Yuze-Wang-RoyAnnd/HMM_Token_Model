basically a typical propaganda film for the last good war. but there were a couple things that struck me. first was the use of mouthed epithets. in two cases the scott character mouths one, once at the beginning when he drops his bomb off target during the bomb-off ("dammit") and once when he is trying to sway a bombardier into being a pilot ("s*%t"). i could be wrong about the second instance but i replayed it several times and that's what it looks like to me. the third case is when the anne shirley character wishes the o'brien character goodbye and good luck ("give 'em hell") over the roar of the engines. she must have thought that was too unladylike because she clearly says "heck". i also found interesting the character that has moral problems with bombing, specifically bombing civilians. the avuncular superior officer assures him that only military targets will be hit due to the precision of the bombsight used. given what we know about the lemay's later strategy of firebombing japanese cities into oblivion this scene plays with not a little irony. i remember mcnamara's quoting of lemay in "the fog of war", something to the effect that if the us did not win the conflict he would be tried as a war criminal. the ending is way overwrought, in keeping with the movie. it reminded me a bit of the end of white heat (i'm not comparing the films, just the ending!). maybe it's just 'cause he gets blowed up. blowed up real good!!!
