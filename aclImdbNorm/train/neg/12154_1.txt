you know how everyone jokes about the acting in porno movies? well if you've always found the plot line of a porn to captivate your interest, then this movie is for you. it truly was like a porn without the sex. or if that analogy is not to your liking, imagine you and your drunk roommate found a movie camera abandoned on a park bench. this is the movie that you would make. -horrible acting -bad camera work -music done on a casio keyboard this movie has it all, and more. for those who are masochists in the crowd, this is a premiere piece for your collection. <br /><br />all i can figure is that the only people to submit reviews for this dripping pile of movie, were people who 'starred' in it. <br /><br />their movie career is over before it started.
