this is a direct sequel to 'the mummy's hand' (1940), because the lead character, stephen banning (played by dick foran) is now thirty years older and is relating the story (with the help of archival footage) to his son's fianc'e. there are only two unusual aspects to the film: the early death of banning, and the presence of turhan bey.<br /><br />lon chaney as the mummy kharis gets top billing, though given the nature of his role, he has little more to do than limp along or thrash his arms about. there's nothing scary about his presence, except for his attempt to carry off the fianc'e, isobel (elyse knox). dick foran gets second billing, but he's killed off within the first fifteen minutes! we'd have to wait until 'psycho' (1960) when a lead character (janet leigh) dies way before the end of the movie! banning's buddy from the first film, babe jenson (now henson), shows up a little later looking much, much, older and not doing any of the comic shtick he did in the original. it's hard to believe it's the same actor! unfortunately, this great acting job is wasted because he gets killed by kharis after only two brief scenes. it's then left up to banning's son john (played by bit player john hubbard) to led the chase to the cemetery--no! the sheriff leads a torch wielding mob to banning's house to burn it down and kill the mummy. sound universally familiar? <br /><br />turhan bey is introduced to audiences as the new high priest, mehmet bey, to care for and feed tana leaves to kharis. with his 'exotic' voice and appearance, it's too bad he gets so easily killed. a better movie would have had 'babe' take von helsing type charge of things in tracking down the mummy, with a final decisive battle with him and mehmet bay. but instead we have a pedestrian rehash of different set pieces from previous universal horror films, put together by the hack griffin jay who wrote many of universal's other clunkers, although he also did 'don winslow of the navy' (1942) as well as 'don winslow of the coast guard' (1943) which also featured elyse knox.<br /><br />elyse knox played anne howe in six joe palooka movies (1946-1949), and of course, turhan bey, with 43 movie and tv credits, is great in the title role of 'the amazing dr. x' (1948).<br /><br />the cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric (with lots of noirish shadows in the sheriff's office) than the first 'kharis' mummy film, but there's little else of interest or excitement.<br /><br />i'll give it a 3.
