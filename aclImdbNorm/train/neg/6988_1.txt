i was so eager to see this one of my favorite tv shows.i saw universal trademark followed with a newly acquainted title and theme song which still impress me.computer animation on some scenery like a solid title name"the jetsons" or a dimension view of a spaceship approaching an amusement park and more made this version splendid and fantastic.shortly after that till the end...i couldn't believe my eyes!!!!how lucky i was that i could forget all i had seen.just songs by tiffany and its theme song in new arrangement were in my head.anyway,i wish to see this space-aged family (also the flintstones and yogi bear) in all graphic computer design as toy story or bug's life.the best style for hanna-barbera's in my opinion.
