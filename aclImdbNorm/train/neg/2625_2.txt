this film is horribly acted, written, directed and produced. but it's so campy it's actually semi-watchable. that's semi watchable.<br /><br />the storyline (what little there is) makes virtually no sense whatsoever. the barney drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie and that gets tired after about 30 seconds. <br /><br />many of the canadian supporting cast can be found in tv commercials.. none of them went on to anything else that i'm aware of. and of course sly stallone's even less talented brother well..... =\<br /><br />trivia: it was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of claremont, ont. (about 20 miles n.east of toronto) i recognized many local landmarks/intersections/buildings. i think the drive-in scene was filmed at the now demolished "oshawa drive-in" just before it was torn down.
