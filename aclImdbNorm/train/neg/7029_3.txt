phantom of the mall is a film that fits best in the "easily forgotten" category. it's a pretty lousy variant on the famous story by gaston leroux, the phantom of the opera. not a bad idea to itself, but the plot and production of this movie are way to weak to bring a decent homage to that story. on the bright side, gaston leroux doesn't has to turn over in his grave just yet. it could have been a lot worse. <br /><br />phantom of the mall has too many useless flashbacks in it and way too many boring sequences to make it memorable. also, the scriptwriters wanted to give too much draught to the story than necessary. and even though there's a lot of mystery getting build up about the character of eric ... the basic plot is ordinary and d'ej`a-vu. ***spoilers*** it's about a young couple that brutally gets torn apart because the boy gets killed in a fire. that fire was set to his house because he and his parents refused to sell their home in order to make room for a huge mall to be build. the boy survived the fire and he has hidden himself in the mall to avenge himself. meanwhile he guards his girl who now works in the mall and tries to forget her loss ****end spoilers*** this pretty simple - but rather effective - plot gets thickened by lots of pointless elements and annoying conspiracy theories. while it should just be an entertaining horror movie, it desperately tries to be an intelligent thriller...and that's not what the fans look for. there are a few innovative killings but they're not satisfying enough for people who want to see a relaxing horror movie. and besides, phantom of the mall could have used at least a bit of humor!! this entire production - the cast included - takes itself way too serious. <br /><br />i'll try to finish with a few positive aspects...like for example, it stars ken foree !! die-hard horror fans will certainly recognize him as peter for dawn of the dead! that's like the horror milestone that yet has to find an equal. even though his role in this movie is limited and even completely unnecessary...it was good to see him again. tv-movie fans will also recognize morgan fairchild as the mayor, she's a fine actress and an elegant lady. pauly shore is also in this but i can't stand him...so my opinion about him may be a bit biased. and finally, a bit of praise for the leading actress named kari whitman. she's an extremely beautiful girl and she does have a bit of talent...too bad she never made it to the top. actually, this movie is her biggest achievement and that says enough about her career...
