for the love of god please don't see this movie! its a waste of time, the plot is predictable, as are the romantic scenes. trying to build too much with very little, this film and its evil predictable villain is just lame. the characters aren't developed, and most of the film is padded out with shots of rome, which is much more interesting than the actual film. to top all of that, the acting is a disgrace. i know everyone tries to find their niche, but this is truly a disaster. i can't believe that someone actually paid however many millions of pounds to put this film on screen. don't waste money or time on this film, go see your grandma or something worthwhile instead.
