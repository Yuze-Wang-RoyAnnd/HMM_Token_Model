this movie wasn't absolutely atrocious, but it was pretty bad. the acting actually was pretty good! jeffrey combs did a pretty darn good job as the mad scientist, which is sort of his specialty if you don't know such things :d. bill forsythe .. well, i'm not exactly sure why he was in this film. he's way too good for this kinda stuff, and his role wasn't exactly demanding. i rented this on the strength of those two leads, and i wasn't really disappointed. i mean, heck, it's a movie about a half man/half shark. it ain't shakespeare folks. other than the plot, which is full of holes, and the poor dialogue, i would like to note that the cinematography also left many things to be desired. there were shots were they were trying to look "cool", but it ended up obscuring the scene or just coming off plain cheezy. they also blew it many times when they had decent dialogue and cut away prematurely before the person could even deliver the line. it was pretty bad. but if you are a jeffrey combs fan, this one is worth checking out. he gives a great performance and does what he can with the character. forsythe ain't bad either, and either is the female lead. heck if i can remember her name though. bottom line, i wouldn't otherwise waste your time.
