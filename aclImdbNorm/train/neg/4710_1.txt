my brother is in love with this show, let's get this straight. i completely agree with the people who said it was copying off of dexter's lab and fairly odd parents. <br /><br />i've never really liked fairly odd parents, i mean, some things did make me laugh, but most of the time it's downright annoying and not cute at all. this is almost the same way i feel about johnny test. except, nothing makes me laugh on that show. the gags are so stupid and pointless, and to tell you the truth, maybe it's just me, but kids don't dress like that! yes, i do think johnny's hair is awesome, but c'mon!<br /><br />and dexter's lab, that used to be one of my favorite shows and i still don't mind watching it. which makes me disgusted and ashamed of johnny test making an absolute joke out of that wonderful show!<br /><br />one more thing. the. dog. is. so. annoying. he is more loud and obnoxious than johnny! and the gay accent? what the fudge! i hate the dog to death and i hope he dies, because that would be better for kids to see than listening and watching the obnoxious crap that goes on in that show, and picking up a gay accent.<br /><br />unless you want you eyeballs to burn into miraculous flames and your brain fried from this show, don't watch it!
