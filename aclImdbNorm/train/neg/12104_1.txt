bill maher's religulous is not an attack on organized religion. it's an attack on christianity and islam. apart from ridiculing a bunch of rabbis inventing warped machines to get around sabbath regulations, he really doesn't attack judaism and seems enraged when a rabbi actually challenges the existence of the state of israel. if bill maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he would realize that the very creation of israel in the palestinian territories is based on the so called 'holy books' of organized religion. this is evidence of his complete and utter lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film.<br /><br />i find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even all that intelligent. anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but what do you have to offer them in return? nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they're stupid. what makes him the "rational" person in the room? in a way it reflects how he really isn't and in the process ends up looking just as stupid as those people.<br /><br />if you want to watch a good movie/documentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization, watch richard dawkins' 'root of all evil?'. it is a brilliantly researched documentary, clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how.<br /><br />bill maher's religulous is not funny, poses no interesting questions nor does it provide any insight on so controversial a topic. it seems to be the rantings and ravings of an old man disgruntled with his catholic upbringing. i almost feel sorry for him.
