given the history of the director of this movie, it is hard to believe that this was such a painfully bad movie to sit through. i was at the european premiere last night and one of the executive producers was there. he was yet to see the movie and, boy, was he in for a surprise. i have not read the book that this is based upon, nor do i know if it highly rated or appreciated, but i have read "captain correlli's mandolin" and given how poorly that was adapted for screen and how bad this movie was, i can only presume that something similar has happened here. the acting wasn't bad albeit that there were a couple-too-many raised eyebrows from farrell. honestly, i can't believed how little i cared for any character in this movie. situations play out on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness. donald sutherland's part comprises a few scenes where he opens a door, says something and closes it again. i kept looking at my watch when i wasn't cringing at the dialogue on the screen. i have never walked out on a movie but i was tempted to start during this. i gave this movie a score of '2' for reasons which seem horrendously shallow to me but these are the best things that i can say about this movie. the first is that i really enjoyed the all-too-short earthquake scene and the second is that salma hayek got naked and looked beautiful. i can say little else positive about this movie. don't ask the dust anything, it can't talk!
