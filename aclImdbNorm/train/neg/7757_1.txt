i have a piece of advice for the people who made this movie too, if you're gonna make a movie like this be sure you got the f/x to back it up. also don't get a bunch of z list actors to play in it. another thing, just about all of us have seen jurassic park, so don't blatantly copy it. all in all this movie sucked, f/x sucked, acting sucked, story unoriginal. let's talk about the acting for just a second, the carradine guy who's career peaked in 1984 when he did "revenge of the nerds" (which was actually a great comedy). he's not exactly z list, he can act. he just should have said no to this s--t bag. he should have did what mark hamill did after "return of the jedi" and go quietly into the night. he made his mark as a "nerd" and that should have been that. i understand he has bills to pay, but that hardly excuses this s--t bag. have i called this movie that yet? o.k. i just wanted to be sure. if i sound a little hostile, i apologize. i just wasted 2hrs of my life i could have spent doing something productive like watching paint peel, and i feel cheated. i'll close on that note. thank you for your time.
