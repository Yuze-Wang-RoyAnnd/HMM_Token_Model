***light spoiler alert*** the story sounds good and if you've read the novel, then you're probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships.<br /><br />true enough, the script tries to do that, the director tries to do that, but the main cast fails miserably. maria's acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever, her most intense moments seem almost comical. sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera. her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriend.<br /><br />ioana seems even more tense than maria and even worse, she doesn't seem natural at all. maria had the attitude, even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious, but she had it and her character received some credibility. and to make matters worse, we don't have an insight on her: where does she come from, how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship evolve? we only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to 'be' there: it has a content and and end, but no beginning. just like her partner maria, she has only once scene that is truly touching, the scene where she dumps maria's character kiki.<br /><br />tudor is the only person in this movie (aside from the landlady, great acting there) who manages to prove some acting talent. he has his character's attitude and it fits him. only once or twice he seems to falter (the scene at his parents' meal, he tries to be obvious when it wasn't necessary at all).<br /><br />i love the story, tudor chirila is ok there, the landlady actually acts and puya delivers his couple of lines with style, but this doesn't save the movie. too bad, the entire setting had huge potential and the romanian cinematography could've used a movie on this theme.<br /><br />oddly enough, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no-background no-feeling (well, maria's spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction) lesbian relationship of maria and ioana. i'm quite sorry for spending money on a ticket, i'd rather had watched it from the comfort of my room.
