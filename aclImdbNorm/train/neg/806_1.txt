this has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with ketchup, and the overall aftertaste is just as disgusting. <br /><br />will be used in the 9th circle of hell at recreation time. just plain torture.<br /><br />i would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than watch this appalling drivel again - ever. horrible. horrible. horrible.<br /><br />you know, the good thing about swiss cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese: here it's only holes - and the excitement factor? well that turns watching paint dry into an adrenalin rush and an olympic speed sport.<br /><br />my brain hurts from trying to work out who ok'd this drivel, did they think about the premise? (i sincerely hope not, otherwise there is no redemption) the only consolation is they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes. made for tv should not be a synonym for: "sure, let the horses bowels run loose across the living rooms! our audience are idiots!"<br /><br />i was hooked just to know how it could get any worse. this is not a good sign, folks. <br /><br />hallmark should be ashamed for releasing it.<br /><br />i should be ashamed for watching it.<br /><br />i am ashamed. i'm off for a long shower.
