this is absolutely the worst movie i've seen all year.<br /><br />first, i will say that the acting was very good, and by all of the cast.<br /><br />this was apparently meant to be very offbeat, and in that regard it succeeded. by the same token, the story revolves around a self-centered wannabe, who is a clueless, talentless chronic liar, whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers.<br /><br />this was worse than watching a car wreck.
