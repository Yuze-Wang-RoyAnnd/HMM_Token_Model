plot synopsis: when his wife, a news reporter, is kidnapped & replaced with an android double, secret service agent eric phillips tracks her down & uncovers a plan by an arms dealer to create an army of invincible androids to assassinate world leaders.<br /><br />i wasn't expecting much when i first saw this sequel to richard pepin's low-budget sci-fi / action hybrid "cyber tracker". that film was nothing special, not to mention a blatant rip-off of both "the terminator" & "robocop". this sequel is the same as before, with an all-out action sequence opening the film. there are plenty of explosions, heavy gunfire & a huge bodycount, as well as some martial-arts moves courtesy of the film's star, don "the dragon" wilson. the whole film seems like a series of action scenes strung together with minimal plot. on the acting front, wilson is a bad actor. he really needs a personality transplant.
