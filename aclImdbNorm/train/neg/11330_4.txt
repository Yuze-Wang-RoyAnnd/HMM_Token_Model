"giant" is one of the most boring, overly-long hollywood contraptions ever. many scenes seem utterly fake and without energy. rock hudson, elizabeth taylor, and james dean are wasted in this big hollywood production. a central notion to this movie, that a rancher would ever resist drilling for oil on his land, is absurd, and i know this because i'm from houston. a couple of scenes, especially dean serving taylor coffee, redeem this otherwise boring film. for a much more accurate and interesting depiction about how modernism changed the ranches in texas, see "hud" (one of paul newman's great performances) or "the last picture show."
