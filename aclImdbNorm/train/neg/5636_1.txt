this movie was the worst i've ever seen.<br /><br />it doesn't seem to have a plot but the time you realize this is far beyond the beginning of the movie so you have to watch the shut for a long time to recognize the total incompetence of the director, aka the sloth that plays the tampon chick in the movie, and we do not believe the willem dafoe in this movie, he's a clone, because the real dafoe, like we know from "apocalypse now" and "the boon dock saints", would never agreed to such a script.<br /><br />duh, (da)foe wrote this bill shut together with his twenty years minus baby. this movie starts with the credits of the two main characters, dafoe and colagrande, and then the two script writers, dafoe and colagrande, and then the director, colagrande.<br /><br />bottomline (the story); widow meets guy, guy bangs widow, widow smashes windscreen with guy who banged her.<br /><br />title in netherlands; the black widow (different title, same bullshit).<br /><br />do not watch this movie!!! it's a total waist of time!!!
