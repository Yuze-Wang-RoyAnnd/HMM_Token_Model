this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it's extremely boring with lots of boring dialog and has some very annoying characters and a laughable looking creature. the only reason i watched this piece of garbage is because it was on that 8 disc horror set i got. the plot is preposterous and totally stupid as is the finale. no blood what so ever except a few bloody marks on the creature, and a couple of bloody gunshot wounds. the acting is terrible!!. richard cardella is terrible as the sheriff and was quite laughable plus his character is annoying. glen roberts is the comic relief and was not funny at all!. mark siegel is extremely annoying and was also not funny!. bob hyman is decent but not much more then that. richard garrison is annoying and had no chemistry with kacey cobb what so ever. kacey cobb is so so here and had no chemistry with richard. overall avoid this piece of garbage at all costs! bomb out of 5.
