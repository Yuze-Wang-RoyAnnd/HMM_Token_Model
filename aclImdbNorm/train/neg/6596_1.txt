this is the kind of film one watches in gape-jawed, horrified silence, and yet continues to watch, mesmerized, as if watching a train wreck in slow motion. and yet, in the back of your mind, thoughts are churning: "who on earth green-lighted this garbage?"<br /><br />some of the preceding user comments say things like, "a good way to introduce children to laurel and hardy" -- an insult to children everywhere. that children would need some sort of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy shows a profound misunderstanding of the nature of children the world over. others have commented on the faithfulness of the two stars' characterizations of laurel and hardy to which i would respond: so what? one would think that the rash of movie bombs based on beloved series (rocky and bullwinkle, avengers, flipper, mod squad, ad nauseam) would have taught hollywood that there are some things that simply can't be recreated. the films of laurel and hardy are readily available on video: why bother with this?<br /><br />as for f. murray abraham, a fine actor of stage and screen... well, all i can say is, he must have been in trouble with the irs.<br /><br />run, don't walk, away from the television if this trash comes on!
