from the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful 'cruel intentions', and how flat it landed. you'll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting robin dunne as valmont... then in the second scene, you meet the two best things in this movie, amy adams and mimi rogers as kathryn and her mother. that is, if you can get past the fact that kathryn wasn't blonde in the first film... then the movie goes on, you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago, and you notice sebastian has already met an anette in the past, here called danielle, and a cecile, here called cherie... how original is that for a prequel. then it turns into a low budget 'wild things' type of film with lots and lots of oh-my "twists". as i mentioned, robin dunne was a very bad choice. not that he is a bad actor, he's good.. he just doesn't have the charisma ryan did. amy adams, who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time, once again delivers. but with all the talent in the world, there is no way one could save this trash. as a whole, this "movie" feels like a 'beverly hills, 90210' episode. the score has been stolen from 'cruel intentions' and 'jawbreaker'... yes, they used the score from jawbreaker... couldn't they at least leave that one alone?! you'll want to pass this one. if you want more cruel intentions, watch stephen frears' dangerous liaisons.
