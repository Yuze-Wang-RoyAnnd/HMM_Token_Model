i entered the theatre intending to pass a pleasant 90 minutes being entertained if not enlightened. i left neither entertained nor enlightened. this movie can't make up its mind what it wants to be and ends up being not much of anything. there are a few funny lines and a few incredibly pretentious movie references (the 400 blows--for this character? come off it!). while none of the characters gets treated with much respect, the over thirty gay men get the worst of it: all predatory, fat, sad, slobs. if you're in the mood for a movie dealing with gay relationships check out parting glances, longtime companion, trick, all over the guy, red dirt, maurice, philadelphia instead. you'll thank me.<br /><br />
