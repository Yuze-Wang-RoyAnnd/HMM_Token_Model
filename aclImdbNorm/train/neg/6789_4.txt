the plot of this movie hangs on one important point: that this murderer was also a responsible, loving, caring father. not that being a father and a murderer is impossible. but this man is shown murdering a teenage girl without provocation or reason and without emotion. this girl was someone's daughter. i don't think a father who cared so much about his own daughter could have been so cold-blooded to someone else's daughter. or, alternately, could have been so cold blooded and yet worry about and care for his own daughter. and the idea that a convicted murderer would actually ask his victim's parents to take in and care for his daughter is beyond belief.<br /><br />that said, the characters were acted with conviction by the actors. i thought changing scott bakula's eye color did make him seem more cold and menacing than he usually is. you couldn't see into his eyes at all.
