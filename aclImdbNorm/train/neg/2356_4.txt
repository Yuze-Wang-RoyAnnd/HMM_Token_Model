the film was made in 1942 and with world war 11 around, the movie industry decided to capitalize on the fact that spies were around.<br /><br />the film is fun to watch due to the fabulous dancing of eleanor powell. the late miss powell was certainly a great hoofer in every sense of the word. she is again paired with a very young looking red skelton here. the two of them also starred in "i dood it."<br /><br />moroni olsen, who 3 years later, was superb as the interrogating police officer in "mildred pierce" again appears as an officer asking powell to deliver an item. trouble is that olsen and his rogues are really the japanese spies.<br /><br />bert lahr is his usual brilliant self here and he gets ample support from virginia o'brien.
