i very much looked forward to this movie. its a good family movie; however, if michael landon jr.'s editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. too many scenes out of context. i do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. but, if another one is made, i beg them to take better care at editing. this story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. i enjoy the story of willie and missy; they're both great role models. plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.
