for domestic audiences i can see how they would applaud this movie. for outsiders, with no vested interests, it did not make much sense. the germans were portrayed as incompetents and the russians as heroes. the supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction. how a young woman could 'love' the lieutenant from just glimpsing him was nonsense. how she could, as mentioned at the end of the movie, never marry just because of this infatuation was beyond me. i mentioned the germans were portrayed as idiots and that was exemplified in the chase into the marsh. several hundred german troops advanced, pushing the russians into the marsh. so the russians hid and the germans stopped at the edge of the marsh and just stood there listening. i suppose they did not want to get their boots wet, but i am sure an officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men into the water to search the marsh. but that would have ended the story. also, the germans entered the barn where the russians were hiding in the loft and did not bother to fire into the roof. at the worst some soldier would have tossed a grenade into the loft and not climbed a ladder to peer in.<br /><br />i did see some reviewers who said they cried at the end. i wonder why? you knew this small band would perish and they was nothing heart-tugging in that.
