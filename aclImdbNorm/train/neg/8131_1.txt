unless the title is supposed to be some kind of spoiler for the wife's transformation (the fiends! ruining it for us). anycase, if this movie wasn't made-for-tv, it should have been, it's so remarkably low-budget, underscripted, underacted, and hits every 70's cliche except disco. nobody is likeable, and you could careless what happens to anyone in this one. eminently forgetable except for the bad, bad performances.
