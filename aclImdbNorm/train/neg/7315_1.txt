ok let's get right to the point. we have five recent college grads (must have majored in the f word) going out on a weekend camping trip. they run into someone who is in need of help, but instead of trying to assist him, they decide to set him on fire instead. nice bunch of people. next some of them start go get sick - must be something in the water at the cabin they are staying at. however the neighbors seem to be ok. oh well, when things start getting really bad, they lock up one their companions instead of getting help (try the neighbor by the way). some locals don't take a liking to them. they chase one on a high speed romp through the woods for many miles, until the truck breaks down. somehow ten minutes later he shows up at the cabin (how he could find it and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery). another of the brain surgeon type at the cabin realizes something is amiss so he hides out in a cave to let this blow over. he then decides the next day to return to the cabin believing it must be some type of shrine. he is giddy with relief that he survived (he must have thought it was a 24 hour bug). unfortuneatley he is met by some not so friendly police officers. another couple decide to have sex while the flesh eating bug is working its magic, and then the women realizes she needs to shave her legs (taking a lot of the diseased skin with shaving cream). anyway you get the idea. nothing makes sense here. these are five people i would not want to be friends with. i was rooting for the flesh eating bacteria. other characters were introduced who were also somewhat amusing but utterly unlikeable as well. ninety minutes of good life wasted here.
