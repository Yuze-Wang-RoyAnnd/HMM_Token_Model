while the 3-d animation (the highlight of the show) did it's job well, most other elements fell flat. it was as though the filmmakers thought "well, it's gonna be 3-d so we don't have to work that hard on the plot or character development." and the fact that it's a children's movie is absolutely no excuse. the public is drawn to three dimensional characters (shrek, nemo's dad) just as much as they are drawn to three dimensional graphics. the only dimension any of the main characters showed was two dimensional scooter who twists the plot from time to time with his compulsion to eat everything in sight.<br /><br />and the absolute kicker? buzz aldrin's appearance at the very end (after watching a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and half) comes on the screen and ruins everyone's good time by calling the film's main characters "contaminants" and announcing that the situation put forth on screen was actually an impossibility.<br /><br />???!!!??? did you just wanna tell the kids the easter bunny and santa claus don't exist while you're at it?
