this show proved to be a waste of 30 minutes of precious dvr hard drive space. i didn't expect much and i actually received less. not only do i expect this show to be canceled by the second episode, i cannot believe that geico will ever attempt to use the cavemen ad campaign ever again. i would have preferred spending a night checking my daughter's hair for head lice than watching this piece of refuse. i wonder what abc passed on to make this show fit into the '07 fall schedual, perhaps a hospital/crime/mocumentary reality show featuring the aflac duck? in the event that i failed to express my opinion about this show let me be clear and say that it is not too good.
