as a mystery science theatre 3000 fan, i can withstand any motion picture that can be foisted upon me, but there is absolutely no reason for this.<br /><br />rated "super action" in the blockbuster video section and given the dreaded "restricted viewing sticker" i'm assuming these are the only methods that film maker (ha!) robert napton could use to get at least 4.50 from one unsuspecting person.<br /><br />shame on you robert napton! shame on you for exploiting these poor mexican actors who you probably promised hopes for making it big in american cinema. you are a disgrace!<br /><br />there isn't one moment in this movie that holds the slightest bit of action. did you use snot on these people? oh, look, they're having a rave in a field! like all 6 of them. and isn't that an asian guy in the background? why is it always daytime? why did it take 1/2 of the movie to show anything.. and more importantly why did we watch the other 1/2?<br /><br />ps: you owe me 4.50.
