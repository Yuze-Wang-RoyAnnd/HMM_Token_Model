the idea of making a miniseries about the berlin airlift seemed to me as one of the more interesting german (post)war movies. it is a theme that has not been explored much as yet. however, the makers of this series stuffed it with clich'es. it starts already with the dvd cover of the movie, which is a direct copy of the cover of 'pearl harbor'.<br /><br />luise kielberg (bettina zimmermann) gets to hear that her husband, who is a doctor, (ulrich noethen) has died in russia and after the war she's struggling to survive. she finds a job at the american base, gets to work for the coolest and highest ranking officer (heino ferch) in town, falls in love with 'm, gets pregnant, and all of a sudden her husband turns up again. come on!!! we've seen this once too often. heino ferch and ulrich noethen play their role quite well; bettina zimmermann however never really seems to convince. for some reason it always seems she's somewhat too late in giving the right emotional reaction to the scenes. it just didn't work for me.<br /><br />the action scenes with the planes and the air lift, we're sometimes exciting, more often not. nasty things always seemed to happen to the same pilot.<br /><br />unless you're a big fan of wwii movies, i suggest you spend your money on something else: chocolate ice-cream brings a lot more satisfaction!<br /><br />4 out 10!
