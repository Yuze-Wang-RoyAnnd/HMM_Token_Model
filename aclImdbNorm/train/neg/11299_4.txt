the mummy's tomb starts with a review of the events in the mummy's hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the united states of america where the current high priest and the mummy kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the past.<br /><br />while i absolutely loved "the mummy" with boris karloff as the mummy imhotep, and quite liked "the mummy's hand" with tom tyler as kharis (which is the direct prequel to this film), i was not as taken with "the mummy's tomb".<br /><br />it is made in a similar style as the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting. lon chaney jr is okay as kharis, but doesn't really stand out. and i guess that's my main criticism of this movie-that nothing really stands out. there's nothing really terrible here, but nothing really outstanding either, so the viewer is left with a rather bland mummy's tale.
