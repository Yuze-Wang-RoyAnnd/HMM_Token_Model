if i could have rated this movie by 0 i would have ! i see some ppl at imdb says that this is the funniest movie of the year , etc etc excuse me ? are you ppl snorting lsd or ........? there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie n o t h i n g ! i actually want my 27 minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap. <br /><br />i read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes , i totally understand that , i actually would have watched snakes on a plane for 2 times over instead of watching this movie once ! <br /><br />do not watch this movie , do something else useful with your life do the dishes , walk the dog , hell... anything is better than spending time in front of the tv watching hot rod.
