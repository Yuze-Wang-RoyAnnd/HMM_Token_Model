my nose is bent slightly out of shape as i write this. i had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared, so i assume it was rejected, even though it met all the usual guidelines.<br /><br />i found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes, particularly the performance of jordi moll`a, a veteran actor who has appeared in such major productions as "blow" and "the alamo." leonor watling is also quite good. unfortunately, everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful, melodramatic script. there is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative or lend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of art.<br /><br />an actual day trip to the beach at valencia would be much less arduous than having to encounter these fictional characters again anywhere, anytime.
