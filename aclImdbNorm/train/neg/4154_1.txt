vampires vs. zombies wasn't the original title. it was actually... <br /><br />nasty lesbian semi-vampires and two zombies getting hit by cars: special guest appearances by bob the lesbian gypsie-witch and her dog, random woman with special powers and the catholic school girl short skirt zombie choir. <br /><br />also on the box: warning: no plot- only the writer and director will understand the end, or anything else in this movie.<br /><br />seriously though, i love bad movies. i love vampires. i love zombies. hell, i even enjoy the lesbians. this movie combined all three with a vague and confusing (or non-existent) plot, horrendous (i mean really bad) dialogue, and random stuff and people that have nothing to do with anything (or do they... i didn't know what in the world was going on). oh, and i can't forget the green oatmeal 'zombies' in latex gloves (yes, the film makers were so cheap they couldn't even cover their zombies hands in oatmeal and paint). any way, the result was this excruciatingly bad film, if you could even call it that. <br /><br />was the end supposed to not make sense? the vampire was really nurse and the other girl was really a mental patient? where were the vampires vs. zombies? hell, where were the vampires at all... you really couldn't call any of the girls vampires. whatever. <br /><br />don't ever rent or buy this movie. if you are really curious... okay, i'll understand. seriously, even lovers of bad movies won't be able to stand this one. it should be number 1 on the bottom 100.
