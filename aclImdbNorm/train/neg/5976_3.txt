the rumor is true: girls like coyote ugly more than guys. and the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given. jersey girl goes to new york to become a song writer. and after initial frustration of having no luck, overhears some girls partying about the $300 each they made last night. she gets an audition at the bar they work at and surprise! the place is completely full of "two year old toddlers" bursting at the sight of babes dancing.<br /><br />the story is not bad and some characters are likeable, especially cammie (the "fashion coordinator" part was cute) and the bouncer but let's face it, the drama was horrible and completely laughable from the beginning. violet and her father looked far too ridiculous while they were relating throughout the movie. and check out violet too jamming on that keyboard with the break dancer!<br /><br />for the first time i could think of, how could the production be so terrible? for a brief moment with this movie, hollywood could stand on its two feet and show a new low without any major public outcry without saying, "you were warned!" instead, it seems coyote ugly has a purposeful intent on trying to kiss every major rear in the world. advertising babes in a bar, but showing a paper thin "pursue your dream" story disappointed every male teen you targeted!<br /><br />and finally, the music. there was absolutely no break of music i found in this movie, especially when it was needed (the hospital scene). every scene felt like some short music video you just wish would stop until the bar opened. but the climax was an ultimate laugher: an '80s like song you would expect cyndi lauper to jump on the stage and jam with violet. heck, i personally thought bon jovi was going to jump out with the long hair and jam too!<br /><br />other than some really smart camera work with the coyote girls when dancing (especially the wet scene), and a couple cute cliches, coyote ugly is something to be purely embarrassed about. whether you watched or made it, it looked like nothing but time killing. or wasting depending on how you look at it.
