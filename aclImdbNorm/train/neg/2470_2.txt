i've seen many horror shows over the years, like nightstalker, that dealt with the wendigo legend, so i was looking forward to an angry spirit causing mayhem to add flavor to the halloween season. man was i mistaken. the whole movie creates this sense of events about to happen that will be scary and creepy, but then delivers a very simplistic tale of revenge and murder over the loss of some property. ve-ery scary - not! this movie has a lot in common with cold creek manor, another total loser.<br /><br />it's getting harder and harder to believe anything hollywood puts forward about scary movies, since they rarely come through with anything original and spooky anymore. what idiots pay for such a bogus movie to be made? go back to the drawing board fellas, and do something useful with those millions of greenbacks you have to throw around.
