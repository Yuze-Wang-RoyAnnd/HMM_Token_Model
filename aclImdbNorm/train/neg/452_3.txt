i watched this movie for a project on love. please tell nicolas cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character, and then re-read the lines he's saying. my life cannot go on... i accidentally cut off my own hand...my brother was close by. obviously his fault. and since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of mom sad and alone. no closure, bad script, and doesn't have enough extension of minor characters. save yourself, unless your up for a good laugh. costumes were done appropriately, and extras did a fabulous job. i'm sure it would have been a fun movie to make, but keep it more genre specific, i can't recommend this movie to anyone i know, because it is not an intellectual movie. it is not a chick flick. it is not a strict romantic. and i can't show kids because of the sex and questions to follow. all in all, just not a good flick.
