a major disappointment. this was one of the best uk crime drama / detective shows from the 90's which developed the fascinating title character played by scotland's robbie coltrane. however this one-off has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectations when a favored show returns after a long hiatus. coltrane isn't really given much to do, much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer, and in what he has to act in, he seems uninvolved, almost bored. the ex-soldier's story is written by the books and the attempt to update us on coltrane's family life seems lightweight. perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one two-hour show they would have written this with much more depth. as is, skip this and watch the old cracker from the 90's which is far far superior.
