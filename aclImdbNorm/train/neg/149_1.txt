well, you know the rest! this has to be the worst movie i've seen in a long long time. i can only imagine that stephanie beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role.<br /><br />the lead role is played by (to me) a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey.<br /><br />bruce lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques. this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts, however, even this can't disguise the fact that the lady doesn't know how to throw a punch. an average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showing.<br /><br />sorry, the only mystery on show here is how this didn't win the golden raspberry for its year.
