in my lit. class we've just finished the book, hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book. (1) brian never ate worms in the book. (2) he didn't know the pilot's name. (3) his mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see. (4) the man the mother is cheating with doesn't have black hair, he has blonde. <br /><br />now for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) a thirteen year old can't punch his fist through a window in one punch. <br /><br />and for the acting, the kid who played brian was a horrible actor. <br /><br />however, i do believe that the scenery was impressive, though i highly doubt the director even read the book.<br /><br />this movie is good if you have not read the book hatchet, by gary paulsen, but if you have, then begin a complaint letter to the director.
