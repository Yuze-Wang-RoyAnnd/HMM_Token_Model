i thought i was going to watch a scary movie.. and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie. in the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf i thought they was kidding. todays computer games have ten times better animations. low budget, is a fitting comment. i would recommend wolf (1994) with jack nicholson for a good werewolf movie. it has good special effects as they should be (human transforming to werewolf). unless you wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this movie. this movie is a joke.
