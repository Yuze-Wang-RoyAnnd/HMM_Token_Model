if you like occasional nudity with junior high school level slap stick comedy, then look no further.<br /><br />starting at about the halfway point, the beautiful and erotic arielle dombasle starts disrobing at every opportunity. that is the only thing that made this movie worth watching.<br /><br />the story is both lame and preposterous, the humor is corny, and character development is basically non-existent.
