i don't even know where to begin on this one. "it's all about the family." that has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a "horror" movie, although this couldn't be a horror movie even if it tried!!! ugh!!! and i know that owen wilson is a better actor. he needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie (anaconda, armageddon). after all, the man did co-write "bottle rocket" and "rushmore." he does have some talent. also, lily taylor should stick to indie films. she has no place here. finally, catherine zeta-jones should become a porn star. there's no room in legitimate acting for her. i'm serious. one of the worst movies i've ever seen, ever.
