i couldn't wait to see this movie. about half way through the movie, i couldn't wait for it to end. all of the (white) actors were delivering their lines like woody allen had just said, "say it like this..." then they said their lines on screen like they were trying to imitate woody allen. it was so annoying. we all know how will ferrell really talks, and he doesn't stumble over his words like mr. allen. the comedy portion of this film was just as boring as the tragedy and definitely never funny or even entertaining. i must admit that i have never been a major woody allen fan, and this movie definitely has not converted me. i think that his writing was just as bad as his direction. this movie will go down as one of the worst 10 movies i have ever seen.
