really, really bad. how does a film this bad get made? i kept waiting for some redeeming plot point, interesting camera work, or at least some gratuitous nudity but i got nothing. i had just watched cabin fever and i thought it was an train wreck (except for the nudity and pancakes) but it looks like genius compared to this dreck. the best script doctor in the world couldn't have saved this putrid pile of of stinking poo.<br /><br />the only thing going for this "film" is that it ended.<br /><br />i've got a headache just thinking about this movie and trying to write something. ugh! i'm glad i only paid $5 for it and it will soon end up in a landfill.
