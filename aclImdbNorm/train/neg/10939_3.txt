this movie has some of the worst acting that i have ever seen! some scenes are original such as the nails coming through the floor. this nail trap catches these bad guys. the rest of the movie degrades as you go. i can't believe that this movie is not even in the bottom 100 movies of all time. i also can't believe that there are sequels! the next crap movie that i want to watch is r.o.t.o.r. could r.o.t.o.r really be much worse than this?<br /><br />
