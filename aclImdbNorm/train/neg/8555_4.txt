this is a very old and cheaply made film--a typical low-budget b-western in so many ways. gary cooper was not yet a star and this film is highly reminiscent of the early films of john wayne that were done for "poverty row" studios. with both actors, their familiar style and persona were still not completely formed. this incarnation of gary cooper doesn't seem exactly like the cooper of just a few years later (he talks faster in this early film, among other things).<br /><br />however, unlike the average b-movie of the era, there are at least a few interesting elements that make the film unique (if not good). if you ever want to see the woman that was married to errol flynn for seven years, this is your chance. lili damita stars as the female love interest and this is a very, very odd casting choice, as she has a heavy accent (she was french) and wasn't even close to being "movie star pretty". incidentally, she was also married to director michael curtiz. <br /><br />but for me, the most memorable and weird aspect of the film is the seemingly gay subplot--sort of like a brokeback mountain from the 1930s (and we thought this was a new idea). gary cooper's character was raised by two men who hate women and do everything they can through much of the film to keep cooper clear of females. this misogyny alone doesn't necessarily mean much, but there are so many clues throughout the film that indicate the makers of the film really were trying to portray them as a gay couple. in particular, towards the end, when one of them is killed, the other is shot by an arrow and holds off dying long enough to crawl over to the body of his fallen friend and then falls--with his arms cradled around him! this was pretty edgy stuff for the time and i think this makes this dull film really fascinating today! as far as cooper and the plot go, the film is a bit of a disappointment and very skip-able. unless you are curious about damita or the homosexual undertones, do yourself a favor and find a better western.
