first of all there wasn't really anything in this movie that grabbed me really. it wasn't a bad movie, just another movie where i said "well, that wasn't anything special" after i'd seen it. there was probably drama and stuff, but it simply didn't grab me, but more seamed semi-dull. as i said in the headline it seamed very cheap in a way. the quality of the film itself (the images) seamed like a low quality and reminded me more of some cheap made for tv-movie than a well respected english film-maker. the camera angles and shots were very amateur like in my opinion. didn't really have any close up shots or similar effects to produce interesting scenes. i haven't seen many english films and the ones i've seen didn't really impress me more than this and they seamed kind of similar done with the camera work, colors and such. "game" tried to be more cool, hip & smart (see my review of "lola rennt" about this if you wish), but didn't succeed for me either. overall just a little indifferent movie that wasn't anything special (at best, i'm afraid) and basically unfortunately over two hours wasted.
