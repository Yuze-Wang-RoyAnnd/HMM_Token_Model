prior to this film, i had only seen two films by director andrea bianchi: the trashy zombie flick le notti del terrore (1981), famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man-child peter bark, and the enjoyably sleazy giallo strip nude for your killer. neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema, but both were entertaining in their own special way (and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didn't hurt). massacre, however, is dull, dull, dull, despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh.<br /><br />the story, about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot, is confusing and oh-so boring: when the blood isn't flowing and the skin isn't on show, the film is a real struggle to sit through (it took me four attempts to finish), with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of note.<br /><br />the only point of interest about the film is that its producer, lucio fulci, used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega-gory movie cat in the brain (aka nightmare concert). and if you've already seen that film, then there is very little reason to bother with massacre.
