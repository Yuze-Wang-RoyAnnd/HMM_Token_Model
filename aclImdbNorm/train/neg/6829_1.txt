i've written at least a half dozen scathing reviews of this abysmal little flick and none get published, so i must opine that someone at imdb.com really likes this awful movie. the idea that a bunch of oilmen can resurrect a military tank that has set in the desert for over a decade, and make a fighting machine of it again is ludicrous. so is the acting and direction. pass on it.
