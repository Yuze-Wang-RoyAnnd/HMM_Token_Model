this movie is incomprehendably bad. it begins with several random explosions and then cuts to a sock puppet of a t-rex that talks (!) to the audience. it goes back and forth between sock puppetry and animation throughout, probably because the film makers couldn't afford live actors. i'll spare you the long, tiresome, relentless plot that drags this pitiful film on for a brutal 85 minutes.<br /><br />one of my friends found this very rare video at a hobby shop somewhere that sells out of print b-movies, and he bought it for the sole purpose of making fun of it, but, as it turns out, our intervention was not neecessary. this film makes fun of itself better than we could.<br /><br />i thought that ed wood's "plan 9 from outer space" was the cheesiest movie in existence, but leave it to japanamation/lego cars/sock puppets to outdo him. if you see this movie anywhere, buy it without hesitation. it is very rare and worth many, many good laughs.
