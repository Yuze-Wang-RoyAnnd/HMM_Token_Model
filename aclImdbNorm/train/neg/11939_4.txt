let me tell you something about this movie. i have seen it twice. the first time i was a kid and the movie was quite entertaining to me. i really liked it. i thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was kind of cool.<br /><br />i saw it again a few days ago. it was horrible. really. i don't know why i thought it was funny before but now... i didn't laugh at all. there was nothing even slightly entertaining. it was just dumb. the story was weak. the acting was nothing special. there are great actors in this movie but still the acting is mediocre at best.<br /><br />what is the worst is the fact that this movie is racist. really. don't get me wrong, usually i don't complain about racism in movies. however i have seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like 'the shaolin temple' or about the fact that the only black man in 'the street fighter' is one of the bad guys or... whatever, you get the point. there are people seeing racism everywhere. i wonder how would they react to a movie like 'the meteor man'. why? i will tell you why. there are no asians in this movie. there are no white people among the good guys. in fact there is only one white guy in the entire movie and he is the leader of the bad guys. all the good guys are african americans. don't get me wrong, i don't care is the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green... what i do care about is the fact that we can barely see a white person in this movie. this is the only movie like that that i have ever seen. it is just not realistic. if there is only one black man in a japanese movie which is the case with 'the street fighter' there is no problem - in japan most of the people are asians. but if there is only one white man in an american movie there is some sort of problem - in usa most of the people are white. it is like filming a japanese movie with entirely white cast and only one asian as a bad guy. just not real.<br /><br />that is it. i am giving the movie the rate of 4/10. it would be 1/10 if i hadn't have fun with it as a kid.
