this budget-starved italian action/sci-fi hybrid features david warbeck as a miami reporter who is chosen by the ghosts of the people of atlantis (!) to stop an evil businessman (academy award nominee john ireland) from using a telepathic fetus grown using spores from an asteroid to rule the world. you got all that? despite such a loopy plot, this is actually quite a bore and the raiders of atlantis sneers at it with contempt. honestly, the most (intentionally) creative thing about this flick is the slight reworking of herbie hancock's beverly hills cop theme for the opening titles. the most unintentionally creative bit involves a scene in a lab that is inexplicably shown twice back-to-back. perhaps director alberto de martino wanted to get all avant garde on us in the twilight of his career? i was going to declare this ireland's worst film on his resume but then i saw satan's cheerleaders was listed on there. i would also like to safely declare that i am probably the only person in the history of the world to do a double feature of this and hitchcock's vertigo.
