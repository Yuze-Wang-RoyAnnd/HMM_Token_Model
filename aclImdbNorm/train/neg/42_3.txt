of the three titles from jess franco to find their way onto the official dpp video nasty list (devil hunter, bloody moon and women behind bars) this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety, being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore, a gratuitous rape scene, and loads of nudity.<br /><br />gorgeous blonde ursula buchfellner plays movie star laura crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the 'devil god' that lurks in the jungle (a big, naked, bulging-eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices).<br /><br />employed by laura's agent to deliver a $6million ransom, brave mercenary peter weston (al cliver) and his vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island, but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double-cross. during the confusion, laura escapes into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the island's natives, who offer her up to their god.<br /><br />franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks: crap gore, murky cinematography, rapid zooms, numerous crotch shots, out of focus imagery, awful sound effects, and ham-fisted editing. the result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish (it took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing), and even the sight of the luscious buchfellner in all of her natural glory ain't enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry.
