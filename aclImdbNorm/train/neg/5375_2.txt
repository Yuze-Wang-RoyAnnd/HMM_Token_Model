having just watched this movie, i almost feel like having wasted 2 hours of my life, but i guess there is some good in everything:<br /><br />if i was to rate this as any other movie, it can only receive 1 or 2 tops, but if i grade it like a low budget ind. movie, it may get 3 or 4. that is a movie is supposed to be 'complete' and without too long passages of boredom or waste of time. this movie isn't. but i guess a lot of independent movies are about showing movie skills, and considering this, this movie has a few highlights. if i am to comment on what the directors should take with them to their next project, i guess the distorted sound effects had some quality. they also manage to build some characters, this however takes me to what they should leave out in their next project, because the character building takes too long, since it is mostly irrelevant for the movie plot. neither should the long spaces of time dedicated to walking around be continued in the next project - whats the point? i guess this movie tries to be a little bit of everything (building characters, suspense and a plot), and ends up being nothing (not a lot)<br /><br />this movie tries too much and too hard, and i guess it should have been cut to a short film. i could easily manage to find one hour of walking around or pointless dialogue to cut from the movie.<br /><br />there is too much irrelevant things going on in this movie. the story should have been more streamlined. i know there is supposed to be some mystery in this movie, but a slight surprise to who the killer is, doesn't make a mystery. the story behind the "mystery" receives almost no attention during the film, which leaves the final "point" as a quick an unsatisfying wrap-up. <br /><br />therefore i would like to say this movie was a nice try, but i cant. i hope the directors learn from their mistakes, and produce a better product next time.<br /><br />if you don't have an interest in bench learning from producing low budget movies, there is no need to watch this - not even too see why everyone thinks its bad.<br /><br />as others have stated i am pretty sure the many 10's given to this movie are from people somehow involved in the movie. this movie could not receive a "10" judging from any remotely objective standpoint.
