this film sold for one-dollar at wal-mart on a dvd and so i do not feel like i lost anything for watching this film, except my time. enjoyed the acting of tom hanks, (robbie wheeling), who was very young looking and gave an outstanding performance considering it was a horrible script. the story is about college students who decided to play the game mazes & monsters, only in a very realistic setting. robbie wheeling has had problems in the past playing this game at other colleges and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good grades. robbie meets a very nice gal and has a romantic fling with her and once he starts playing the game, he stops making love to her and acts like a monk. there are some scenes in the film which are taken running around the former world trade center and also in the observation floor and roof area. it is rather sad viewing this part of the film where so many human beings died because of evil in the world. this is not a very good film, except for tom hanks trying to keep the film above the sinking level of entertainment.
