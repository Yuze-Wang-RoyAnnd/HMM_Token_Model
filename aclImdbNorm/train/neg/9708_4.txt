when the employees of a theater find an old reel of film, they decide to show it at the midnight screening of night of the living dead, assuming it's an old preview reel. unfortunately, it's actually an old nazi mind control experiment that turns the audience into a horde of mindless shuffling zombies.<br /><br />i can't understand the hate for this movie. it is a low budget independent production with a lot of camp, but it doesn't deserve a "1.1" here on imdb. it is just so much fun. it is obvious that the filmmakers have a reasonable knowledge and love of old horror movies, and they have created an entertaining tribute to them sprinkled with references and homages to a variety of them. it has the feel of such things as night of the living dead (in many ways, very similar), evil dead 2 and army of darkness, and various others.<br /><br />i liked the explanation of how the zombies, though really just hypnotized into thinking they are zombies, actually come to have the physical attributes of the living dead-unbelievable, perhaps, but i appreciate the effort by the writers to explain it. the gore effects were decent for the budget, the acting was all right, and the story was entertaining.<br /><br />i liked it.
