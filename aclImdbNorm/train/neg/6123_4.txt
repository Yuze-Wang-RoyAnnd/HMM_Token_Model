when i was a teen-ager seeing this film for the first time, i thought it was one of the best movies ever made. of course, the reason for that is bo derek and her various states of undress in this film. however, now that i'm older, i can honestly say that this film is awful. mind you, bo derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director john derek make sure you see plenty of her. but when you take that aspect out of the film, it becomes one big dull ride. and tarzan, well, he's all muscular like you think he should be, but when he sees jane (that's bo, of course) for the first time, he doesn't know what to think. this despite the fact that bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed. tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. if you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body, then this might fill the ticket. if you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and worth-while film, go elsewhere...almost anywhere else at that!!!
