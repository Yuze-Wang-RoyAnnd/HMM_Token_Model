i picked this up at the video store because of tarantino's recommendation ("if you don't like (this), go f&^% yourself!") on the box... seemed like a ringing endorsement.... i was expecting something a bit more like "death proof"... not much actual violence in this one tho, or plot, of character, or dialogue. <br /><br />look at the poster. it's all there. stunts, and rock. it goes back and forth. a week or so in the life of an la band that does a crappy magic show, at a level that you'd maybe see in one of the lesser casinos off the strip, and an aussie stuntman new in town finding his feet... they work, they meet girls, they party. end of story.<br /><br />the band obviously needed all that stuff because they are frankly second-tier, and playing a style that was already dated in 1978. it has to be said that the stunt bits in the film are genuinely spinetingling - that aussie fellow really is something, and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for the "art". i hung it there to see what crazy thing he'd do next. just wish he could have found a better vehicle.
