all the kids aged from 14-16 want to see this movie (although you are only allowed at 18). they have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it. i feel very sad kids can't see what a good movie is, and what a bad movie is. this was one of the worst movies i saw in months. every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie. and the end? it's an open ending... why? because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story. this movie is just made to make you scared, and if you are a bit smart and know some about music, you exactly know when you'll be scared. <br /><br />when the movie was finished and i turned to my friend and told (a bit to loud) him that this was a total waste of money, some stupid kid looked strange at me. these day i could make an oscar with a home-video of my goldfish, if only i use the right marketing.
