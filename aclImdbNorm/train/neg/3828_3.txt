by 1976 the western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it. still, instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch it, they went ahead and made it anyway. apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film, they decided to make it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible. hell, it worked for the wild bunch so why shouldn't it work here? of course, the wild bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of the last hard men is plain old-fashioned rubbish.<br /><br /> it's hard to figure out what attracted charlton heston and james coburn to their respective roles. heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw (coburn). the hunt becomes even more personal when heston's daughter (barbara hershey) is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation.<br /><br /> this is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over-the-top detail. it's tremendously disappointing really, because the star pairing sounds like a mouth-watering prospect. there's no sense of pace or urgency in the film either. it takes an eternity to get going, but when the action finally does come it is marred by the emphasis on nastiness. all in all, this might be the very worst film that heston ever made. i'm sure it's one of the productions he is loathe to include on his illustrious cv.
