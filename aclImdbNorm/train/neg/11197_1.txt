what was the worst movie of 2003? "cat in the hat?" "gigli?" mais non! i propose that it was this atrocious little film from earlier in the year. badly written, badly edited, and (if i may be so bold) badly acted, "the order" is the black hole of film - a movie so dense not even the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of suck. it isn't even accidentally funny, like (for example) "showgirls."<br /><br />you know that the producers are assuming that their audience isn't going to be very smart. they renamed the movie, originally titled "the sin eaters," because they figured americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was, even though they go to great lengths to explain what a sin eater is in the movie. instead, they figure an utterly generic title and a picture of heath ledger looking sullen are more than enough to get you in there.<br /><br />and, hey, what do you know, they were right! my ex-girlfriend saw the picture of heath and dragged me in. congratulations, producers, you've met your target market. she also liked "grease ii," so you're in good company.<br /><br />back on topic, heath plays a catholic monk from a specific (you guessed it) order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor. he has celibacy issues, possibly because nobody in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion, much less be a celibate monk. the only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat guy. as much as i've wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic to the big screen, his attempts at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school who did imitations of monty python, thinking that if they just said the lines like the pythons did they would automatically be funny. you know the sort of people i'm talking about.<br /><br />if i utter any more, i would be in danger of generating spoilers. frankly, the thing that spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created.
