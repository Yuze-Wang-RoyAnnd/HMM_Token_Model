kol, space prisoner on space death row, manages to hijack a space shuttle and escape to the woods of america where he, along with some new found friend try to escape from the 'alienator" a female cyborg killing machine. made one year after the best movie of fred olen ray's career, "hollywood chainsaw hookers", this one can't help but feel like a bit of a letdown. just as low-budget as that earlier film, but not nearly as fun as i had with it. none of the actors really stood out at me. the film is alright for the undiscriminating viewer during a rainy saturday afternoon, but that's pretty much all it's good for.<br /><br />my grade: d+ <br /><br />where i saw it: showtime thriller
