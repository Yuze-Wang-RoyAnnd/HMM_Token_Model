this movie was on t.v the other day, and i didn't enjoy it at all. the first george of the jungle was a good comedy, but the sequel.... completely awful. the new actor and actress to play the lead roles weren't good at all, they should of had the original actor (brendon fraiser) and original actress (i forgot her name) so this movie gets the 0 out of ten rating, not a film that you can sit down and watch and enjoy, this is a film that you turn to another channel or take it back to the shop if hired or bought. it was good to see ape the ape back, but wasn't as fun as the first, they should of had the new george as georges son grown up, and still had bredon and (whats her face) in the film, that would've been a bit better then it was.
