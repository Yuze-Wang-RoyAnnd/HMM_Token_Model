man i must say when i saw the trailer i was excited. futuristic soldiers, taking on bad ass vampires led by genre vet michael ironside....in space. i mean i wasn't expecting high art, but it looked like a potential b movie classic. this was no doubt a tv pilot, reedited some time later into a feature film, after it wasn't picked up. alright i'll start with the films few good points, the action was competent for a lower budgeted film, and the cgi and locations used were passable. now onto the bad, first off michael ironside was barley in this, and his performance here....well it was cheesy not in a good way. but as i said he wasn't in it much anyways, so i can't blame him. one thing that was really stupid, was the peta type group for vampires', no i'm not joking, it's the dumbest most unbelievable thing i've seen in along time, and it's taken seriously. also this film commits one of the major b movie sins, it teases a lesbian scene, and doesn't deliver. most of all what sinks this film is nothing really happens. since it was meant to be a pilot the script is almost nonexistent and it doesn't have a regular ending. even the main villains, only come in towards the end. if ever a movie needed to up the sleaze and gore factor, it's vampire wars. in closing i will say the main crew on the spaceship, were all very capable actors and could very well put this mess behind them, and go on to bigger and better things. they just had nothing to work with here.
