don't spend your money or your time on this pitiful piece of film in the guise of cinematography.when every third word is devoted to foul language and there is no real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same dated performances from the past and have not evolved in their careers, leaves a lot to be said. i was expecting something better from award winning actor benicio del toro. the vision that others may have of puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as maldeamores. a foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context (see the movie elsa and fred for example) but it should not permeate the plot. the movie is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this film.
