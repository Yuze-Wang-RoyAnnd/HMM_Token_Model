i've read some of the other comments and i do have to agree with the ones that didn't get the ending. i thought it was going rather well..until the end. it kept your mind running and then splat. i have not clue what went on the last couple minutes of the movie except a complete mess. it's like they ran out of money to come up with a good ending so they improvised. first they had a mysterious thing making people disappear then they had a guy talking about area 51 (which makes you think about aliens) then after they it went to crap. i thought the actors and actresses did fine it's just the script went sour. anyways, if you do watch this movie be prepared to be disappointed at the end.
