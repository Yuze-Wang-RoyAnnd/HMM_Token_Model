cafe lumiere is a beautifully photographed nullity. unacquainted with the work of the director, i am well-acquainted with the filmmaker he is supposedly paying tribute to - ozu yasujiro. while not even approaching ozu in greatness, hou has communicated nothing of ozu's depth of emotion and concentration on meaning within a closed space. one of the things he misses entirely is ozu's attention to character - we are not even "introduced" by hou to his lead character (a perfect blank page). there are no medium or close shots of his people. one of the dvd extras offers interviews with the actors and gives us precisely what hou doesn't - a good look at their faces.<br /><br />there was a great spanish film by bardem called nunca pasa nada, which translates to something like "nothing ever happens". that would be a far better title to this pointless exercise. all through the film we are given clues about an obscure taiwanese composer some of whose work we hear on the soundtrack. but the clues, like everything else, add up to nothing. unless you're a trainspotter, this film has nothing to recommend it.
