after leaving tv's popular "the andy griffith show", don knotts gave movie stardom a valiant try with a series of inane but matin'ee-pleasing comedy vehicles. unfortunately, "the reluctant astronaut", filmed on the cheap (as were most of knotts' movies), is much worse than his others. don plays a small town schnook who gets accepted to astronaut training camp...but not as a candidate for space travel--they want him as their new janitor! some may say the weak satire capitalizes on americans' then-fresh fever for the new age of technology, but the flick is really just a dim excuse to keep restless children occupied. it gets off to a good start, with an ok set-up and nostalgic locations, but it becomes increasingly more spiritless and idiotic. * from ****
