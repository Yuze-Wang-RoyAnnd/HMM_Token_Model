there will be a time where kids will have grown up without ever seeing the one and only bugs bunny kiss (technically) another man on the lips. there will be a time where it won't be duck or rabbit season. there will be a time where the tazmanian devil will be dubbed politically incorrect.<br /><br />but so help me now is not that time.<br /><br />nobody really wants an 'extreme' version of our beloved loony characters. whoever it is in marketing who comes up with "corn nuts: corn gone wrong" and "extreme doritos" and evidently this festering turd should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising or whatever doesn't mean they know jack about kids.<br /><br />i think that they're doing a disservice to children, depriving them of one of the greatest and most iconic shows of all time. this show disgusts me, and it's not just the dated artwork or terrible dialogue. they misuse good voice talent, like phil lamarr, michael clarke duncan, candi milo, and so many others. it lacks style, humor, character development, and most importantly, heart.<br /><br />the show, like it's repackaged characters (slam tasmanian, rev runner, ace bunny) is but a shadow of it's former, timeless and beautiful self.
