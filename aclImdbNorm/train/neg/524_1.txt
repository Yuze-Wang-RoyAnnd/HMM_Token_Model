"the 40 year old virgin" exists in a world i don't understand. a world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to "f*** off" and broadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not get reprimanded. a world where it's really funny to go drunk driving and smash into other peoples' cars. a world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass her underlings. a world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. and a world without any funny jokes! i am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie. i thought every scene was like a bad saturday night live sketch - not very funny to begin with, and stretched out beyond all rational thought. the chest-waxing scene went on forever.<br /><br />the characters, aside from carell, were totally one-note. and the romantic elements were completely contrived, particularly the scene where keener finds porn in carell's apartment. that was just lame.<br /><br />and i also found the "aquarius" sequence totally annoying and excessive. i hated hated hated this movie!
