i've always been enthusiastic about period dramas, an art form in which the bbc has excelled in the past. this presentation of "byron" was unbelievable. unbelievably bad! the script was dreadful, the acting uninspired, and all the characters woefully insipid. apparently byron was "mad bad and dangerous to know", and set the ladies hearts all-a-flutter. not in this production. here he appeared as a tawdry jumped-up little squirt instead of a fiery hero of womenfolk and the greek struggle for independence. it is said that byron walked with a limp. this portrayal of the man was just limp all over.<br /><br />i watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life. not a splutter, not even a glimmer. it was utter tedium, if not downright boredom, from start to finish.<br /><br />having the opinion that no-one will ever better the bard of avon, i also believe that byron's poetry is over-revered and to my mind should be flung on the back burner, and this dramatisation of his life should be accorded the same treatment.<br /><br />i think the bbc lost its nous with this one
