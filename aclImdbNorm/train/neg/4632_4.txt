maria bello doesn't seem to care what people think of her choices in movie roles. again she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie to star in. maybe she needs those movies, to get off the sugar coated (aka "hollywood") ones she does here and then (coyote ugly and of course mummy 3).<br /><br />while i think fails to achieve what it sets out to do (i won't spoil that), maria bello is as great as in her other independent/small movies she stars in. it's her performance that elevates this movie. this combined with the strange subject matter almost did the trick for me. but in the end (and even if i try to overlook some flaws, like bad pacing and dramaturgy), the movie is still too long
