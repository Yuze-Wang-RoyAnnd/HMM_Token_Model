two years ago, on berlin film festival we watched the amos kollek movie "sue" in the panorama program, with a wonderful anna thomson in the leading part. it's a film about loneliness and sex, and how the one thing is compensated by the other. in the same section on the festival now we have to complain the superfluous antithesis of sue, "extension du domaine de la lutte", which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having no sex is one and the same problem. but unfortunately we can't sympathize with "our hero" (how he is called by the story-teller), because he is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself. own fault, i'm sorry. i can't understand him. not enough, the writer/director/actor want us admitting to him, that it's not his destroyed self-consciousness or the passivity of his personality, what brought him so far, but the rotten society and its image of sexuality. yes, there are some deeper insights about gender relations, but we won't follow him so far... and the point is, that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate, having no sex. who didn't notice yet, it's a quite depressing film...<br /><br />in the beginning, there had been some starts to be more accurate in sketching the situation. at the bed store the "hero" speaks about the hindrances buying a new bed. perhaps it's too broad getting up the stairs, you have to stay at home half a day... this is a satire about a character, who doesn't know taking the life and heart in hands, doing something... the movie doesn`t follow this path, but handles his characters with helplessness. nobody believes, that "our hero" is able to instigate tisserand for a murder. too dull, too kind, too - passive (not to mention tisserand's complex; he has an inhibition, but he couldn't be, of course, a murderer of women!). to finish: there are women and the world, it's not a device of a modern sexualized society. help you as you can, but don't follow the messages and the "wisdom" of this movie, which announces bankruptcy to human relationships, without seizing the real conflicts within.
