the original "vanishing point" was a great flick. subtle motives, characters that seemed real and spontaneous.the remake was terrible. preachy, overtly obvious; it missed the point as to why the original was a classic. the black charger was cool, but even that couldn't rescue this flick. why stick with a white challenger? i didn't think that was the best choice back in '71. some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious. like when vigo was standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his "dream quest". his indian pal was standing next to him. vigo was only wearing his white briefs. i'm sorry - it just looked silly - him surveying the vista in his fruit of the looms. another scene was at the end - after the explosive crash into the bulldosers - the announcer said that the impact was clocked at 180 mph. then he mentions that the cops said his remains weren't found because he vaporized, but some people believe he bailed out and was hidden by friends in the crowd. then it shows him rolling out of the car at 180 mph! first of all, you couldn't open the car door at 180 mph. secondly, the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 yds. with nobody to steer it. it would promptly roll over about 30 times. thirdly, if you hit the pavement at 180 mph, you would wind up in various squishy pieces. no matter, we see him at the end standing with his daughter. all in all, a movie that would insult anyone's intelligence.
