i can't figure al pacino out. i watch him in the godfather, scarface, carlito's way, and i think i am watching one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years. then i see him in two for the money, any given sunday and revolution, and i wonder what the guy is thinking.<br /><br />i stumbled on revolution a few nights ago, and thought i would invest the next two hours on this. here is a news flash: want to get prisoners to talk? force them to watch this over and over...they'll confess to anything.<br /><br />i won't rehash the plot since there is no coherent plot, but it does take place during the american revolution and pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to get involved, but ultimately does. while he has no money, no education and dresses like a caveman, a very hot natasha kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason, since they have only two minutes of dialogue together.<br /><br />quite frankly, if "al smith" starred in this movie, instead of "al pacino", it would have ruined their career. the script was horrible, but pacino's demotivated performance and obvious fake accent made it even worse. donald sutherland's role was laughable. i really can't describe it. natasha kinski is a main character, but has like 5 lines in the movie. in fact, nobody speaks much in this movie.<br /><br />one of the most laughable premise in the movie is how al pacino and kinski have this uncanny knack to continually run into each other on the battlefield. its like the entire northeast is a starbucks. "hey, funny to see you here again, on another battlefield 100 miles away...see you in a few months".<br /><br />i am required to give this one star by imdb, since there is nothing here for a negative score.
