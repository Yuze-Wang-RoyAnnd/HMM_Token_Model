"dahmer" is an interesting film although i wouldn't use "horror" or "thriller" do describe it. it's more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killer.<br /><br />jeremy renner portrays serial killer jeffrey dahmer, who drugged, murdered and dismembered his male victims. the film centers on the relationship between dahmer and "rodney", well-played by artel kay`aru. <br /><br />rodney is almost the more interesting character: enamored of dahmer and having once escaped an attack, he returns to dahmer for sex and survives a second attack.<br /><br />i think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray dahmer's formative years, how events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into dahmer's belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victims.<br /><br />the roles are well played but the story is thin.
