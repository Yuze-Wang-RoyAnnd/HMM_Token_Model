gadar is an example of one of bollywood worst overrated movies ever. directed by anil sharma, who prefers making period related movie gives a rubbish movie. the songs were boring and ain't the kind of song you want to listen to in your car, full volume. sunny deol is famous for making daft movies, where he beats up a 100 bad guys on his own. he even kicks a metal jail door (indian) and kicks a moving car far away (teesri aankh). i can give another 50 examples of disgraceful action by sunny deol. but i'm sure most people know this already. sunny gives a pathetic performance once again repeating the same type of role. a guy claiming to be fighting for his countries piece, by using violence. amisha patel is hands down dead sexy with an amazing body that i would love to bone. but even she couldn't save the film from being a disaster. instead of wearing sexy clothes like she usually does, in this movie she doesn't. maybe cos she was playing a muslim, but she doesn't act like one in the movie. overall, this is a poor show all the way, i'm sure it will appeal to some people, who love seeing the bollywood actor beat up 100 guys. give me a break.
