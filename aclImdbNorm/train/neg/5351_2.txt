if you liked the first two films, then i'm sorry to say you're not going to like this one. this is the really rubbish and unnecessary straight to video, probably tv made sequel. the still idiotic but nice scientist wayne szalinski (rick moranis) is still living with his family and he has his own company, szalinski inc. unfortunately his wife wants to get rid of a statue, wayne is so stupid he shrinks his statue and himself with his brother. then he shrinks his wife and sister-in-law too. now the adults have to find a way to get the kids of the house to get them bigger. pretty much a repeat of the other two with only one or two new things, e.g. a toy car roller coaster, swimming in dip, etc. pretty poor!
