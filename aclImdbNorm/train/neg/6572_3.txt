in my opinion, this movie's title should be changed from "only the brave" to "all about lane". i went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome. although, i appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of 442nd - a subject matter that long deserved addressing in the film industry - the acting in some parts of film was quite stale. the performances of marc dacascos, tamlyn tomita, and jason scott lee were all great. however, the director should have never put himself as the main character in the movie. sorry lane, you are just not a film actor. stick to what you're good at - theater acting. gina hiraizumi's performance in this film was also horrible. she should never have been given a speaking role and her looks were unfit to play the part of a miss nisei queen. there were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful... why weren't they cast for that role? another major problem with this film were its action sequences. the japanese-american soldiers don't look like they were fighting german soldiers... let alone anyone. granted this was a low budget feature, but since this was a war-based film, isn't it important to show some actually fighting? this film was a worthy attempt, but definitely not worth a major distribution.
