my god, what's going on? a uwe boll film and positive comments? wow!<br /><br />nice to note that most of the positive reviews are coming from newbies to boll's work. i myself, as i have stated in previous uwe boll reviews, only watch his films in the hope that one day he will actually make something good. i mean..it must happen one day!<br /><br />alas, seed is not that day. i don't quite know where to start with the lame attempt at a horror film that seed is. the thing to remember people is that all the sickos in the world are that way due to having watched various sick acts on video or the net.....or so mr boll believes. i still can't for the life of me figure out why footage of real animal abuse and killings was needed in the first 10 minutes of this film. i understand the concept that seed (the killer) is a sicko and enjoys watching such stuff.....but can't understand why mr boll thought putting real footage in the film would work. maybe to shock us? hmmm.....well, i for one am not squeamish and can handle seeing anything on film. i don't though, find the use of real animal cruelty footage entertaining in the slightest. if you were trying to shock me, it didn't work. it just reminded me how messed up the world was because such things happen and also because uwe boll is allowed to continue making films. this sort of context may have worked for films in the 70/80's (cannibal holocaust) but not todays market.<br /><br />with that out of the way, we can move on to the fact that uwe has managed to give the film a very cheap feel all round like bloodrayne 2. you can just tell that there wasn't a huge amount of money floating around for production.<br /><br />as per usual, mr boll does not really care for making a decent story as we are treated to boring shots of police officers watching various videos of seed's victims in the first 25 mins. each of these videos ends in a speeded up decomp of the victim. it's all very boring and tedious. i won't comment on the toddler scene as it's laughable and just another cheap 'shock' factor.<br /><br />if you manage to sit through the first 25 mins then you will be treated to the police officers walking through a very dark house in order to catch seed. the lighting here is horrible and uwe has the old 'i'm not using a steady cam' fiasco that he did with bloodrayne 2. watch as the police officers die in ever stupidly increasing ways until such point as seed is caught. this scene is soooo bloody stupid you have to see it to believe it. the cop actually tells seed he could have shot him. for some un-be-known reason, the cop doesn't shoot him. given that seed is a sicko that kills kids as well as adults, you'd have thought at this point in the script that sense would prevail.<br /><br />from here we are treated to a stupid execution scene, followed by the cops burying seed alive (and they know he is alive..why not shoot him in the head????), followed by seed getting out of the ground and then killing some random woman with a hammer and then kidnapping the one of the cop's family.<br /><br />what i'm trying to get across to you all here is that it's just plain stupid! it's not even hollywood horror stupid....just plain dumb. uwe boll can not direct ****. anyone with any ounce of taste would agree with that statement. anyone who watches this film and found it entertaining in any way shape or form needs to take a serious look at themselves as a person. <br /><br />once again we are treated to a poorly acted, directed, lighted, produced, scripted piece of ub crap.
