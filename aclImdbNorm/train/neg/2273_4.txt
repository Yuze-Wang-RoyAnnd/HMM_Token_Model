this wasn't the major disaster that i was expecting, but that is about as positive as i can be in my description of the movie. i'm not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie, but i suppose it's all a matter of taste. personally, i don't find it funny to watch morons living their idiotic lives or making fools of themselves on television, but then again, i'm not a fan of jerry springer's pathetic daytime talk show. i didn't get too bored watching this, but i was definitely never enjoying it, either. if you're in the mood to see a bad movie, but one that isn't too painful to sit through, this is a good choice.
