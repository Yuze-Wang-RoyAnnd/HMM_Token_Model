all i can really say is that i'm glad that i was knitting socks while watching the movie, or i would be very angry for having wasted 2 hours of my life. the acting was terrible, the plot was even worse. there were some scenes that were meant to be serious that had my husband and i laughing out loud. i highly recommend this movie to people who like to do their own version of mst3k.
