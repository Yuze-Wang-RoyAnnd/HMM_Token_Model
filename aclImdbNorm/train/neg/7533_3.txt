the film had some likable aspects. perhaps too many for my taste. it felt as though the writer/director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of all of its characters. not once, a few times...but all of the time. <br /><br />this is the job of television, not cinema. <br /><br />the location of the train station was well chosen and i enjoyed sascha horler's performance as the pregnant friend. <br /><br />i felt as though justine clarke's performance was wan. her reactions to things felt forced, as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonist's expressions. i also can't believe that a director can make the wonderful daniela farinacci into an unbelievable presence. <br /><br />i cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences. this is a lazy device, especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film and/or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest. <br /><br />that said, there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the australian heat and local attitude with originality. it does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine. especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity, infusing it with passion and hand-crafted charm. <br /><br />i am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked. "who knows if there's a god? like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do" or whatever the line was. <br /><br />perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife "i'm giving up smoking." <br /><br />an anti-smoking commercial? a tac ad with some tasteful animation? i had to leave the cinema at the 50 minute mark -- it was all too much.
