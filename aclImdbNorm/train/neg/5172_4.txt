this is the second movie i saw for horrorfest this past weekend, the gravedancers being the first. gravedancers was better. i can only guess from watching this that the production must have been quite limited. i will admit the story started out interesting but really fizzled for me in the end. we weren't really given time to sympathize or understand any of the characters which only made each of their erratic characteristics even more annoying. i have to mention that there was also a bit of mis-casting with a 12-year-old boy acting as sheriff. the only reason i sat through the whole film was to find out what the big secret was, which turned out to not be all that interesting. some more background about the family would have helped but they didn't really seem like a family at all to begin with.<br /><br />to me, this film is so amateur that i couldn't even see putting it on dvd. the four rating is for the initial potential the story might have had. this was one to skip for horrorfest.
