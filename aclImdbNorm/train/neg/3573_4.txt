this film is a pia zadora special! when viewing it, i was reminded of the classic cartoon showing a hollywood starlet; in urgent need of another role but afraid of becoming typecast for 'b' movie or soft porn roles; who says at her casting session "well of course i do not normally do roles requiring nudity, but if it is artistically necessary for the film...............". this recollection brought up a very naughty image of a similar cartoon showing pia at such a session saying "well of course i do not normally take any roles requiring actual acting, but if it will really give me sufficient exposure to enhance my status as a sex symbol..................". this is probably grossly unfair, the rather sordid tale is the fault of harold robbins book; considering the nature of the story pia's exposures certainly do not receive undue attention, and perhaps pia (who once won an acting award in butterfly) is deliberately satirising her part rather than attempting to act in an almost unplayable role. critics usually point first to the actors as the problem whenever a film proves disappointing, but this is grossly unfair; the scriptwriters and director are far more often the guilty parties. the real problem with "the lonely lady" is that the screenplay, like the original book, looks for sensation rather than substance, and nothing can help with this. <br /><br />	the screenplay for this film is abysmal, but whether the story could have been filmed more successfully with a better script, tauter directing and really competent acting must remain a matter of personal judgement. as it was released, my viewers rating for it would depend upon whether i am assessing my personal opinion, or assessing to what extent the film succeeds in providing what it aims at doing. my personal rating for it would be two out of ten; but to some extent this film probably provides exactly what its sponsors intended, and judged on this basis a quality rating of four out of ten would be reasonable. being in a charitable mood, and wanting to make it clear that i am not blaming pia for my disappointment, i will give an imdb rating of four.
