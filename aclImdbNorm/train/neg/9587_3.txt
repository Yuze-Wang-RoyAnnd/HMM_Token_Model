recreation of 1950's (london) soho and the up-and-coming people. based on a cult novel.<br /><br />julian temple is a video director. no more, no less. give him 15 million dollars and he will make you a 15 million dollar pop video. here he forgets that two minutes with people that can't really act is one thing - but two hours? what was he thinking of. besides who are the audience? who cares about a book that was well remembered way-back-when. the usual london story of the chancer taking his chance. <br /><br />what could really drag this film even further down? oh i know, third rate songs that sound like they were made up on the spot. david bowie crones the film title over and over a few times and that is the highlight. the soundtrack album is clay pigeon material.<br /><br />there is one good thing though. good recreation of period soho. shame they couldn't think of anything to put in front of it.
