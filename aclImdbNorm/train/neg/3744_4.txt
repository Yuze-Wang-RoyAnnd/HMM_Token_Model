this film is an attempt to present jared diamonds theory of "guns, germs and steel", explaining how europeans have dominated much of the globe.<br /><br />the version i saw of this documentary came on 2 discs covering 3 hours. i think the information could have been presented in 20 minutes. there are completely useless scenes of: professor jared diamond watching birds through binoculars, professor jared diamond failing to use a bow and arrow properly, professor jared diamond firing a muzzle-loader badly. was this documentary supposed to make a hero out of "professor jared diamond?". this part of the documentary was so bad, it could have been a spoof. the worst was when diamond is shown breaking down and weeping when touring the malaria ward in an african hospital. none of this helps me understand his theory of "guns, germs and steel." btw, "guns, germs and steel" is said about 100 times. "can the europeans guns, germs and steel get them out of this dire situation? stay tuned and find out!" when he finally gets down to business, his theory is equal parts interesting and utterly boring. europeans conquered the natives peoples of other lands, because they had guns and fine blades against stone and wooden weapons. do i really need a professor to convince me of this? the parts of his theory that explain how the europeans came to have the advantages that allow the conquest are interesting, but the coverage is paper-thin.<br /><br />in the end, i think the documentary was only trying to convince me that non-europeans are as capable as europeans. if i'm not a racist, i already know this. if i'm a racist, jared diamond is not going to convince me with his bumbling use of native implements.<br /><br />i don't think adults are the intended audience for this documentary. kids may enjoy this more than i, though. i have read that the book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary.
