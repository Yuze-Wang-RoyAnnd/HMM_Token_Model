this movie was a major disappointment on direction, intellectual niveau, plot and in the way it dealt with its subject, painting. it is a slow moving film set like an episode of wonder years, with appalling lack of depth though. it also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner.<br /><br />the approach to the subject of painting is very elite, limited to vague and subjective terms as "beauty". according to the makers of this movie, 'beauty' can be only experienced in bob-ross-style kitschy landscape paintings. good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic (like, primary school level) color theory and lots of sentiment. in parts the movie is offending, e.g. at a point it is stated (rather, celebrated by dancing on tables) that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting, their works by definition being worthless 'bullshit' (quote).<br /><br />i do not understand how the movie could get such high rating, then again, so far not many people rated it, and they chose for only very high or very low grades.
