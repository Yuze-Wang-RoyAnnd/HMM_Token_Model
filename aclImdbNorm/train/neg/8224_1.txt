watching this movie? l thought to myself, what a lot of garbage. these girls must have rocks for brains for even agreeing to be part of it. waste of time watching it, faint heavens l only hired it. the acting was below standard and story was unbearable. anyone contemplating watching this film, please save your money. the film has no credit at all. l am a real film buff and this is worse than "attack of the green tomatoes".<br /><br />l only hope that this piece of trash didn't cost too much to make. money would have been better spent on the homeless people of the world. l only hope there isn't a sequel in the pipeline.
