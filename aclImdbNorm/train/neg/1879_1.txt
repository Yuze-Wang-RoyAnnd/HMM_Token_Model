it's hard to believe that this is a sequel to henry fool. hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both movies. while henry fool is refreshing, witty, comical, fay grim is slow, boring, and doesn't go anywhere. where has the wit gone? i am baffled.<br /><br />it is 10 years since i saw henry fool and many of its dialogs and scenes are still vivid in my memory. fay grim is painful to watch. this is no fault of the actors, who are good (parker posey) or great (jeff goldblum) -- the blame lies entirely with the plot, the dialog, and even some of the filming (low budget is no excuse). a huge disappointment. <br /><br />sorry i couldn't pay attention to the plot, i was so bored, so disappointed... if you enjoyed this one you might not enjoy henry fool so much... the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other... there is no continuity in the characters' personalities... it's all a fraud to entice fans of henry fool to watch the sequel.<br /><br />i'm switching this off now -- henry in some sort of jail with a taliban?!?!
