there are so many stupid moments in 'tower of death'/'game of death 2' that you really wonder if it's a spoof. at times, it felt like i was watching a sequel to kung pow rather than a bruce lee film.<br /><br />to be honest, this film has bugger all to do with 'game of death'. if anything, it's more a sequel/remake of 'enter the dragon', incorporating many elements of that film - particularly the actual footage. bruce lee's character billy lo (apparently) investigates the sudden death of his friend and encounters a piece of film that was left with the man's daughter. when the body is stolen during the funeral (!), billy is also killed and it's up to his wayward brother to avenge both men's deaths.<br /><br />tong long stars as brother bobby lo and doesn't really have the sort of charisma to carry the film. his fighting abilities are very good however. bruce lee obviously turns up thanks to (no longer) deleted footage simply to cash-in on the legacy. saying that, on the whole, the footage is actually edited-in better than in 'game of death' but it doesn't stop the film from being a mess.<br /><br />ok, so the fights are actually very entertaining (dare i say mind-blowing) and make the film at least watchable. but there are so many daft elements to this film that it really tests your patience. first off, there's the supposed villain who lives on his palatial estate... or is that mental institution? seriously, the nutter eats raw venison, drinks deer's blood, carries a monkey on his shoulder and owns some peacocks and lions (?!). this attempt to make him look tough and intelligent just makes you feel sorry for him - you half expect someone to escort him back to his room.<br /><br />in fact, this middle section is awful and when the scene involving a naked hooker and a lion suit arrived i turned it off. however, i did finish the film and was kind of glad i did because the fight scene towards the end (much like 'god') was the whole reason for watching. while the story is an embarrassment, the action is very good and contains excellent choreography.<br /><br />but even the finale disappoints if the premise was anything to go by. what we were told was that the 'tower of death' was a pagoda that was upside down and underground. this sounded great, like a twist on bruce lee's original idea with different styles of fighting on each level. could this be the 'game of death' that was originally planned? no! the film should have been named "generator room of death" because thats as far as the tower goes. of yes, there were indeed one or two 'different' styles... there were foil clad grunts, leopard-skinned henchman and stupid monk. it's as though enter the dragon had never been made, with the plot being a poor imitation.<br /><br />worth watching once for the fast paced fight scenes, but so stupid sometimes that it hurts. if this was intended, then fine. thumbs up, however, for recreating that projector room scene from 'enter the dragon'.
