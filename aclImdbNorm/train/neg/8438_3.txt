i suppose bad laurel and hardy is better than no laurel and hardy at all, but just barely. it's sad that the fox films are the ones getting a big release on dvd, exposing people who may not be too familiar with l&h to their worst stuff rather than their classic comedies.<br /><br />once again the boys are saddled with a dumb romantic plot about a guy who's invented an invisible ray. he's in love with the bosses' daughter, who hates him and prefers some slick guy. it's incredible to think the geniuses at fox thought this is what l&h needed in their films.<br /><br />without their pancake makeup the boys look tired and old. the only scenes that work for them in this picture is when they try to sneak out of a bedroom window at night and the rather bizarre scene where robert mitchum, being a classic noir bad guy tries to sell oliver hardy "insurance" on stan.<br /><br />otherwise, this script is just a mess. forget this and see if you can find a copy of "a chump at oxford" or "bohemian girl" or "sons of the desert" instead.
