i think the biggest failing something can have is to be boring. bad is actually better than boring. this thing has no breath. it does have the interesting fact of taking place in cambodia. how many american made films of the 30's take place in cambodia. nevertheless, the conflict there is a little hard to figure out. even the troop movements are a little confusing. what drags it to a resounding halt is the love story. why those two guys are so totally transfixed on the dippy blonde i don't know. i thought he should continue to use his zombies (such as they are) and forget all about her. the movie just plods along. the perfect microcosm is where one of the principle characters follows a cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where the hieroglyphics (or whatever) that explain how to turn people into zombies is kept. i thought they would never get there. one guy takes two steps. he stops. he looks around. the other guy hides behind some columns. he takes two steps. he stops. he looks around. the other guy hides behind some bushes. this is the movie in a nutshell. then there is the bad acting and insipid dialogue. i actually have a lot of patience when it comes to b movies. this one is insufferable. by the way, a more apt title would be revolt of the hypnotized.
