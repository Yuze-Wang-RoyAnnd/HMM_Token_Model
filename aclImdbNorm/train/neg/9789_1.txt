they should have called this movie: "adopted mouse brother that is slightly inspired by someone's vague recollection of stuart little who just kind of skimmed the book a little, but mostly just remembered the cover" if it wasn't so misleading i'd give it a better review.<br /><br />but seriously people, do your kids a favor and have them read the book. they might actually learn something instead of having their mind numbed by what we all know as hollywood film.<br /><br />the book stuart little isn't about a mouse, it's about a person who happens to be very small and mouse-like. he's born to his parents, not adopted. the book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey he embarks on. there is a cat named snowball who thinks he's food and wants to eat him, but snowball can't talk. <br /><br />in the movie they screw all of that up. i think the only things that they kept from the book were the boat race and the names.
