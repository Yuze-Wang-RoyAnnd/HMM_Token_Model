new york, i love you, or rather should-be-titled manhattan, i love looking at your people in sometimes love, is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation. case in point, look at two of the segments in the film, one where ethan hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexy-talk, and another with orlando bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two dostoyevsky books. while the latter isn't a great story by any stretch, it's at least something that has a beginning, middle and end, as the composer tries to score, gets dostoyevky dumped in his lap, and in the end gets some help (and maybe something more) from a girl he's been talking to as a liaison between him and the director. the ethan hawke scene, however, is like nothing, and feels like it, like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in (or, for that matter, hawke with a combo of before sunrise and reality bites).<br /><br />what's irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible 'stories' and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another (i.e. bits involving bradley cooper, drea dematteo, hayden christensen, andy garcia, james caan, natalie portman, etc). it's not even so much that the film- set practically always in *manhattan* and not the new york of queens or staten island or the bronx (not even, say, harlem or washington heights)- lacks a good deal of diversity, since there is some. it's the lack of imagination that one found in spades, for better or worse, in paris j'taime. it's mostly got little to do with new york, except for passing references, and at its worst (the julie christie/shia labeouf segment) it's incomprehensible on a level that is appalling.<br /><br />so, basically, wait for tv, and do your best to dip in and out of the film - in, that is, for three scenes: the aforementioned bloom/christina ricci segment which is charming; the brett ratner directed segment (yes, x-men 3 brett ratner) with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist; and eli wallach and cloris leachman as an adorable quite old couple walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary. everything else can be missed, even natalie portman's directorial debut, and the return of a hughes brother (only one, allan) to the screen. a mixed bag is putting it lightly: it's like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left.
