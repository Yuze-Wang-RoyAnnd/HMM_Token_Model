the first half of this movie is a pure delight. novel. funny. wonderful performances. a close knit brother and sister living in manhattan fall for the same woman! adult. bright. witty. what more could you ask. as a romantic comedy this starts refreshing. it heads into unexplored territory. and then it falls apart.<br /><br />it goes from being a universal adult comedy to a coming-of-age coming-out-of-the-closet story that has been done many times before. what a disappointment. as a people film it begins with such promise. why does it need to turn into such a pedestrian "i am who i am" film. the freeze-frame ending shot of heather graham's jumping in the air to celebrate "her happiness at finding herself" underlines the banality of the last part of the film.<br /><br />it could have been different. it could have been magical. it ended up being the same old same old.
