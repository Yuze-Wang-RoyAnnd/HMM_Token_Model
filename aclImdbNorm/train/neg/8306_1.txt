et's obsession with dannielynn smith is despicable. leave the child alone. with all the constant attention she'll most likely grow up psychotic, depressed or worse. think of princess diana and how she longed for privacy. now poor little rich girl ashley olson just wants to be left alone. no wonder greta garbo became a recluse and said "i want to be alone". how much does et make off this little girl? does et not have anything better to report on? i bet there's lots of people who really don't care what color her birthday cake and balloons were. by the way, i never heard that anna nichole ever won any of those court cases over the will and her inheritance. who is paying for the lifestyle of larry, howard and little dannielynn? could it be et?
