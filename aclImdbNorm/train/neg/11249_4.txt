visually stunning? most definitely. i have seen few films look this good in some time. sky captain and the world of tomorrow uses striking cinematography, computer graphics, and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar yet something quite fresh. the time period seems to be the 1930s or early 40s. the movie tells of recent attacks on new york city by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason. also, mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide. who can stop them and save the world? alright, it doesn't take a leap of faith to know it is the sky captain himself with his wisecracking reporter girlfriend always hot for a lead, and in the wings his trusty, thoroughly competent sidekick. what sky captain has in atmosphere and graphics it lacks in storytelling and characterization. the plot for this film is ridiculous. that being said, the film is going for a serial-like feeling of film serials of yesteryear. they had pretty far out stories and bad acting - but none of them, and i mean none of them, had the budget and big names this film had. two academy award winning performers and jude law could keep a film afloat, one would think, but sky captain sinks miserably. despite its fantastic dark look, i found myself wishing the film would just end and i could get on with my life. i had little interest in a story that generated little interest. i didn't care at all for any of the glib portrayals. paltrow was just awful. jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance. law cannot carry the one-liner tradition all too squarely on his limited shoulders. i mean, let's face it, he's not will smith, mel gibson, or even wesley snipes. the sad thing about sky captain, at least for me, was that it held so much promise yet delivered so little. i was bored ten minutes into the film - waiting for something to hook my interest - and it never came.
