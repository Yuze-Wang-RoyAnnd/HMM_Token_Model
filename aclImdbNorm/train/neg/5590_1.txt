horrible film. about an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl. boring. tatum o neil goes through the motions in her part, and has some of the corniest lines in film history. richard burton looks close to death in this film, and we're supposed to believe he looks "good for sixty". the acting is bad, as is the plot. the characters are awful, as is the story. it's really hard to feel for anyone in this film, except larry ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on tatum, he's kind of funny. this movie is really a waste of time. if you are a tatum fan, like me - which is why i rented it in the first place - please don't see this movie. she is really bad in it, and you'll wonder if maybe paper moon was a fluke. it wasn't, because of bad news bears and little darlings it's known she can act well, but still, don't rent this movie. and if you're a fan of burton, rent something when he was good looking, and not a fossil.
