one of the worst films ever. not funny, poor tv style cinematography, bad acting. sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk, let alone act. lead female nancy young can't act. terrible direction. sub-par with bad tv movies. occasional weak jokes fall flat. even the basic premise of the movie makes no sense. somehow they are supposed to stop a wedding from happening but there's no logic behind their actions. slow pacing made my wife stop watching but i suffered through it. the old men are supposed to be acting like they are young and horny, but it comes off as pathetic instead of funny. how did they even get the money to make this?
