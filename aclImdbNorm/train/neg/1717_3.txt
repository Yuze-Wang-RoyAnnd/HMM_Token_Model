here we have 2 misunderstood kids who never stood a chance against a cruel, poverty riddled existence: robin hoods singled out by the police for persecution because they were a trifle wild at times. gad! according to this crap bonnie was the sweetest little thing west of the missouri who was taught to be a psychopathic murderer by a fun loving boyfriend who didn't really want to hurt anybody....he just wanted things without putting a lot of energy into getting them. badly acted, poorly filmed, unbelievable dialogue, unrealistic use of weaponry, gore that looked more like grape jelly than the real thing. avoid this bilgewater. thumbs down. -5 stars.
