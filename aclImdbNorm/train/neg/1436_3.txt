oh dear. some of the best talent in british tv made this serial, and so i can only assume that they were working under incredible time pressure, and had to settle for first takes of many scenes.<br /><br />there are some frightening scenes in this highland mystery (mostly when the "monster" attacks and we see it from his point of view), but i'm afraid that i found most of the story unintentionally funny ! such as the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course: oh look, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand over there ... hmm this is a bit puzzling ...<br /><br />for many years fans of british cult tv shows campaigned to have this serial released on vhs or dvd, but the bbc always said no. now i think i understand why !
