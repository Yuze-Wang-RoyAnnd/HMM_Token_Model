of course i was watching bg. i loved s1, i liked season 2, season 3 was ok, and loved the final one. yay, there is a spin-off show! i didn't know about this at all, one of my friends told me about this. i was really excited.<br /><br />i watched the first 3 episodes... what a piece of rubbish! teenage girl drama fest. there is no science fiction... well, hardly any. at the end of every episode we can catch a glimpse of a cylon. that's all. who cares this? did they decide that the next show's target audience will be females under 18? boring religious nonsense talking, moaning, bitching... and some more.<br /><br />it is just sad that there is nothing out there at the moment to watch. stargate ruined, bg over...
