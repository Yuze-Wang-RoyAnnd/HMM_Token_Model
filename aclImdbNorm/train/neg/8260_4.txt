first off, i would like to point out that while i am not an expert, the way the trial was handled will insult your intelligence. firstly, the prosecution never proved that 'facilitated learning' actually works. irresponsible for both the prosecution(because they can get an appeal) and the defense for not acting on this. as another commenter said, facilitated learning was proved untrue. secondly, they used terry as the translator who has personal interest, and even will testify, in the trial which is just stupid. if the court had allowed him to testify that way, they would have brought in someone neutral otherwise they would be just asking for an appeal. thirdly, this child was never asked specific questions about the defendant by the prosecution(birthmarks, details of the event, etc.) and even when asked by the defense specific questions like when it started, he could not answer. if that isn't reasonable doubt i don't know what is and a competent lawyer would have gotten an acquittal.<br /><br />bottom line, it starts off well with the pressures of being the parent of a child with autism, but the trial makes this movie wholly unbelievable.
