believe it or not, "the woodchipper massacre" gave me full-blown gonorrhea! that's right, i've got a rainbow of discharge spewing from me just because a group of kids went playing around with a camcorder and somehow made a deal with the devil and got distribution. it's beyond my comprehension how anyone with moderate intelligence could tolerate this pant-load of a film. the only reason i managed to sit through the whole thing (not without several suicide attempts along the way) was because, well first off, i was delirious with boredom, and second - i guess i wanted to further explore this newly discovered type of hate i was experiencing... this movie is a 'shot-on-video' "horror/comedy" about three siblings who are left for the weekend in the care of their bitchy elderly aunt. the youngest kid ends up stabbing the old lady accidentally with his rambo-replica hunting knife. they then get to dismembering auntie with various tools (apparently she didn't have a single drop of blood in her body!) and heave her into their dad's rented wood chipper... her convict son then stops by looking for his mom and the kids end up grinding that jackass too... i don't recall ever seeing a cast of annoying actors that actually caused me nausea. seriously, that one blond chick's voice had me wincing in pain constantly. all of the actors were downright atrocious - literally just screaming their phony sounding dialog and cracking jokes that must've been written by a chimp that just didn't care! now, i can usually appreciate independent efforts, but only from those who can realize that people other than their relatives might be watching this! i don't need to see a 3 minute shot of a car pulling out of a drive-way and a torturous, painfully long lawn grooming montage with some ridiculous, fluttery music playing over it. plus, why the hell does the box of this movie have a bloody piano on it?! there was a piano in one scene and no one is killed near it! i'm through with reminiscing about this movie. unless you like insufferable crap, i would advise anyone with half a brain to avoid this trash.
