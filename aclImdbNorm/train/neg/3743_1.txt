jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to domesticate but europeans did, and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines.<br /><br />but then in the third episode he says that when the europeans in south africa got too far north they ran into zulu people and other tribes that *herded cattle and planted crops*. so what explains their lack of technological, economic, and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for success?<br /><br />diamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox (brought to north america by black slaves) were our biggest weapon. well, if 150 europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-military south africans can defeat 10,000 zulus *without a single casualty* in either case, then i think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant. with or without germs, we were going to succeed.<br /><br />he says malaria stopped europeans from colonizing further north, killing "thousands" of europeans while not affecting africans. (i'd like to know real numbers but he doesn't say.) then at the end he says today malaria is killing thousands of africans and that is why they can't catch up with us. so which is it, jared? did malaria help the africans by halting eurpeans or hurt them? and how come europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history? <br /><br />he also seems far too eager to say that the reasons europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck. at times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories he's reluctant to admit that maybe europeans were successful because they worked for it. it's sad watch this obvious neo-marxist contort reality to try to prove his point.
