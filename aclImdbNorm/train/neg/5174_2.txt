this movie was so bad i don't know whether to laugh or cry. i had high hopes for horrorfest that year, which was also the first year i attended horrorfest, and i have to say horrorfest and all of its films take false advertising to a whole new level. mad kudos to the advertisers because i'm sure they tricked a lot of people into spending money and seeing those movies that year. the hamiltons was easily the worst one of the ones i've seen (the other ones i saw were unrest, dark ride, and reincarnation). the movie cover and trailer made it seem like a family of cannibals terrorizing the neighborhood which i thought was a rather interesting plot, only to be disappointed at the end discovering that it was some 'coming of age' tale about a boy's transition into being a vampire. which is why drama prevails over any sense of horror in this film. and to make the plot even more ridiculous, they add in a set of horny twins who can't wait to take a 'bite' out of one another, and some deadly creature locked in the basement, which if i had discovered what 'it' was had the secret not been revealed at the very end of the film, i would have left the theater halfway into the movie.<br /><br />complete waste of money and time. cut forty minutes out of this film, and make it into an episode on some show like smallville or charmed or supernatural and it would have received more praise than this. absolute rubbish! so bad that two years later, i have to come back to imdb and write a review about it because it still stands out in my memory as one of the worst movies i've ever seen. also, while you're reading this, steer clear from the rest of the horrorfest movies in the future. the most you could do is rent them from blockbusters or watch it online somewhere. horrorfest features movies from independent filmmakers who can't make it onto the big screen, and all the crap about 'stuff they don't show you in theaters', they weren't referring to blood or guts, or horror...they were referring to the movies themselves. because they're horrendous. think of horrorfest as a less renowned version of sundance film festival, but for horror movies.<br /><br />sorry for all the 'hate', but next time think twice before you cheat costumers out of their money.
