666: the child starts as a plane crashes, the only survivor of flight 666 was a young boy named donald (boo boo stewart) who is adopted by news reporter erika (sarah lieving) & her cameraman husband scott lawson (adam vincent) after they covered the incident for channel 6 news. at first donald seems like any normal kid but death seems to follow him around, after warnings from a nun & vicar scott begins to believe that donald is evil & the cause of all the deaths...<br /><br />this straight-to-dvd horror flick was directed by jake perez under the pseudonym jake jackson & one has to say 666: the child is really rather poor. whenever i see the asylum is responsible for a film i get worried, i get very worried since their track record is awful. they seem to specialise in making &/or distributing low budget horror films which are usually rip-offs of some recent successful big budget horror film & in the case of 666: the child you don't need a degree in rocket science to realise that it's a complete rip-off to cash in on the recent the omen (2006) which was released the same year. the script by benjamin henry & austin laurel is terrible & simply can't match the ambitions of the the hollywood equivalent, i mean just what exactly does donald the antichrist expect to achieve from a middle class family in a small town? it's hardly a great starting point to bring about the destruction of thew world is it? every character in 666: the child is some form of the main character's from the omen, the adopted parents, the priest who tries to warn them & the sinister babysitter. there's a real lack of incident, there's barely any gore & the plot is poor. i mean donald killing a dentist because they were trying to fix his teeth is just so random & needless, what were all the disgusting pictures donald drew all about, where did the babysitter come from & there's just nothing that ties everything together & it's just a disjointed mess that just becomes very boring very quickly. the references to the number 6 also becomes annoying & are very unsubtle.<br /><br />director perez does alright i suppose, it's competent if nothing else. there's virtually no blood or gore, there's a few sprays of blood, a cut off hand & someone gets a circular saw stuck in their face but it sounds a lot better than it looks on screen. it's certainly not scary, there's no atmosphere thanks to a throughly bland contemporary setting in a suburban house & there's no tension because we never really know what donald is trying to do & there fore there's no threat from him.<br /><br />technically the film is alright, it's reasonably well made but since the actual film is so poor it makes little difference. the acting isn't that great but at the same time i've seen worse.<br /><br />666: the child is a poor mans the omen rip-off, i'd sooner watch either the original or the remake over this any day of the week. not good & definitely not recommended. followed by the sequel 666: the beast (2007) which also went straight-to-dvd.
