geez, as a gay man who lives in nyc i can gratefully say that i have never seen the underbelly of gay culture that is portrayed in this film - and i am glad of it!!! was this film broadcast on tv across the united states there would be a great anti-gay backlash and i cannot say that i would blame them. the people in this film do not represent the average gay american or even the average trandgender american, what they do represent is a sheer and utter nightmare. the inclusion of obviously underage characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments (anti-white) are blatant and unsettling - society cannot be blamed for people who have chosen drugs, unemployment and rejection of education on the part of the film's "cast" - the actions of these people are not acts of desperation, but rather a rejection of anything resembling personal ambition and a willingness to make something out of one's self.
