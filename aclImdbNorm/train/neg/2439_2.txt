"intensive care" by dorna von rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made.this extremely cheap dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations.a horror veteran george kennedy is completely wasted as as professor bruckner.the acting is abysmal,the action is slow and the climax is laughable.a famous surgeon has a car accident.he lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage."intensive care" is clearly influenced by american slasher films including "halloween" and "friday the 13th" series.the killings are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully stupid.still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look.you'll laugh until it hurts with this one-you can believe me!
