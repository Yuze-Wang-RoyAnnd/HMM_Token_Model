we should have been suspicious to discover that with only two minutes to lights out we were the only ones there. only five others joined before the movie began.<br /><br />there is nothing at all to redeem this movie. the acting is awful (especially ms hurley). the script is banal. the effects we've seen a million times. the film direction the worst that we've seen. meandering and disjointed. no-one laughed including the kids.<br /><br />we left after 25 minutes. it would have been sooner if my wife hadn't gone for a hot-dog!!!<br /><br />do not waste your money on this film. if there's nothing else to watch at your cinema then buy some drinks, popcorn and hot-dogs and do some people watching. you'll have a much more enjoyable time!!!<br /><br />
