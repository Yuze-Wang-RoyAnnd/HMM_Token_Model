i had no real expectations going into this movie and i'm glad. even if i had expected it to be bad i would have been disappointed.<br /><br />where to start? first, i think 15% of the movie consisted of stock footage of stationary scarecrows in a dark jungle-field. i get it. there's scarecrows. i think the title "scarecrows" was sufficient.<br /><br />second, not a damn thing is ever explained regarding the scarecrows and paranormal occurrences. there's too many times where i was left going wtf?<br /><br />third, the movie takes itself seriously. i'm all for a b-movie with buckets of blood, screaming women, and senseless violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or ancient curse. but those movies often know they're b-movies and even flaunt it, like dead snow (hilarious scandanavian zombie flick) or evil dead 2. but this movie seems oblivious to its crapdom.<br /><br />finally, there should of been more blood and/or nudity. yea, i said it. if you're going to have a crap horror movie, make with the killing. and if you're going to have one hot and one semi-hot girl, one of them needs to show some side-boob at a minimum.<br /><br />so, like the summary says, skip "scarecrows" and just poke yourself in the eye. you'll thank me.
