max had the v-8, trace (wheels of fires last and only hero) has a jet engine on the back of his car allowing him to make unintentionally humorous faces as he rockets around the halfway desolate wasteland. be amazed as mad max 2 (aka the road warrior) is dissected and spliced back together as a new movie albeit filmed in a lackluster manner with bad actors and lousy stunt work.<br /><br />why is wof set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland? simple, the road warrior was! actually any questions can be answered by: it was that way in the road warrior! except for the out of work mutant actors from the original 60's the time machine film that make a cameo appearance for sake of giving the audience some non-vehicular action to chew on for a few minutes.<br /><br />in typical 80's fashion, all cars driven by bad guys that are bumped or slightly jostled explode in a huge billowing explosion. inevitably all car chases will happen near convenient cliff sides and cars will unavoidably fall off of them. along with this 80's cinematic wild ride is the general rampant misogyny in this style of cheapie film. generally i waited for trace's rocket powered car to accelerate and shoot flames so there would be another shot of him scrunching up his face like he is supposed to be tough, which comes off more as him looking constipated. badly choreographed action coupled with bad acting makes this film a true sinker. the unintentional humor value even manages to wear thin.<br /><br />rats: nights of terror by bruno mattei is superior. and that in and of itself is saying a lot! by this count 2020 texas gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to wheels of fire. a poor road warrior knock off that doesn't have near enough cheese factor to make the film watchable.<br /><br />
