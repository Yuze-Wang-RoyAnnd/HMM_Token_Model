this, and immoral tales, both left a bad taste in my mouth. it seems to me that borowczyk is disgusted by sex, and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex. as a film, it's not very well done -- some of the acting is truly epically bad (such as the "american" woman with the french accent). the young woman's sudden flip-flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested (when it seems like it should have been the other way around), and the aunt's sudden realization of the young man's secret don't make sense -- they're not explained at all. i also didn't like how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family's perversion or predilection for bestiality. the central idea, the idea that there's this "sexy beast," if you will, that lives in the woods, could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story, but instead is just used as a basis for a nasty, sex-negative, morality play.
