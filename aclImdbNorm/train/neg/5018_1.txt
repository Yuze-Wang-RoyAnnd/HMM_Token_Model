i rented this film just to see amber benson, though after reading the box i thought it sounded like a good story.....however the first problem was that there really wasn't a story...or actually there was a story but it made absolutely no sense. the second problem was there was no set up for these characters...yes i got that they all went to school together, but within the first 3 minutes of the film you realized they had nothing else in common and didn't like each other...so why did they keep getting together. flaw number 3...the director though long pauses and tight camera shots equaled suspense (especially with the typical suspense music dubbed in)...he was sadly mistaken. it was painful to watch a terrific actress like amber benson waste time trying to bring this back to life....my only hope is the money she made here was put toward producing her own film.
