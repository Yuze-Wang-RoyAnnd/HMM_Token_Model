this film so not funny - such a waste of great stars, who seem to be caught up so in their own stardom that they forget. only shining moments belong to john cleese as the hotel manager who likes to dress up - you almost fall out of your chair with helpless laughter when he dances to donna summer's "bad girls" while wearing high heels, a mink coat and a dainty hat. the rest: forget it!
