ya i rented it, so shoot me!<br /><br />a decent premise sets up an otherwise awkward story with no real payoff, but at least it's shot well. director jon keeyes takes the simple idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside. in most cases this should be a slam dunk, but this little stinker derails quite quickly. the cinematography is above average and the acting is mediocre at best, but the story and writing is just plain awful. slower scenes drag on forever and the scares are too few and far in between with no real climax to the film. an eerie mood is set at the beginning but loses it's luster before any type of horror transpires, and i found myself bored to death and making another sandwich... the cover art is appealing and i suppose it's worth a rental if you're looking for mindless low budget dreck, but if you enjoy a good story and eventful ending, reach for something else.
