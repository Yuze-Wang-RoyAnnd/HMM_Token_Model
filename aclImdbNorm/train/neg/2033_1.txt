if i could give it less that 1 i would. do not bother to rent; if someone gives you the dvd burn it.<br /><br />this is horrible movie making. a total waste of even digital "film". i have seen better on youtube made by 12 year old boys. lommel claims to have written this, if that is the case he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages. the story line is none existent, the dialog is mainly screaming, the camera work is some sort of attempted arty flairs with nonsensical cutting of totally unrelated jumps to either industrial transportation scenes or some sort of odd angry young woman rift.<br /><br />i can usually follow a less than obvious plot or see the purpose in a "creative" film - i like david lynch.<br /><br />this one is either so far beyond my limited powers of comprehension i missed it or it is totally pointless. i think this is a "lets see if we can grab a title that will be coming out soon and do a weird rift on it and see if we can grab some of the bucks" con job.<br /><br />i cannot see why lionsgate even bothered with this. totally worthless, it is so bad i will not rent any other by this same director.
