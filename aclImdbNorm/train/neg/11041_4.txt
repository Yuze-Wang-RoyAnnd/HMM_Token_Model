the show is average. it doesn't make me laugh particularly. however, i think courtney really brings it down. she doesn't look natural. she has these three ways to talk, all robotic. she talks quietly (with no intonation), she talks normally (with no intonation), or she does that thing where she starts talking normally, and starts yelling gradually. however, her yelling is like "let's pretend i'm yelling because i shouldn't be too loud on the set". <br /><br />she is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing. it's annoying. you can't really get her personality, because she doesn't really produce emotion, and doesn't get upset. she has this husband, who's doing all these stupid things, and there is no reaction from her. very dry and plain acting.
