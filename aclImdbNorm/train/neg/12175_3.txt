why review good movies when you can review "trancers ii?"<br /><br />ooh, this film is soooo lame. i can just picture the cast and crew driving around l.a. with a camcorder, hurling extras in silly monster make-up at poor, long-suffering tim thomerson. the stars' families actually turn up to play cameos, probably because full moon couldn't afford "real" extras. lame effects, lame sets, and a script so convoluted it would take eons to untie all the knots - this must be classic trancers!<br /><br />and yet...and yet...it rules. note this is the same thing i say about "trancers iv." i say it because it's true. what can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies, then bust out with quips like, "don't worry ladies, they're bio-degradable"? well, lots of things could be better, but anyway this is still good stuff.<br /><br />my only significant reservation is megan ward, who really stinks up the joint. she's a lousy rival for helen hunt's character - they're both young pieces of eye candy, and it would've been more effective if they actually contrasted a bit more. oh well, you can't have everything. at least the wonderful plot device of the "long second watch" is back in place, and we've got more of hap ashby, the least-convincing athlete in the history of cinema (oh, wait a minute - he's got a rival in the form of david ogden steirs in "creator").<br /><br />i haven't seen this lately, but i do seem to remember that martine beswick runs away twice during the final battle. hooray for lousy continuity! just one of the many highlights in this fine film.
