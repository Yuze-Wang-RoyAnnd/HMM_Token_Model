i was expecting a b-movie french musical. after all, dh'ery, blanche, defun`es were superstars of low budget french films of that time. and it is in color! but i have hallucination in this unbelievable one hour 30 of pure mediocrity. musical numbers are awful, and comedy is absolutely boring and stupid. and the songs? what songs? this is just a succession of bad numbers, one after another. the only one very rare thing about that thing is the nudity of women. it was not familiar at that time. in fact, some numbers are just there to show us topless women. it adds to the mediocrity! and try to find young michel serrault, the future great actor of french cinema, in a bit part as a musician, in his very first movie. good luck!
