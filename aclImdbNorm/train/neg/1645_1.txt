i just watched this movie last night, and i had to put a warning out for anybody else considering to see this film. in a word - don't. i seriously feel like this is something that a screenwriting student would have written in a quentin tarantino/eddie murphy phase, i.e. every other word was a curse word. i don't have a problem with profuse cursing, as in "good will hunting", provided it helps to delve more into the characters. in this case it was just hollow banter with the attempt to draw an occassional *gasp* or laughter from the audience. the three lead characters are all their own unique stereotype, the wall street jerk, the coffee house jerk, and the "i'm-not-gay-just-in-touch-with-my-feminine-side" slightly-less-of-a-jerk. you just don't give a damn about any of them! they are all shallow, unredemable losers who you want to see lose. for those who dare, this film does have a couple funny moments, the very beginning, and the very end. the toilet/vibrator scene is funny in a sick kinda "uh, yeah" way. really though, i would only recommend this film to my worst of enemies.
