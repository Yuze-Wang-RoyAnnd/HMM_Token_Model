the cast of this film contain some of new zealander's better actors, many of who i have seen in fabulous roles, this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them. the fake american accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong. as another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry, decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot. most of the cast appear to be from the (great) long running new zealand soap shortland street. it's as if this movie was dreamt up at a shortland street cast christmas party, the result of too many gins, and possibly a bit of salmonella. imagine "under siege" meets "the love boat", staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea.<br /><br />if you are an actor, i recommend you see this film, as a study on how to destroy your carer.
