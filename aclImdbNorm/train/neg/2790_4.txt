julia (kristina copeland) travels with her husband steven harris (steven man) and their baby son alex to spend a couple of days with her family in savage island, an island of their own. the couple expects to resolve their issues along the weekend in the remote island. while waiting for the boat, julia and steven meet two weird men in the harbor, and when her brother peter (brendan beiser) arrives, he explains that a family of hillbilly squatters is living in the island. the reckless peter smoke pot while driving the truck in the night and turns the headlight off to show off; however, he accidentally runs over the young son of the savage's family, but in the dark he believes he has hit an animal. later, the savage family claims alex as a compensation for their lost son. the young family does not accept the trade, and they initiate a deadly war between families.<br /><br />"savage island" is a very low-budget movie, with a stupid screenplay, amateurish cinematography but surprisingly good acting. the flawed story is totally absurd, and there are many unbelievable situations. for example, how could two men leave two women with the baby alone in the road during the night with the menace of the deranged family? the logical procedure would be going immediately to the continent and bringing police force to rescue peter. then the young family vanishes; julia and steven leave their car in the continent and their house and friends, and nobody chases them? peter calls his sister julia of alex when he arrives with the boat in the beginning. there are so many flaws in this flick that i could spend many lines writing about this subject. i believe this film was filmed with a home video camera so awful the images are. the good cast deserved a better material to work. my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil): "ilha de sangue" ("island of blood")
