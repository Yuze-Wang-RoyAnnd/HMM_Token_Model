john heder was absolutely horrendous in this movie. i felt like i was watching a bad college kid act for the first time in a student film. anna farris was par for the course, not good, but not horrible (plus she's cute). dianne keaton should have known better. jeff daniels was the only saving grace in this movie (even though it was poor judgement on his part as well). <br /><br />all in all, i would avoid this at all costs. i'm just glad i didn't pay to see it! <br /><br />john heder will forever be stuck in the typecast role of' the dorky kid,' unless he does some serious work on his acting chops.
