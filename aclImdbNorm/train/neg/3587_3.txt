how can they from joe don baker (as bufford pusser in the first sequel) to bo svenson (as bufford pusser in the second sequel).why did they do that for.just because bo svenon look more a like to bufford pusser they still should'nt of changed it because the first sequel it was joe don baker as bufford pusser and that one of the thing i wanted to see in the second sequel.<br /><br />i would've given this movie a 7 out of 10 and i would've given it a 1 out of 10 if the story did'nt have anything to do with bufford pusser's life but it did and that why i had given this movie a 3 out 10.<br /><br />i strongly suggest that anyone who is planning on watching this cheese i suggest don't and watch the first sequel instead.
