this movie is just not worth your time. its reliance upon new-age mysticism serves as its only semi-interesting distraction. the plot is one that has been re-cycled countless times.<br /><br />i was only prompted to even spend the time to put in a comment when i noted that some have tried to prop-up the reputation of this drivel. their motivation & objectivity is dubious, since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults, but at its well intentioned message of new age consciousness.<br /><br />so would it be alright for some twenty to thirty evangelical christians, or islamic fundamentalists to pour in positive ratings about movies/television that support their views? in spite of the poor qualities of production, or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis? i hope not.<br /><br />i am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie, in spite of the truth.
