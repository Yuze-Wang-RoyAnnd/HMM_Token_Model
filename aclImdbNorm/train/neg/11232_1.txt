it is so sad. even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake, there's nothing out there & . the music they play in this is the funniest stuff i've ever heard. i like the brother and sister in this movie. they both don't try very hard to sound sarcastic when they're saying stuff like "my friends are going to be so jealous!" hey, whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning? thats retarded! i practically ignored the second half of this. my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe. the same exact sound for every chop!
