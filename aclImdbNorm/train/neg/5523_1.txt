georgia rule has got to be one of - if not the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. the whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp, "what?" out loud at least 7-10 times throughout its grueling two hour course.<br /><br />advertised in its trailer as a movie about three generations of women - jane fonda as the matriarch, felicity huffman as her daughter, and lindsay lohan as the rebellious, over- sexed, scantily clad grand-daughter, the viewer thinks this will be a clich'e, light, chick-flick about growing up and coming together as a family.<br /><br />talk about false advertisement at it worst.<br /><br />after many shots of animals doing "funny" things in the background of "pivotal" scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes into a doctor's office weekly to have her diaper changed, or the fact that this movie is actually about lindsay lohan's character being sexually abused by her step-father, georgia rule creates its own genre of cinema : the ungrounded, horribly acted, inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most awkward, surreal, strange way. if garry marshall wanted this movie to be a drama/comedy, then he should have watched the royal tenenbaums. sideways. junebug. and so on. and so on.<br /><br />the only way i feel i can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that georgia rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation. say that the movie, the 40 year old virgin, was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child. but instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn, belly laughs and comedy would ensue, with all of the characters' reactions being that of fake, lifeless, human beings pretending to care. <br /><br />throw in a yellow parakeet, dermot mulroney as the flattest, most non-dimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script, along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy, too-tanned girl who shares none of the same interests as he, as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene, unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other, and you've got georgia rule.<br /><br />i found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers, screenwriters, actors, editors, etc..who have a lot more talent and aren't getting noticed.<br /><br />don't see this movie : my rule. <br /><br />and if you must, get sufficiently drunk before hand.
