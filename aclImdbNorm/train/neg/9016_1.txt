dragon fighter is the first sci-fi channel (although i guess it's now called syfy?) original movie i have ever seen. but i have seen one or two others since, and i can tell you that they were stupid, but this one really scrapes the bottom of the barrel. the cgi is done poorly, the acting is bad, the script is ridiculous, and what happens at the very end is unexpected and out of place (if you have seen dragon fighter, you probably know what i mean; i didn't want to put a spoiler in my review). plus, there was this one musical tune that was used in pretty much every single dangerous sequence. that was really stupid; they just played it over and over. and it's definitely not original; i know i've heard that somewhere before (i just can't remember where). this is one to avoid.
