falls into the film category of "way too ridiculous in the dialogue and execution departments to be taken seriously". whereas shriek if you know what i did last friday the thirteenth or my boyfriend's back know they are bad, scarecrows doesn't. evil dead set such a high standard for the comedic horror on a budget genre, that scarecrows is simply out of place. <br /><br />suspicions of inexperience are immediately at play as there are no hints of noise or vibration in the hull and cockpit of an airborne plane. the repeated display of a picture of 3 men just screams for a story arc, but nothing comes. although the men are obviously the scarecrows, there is no explanation.<br /><br />knowing this film is too serious for it's own good may produce some grins. i don't recall if joe bob briggs ever previewed scarecrows, but i believe that he wouldn't stoop this low. however, with an imdb rating of over 6, there are many people that disagree.
