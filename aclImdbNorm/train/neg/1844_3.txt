personally i think this show looks pretty cheaply made. some of the actors are terrible. they over do it & seem fake. i can always tell how it's going to end within the first 10 minutes or less of watching because they make it so transparently clear. it's not very well written either. i love to watch it to laugh at it. you know the saying "it's so bad that it's good?" well, that saying applies to this show. i also like to watch just to see if i'm right when i guess how it's all going to end. so far i've been right every time. it's like a little game that i play. it's nice when you are bored & you feel like laughing at something.
