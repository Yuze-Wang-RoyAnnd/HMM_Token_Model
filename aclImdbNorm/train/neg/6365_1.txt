wow, i knew this film was going to be bad but not this bad. spoilerific comments ensue.<br /><br />roddy roddy piper is sickly sweet retired cop (cliche!), helping out everyone - smiling like a post-op lobotomy patient through-out and lamenting over his dead son. his adopted son returns from armed forces "special ops" and because he's "seen things" - portrayed by clenching his teeth if anyone mentions anything about the past. time to clean up the streets from another guy who once knew piper and his dead son (who the bad lad killed) and his adopted son.<br /><br />oh, the love interest is a pretty young lady who decides for no reason that she wants to jump the bones of the ex-army bloke. this happens in about 2 minutes of 1 scene.<br /><br />the action could have saved this film, but it's even worse than the storyline and acting. it's all been done before, it's all been done much much better (ong-bak is a prime example). this is the worst film i've ever seen - and i've seen waterworld, twice.<br /><br />erm, the film is called honor (spelt wrong for the americans) and the tag line has "from the makers of bloodsport and kickboxer" - check out director david worths other films and you'll soon realise why they put these 2 films on there, even though they are over 10 years old. such classics as "shark attack 3: megalodon" - says it all really.<br /><br />i'll give you lb10 if you don't go to see this film.<br /><br />ps - apologise for not know character names, tells you something though.
