this is, quite literally, the worst movie i have ever watched in my life. it may be the worst movie possible. some movies are so bad that they're good; this movie is so bad that it goes past enjoyable camp and simply becomes unwatchably awful. it is the anti-enantiodromia. we bought it with the intent to heckle, and all of my family gathered around for a fun evening of clever remarks; instead, we sat in stunned silence, pitying poor peter sellers.<br /><br />this is worse than the animated lord of the rings. it is worse than the matrix sequels. it is worse than krull. it is worse than any batman movie.<br /><br />do not, under any circumstances, let this movie approach within ten feet of your television.
