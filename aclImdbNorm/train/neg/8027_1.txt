i watched this movie. to the end. and that was really not easy. it is so boring, bad played and in nearly every detail stolen from "blair witch project" that you can't believe the makers take this serious. even harder to believe, is how this "product" made it onto vhs and dvd.<br /><br />so, if want to see a horror-movie, just watch "scream", but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time, watching some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showing of their inability, watch dark area.
