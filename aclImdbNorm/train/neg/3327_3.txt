two sisters, their perverted brother, and their cousin have car trouble. they then happen about the home of dr. hackenstein whom conveniently needs the body parts of three nubile young women to use in an experiment to bring his deceased lover back to life. he tells them that he'll help them get home in the morning, so they spend the night. then the good doctor gets down to work in this low-budget horror-comedy.<br /><br />i found this to be mildly amusing, nothing at all to actually go out of your way for (i stumbled across it on netflix instant view & streamed it to the xbox 360), but better then i expected it to be for a troma acquired film. most of the humor doesn't work, but their are still some parts that caused me to smile. plus the late, great anne ramsey has a small part and she was always a treat to watch.<br /><br />eye candy: bambi darro & sylvia lee baker got topless <br /><br />my grade: d+
