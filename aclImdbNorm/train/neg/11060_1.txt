it could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of america's most notorious serial killers, but sadly it doesn't even come close. terrible editing, direction, bad acting, you name it. this movie is literally about 10 minutes of plot stretched into 100. the only redeeming quality is bruce davidson as the father, but that's not nearly enough to save this stinker. a 1 out of 10.
