my friends and i rented this for "bad movie night" with high hopes, but the brain was something of a letdown. the brain itself is gloriously goofy-looking, but it mostly just sits on its little platform. who thought that it would be cool that the brain only gets to munch on three people throughout 94 drawn-out minutes? this movie has a number of things going for it at first, including an estevez-knockoff lead playing a rebellious genius (we're told that his enormous intellect is misdirected into his elaborate pranks and school stunts, which include putting krazy glue on someone's chair). it also has some great lines, a hilariously out-of-shape and out-of-breath henchman who just barely manages to be everywhere, and, yeah, some chick gets naked. however, the director desperately needs some schooling in the art of pacing. during the last half things just start to drag on and on, with at least 3 or 4 pointless, boring chase scenes making up the middle third of the plot. the scenes inside the pri complex are especially bad. at least 15 minutes of this movie are people running up and down the same stairwell. i could've fixed the screenplay to this thing in half an hour- more cheese, more gore, more nudity, more brain action. if you're going to make a bad horror movie, at least give me something cool to look at while my superego shuts down. maybe the director was trying to really bring the audience into his movie- i started feeling like one of the zombified townsfolk by the end of this crapfest.
