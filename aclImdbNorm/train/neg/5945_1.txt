a black guy fights ..... and supposedly wins .... yeah ... 1/10. obviously fiction.<br /><br />so we're presented with a damm nice title, a real nice tag line and even a nice plot line .. thats about it, thats where it ends.. we move into fiction after that.<br /><br />michael jai white, the black guy so don't get confused with the name.. portrays a black guy.. umm, thats all there is to the name..<br /><br />its so hard to find decent help, must have hired the black guys friends to help cause the low budget, low ineptness of this movie, has the camera's shadow trailing the first scenes.... yeah obvious idiot moment for the average guy like you and me.. but yeah...<br /><br />10 lines. review submitted,. if you paid to see this movie, you got screwed.
