i usually like comedy movies. i really enjoy them. but i don't really get the point of "envy". i mean, it has a dull content/topic, and it's not really funny.<br /><br />although the acting is generally good, it's not enough for the movie to get at least a bit interesting. stiller and black don't show all their talent in this movie.<br /><br />so, if you're about to rent a comedy, i suggest you definitely don't go for this one. unless you want to get bored, and i can see i'm not the only one with this opinion, because even jack black apologized for it (take a look at trivia).
