"creepshow 2" is little more than a pale imitation of the original, designed with little purpose other than to cash in on the name of the previous film. it even amplifies the flaws of its predecessor, which was often predictable and heavy-handed. still, the first time around, there were enough thrills to make up for it's periodic lulls, resulting in an uneven but overall fairly entertaining effort. the sequel has few worthwhile moments, so the transparency of the stories are even more apparent. once in a while, it delivers, but most of the time, it just lingers there.<br /><br />as in the original, all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just desserts. a wooden indian comes to life, wreaking vengeance upon the killers of its owner. teenagers are devoured by an aquatic monster. a hitchhiker returns from the dead to pursue a careless motorist. none of these premises are inherently bad in themselves, but they are utterly lacking in inspiration. there are few surprises and no scares. this a textbook example of unmotivated, by-the-numbers filmmaking. it doesn't help that this cheap-looking movie suffers from a flat directorial style, although to be honest, there wasn't much to work with. in the end, the second story comes off best, but not by much. <br /><br />for the most part, the performances are okay at best. george kennedy, as the ill-fated general store owner, does an adequate, if not particularly inspired job. dorothy lamour, on the other hand, is quite good as the guilt-ridden motorist, evoking sympathy for her plight despite the predictable, redundant material. however, most of the characters are pretty thin overall. <br /><br />one would think that "creepshow 2" would have turned out better. george romero, who directed the original, returned to pen the screenplay, based on more of stephen king's stories. makeup effects artist tom savini turns in some good, gory work. so why is the film a letdown? i guess romero didn't really want to make a second film, but was forced to do so for financial reasons. it was a decade of horror sequels, clones, rip-offs, and whatnot, so this one was certainly inevitable. i can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry, picking up his paycheck, and running off. i guess he had to do what was necessary to get his own projects financed; we can't blame him.<br /><br />rating: *1/2 (out of ****)<br /><br />released by new world pictures
