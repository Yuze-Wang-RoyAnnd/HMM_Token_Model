this is probably one of the worst french movies i have seen so far, among more than 100 french movies i have ever seen. terrible screenplay and very medioacre/unprofessional acting causes the directing powerless. with all that it doesn't matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the story.<br /><br />one of the key weakness of this movie is that these two characters do not attract people, as an audience i don't care what happens to them. <br /><br />it amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes, man, i love almost all the awarded movies in cannes, but not this one. a major disappointment for me.
