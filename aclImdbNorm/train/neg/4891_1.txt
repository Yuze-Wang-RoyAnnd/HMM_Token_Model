i want to clarify a few things. i am not familiar with ming-liang tsai movies, and i am very familiar with art cinema; i grow up in the seventies times of goddard, fellini, bergman, bertolucci and many others.<br /><br />art movies then were really art; like paints. people did it to express their inner feelings, not really worried about if other people understand anything. they were beyond commercial values; just look some old antonioni (or early picasso) and you will understand.<br /><br />tian bian yi duo yun (the wayward cloud) has nothing to do with that. it is an opportunistic movie, intended to fool festival judges and critics, playing many things without saying anything.<br /><br />the story makes no sense. the lack of water makes the government to promote the use of watermelons to hydrate. a girl in desperation, steal water from the public bathrooms wc. there is also a porno start (neighbor) trying to make a movie with an actress he does not seems to feel comfortable with. there is some romantic awakening between the girl and the porno star. the mess ends with a sexual scene (not pornographic) that many people feel shocked about, but i believe it is less provocative than you can see in american pie or history of violence.<br /><br />the two main characters never talk. sometimes, a musical number 60 style appears and explains (through a song) what is happening in characters minds. these video clips, are really welcomed because the previous scene, without dialog or music only people looking at each other, takes sometimes 4, 5 or even more minutes which in movie times is too much. <br /><br />there is also a few bits about "the difficult to make sex without love", the "selfish mind of the porno industry". <br /><br />it is obvious, this movie intended (get away with it) to fool festival juries and critics. it have a few pseudo-shocking scenes (within the limits of taiwan censorship) and many subjects are open, but nothing is concluded or goes anywhere. <br /><br />these tricks, got the movie a few (disputed) important prices in film festivals and get the movie an undeserved commercial success (i see the movie in france and the theater was packed). <br /><br />however, please, do not be fooled. there is nothing new or original or even originally told or filmed in this movie. it is boring and empty; really a fraud to public. boogie nights (which i did not really liked), intimacy and 9 songs are far better movies.
