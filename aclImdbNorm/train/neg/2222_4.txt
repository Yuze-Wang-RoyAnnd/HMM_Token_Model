carlo verdone once managed to combine superb comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticism.<br /><br />then something happened, and he turned into just another dull "holier-than-thou" director.<br /><br />il mio miglior nemico can more or less be summarized in one line "working class = kind and warm, while upper-class = snob and devious. but love wins in the end".<br /><br />such a trite clich`e for such a smart director.<br /><br />there isn't really too much to talk about in the movie. every character is a walking stereotype: the self-made-man who forgets his roots but who'll become "good" again, the scorned wife, the rebellious rich girl who falls for the honest-but-poor guy... acting is barely average.<br /><br />severely disappointing under every aspect.
