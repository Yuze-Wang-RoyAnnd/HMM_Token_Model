i saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. its so bad that it is actually funny in a very cringe worthy way.<br /><br />gael is absolutely terrible, i mean he just cannot act, period. he should give up now, as acting is clearly not his thing.. his co-stars are about the same caliber, i'm sure my 5 year old cousin could do a better job than all of them! the director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous.. somehow i don't think an oscar is on the cards for this guy.<br /><br />i have never written a comment on imdb, but this movie was so bad i felt compelled to do so.<br /><br />if you get the chance to see this film, don't 0/10 if there was a 0
