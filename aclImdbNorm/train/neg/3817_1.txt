seriously. this is one of the most stupid family shows of all time.<br /><br />plot- a family without a mother and 3 "dads" raise 3 little girls in san francisco, california.<br /><br />characters- neat freak danny, cartoon loving joey, hair obsessed jesse, spoiled brat michelle, stupid dj, and almost normal stephanie. the creators of this show really want you to hate the characters, don't they? <br /><br />therefore, i do not think anyone should watch this show. i only chuckled at a few moments in the show's whole running, and i think that instead of lethal injection, all criminals should be forced to watch this show, a torture far worse than anything else.<br /><br />1.5/10 or: d
