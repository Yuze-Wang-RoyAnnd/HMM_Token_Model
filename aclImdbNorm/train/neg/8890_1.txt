for my first taste of shakespeare on stage, i cannot believe what these people did to a perfectly good play. <br /><br />-let's start off with the good bit, shall we?-<br /><br />alan rickman is alright, although some of his dialog could have been delivered with more feeling. the rest of the actors needed to pull it together. <br /><br />romeo, romeo, whyfore art thou not dead yet, romeo? the actor, while not only completely wooden and deadpan, could not read his lines with any gusto at all. he was completely out of focus, had difficulty even looking juliet in the face, and absolutely no grace with the lines that he was given. whoever cast him deserves to be punished. juliet is almost passable, but she gives no depth to her character,and seems to be completely out of touch with the play. mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of character for the entirety of his dialog. benvolio was unfeeling and mercilessly choppy with his lines. <br /><br />i was forced to endure this half-baked production of romeo and juliet. the acting was stilted and the costumes were nothing short of distracting. i have seen kindergarten puppet shows with more effort put into them. i only wish that i could give this movie a rating of zero.
