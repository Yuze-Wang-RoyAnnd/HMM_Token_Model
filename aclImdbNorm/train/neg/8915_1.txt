my comments on this movie have been deleted twice, which i find pretty offending, since i am making an effort to judge this movie for other people. please be tolerant of other people's opinion. obviously writing in the spirit of nietzsches works is not understood, so ill change my comment completely.<br /><br />i think this is a really bad movie for several reasons.<br /><br />subject: one should be very careful in making a movie about a philosopher that is even today not understood by the masses and amongst peers brings out passionate discussions. one thing philosophers do agree on is that nietzsche was a great thinker. so making a movie about his life, which obviously includes his 'ideas' is a thing one should be extremely careful with, or preferably, don't do at all. wisdom starts with knowing what you don't know. one might think this is not a review of the movie itself, but the movie is not about an imaginary character, it is about the life of someone who actually lived and had/has great influence on the world of yesterday, today and tomorrow. if someone tells a story about a tomato, i can express my thoughts about the story itself, but also about the chosen subject, the tomato. there is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about actual facts. specially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken.<br /><br />screenplay: one of the first things i noticed were the ridiculous accents. why? it distracts from what it should be about; nietzsche and the truths he found. it doesn't help putting things in a right geographical perspective or time! come on, make it proper english or better yet; german! even mel gibson got that part right... letting his characters speak some gibberish aramaic in the passion.<br /><br />secondly, it is well over-acted.<br /><br />3d, assante is not an actor to depict nietzsche. bad casting.<br /><br />4th, facts are way off.<br /><br />and so on. its a waste of celluloid.
