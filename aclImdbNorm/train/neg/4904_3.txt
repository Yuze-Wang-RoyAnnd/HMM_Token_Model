teamo supremo are three kids, consisting of their leader- captain crandall, rope girl and skate lad, all with their own battlecry (buza! chika! woopa!) and outfit and moves. they work for the governor, kevin, and were recruited after wishing to be heroes and playing at that game. they lead normal lives as well, and have family and school duties, but most of the action takes place away from school fighting villains. the villains all have rather unique and singular traits, such as mister vague and his men who never seem to know what their plans are but act anyway. from an evil robot to a wicked baron the three have to encounter them and stop their evil, and often strange, plans to gain power, take revenge etc.<br /><br />the animation itself is quite nice and smooth, but the style appears to be simple on purpose. the backgrounds have overlapping colour and the buildings seem futuristic. the music is quite nice, and the show isn't too bad altogether, although the style isn't my favourite.<br /><br />the plots are almost always nonsensical and ridiculous, but after all this is a cartoon and one can't blame them for that. however this would not be in the same rank as fillmore! or pepper ann.
