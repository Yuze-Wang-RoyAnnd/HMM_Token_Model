about twenty minutes into this movie, i was already bored. quite simply, these characters were fairly dull. occasionally, something enjoyable would happen, but then things would slow down again. fortunately, my patience was eventually rewarded, and the ending to this movie wasn't bad at all. however, it was by no means good enough to justify sitting through the first ninety minutes. so, i would say that the movie was mediocre overall, and considering all of the talent in the cast, i'd call this a disappointment.
