i watched an episode. yes i sat through the entire miserable experience, and i have to say, this brand of comedy is one of the worst you will get. imagine peter griffin, of family guy fame. now imagine peter griffin as a(admittedly slim and minus the glasses) woman, except that he now lacks the something that made him hilarious. peter griffin is an idiot, but he doesn't know he's an idiot. sarah has none of the genuine character, none of the acting ability to pull her character off. maybe its the trite, formulaic jokes that pull her comedy even lower than her character can take it by herself. maybe it's the lack of believable foils. her insensitive, bigoted persona may appeal to insensitive, bigoted people unlike the mass appeal that stephen colbert's insensitive, bigoted character has. like bill o'reilly, sarah creates an annoying, unfunny character. she lacks something that is necessary for the genre of satire, let alone for the entire world of comedy. what sarah silverman lacks, its noticeable. and when you don't believe it and identify with it, it's not funny anymore.
