---what happened to these unlikeable people. alan arkin was, as usual, unfunny and just walks through the role. the kids are all a mess. mariesa tomei probably wishes this role had never come her way. and what are carl reiner and rita moreno doing in this really bad, mean movie? if you enjoy watching losers wallow in their disfunction, and not try in any way to do better, this is your film. all others, take a walk, read a book, or see something else.<br /><br />jane
