believe it or don't, i have my very own dvd copy of this "movie" which i bought at walgreens for a great big whole dollar. i'm still not sure if it was a dollar well spent or a dollar foolishly wasted.<br /><br />pretty amazing set designs and costumes. apparently much thought and effort went into their making. the set designs are very mexican in stylization. i liked them a lot. and santa is impressive. one of the more impressive santas in moviedom.<br /><br />i'm guessing the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a kids audience. but, somehow, it comes across quite deranged. in fact, i'm left stunned at how deranged it is.<br /><br />maybe it's the english dubbing that makes it seems so deranged and bizarre. one of the reasons i prefer to experience movies in the original language they were made and the use of english subtitles as dubbing often gives an unintended strangeness. the kid voices were at least dubbed with actual kid voices as opposed to women pretending to be kids which tends to sound very, very weird.<br /><br />did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their longjohns? you didn't? neither did i until i watched this movie. one learns something new everyday.<br /><br />is this movie actually worth watching? now, that's a tossup. i can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone as it's quite disturbing in its own bizarre way. yet, its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worth watching. you decide what you're going to do. i dunno... for myself, it made me feel uncomfortable seeing demons constantly doing cutesy ballet moves. now, that's just wrong...
