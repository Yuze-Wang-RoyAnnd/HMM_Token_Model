i screamed my head off because seeing this movie was my first movie going experience ever at some 13 months old. i remember it being incredibly bloody and it made me angry. i watched it again on tv a few years ago. big mistake -- the acting is wooden, the plot non-existent and the movie lacks merit unless 23 year-old t & a is what gets you going... 0/****
