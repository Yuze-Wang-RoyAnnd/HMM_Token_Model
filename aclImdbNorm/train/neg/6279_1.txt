no,<br /><br />basically your watching something that doesn't make sense. to not spoil the film for people who actually want to this take a look at the flick i will explain the story.<br /><br />a normal everyday to day women, is walking down a street then find's herself driving by in her own car. she follows her and many events take place during that time that include her and her family.<br /><br />i specifically made an account to comment on this film, of how horribly written this was. the acting was great, the events were great, but the story just brought it nowhere - it could of been added to tremendously and be made into a worldwide epidemic. i'm not sure what the writer was trying to accomplish by making this, usually at the end of films most of your questions get answers but this film has you asking, what just happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just passed for nothing.<br /><br />spoiler starts__<br /><br />they had this area between 2 dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would come into our world and kill us. it was not elaborated on all during the film, and you never know how it was happening or why it was or when it happened. nothing gets explained during the film. the main character shouldn't of even been the main character. at the end of the film the guy who finally figures it all out and runs away (her sisters boyfriend) should of been the main character but sadly the movie ends 20 seconds after. <br /><br />i bought this movie for $10, threw it out right after.. don't waste your time. i really hope nothing like this is made again.
