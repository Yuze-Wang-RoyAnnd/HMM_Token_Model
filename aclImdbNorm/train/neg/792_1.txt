thanks to the bbc for this show. i used to suffer from an inferiority complex, i hated leaving the house, talking to new people and i had an overwhelming sense that people hated me. however after watching one episode of 4 non blondes my fortunes started to change. after episode 2 i started applying for new jobs, wearing fashionable clothes and i actually felt talented. when the series had finished i was running the sales department at work, banging a plethora of women and frequently won the karaoke competition down my local. if you ever have a confidence crisis and don't know where to turn then take a trip down to poundland and pick up the dvd it's only 99p.
