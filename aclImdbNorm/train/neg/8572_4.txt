thin story concerns two small town brothers and their struggles over family honor. david morse is the responsible, straight-laced cop and 'good' brother; viggo mortensen, the 'bad' boy, is a former soldier and ex-convict. as an actor (particularly in his earliest years), sean penn seems to have modulated his performances under the method. turning first-time writer and director for this arty, obtuse drama, he works his script and characters out through the same methodical process, slowing the pacing down to a crawl (ostensibly so we can catch every nuance and inflection). this approach might be fascinating if there were three-dimensional characters to care about, but photogenic morse and mortensen aren't really convincing as siblings. worse, we expect more from prominently-billed veterans charles bronson and sandy dennis, who hardly get a chance to come through with anything interesting. the picture is balky with turgid sequences, a wobbly narrative and confusing editing (always slanted to point up the artistic excesses). penn's tricks with the camera show off a talented eye, yet they are mostly an irritation. *1/2 from ****
