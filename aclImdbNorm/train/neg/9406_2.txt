houseboat horror is a great title for this film. it's absolutely spot-on, and therefore the only aspect of the film for which i can give 10 out of 10. there are houseboats, there is horror, there's even horror that takes place on houseboats. but if there were ever a tagline for the film poster, it would surely be 'something shonky this way comes...' for houseboat horror is easily the worst australian horror film i've ever seen, not to mention one of the worst horror films i've ever seen, and a fairly atrocious attempt at film-making in general. the good news is, it's so bloody awful, it sails straight through the zone of viewer contempt into the wonderful world of unintentional hilarity. it's worth watching *because* it's bloody awful.<br /><br />the category of 'worst' comes not from the storyline, for the simple reason that there actually is one: a record producer, a film crew and a rock band drive up to the mystifyingly-named lake infinity, a picturesque rural retreat somewhere in victoria (in reality lake eildon) to shoot a music video. someone isn't especially happy to see them there and, possibly in an attempt to do the audience a favour, starts picking them off one by one with a very sharp knife. even more mystifying is how long it takes the survivors to actually notice this, <br /><br />on the surface, it looks like a very bog-standard b-movie slasher. you've got highly-annoying youths, intolerant elders, creepy locals (one of whom, a petrol station attendant, would easily win a gurning competition), and let's face it, my description of the murderer could easily be jason voorhees. ah, but if only the acting and production values were anywhere near as good as the comparative masterpiece that was friday the 13th part vii. unfortunately, houseboat horror is completely devoid of both these things.<br /><br />but in the end, this only makes what you do get so ridiculous and amusing. fans of one-time 'late show' and 'get this' member tony martin will already be aware of some of the real dialogue gems ('check out the view...you'll bar up!'), while the actual song to accompany the music video is so bad it has to be heard to be believed - i can't help wondering if writer/director ollie wood hoped it would actually become a hit. the horror element is comparable i think to b-slashers of the genre and particularly of the period, but there were times when i couldn't help imagining someone biting into a hamburger off-screen and seeing a volley of tomato sauce sprayed at the wall on-screen.<br /><br />indeed, if you've been listening to tony martin recommending this film as hilarious rubbish like myself, i don't think you'll be disappointed. any fans of 'so-bad-it's-good' horror should not pass up the opportunity. whether you'll 'bar up' or not though is another matter. if, on the other hand, you are in search of genuine excellence in the australian horror genre, get yourself a copy of the incomparable 'long weekend' and don't look back.
