there really wasn't much of a story in this film. it loosely based itself off the events in the first lion king movie. it is supposed to be how timon and pumbaa met via their aloneness. but there isn't much more than that.<br /><br />it mixes some scenes from the original, then it ab-libs about how this movie changed them a little bit. but still, is that it? i was hoping for something a little more. instead, all i have to show for it is an empty plot with little explanation.<br /><br />i guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the lion king universe, then this is it. but other than that, it does little justice for the animators. disney really should stop these direct-to-video productions. it really was quite boring and could have used jason statham.
