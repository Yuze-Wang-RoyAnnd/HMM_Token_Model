the first cube movie was an art movie. it set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented, and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn't understand. it was, on the non-literal level, a "man vs. cruel nature" plot, where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end, triumphing to face a new, indefinable world beyond man's petty squabbles; a world where there were no more struggle, but peace. i rated cube a 10 out of 10, and it's a movie that was never meant to have any sequels.<br /><br />the second movie, hypercube was a massive disappointment. some of the ideas were kind of cool, but in the context of the original movie, both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning. still, for being fairly entertaining, i rated it a 5 out of 10.<br /><br />the third movie, cube zero, while ignoring the second, plays like a vastly inferior commercial b-movie rehash of the first, sans the symbolism. there is no "homage" or "tribute" here; there is only ripping off. the same kind of plot, with some elements idiotically altered (like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes - an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip-off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say).<br /><br />that we see something from "behind the scenes" means nothing, because the watchers are just part of the big bad experiment, the architects of which we hear nothing of. and, in this movie, those who get through to the exit (like kazan did at the end of the first movie) are just killed - where the *bleep* is the sense in that?! that's just flippin' stupid. i'm glad i didn't pay to see this.<br /><br />the production values and acting in cube zero are not too bad, but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10.
