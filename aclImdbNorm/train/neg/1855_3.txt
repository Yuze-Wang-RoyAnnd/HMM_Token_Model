this is the crappiest film i have ever seen but in all fairness it's watchable and rather funny. i don't think the film-makers intended it to be your typical hollywood blockbuster quality. it's just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow (as it's the middle of winter). he then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on it's own. this film is really stupid but it's funny. the killings are hilarious.i wouldn't advise you to go and buy it (like i did -the cover looked good!)but if it happens to be on tv one night and you're up for a laugh then stick it on.
