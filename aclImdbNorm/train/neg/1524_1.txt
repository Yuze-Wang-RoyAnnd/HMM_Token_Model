words fail me. this film was extremely difficult to watch and in hindsight i really wish i hadn't done it. although i attempted to sit through it until the end credits i have to admit i couldn't last for more than hour, so my opinion could be unfair. however, this film would require the most impressive final third in the history of film-making in order for it to be given a review which is anything but vicious.<br /><br />please do not watch any part of this film.
