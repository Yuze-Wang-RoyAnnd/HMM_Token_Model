this is the sorriest collection of clich'es, strung together on a straight line, with no discernible plot or any decent way of acting i've seen in a long time. canibalising scenes from star wars, reign of fire, godzilla, lord of the rings and harry potter, it went for an all out war on the viewer intelligence. was this movie good? it wasn't a movie at all!<br /><br />even if it doesn't go so low to actually be funny and achieve cult status as a comedy, the movie does offer some laughs. the trick is to put the copied scenes in the context of their original films. gandalf can be funny talking korean, the basilisk looking snake hilarious if you compare it to a kitten and the evil henchman can provide a lot of fun switching back and forth between sauron and jaja-bing, or whatever his name was.<br /><br />bottom line: any pleasure derived from this movie is completely dependent on the state of intoxication and imagination of the viewers, not on the director/writer. shame on you, shim!
