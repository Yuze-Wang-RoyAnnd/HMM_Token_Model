for me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding franks fanatasies when he is travelling with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings... the problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasies/funny situations again and again and again. it is to predictable. it is more done as a tv story where you can go away and come back without missing anything.<br /><br />i like felix herngren as frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to it's audience....<br /><br />
