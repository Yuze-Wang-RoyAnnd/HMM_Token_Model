i really wanted to like this movie a lot more than i did. that's because i love wacky foreign comedies--particularly the strange ones that catch you completely by surprise. however, although this one frequently caught me by surprise, these were almost never pleasant surprises. it reminded me of south park in that nearly every social norm was violated until the only ones left to broach were too sick to be funny. for example, after exploring adultery, drug abuse (of nearly every sort--ranging from pot, heroin, speed to glue sniffing), prostitution, s&m, suicide, murder, etc., the movie got to the hilarious(?) topic of pedophilia. mom encouraged her one son (who looked about 12 years-old) to sleep with neighboring men. in fact, at one point in the movie she gives this boy to the dentist in lieu of payment for dental work! funny?! you've got to be kidding. this movie just goes too far and delves into the "black hole of comedy". what should they make fun of next, cancer or rectal tumors?
