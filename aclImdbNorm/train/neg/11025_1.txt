once again i have seen a movie made by people that know nothing. i just recently reviewed baby face nelson. now i've seen dillinger and i've had it.<br /><br />this movie is garbage. i don't know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like bonnie and clyde. this movie is far from a classic. someone called it brilliant. that's an insane thing to say. this movie can't get any facts straight and it has the worst casting i've ever seen. i don't know whose dumb idea it was to cast warren oates as john dillinger. first of all he looks nothing like him. second of all, by the time john dillinger was killed he was 31. when oates made this he was 45! you could even tell that he's older than the real dillinger just by looking at him. not only was he too old, but so was ben johnson as melvin purvis.<br /><br />they show baby face nelson die, then homer van meter, and finally john dillinger. john dillinger was killed before both of them. the last one to die out of the three was baby face nelson. not only do the writers not know when they died, but they also don't know how they died. baby face nelson was not killed after he escaped from little bohemia in a robe. homer van meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns. homer van meter was cornered by the police in st. paul and gunned down with machine guns. another member of dillinger's gang, harry pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie. pierpont wasn't shot. harry pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair. i go into what happened to baby face nelson on my baby face nelson review so i'm not going to go into it again here. let me also add that richard dreyfuss' portrayal of baby face nelson is pathetic. there's a scene where he attacks dillinger and then gets a bad beating. while dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming, "leave me alone!" baby face nelson and john dillinger never fought. maybe dillinger didn't agree with nelson's bank robbing methods, but they never fought. nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten. they keep calling him lester "baby face" nelson. he was never in his life known by that name. nelson's real name was lester gillis and he changed his name to george nelson. the black guy that escaped from jail with dillinger was herbert youngblood, but in this movie he is known as reed youngblood. john milius doesn't know anything. where the hell did john milius get his information? i could probably make a better movie than him.<br /><br />finally the way they showed john dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable. the movie shows dillinger walk out of the biograph with the lady in red and his girlfriend billie frechette. by the way, billie frechette wasn't even there that night. but a girl named polly hamilton was. melvin purvis yells, 'johnny!' dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell. it is a proved fact that dillinger did not have a gun that night. the fbi gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away. they didn't even have to shoot him. they were so close that powder burns were found on his face. it was murder. they also say that the man killed that night was not john dillinger. after killing tons of civilians in the little bohemia incident can you imagine the fbi reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man? the gun they had on display that was supposedly on dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after dillinger's death. i could go on and on how the man they killed wasn't john dillinger, but i'll stop here. if you would like to know more check it out here<br /><br />see the dillinger version with lawrence tierney if you want, but don't waste your time with this inaccurate piece of garbage movie.
