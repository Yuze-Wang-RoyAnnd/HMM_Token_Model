this movie is just truly awful, the eye-candy that plays ben just can make up for everything else that is wrong with this movie.<br /><br />the writer/director/producer/lead actor etc probably had a good idea to create a movie dealing with the important issues of gay marriage, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crimes and just about every other issue effecting a gay man of these times, but trying to ram every issue into such a poorly conceived film does little justice to any of these causes.<br /><br />the script is poor, the casting very ordinary, but the dialogue and acting is just woeful. the homo-hating brother is played by the most camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two lead actors (i think i've seen more passion in an corn flakes ad). the acting is stiff, and the dialogue forced (a scene where the brother is feeding the detective his lines was the highlight).<br /><br />i'm just pleased to see that the creator of this train wreck has not pushed any other rubbish out in to distribution, and if he is thinking of doing so, i have some advise - just don't do it.
