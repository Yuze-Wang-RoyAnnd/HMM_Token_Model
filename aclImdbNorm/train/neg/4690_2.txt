this british film is truly awful, and it's hard to believe that glenn ford is in it, although he pretty much sleepwalks through it. the idea of a bomb on a train sounds good...but it turns out this train ends up parked for the majority of the film! no action, no movement, just a static train. the area where the train is parked is evacuated, so it's not like there's any danger to anyone either. in fact, this film could be used in a film class to show how not to make a suspense film. true suspense is generated by letting the audience know things that the characters don't, a fact apparently unknown to the director. spoiler: the train actually has two bombs on it, but we are led to believe there is only one. after the first bomb is defused, it feels as if there is no longer a reason to watch the film any more. but at the last minute, the villain, who has no apparent motivation for his actions, reveals there are two. nor are we certain when the bombs will go off, so we don't even have a classic "ticking bomb" tension sequence. a good 10 minutes or more are spent watching glenn ford's french wife thinking about leaving him, and then wondering where he is . she's such an annoying character that we don't care whether she reconciles with him, so when she does, there's nothing emotional about it. most of the other characters are fairly devoid of personality, and none have any problems or issues. it's only 72 minutes, but it feels long because it's tedious and dull. don't waste your time.
