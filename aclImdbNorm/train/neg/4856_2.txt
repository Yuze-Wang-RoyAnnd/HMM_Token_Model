for the life of me i can not understand the blind hype and devotion to this totally unbelievable movie......and i think i have the qualifications to say so.... i am a former special operations soldier with 14 years in the "lifestyle" ... this movie was totally totally unreal and obviously written by someone that did very little research into life in the army, in combat or at a team or platoon level.<br /><br />three eod guys trouncing around bagdad on their own????? get real... no chain of command????? get real... eod clearing buildings??? get real....eod/ military intelligence / sniper qualified buck sergeant???? get real.... wait... i shot and killed a bad guy and then let two guys take me without firing another shot or being injured at all???? get real....i carjack an iraqi civilian, while i am only armed with a 9 mil, break into another civilians house, get punked by his wife then make it back to camp on foot in the middle of bagdad at night without as so much as a scratch or confrontation???? get real...<br /><br />there is absolutely no adherence to military protocol {army} and no resemblance at all to any army unit that i have even encountered. totally unbelievable and disrespectful to the men and women of eod who contrary to this poor film are not wild adrenaline seeking yahoos but extremely qualified professionals doing an incredibly hard job.
