horrendous pillaging of a classic.<br /><br />it wasn't written convincingly at all why mary should develop such sympathy for bates. he may be more stable until they start playing pranks with him, but he still doesn't help himself at all with his actions. (inviting a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his until recently disused motel; telling the attractive young girl of his past mental issues; lying about the knives, etc... ) this, in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept mary extremely wary of him, but this somehow doesn't happen just so they can play the 'mistaken-identity-murder-game later on. which in itself is also ridiculous: 'so-and-so is the real killer - plus her as well - also him! there were too many contrived twists in order to slap a story on screen when the narrative didn't need extending.<br /><br />it was good to see perkins reprising his famous role again, but that's about the only small pleasure to be had. it's definitely not a patch on hitchcock, and if you have no intention of even trying to get close then you shouldn't be bothering at all.
