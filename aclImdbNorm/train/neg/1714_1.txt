once again a film classic has been pointlessly remade with predictably disastrous results. the title is false as is everything about this film. the period is not persuasively rendered, and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals. arthur penn's film had style, humor, a point of view, and was made by talented people. even if the 1967 version didn't exist this would still be an unnecessary film. the 1967 version strayed from the facts, presented a glamorized version of bonnie and clyde, but it was exciting, and innovative for 1967, and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care. this 1992 remake seems culled from the original film rather than the truth as known and the actors in this version are callow, unappealing, and not the least bit interesting. by all means skip this one and hope the 2010 version will be better. could it possibly be worse?
