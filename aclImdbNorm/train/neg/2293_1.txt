if this series supposed to be an improvement over batman - the animated series, i, for one, think it failed terribly. the character drawing is lousy... (catwoman, for instance, looks awful...) but what really annoyed me is that it made batman look like a sort of wimp who just can't take care of himself in a battle, without the help of two, even three sidekicks. i mean, he's batman, for god's sake! i know the comic books, i know that nightwing and batgirl are supposed to be batman's allies, besides robin, but still... making batman say that he needs help from them... what, he can't handle a few punches? in btas, he could face a dozen adversaries without any problem... he's getting old? come on...<br /><br />and another thing: i really don't think that batman would allow a kid like tim drake to go into battle that soon, without years of hard training. one, it's irresponsible (and batman is everything, but irresponsible), and two, it's not what happened in the comics, if we are to remain faithful to them.<br /><br />batman - the animated series made history, with its animation, its stories and its characters... that really was a legend of batman. the new adventures series turned the legend into just another batman flick.
