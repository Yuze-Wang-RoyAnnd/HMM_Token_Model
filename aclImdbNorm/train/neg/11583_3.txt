this movie introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first half-hour or so. none of them generate any interest or positive response. i waited for the intrigue to begin, hoping things would get better and ended up sticking around until the bitter end, but there was no reward for doing that.<br /><br />if you want a synopsis, look elsewhere. to me the action isn't worth recounting. not that the story was that bad, i guess you could say i had some problems with the script--i.e. i thought it stunk. a look at the credits will show you that there's a pretty strong cast here, used to no avail. most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs; of the actors i hadn't seen much of before i especially liked deborah kara unger. that's about all that i can find good to say about this picture.
