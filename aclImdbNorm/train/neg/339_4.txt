unlike "the adventures of buckaroo banzai", or "big trouble in little china", or "conan the barbarian", which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and self-deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations, the golden child is just plain bad.<br /><br />the premise itself is not unworkable, and there are some funny moments. but here the eddy murphy "flip attitude" just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story. and the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension. the "mystic secrets" of tibetan buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compel.<br /><br />without a feeling that anything is at stake, or that the characters are faced by real danger, why should we care?<br /><br />who should see this film:<br /><br />-- big fans of eddy murphy who can't help themselves<br /><br />-- i can't think of anyone else<br /><br />i'll give this film a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked.
