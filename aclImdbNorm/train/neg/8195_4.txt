every christmas eve i make my kids endure yet another showing of it's a wonderful life. i also thoroughly enjoyed bad santa. so sue me. i admit it. i like cheesy, schmaltzy movies. i like excellent, intelligent ones too, but as with so many things, variety is a good thing. what would the christmas season be without the annual cinematic ka-ching ka-ching of santa in all his guises, from edmund gwenn to billy bob thornton? fred claus will make no one forget bedford falls, but i do not believe a christmas film should have to reach iconic stature to succeed. "fred" is a perfectly ok holiday movie, with enough humor for the adults and sufficient charm for the kids. my wife and i laughed a lot, even if most of the humor was obvious and vince was just being vince. paul giamatti was a top-notch santa, which helped a lot. not a great flick, and unlikely to become must-viewing for anyone's annual christmas traditions. but my wife and daughter and i enjoyed it for what it was, holiday schmaltz with a small dash of spice. there's nothing wrong with that.
