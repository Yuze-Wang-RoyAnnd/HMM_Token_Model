this film can be judged from three viewpoints: as history, as a profile of amin, as a fictional thriller. <br /><br />it fails as history, it mentions in passing the coup that threw out obote, the expulsion of the asians, and has the entebbe hi-jack as background, but not in any chronologically consistent time frame. <br /><br />as a profile of amin it may have been interesting, because forest whitaker is incredibly good, and if this was a better film, he would get an oscar. (he got it - which proves the oscar voters don't watch the films they vote on.) it ignores relevant historical episodes in the novel, which observed amin and the history of uganda from the point of view of the doctor. it tells instead the fictitious story of the scots doctor and his impossible love life from the point of view of amin. but the story told is the one incident that amin was probably innocent of. <br /><br />as a fictional thriller, there is no plot to hold it together. the beginning is taut - it takes cinematic liberties with the novel, but sets up the story. the character of the doctor is well-defined, but becomes lost in the second half of the film which suffers as a result.<br /><br />why the doctor decides to stay in kampala is badly explained - seduced by power? why he befriends no-one is strange. the character of the friend in the novel has been lost because the scotsman has the affair instead of the black doctor - a ludicrous entanglement which does not seem even faintly believable, but allows the writers of the film to show the ferocity of amin close at hand. the man called horse bit at the end is risible. <br /><br />finally in 1971, uganda drove on the left, not right, the number plates were three letters and two or three numbers - and where are the equator tusks?! <br /><br />in short - if you've never heard of amin, you may want to spend two hours watching this film to appreciate forest whitaker's acting, but the last hour will bore you to confusion. if you know uganda or have read the book - don't see the film - it will only depress you. and if you want to know why the doctor was so foolhardy - he wasn't.
