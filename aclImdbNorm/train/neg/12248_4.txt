the only real highlight in the movie is the death of the sniveling guy and the reaction of the surviving characters to it.<br /><br />in every other way, this film is a very lame rip-off of jaws, lake placid, and alligator, with a little bit of godzilla (1998) thrown in.<br /><br />as is standard for a 1990's-style horror movie, the two non-starring females each take their clothes off at least once. the female lead doesn't, since she obviously has a better agent. <br /><br />the whole movie surrounds the filming of a really dumb extreme sport called blood surfing, in which surfers cut themselves and surf in shark-infested waters. in this film, a giant salt-water crocodile also happens to be in the area. people get eaten. the movie ends.<br /><br />i don't mind a bad horror movie, but i really hate a dull bad horror movie, which this definitely is.
