no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series, of which only 3 have been on so far is awful. the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series. i found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous. as a bbc licence payer, after the show i rang bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment. i'm amazed that actors of the calibre of trevor eve and sue johnstone didn't object to the story lines. these actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surly they can see it's lost all direction. it's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father christmas!<br /><br />paul bentley, west yorkshire, england.
