ronald reagan and a bunch of us soldiers in a north korean pow camp. they are tortured... we learn north korean communists are bad people... we learn americans' beards grow very slowly during days of torture...<br /><br />i tried to suppress it, but i finally burst out laughing at this movie. it was the scene when mr. reagan comes out from telling the communists he wants to be on their side. then, he asks for a bottle of brandy. next, acting stone-cold sober, he takes a drunken companion, dewey martin, to get sulfur to cure mr. martin's hangover. of course, the north korean communist guard is as dumb as they come. so, the drunk distracts the guard while reagan goes over to get something from a drawer, which is next to a bunch of empty boxes. i'm sure he boxes were supposed to contain something; but, of course, reagan causes them to shake enough to reveal they are empty. ya gotta laugh! i think "prisoner of war" will appeal mainly to family and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise, it's wasteful. <br /><br />* prisoner of war (1954) andrew marton ~ ronald reagan, steve forrest, dewey martin
