this is far worse than those awful laurel and hardy cartoons of the 60s. they were terrible, but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then stan and ollie resurgence. new audiences had rediscovered the pair's comedic genius and the cartoons were mind-numbing garbage geared to cash in on children's interest. it was to be expected. but, how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of... i can't even think of a word. i'm sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another laurel and hardy revival, but you can't inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing. the impressionists (i hesitate to call them actors) do a vegas act and that's where it belongs. the plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days, trying to stretch out two-reel ideas for a feature. if this film was someone's first exposure to the real laurel and hardy, i'm sure that viewer would dismiss the original duo's reputation as senility gone amok. the only movie i hate worse than this is i spit on your grave. and, you know, these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to stan and ollie.
