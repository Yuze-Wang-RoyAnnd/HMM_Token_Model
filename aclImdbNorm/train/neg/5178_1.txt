i feel it is my duty as a lover of horror films to warm other people about this horrible and very very bad "horror" film. don't waste your time or money on this film, the acting is bad, the story is just one of the worst i have come across and the script was just awful. nothing about it was good, you end up thinking to yourself why am i watching this crap. the plot had so many holes in it and they never got cleared up in the end, it was just so bad, i don't know how a film so terrible could be made. as i said before i love horror films and i was so let down, it was an 18 but you see little blood and no scares or jumps at all. also what annoyed me was how stupid things happened in the film that had no point to the plot at all like the brother and sister kissing, why? is all i can say. just don't bother, there are far more great horror films out there, just don't waste your time life is too short.
