i love anthony hopkins as an actor so i was very interested to see how he would do as a writer/director. i could not have been more disappointed by this move. the movie was so disjointed and the cinematography was so over done to the point i wanted to pull the plug out of the wall. the actors were very good but it was such a waste of talent. not all actors are cut out to be writers or directors and clearly mr. hopkins falls into this category. of all the movies i have ever seen in my 50 years, this is absolutely the worst movie ever. please do us all a favor mr. hopkins and stick to acting, which you are excellent at, and leave the writing and directing to those who are talented in those areas. if i could give this movie a rating less than one i certainly would.
