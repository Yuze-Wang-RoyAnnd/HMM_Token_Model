i wasn't at all a fan of the 2005 gore fest hit "hostel", and most of these lame ass knock-offs are just as bad or worse - yet "live feed" managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about the first 30 minutes. started off with plenty of sex and sleazy settings, followed by some good death scenes involving the chinese organized crime squad and a 7-foot, leather-aproned butcher... what put me out of the movie was the tough 'hero' with the guns and a grudge saving the day... i would call this movie mediocre, at best, since a premise mainly involving obnoxious young people being slaughtered in a seedy porno theater, doubling as a hideout for the mafia, is appealing to me. if only the torture was prolonged enough to be thoroughly effective, then my rating would have differed greatly. unfortunately, most of the gruesomeness is heaped together in one scene, leaving the rest of the movie to conclude as a revenge-type scenario. so, basically, it is just a low-budget "hostel" rip-off with the redeeming use of gratuitous sex, almost constant during the first half of the film... overall, i would say don't bother with this one.
