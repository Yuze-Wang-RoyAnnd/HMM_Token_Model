to call this anything at all would be an insult to everything else. some expletives might describe it, but still too positively. normally one ignores this kind of rubbish, but it was so stupid that one can but despair. would have though that even americans and commercial tv-stations would have given this piece of s**t a miss. but as the germans say: gegen die dummheit kaempfen die goetter selbst vergebens!
