when hey arnold! first came on the air in 1996, i watched it. it was one of my favorite shows. then the same episodes started getting shown over and over again so i got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching it. i was sort of surprised when i heard about hey arnold! the movie since it doesn't seem to be nearly as popular as some of the other nickelodeon cartoons like spongebob squarepants. nevertheless, having nothing better to do, i went to see the movie anyway. going into the theater, i wasn't expecting much. i was just expecting it to be a dumb movie version of a childrens' cartoon like the recess movie was. i guess i got what i expected. it was a dumb kiddie movie and nothing more. there were some good parts here and there, but for the most part, the movie was a stinker. simply for kids.
