this movie is likely the worst movie i've ever seen in my life -- surpassing the previous most god-awful movie, "spawn of slithis," which i saw when i was about 10.<br /><br />bad acting, stilted and ridiculous dialog, incomprehensible plot, mishmashed cut scenes, even the music was annoying. did i leave anything out? well, the special effects weren't bad -- but cgi does not a decent movie make.<br /><br />i can't believe i actually spent money to see this movie. if anyone has the contact info for hyung-rae shim (the director), please forward it to my user name "at gmail," and i'll contact him to personally demand a refund.
