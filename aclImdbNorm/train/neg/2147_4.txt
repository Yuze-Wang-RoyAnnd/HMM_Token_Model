the original is a relaxing watch, with some truly memorable animated sequences. unfortunately, the sequel, while not the worst of the dtv sequels completely lacks the sparkle.<br /><br />the biggest letdown is a lack of a story. like belle's magical world, the characters are told through a series of vignettes. magical world, while marginally better, still manages to make a mess of the story. in between the vignettes, we see the mice at work, and i personally think the antics of jaq and gus are the redeeming merits of this movie.<br /><br />the first vignette is the best, about cinderella getting used to being to being a princess. this is the best, because the mice were at their funniest here. the worst of the vignettes, when jaq turns into a human, is cute at times, but has a lack of imagination. the last vignette, when anastasia falls in love, was also cute. the problem was, i couldn't imagine anastasia being friendly with cinderella, as i considered her the meaner out of the stepsisters. this was also marred by a rather ridiculous subplot about lucifer falling in love with pompom.<br /><br />the incidental music was very pleasant to listen to;however i hated the songs, they were really uninspired, and nothing like the beautiful tchaikovsky inspired melodies of the original.<br /><br />the characters were the strongest development here. cinderella while still caring, had lost her sincerity, and a lot of her charm from the original, though she does wear some very pretty clothes. the duke had some truly funny moments but they weren't enough to save the film, likewise with prudence and the king. as i mentioned, the mice were the redeeming merits of the movie, as they alone contributed to the film's cuteness. i have to say also the animation is colourful and above average, and the voice acting was surprisingly good.<br /><br />all in all, a cute, if unoriginal sequel, that was marred by the songs and a lack of a story. 4/10 for the mice, the voice acting, the animation and some pretty dresses. bethany cox
