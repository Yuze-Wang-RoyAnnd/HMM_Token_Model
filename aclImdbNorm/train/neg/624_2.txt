the director states in the behind-the-scenes feature that he loves horror movies. he loves them so much that he dedicated the movie to dario argento, as well as other notable directors such as george a. romero and tobe hooper. basically dedicating this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sh*t for mother's day. the first thing they did wrong was the casting. cast people that can act. also, don't cast a person that is 40 years old for the role of a misunderstood, 18 year old recluse. that's right, he's been in high school for 22 years. the reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their hearts ripped out is amusing. or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn (haha get it), and his girlfriend just goes, "oh..my.. god?" the scarecrow himself is quite a character. doing flips off cars and calling people losers.<br /><br />the movie does have one redeeming factor... oh wait, no it doesn't.<br /><br />if you absolutely must see this movie, than just watch the rock and roll trailer on the dvd. it covers about everything and has a really gnarly song dude.
