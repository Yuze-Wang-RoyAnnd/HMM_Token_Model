there is a reason why certain films go straight to video and of course the obvious reason is that if its too naughty for theater audience then release straight to video. of course it really wouldn't be fair to the films that are good and yet they are also released straight to video. this one is not an exception although the film has good actors or at least actors with potential: amy adams (am oscar nominee and talented actress), robin dunne who deserves better or at least a better agent, and sarah thompson who deserves roles that are a departure from teen melodramas. the film is also misstated: this film takes place before cruel intentions so therefore this film is actually a prequel and rather stupid one at that. this was a waste and its really a film that is in the same level as soft core porn and pay-per-view masturbation films. fortunately for the actors, hopefully they will be able to erase this from their resumes. so if you are looking to see something naughty, but don't have the courage to buy porn then rent this film as a starter.
