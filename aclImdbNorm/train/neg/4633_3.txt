as is often the case, films about self-loathing characters do not usually make for good drama. 'downloading nancy' is no exception. it's supposedly based on a true story about a woman who's murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet.<br /><br />the protagonist is nancy (maria bello) who is married to albert (rufus sewell). albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bar/restaurants. unlike most human beings, albert has virtually no positive attributes (except for his ability to be successful in the business world). throughout the film, albert has a grim and dour expression on his face. he has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes. when his wife asks for sex, he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead.<br /><br />nancy is equally one-note as a character. not only has she had a loveless 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up (thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film). her self-loathing takes the form of self-mutilation and a result, she's forced into therapy. however, she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made.<br /><br />finally, nancy is so depressed that she contacts louis over the internet. he's sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo, who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot. it's revealed that louis has two children but no longer sees them (the children's mother no longer wants anything to do with him).<br /><br />nancy's plan is to first have painful sex with louis and then have him kill her. there's a particularly unpleasant scene where louis has sex with nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass. these scenes are shown as flashbacks after louis pays a visit to albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club. it seems that louis has a two-fold plan in going to see albert: 1) berate him for his treatment of nancy and 2) enjoy the beating he receives. it takes awhile before louis will reveal nancy's fate
