i have been a fervent hal hartley supporter since i saw his short "surviving desire" in high school, and even then was still completely unmoored by his searingly brilliant "henry fool." but this 10-year-later sequel is not only unnecessary, it's disgraceful.<br /><br />after a choppy and expeditious start, "fay grim" devolves into pseudo-intellectualism, flat out boredom, and finally unwarranted - and unwanted - nihilism. and that's just the plot.<br /><br />the majority of the new faces are as frivolous and poorly-developed as the movie: one particularly flat character ends up hogging half the time we spend with the infamous henry fool himself, and it's his only spoken scene in the film!<br /><br />jeff goldblum's agent fulbright, it seems, is the only bright character (a pun surely intended by hartley as well). how, then, is he left? **spoiler** dead via a car bombing, easily making this the gentle-natured hartley's most violent film to date, and tonally all wrong in a film that's already all wrong from the word go.<br /><br />as for the other new characters, angus james, ned fool (or is it grim?), not to mention fay herself... well, i won't spoil their fates, as the movie does a good enough job of that all on its own (when it isn't busying itself with yet another godawful canted angle, which gives the disconcerting impression that hartley is moving backwards from auteur to crappy film student).<br /><br />this piece is a complete disaster, a dreadful mess that isn't even good-humored enough to revel in its messiness. instead it self-indulgently crams the typically fun hipster pretenses of its director into the "real world", one uglier and meaner than it need be but not nearly ugly or mean enough to come close to having anything to say. in doing so, hartley tracks sh*t all over my memories of these people and the marvelous world he originally created for them.<br /><br />i have rarely been so depressed at the movies, and i'm counting "leaving las vegas," which at least developed fresh new characters we grew to love before destroying them, instead of immediately disregarding characters already beloved.<br /><br />grim, indeed.
