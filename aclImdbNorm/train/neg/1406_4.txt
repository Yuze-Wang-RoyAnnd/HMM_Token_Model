this "movie" is more like a music video. kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when he is making movies, he feels like making music, and when he is making music, he feels like making movies. the best thing in "promise me this" is the music, written by stribor kusturica.<br /><br />kusturica said in the same interview, that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise. "promise me this" has very little "noise".<br /><br />i liked "life is a miracle". it was also like music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later, but it had a beautiful plot. "promise me this" has no plot. i was awaiting this movie with big expectations, because i've read, that the script has been written by ranko bozic - one of my favourite scriptwriters, who participated also in "life is a miracle". ranko bozic writes great dialogues, but for kusturica they are "noise", and much to my regret, i saw only two dialogues, which i could identify as written by ranko bozic. the other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son stribor.<br /><br />gordan mihic (the man who wrote the scripts for "time of the gypsies" and "black cat white cat") said in an interview, that kusturica never follows the script. "black cat white cat" was the only script, for which kusturica said, that he will not touch it. according to gordan mihic, after all kusturica comes back to the script, and if he doesn't, he doesn't make a good movie. and i think this is the case with "promise me this". he should have followed the script of ranko bozic.<br /><br />"promise me this" is billed as a "comedy", but there are very few moments, which made me laugh. the comedic moments are in the same style as "black cat white cat", but are not that funny at all. i think the difference comes from the fact, that "black cat white cat" was written by gordan mihic.<br /><br />however, i know some people, who liked "promise me this", they find it very positive movie.
