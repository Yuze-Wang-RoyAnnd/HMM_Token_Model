i really can't understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than 1 star... how can you like such a retarded film, where all the animal abuse scenes are real? i don't even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments... jesus... what kind of ''human'' would torture them like that for no reason, or just for money? i tell you, that director is either mentally retarded, or he's just a monster with a ''heart'' of stone. or both. he truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn alive.<br /><br />it contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock, especially to sensitive persons and children: a real frog is skinned alive, fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water, a dog is beaten, birds are thrown into the water...<br /><br />this movie is more than awful; it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made, along with another one, called ''cannibal holocaust'' or something like that. i'll never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster. no one should waste their time watching it, especially when there are a lot of truly great movies out there, in which all the animal abuse scenes are staged.<br /><br />fortunately, only a few people liked this - which is natural, since it's the worst film ever -, so it wasn't successful. i hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals will never be praised, and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films. i truly believe that everyone receives but what they give! there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel ''humans'' will feel the same pain they once inflicted to others.<br /><br />this, however, is probably my only ''negative'' review. i usually don't comment on a movie if i dislike it, but this time i just couldn't shut up. i had to speak the truth, because animal abuse must stop!
