the clich'ed polynesian males drink, fight and make a stream of sexist, stupid and unfunny remarks. real life polynesians are much funnier than these stereotyped, cardboard characters. the supposedly samoan girl didn't look or act samoan at all, seemed more like the stock white female who has sex with anyone on a whim. with weak as water story lines you can't say anything about the acting - even the most brilliant actors could do nothing with this script. it's sad to see polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a film with not one good scene, and only two or three 'jokes'. what a waste of kiwi taxpayers' money, what a lost opportunity to make a great film about a vibrant community. it's better not to make movies if they're as bad and mindless as this.
