seriously, the fact that this show is so popular just boggles the mind. this show isn't funny, it isn't clever, it isn't original, it's just a steaming pile of bull crap. let me start with the characters. the characters are all one-dimensional morons with loud, exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard. the voice acting could've been better. then there's the animation. my god, it hurts my eyes just looking at it. everything is too flat, too pointy, too bright, and too candy coated. then there's the humor, or lack thereof. it's completely idiotic! they just take these b-grade jokes that aren't even that funny in the first place and then repeat them to death. they also throw in some pointless potty humor which sickens me. and finally, last and least, the music. it's just plain annoying. it sounds like it was composed on a child's computer and generates no emotion whatsoever. i wish there was a score lower than 1, i really do. this show seriously needs to be canceled. it's a show i try to avoid like the plague. whenever i hear the theme song i immediately turn the tv off. if you've never watched this show then don't. watch quality programming like the simpsons or futurama.
