i don't think any movie of van damme's will ever beat universal soldier but u never know. this movie was good but not as good as 1st. vd returns a luc & must do battle again. he tries 2 b funny here but its maybe worth a smirk of a chuckle. vd has a kid this time from ally w., good it showed a pic of them 2. goldberg was cool, he does his famous move-forgot what its called cause i don't watch wrestling-sucks. vd & goldberg had some good fights. it was the ending like the 1st but just not that good. vd does his best move in his career, like always-the helicopter kick. even though, the final ending should've been longer. anyway, it is worth seeing but it will never top the original.
