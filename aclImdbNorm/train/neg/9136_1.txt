when the film began, i was shocked to see it was filmed using a cheap video camera! in fact, the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home movie. even direct to dvd films should have production values better than this! heck, a large percentage of the home videos uploaded to youtube have better production values! all too often, the film seriously appears to be made by sticking the camera on a tripod and turning it on--with no camera person! closeups and anything resembling camera-work are absent in some scenes where they might have worked and in others there are too many or poorly framed closeups. yecch! <br /><br />the film is about two gay men who want to become married. as if was made almost a decade ago, their only option was marrying in vermont--times have definitely changed. however, the recent acceptance of gay marriage cannot in any way be attributed to this film--if anything, it set the gay marriage supporters back instead of helping as the movie stinks and never really tries to seriously address the issue. according to the film, religious people are one-dimensional idiots who carry bibles everywhere and shoot people as well as wives who have gay husbands are narrow-minded when they learn their spouses have been living a lie--go figure. i'm sure glad it gives an honest chance to both sides on the issue! <br /><br />the bottom line--nothing about the film shows any professionalism at all and i even hesitate to call this a film. it's more like a home movie and doesn't even merit a listing on imdb or even inclusion on imdb's bottom 100 list of the worst rated films of all time. the acting is horrible, the writing is horrible, the direction (if there even is any) is horrible, the camera-work is horrible and the plot is horrible. it's a home movie!! there is nothing positive i can say about this in any way except that it makes the films of ed wood seem like oscar contenders in comparison and i am sure the ghost of mr. wood is smiling every time someone watches this mess! <br /><br />i don't care if you are gay or straight--this film is not worth your time and i don't know how they managed to create dvds of it. i assume one of the actors burns them on his home computer during his free time! seriously, this gives new meaning to the word 'bad'!<br /><br />by the way, if the one lady in the film was a real lawyer, wouldn't the ability to read be an important prerequisite?! i'm just sayin'.<br /><br />finally, with gay marriage being such a serious and important topic, can't we have a film that's better than this that addresses the issue?! this one, sadly, only invites laughter.
