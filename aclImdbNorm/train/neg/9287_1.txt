wow! why would anybody make a sequel to an already rancid film? half past dead was a bad movie but at least at had an idea of what it wanted to be. hpd2 has no clue of what it wants to be. it just exists on screen for reasons i cant explain. spoiler: the whole movie is this: twitch(played by kurupt of tha dogg pound) gets transferred to another jail where there might be a box filled with gold bricks buried. in the jail, a riot breaks out between rival inmates, one of them gets shot by a guy named cortez and cortez plans his escape. during a conjugal visit, twitch's fianc'ee and burke's(played by bill goldberg)daughter get kidnapped by cortez and are held in an execution room. burke reluctantly befriends twitch and they end up getting into trouble with the idiotic inmates while finding out that cortez has their loved ones.<br /><br />opinion: this is the most unnecessary sequel since universal soldier: the return. the script is terrible, the acting is horrendous, the dialog is a joke and everybody in this movie is a caricature. look, i know it was low budget film but that is not an excuse for these guys to not put effort into what they do. nobody in this "movie" believes in the characters they play. nobody in this "movie can be taken seriously as an actor. kurupt should be ashamed of himself. his character "twitch" is pretty much a spineless minstrel puppet who spends most of his time posing while getting jacked up by burke or the other inmates. bill goldberg spends most of his time sulking throughout the movie as if he had to take a phd(pretty huge dump). the fight scenes are poorly choreographed and pathetic and for an action movie hpd2 is pretty boring even when action is happening! don't let anybody tell you that this movie is somewhat decent. it stinks and is a prime reason why people despise follywood.
