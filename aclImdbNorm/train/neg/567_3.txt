this movie is one of the most awful movies ever made.how can jon bon jovi play in a movie? he is a singer not an actor, what?is he killing vampires with his guitar? and what about the dreadful plot? o my god this movie really sucks. in the end is the queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire arly jover (blade) surrounded by an army of vampires, but when the "fantastic" slayers arrive only 4 vampires are left!! what happened with the other 10-15 vampires? they run out in the sun??? and what about the "grand finally" when bon jovi blows her head with a shotgun??? that's really a "not" . in "buffy the vampire slayer" in 100 episodes not a single vampire is killed with a shotgun??? this really is a lack of originality!
