richard dreyfus is not the star here. he has about three 20 second cameos and what is gene barry doing all over this movie? no idea, the director was probably his brother! this is a movie that makes no sense whatsoever. the inept writer/director (same dude) butchered up everyone's talent with his horrendous uh...work. i got the dvd for a penny so can't complain! but it's weird!and it makes you feel weirded out and in not a good way. this was the 70's and looks like the director was on a bad acid trip and wanted everyone to experience what it's like to be inside his head. it has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but like a scratched record, it quickly plays foul. it has that "manson family on acid" vibe to it.<br /><br />i have no idea how the other reviewer got all they did out of this movie? maybe they worked in it back when? at any rate, be prepared to lose 80+ min of your life you'll never get back. yes, it's that awful!
