i looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented. i mean, i hate to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, tone it down a little. "groundbreaking" is a little over the top. this is a boston based college production that doesn't even achieve the level of most amateur college film. it's what you would expect a bunch of kids to do. a silly action film without much creativity. it's pretty funny if you're willing to poke fun at it. not something you will ever see unless you are a student at emerson college.
