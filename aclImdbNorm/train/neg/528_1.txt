i never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely to the novel (especially a beloved one, like evening) but when i saw that the book's author, susan minot, was a screenplay writer and executive producer on the film, i thought that evening would be a good adaptation.<br /><br />if you enjoyed the book, don't bother with this movie. it is so far afield of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one another.<br /><br />here, our characters are completely different: the bride is in love with harris. harris is the son of the housekeeper. buddy is a drunk, in love with ann and/or harris. i don't think a single character made it from the book to the screen; oh it just gets worst with every passing moment.<br /><br />and, really, didn't we learn from bridges of madison county that cutting from the story we are meant to be enthralled in, to scenes of our heroes' grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights, simply does not work on film? this film is a disaster. skip it.
