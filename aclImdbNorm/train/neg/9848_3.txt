this movie does have some great noirish/neorealist visuals, and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of hollywood's sugar-coating, which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. but some of the scenes go on for much too long (the wedding, especially), and i found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screen.<br /><br />the dialog was particularly distracting, and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on. most of the characters were either italian-americans or italian immigrants living in new york in the twenties and thirties, but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks. toward the end i was laughing, and not because the filmmakers wanted me to. i guess the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have been speaking italian, and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk. but it absolutely did not work for me.<br /><br />another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason: the main character's son, born and raised in new york in the 1920's, suddenly picks up a lovely lilting british accent. i'm only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in england.<br /><br />i give this movie an 'a' for effort and intention, but a considerably lower grade for execution.
