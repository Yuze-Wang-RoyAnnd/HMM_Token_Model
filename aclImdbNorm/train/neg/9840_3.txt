quirky, independent, theatrical, christian slater--these are all teasers that made me look forward to spending an hour or so "discovering" a jewel of a film. boy, was i disappointed. julian po never gets over itself. the film is relentlessly self-conscious. i found myself unable to suspend disbelief for even a moment. the overdone, obviously theatrical sets, the overdone, obviously theatrical acting, the overdone, obviously theatrical directing -- well, you get the idea. <br /><br />allegories do not need to be delivered sledge hammer style. and it's hard to feel much of anything for julian po because we never know much about him. the ridiculous girlfriend, the annoying townsfolk, the idiotic clergyman, the bratty kids -- why would anyone, particularly anyone with a life long ambition to get to the seaside (slater's character), decide to stay in such a dismal place?
