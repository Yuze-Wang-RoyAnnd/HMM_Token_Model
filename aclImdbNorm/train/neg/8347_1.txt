the title should have been "the walker". that was only he did walk.<br /><br />there was nothing on the movie that was good. the description of the movie doesn't really comply with the plot.<br /><br />the only thing that i can get from the movie is that he was a good son, but a low life terrible person.<br /><br />i'm sorry that i expend my money and time, on this movie. i saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie. i stayed hoping that it will better....what a mistake. i got worse.<br /><br />if there is a suggestion that i can make to he producer is to re-direct his life to another field, because making movies is definitely no his cup of tea
