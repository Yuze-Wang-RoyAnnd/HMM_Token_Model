anyone who's watched a few lifetime movie network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing that gets brushed off the planning table. so, when crazed lara moves into patti's home and methodically begins to drive her landlady bonkers, i didn't even blink. when lara eventually ramps up her activities to threatening poor patti, and dares her to do anything about it, i just nodded. you see, on planet lmn, people don't behave the way they do for any particular reason, they just do it to keep the action going. only on planet lmn could someone almost have the owner of a home thrown out of their own house by means of their seductive powers!! poor patti - she just trusted too much, and lara went off her medicine, and then there was this big fight at the top of the stairs involving a syringe full of deadly stuff that ends up injected into someone's tummy, and a body bag going out the front door. the horror!<br /><br />but take it from me, this planet lmn product is a classic. you need to watch it once, just for the great laughs you'll have. on the improbability scale, i give this film a 95/100. make a big batch of popcorn and get some apple slices, too. you'll understand later.
