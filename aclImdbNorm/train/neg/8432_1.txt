leave it to geniuses like ventura pons, the spanish director, to convince the higher ups in his country to subsidize this misguided attempt of a film. the sad state of the film industry in that country is a product of trying to make a film out of such thin material. most of the pictures that are made in spain fall under two categories: those about the spanish civil war, that love to present past history as the writers deem fit. the other type of films show the viewer with a lot of gratuitous sex because the 'creators' don't have anything interest to say. <br /><br />as the film opens we get to watch pere's penis as he attempts to cut it off and place it in one of the platters at a party. later on, sandra will show all she has been given for the audience to admire. the story of pere's attraction to sandra, a married woman that seems to be happily married, is false from the start.<br /><br />our only interest in watching the film centered on an earlier, better made picture by mr. pons, "amic/amat", but alas, it has nothing to do with the mess we are punished to watch in this venture. as far as the comments submitted in imdb, all the negative votes come from spanish viewers, which speaks volumes coming from them!
