to start with, i have to point out the fact that you're gonna feel completely lost for more than half an hour. yeah, some things happen, but you don't know why or what for. when you finally figure things out you just realize that it's nothing but a twisted soad opera, dealing with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate sons... the characters are rather poor and the actors (specially the young ones) don't help that much to make'em look credible. only marisa paredes stands out, but she's a superb actress, no matter if the movie is pure rubbish.<br /><br />the only positive things to say about "fr'io sol de invierno" is that d'ebutant pablo malo seems to have good intentions, and he's filmed a couple of scenes that are quite intense... well, maybe the next time...<br /><br />*my rate: 4/10
