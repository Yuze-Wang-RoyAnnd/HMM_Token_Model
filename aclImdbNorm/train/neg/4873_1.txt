this is definitely a stupid, bad-taste movie. eddie murphy stars in what is written like a sitcom. he is surrounded with his perfect family, full of good family values. if you're looking for politically correct entertainment, this movie is for you. but if you hate the idea of being the only one not to laugh at obscene gags in a movie-theater full of pop-corn addicts, just flee.
