i saw this movie the other night and i have to honestly say it's one of the worst films i've ever seen. the acting is fair, but the plot is totally ridiculous. a killer is born because of all the "energy used to make the movie" and if the film is burned the killer will die? how unbelievable is that? the characters were underdeveloped to say the least...for example, all of a sudden the man mentions "aren't you trying to complete the film because your mother couldn't?" so we're supposed to go along with this? we had no idea it was her daughter until half way through the film. the movie really didn't spotlight on anyone, we didn't know anything about the main people who survived except ringwald's character was a whiney actress, the guy was on the set when the people died and raffy wanted to be a director like her mother. not truly diving in to know who they are. seemed things were rushed to just get to the killings. the whole plot is entirely too weak for my taste and i was extremely disappointed. anyone who enjoyed this piece of crap, obviously needs to learn a thing or two about film making. i can't believe anyone would agree to star or even work on this picture. it's not funny, it was not scary and was cliche through the entire film. i found myself predicting what would happen before each scene, which believe you me wasn't hard at all to do. it's a disgrace and i'm deeply sorry i wasted an hour and a half watching the mess. 1/10.
