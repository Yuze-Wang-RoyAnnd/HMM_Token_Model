terry west had a good idea w\ this movie. he just didn't flesh it thru. there are endless shots of the creepy looking school's exteriors that go on forever and probably to pad the film's running time. also at this school there are only 2 students. misty mundae is good as usual but this film will always belong to ruby larocca (which is the only reason to watch the film in the beginning). if the script centered on her interesting character we'd have a movie to watch. she is so gorgeous!! good news for dvd buyers, terry west's earlier (and better) film "blood for the muse" is a special feature. one thing i'd like to say is that this movie feels like someone who's not good at delivering the punch line at the end of a long joke for the ending feels that very same way. then again, just watch this for ruby larocca.
