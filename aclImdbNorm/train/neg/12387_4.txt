lipstick is another glossy movie failure.i am trying to think of one good thing that i could say about the movie, and i am having trouble coming up with something.i guess the red dress that margaux hemingway was wearing in the end of the movie was the best part.the writing and the script was not the worst that i have ever encountered,but it could have been a lot better. lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to view.the sets were very glossy and nice to look at.the cast was okay. i felt like anne bancroft's character was the only feasible character in the entire movie.it was sad to see chris sarandon waste his time on this one.
