this weekend just passed i watched "28 weeks later" which was very good. after that i watched this film. <br /><br />i have tell you it is one of the most boring so called horror you could ever watch. the scenes were unrealistic, there was no script and no plot. the alien creature was unreal. and the fight scenes mild compared to a school yard fight. and to make it worse the guy named cody had an uncontrollable loose filthy tongue which distracts attention from the main film.<br /><br />forget about this movie; rather go and watch 28 weeks later.<br /><br />cheers, mesake c.
