i didn't feel as if i'd been raped like i did with the enchanted christmas,but belle's magical world is still the antithesis of beauty and the beast. like christmas,bmw hates its audience,although not to such an extreme degree. it's ugly,uncanonical,idiotic,and the writing is horrifically bad.none of the stories work. these are not the characters we loved from batb at all,they're a bunch of pod people. i wanted to dissect it,but after a few minutes,i gave up,because no one in their right mind would take this claptrap seriously. what we have here are three stories. "the perfect word" is an overbearing,ponderous study of forgiveness. "fifi's folly" only works if you can accept that babette's name is actually fifi and that she's a closet james bond villainess and that lumiere is an idiot concerning women. "broken wing" (or "broken wind" as i like to call it) is probably the most heinous of the bunch. beast hates birds? since when? don't watch this crap- every copy of this video deserves to be cremated. beauty and the beast is still a cinematic classic,a transcendent celebration of love,art, intelligence and the human soul.
