as a fan of the sookie stackhouse books, i find this series to be a totally crass representation of them. vampire bill is not very good looking and looks much older than described in the book. i found that they have made already wonderfully colourful characters seem very course and vulgar. one of the things i loved about the books is that despite all the crap that she is going through sookie is always a lady, and yet in the tv series she doesn't seem like that at all. not only that but the prejudices displayed in the tv series are not nearly as wide spread in the books. i didn't expect an exact replica of the books but i at least expected the feel of them to be used for the series.
