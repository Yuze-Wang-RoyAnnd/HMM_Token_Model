diana muldaur appears on star trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. no one on board seems to notice--maybe it was the hair. regardless, this time she is not the receptacle for a god (see the previous episode) but is a very famous lady with magical powers that enable her to communicate and see a medusan without going crazy (the standard human response). unfortunately, the man that is most in love with her is a few cards short of a full deck and he tries to kill the medusan ambassador (who, oddly, lives in a small crate--this is a lousy way to travel). and, unfortunately, muldayr isn't wound all that well herself. what happens next is kind of dumb and by the time the episode was over the first time i saw it, i was pretty relieved. watching all the men on board go ga-ga over muldaur was pretty silly and the acting of spock when he briefly went crazy was pretty campy. do yourself a favor--if you haven't seen the show before, pick a different episode.
