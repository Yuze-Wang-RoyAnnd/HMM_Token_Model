revenge is one of my favorite themes in film. moreso, "the futility of revenge" is one of my favorite themes in film. having seen gaspar noe's irreversible (2002), i was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme. instead, this film is a weak half-hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film's lack of conviction and focus.<br /><br />*spoilers* the end scene, a gratuitous male-on-male rape/torture scene, came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy. however, the film doesn't even follow through with this. instead, the drawn out scene (which far exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized) is crowned with a shot of dawson's face in an expression of either regret or "this didn't fix anything" while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the background.<br /><br />my problem with the scene wasn't one of shock, but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience. i mean, do we feel bad for the rapist? do we rejoice in dawson's revenge? are we disgusted by the brutality of it all? do we feel dawson's moment of regretful clarity? aside from this failing, the film is really sort of awkwardly paced with more style than substance. character's are thin, dialog is monotonous, etc.<br /><br />normally i try to take films on their own terms but descent didn't really seem to know what those were. thumbs down.
