i remember when this was in theaters, reviews said it was horrible. well, i didn't think it was that bad. it was amusing and had a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor concerning families around holiday time.<br /><br />ben affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for christmas to please his girlfriend. he goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for christmas. i really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract. that was funny.<br /><br />so, he makes silly requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read. of course, the family has a hot daughter for the love interest. and he learns that the holidays aren't so bad after all.<br /><br />also, the whole doo-dah act was funny, especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy, and the girlfriends's parents didn't even say anything about it. and the parts where doo-dah is hitting on his "supposed daughter." final verdict: i thought it's worth checking out if you catch it on cable.
