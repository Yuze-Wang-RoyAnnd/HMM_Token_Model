relentlessly stupid, no-budget "war picture" made mainly to show off the attributes of the spectacular eve meyer--not a bad idea in itself--but that should be an embarrassment to everyone connected with it. laughable "script", performances that wouldn't pass muster in an elementary-school christmas pageant, inept "action" scenes, confused direction by the normally competent documentary director louis clyde stoumen--who is apparently not quite sure if he's making a comedy, a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or a leering t&a (by early 1960s standards, anyway) travelogue of eve meyer's magnificent body--and a general air of shoddiness and incompetence. worth seeing in order to watch eve meyer strut her stuff, but that's pretty much it.
