slow, slow, slow... there is no mystery or excitement in this film. if you don't figure out who the "mole" is in the first ten minutes you must be brain dead. the secret service must have been too, because it took them the whole film to put it together. there are no compelling characters in the movie (not film). the pace of the movie is slow there is no tension. the hired killer is an excellent shot unless he is aiming at michael douglas than all he seems to be able to hit is large panes of glass. the funniest scene in the movie is when the presidents wife says the code word at the anticlimactic ending. it is laugh out loud ridiculous. at least six people got up and left the movie early. i would have joined them if i were not sitting in the middle of the row. i would not recommend this film to anyone.
