the novelty of hearing clean-cut jay leno spout four-letter words is the only memorable aspect of this formulaic mismatched-police-partners caper. in collision course, the pelican-faced comedian teams up with the late pat morita to track down a stolen prototype turbocharger (think car lover leno played a hand in the plot?). the two leads try hard, they really do, but leno is no actor and morita's fish-out-of-water routine gets old in a hurry. the film carries a bit of cheesy '80s appeal, but its worthy moments become increasingly scarce as it fills out its overlong 100-minute running time. fans of leno's considerable comedic talents will feel let down; everyone else will just be bored.
