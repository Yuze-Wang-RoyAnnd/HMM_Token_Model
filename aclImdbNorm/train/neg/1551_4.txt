the ladies man is a funny movie. there's not much thought behind it, but what do you expect from an snl movie? it's actually better than most snl movies (i.e. superstar or a night at the roxbury) tim meadows and will ferrell were both very funny. chris parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the funnier ones in the movie). other than that, the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support meadows. i've definitely seen funnier movies, but i've seen dumber ones too. again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for a few laughs. it was funnier as a skit though. but still, if you're looking for a pretty funny movie, i'd recommend this one. just don't think about it too much, or you'll hate it.<br /><br />rating: 6/10
