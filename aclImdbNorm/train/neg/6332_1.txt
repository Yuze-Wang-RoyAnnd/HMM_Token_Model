i looked forward to seeing this movie when it came out, since i was a huge snl fan. when my boyfriend and i went to see it, the people coming out of the early show were yelling, "don't waste your money!" but of course we had to find out for ourselves.<br /><br />while there were a few funny bits (laser bra 2000, root boy slim), most of it felt like it could have been severely edited down to an amusing 1 hour show. it was pretty bad.<br /><br />when the opera singer came on, many people got up and walked out. this made me laugh, because i realized that o'donoghue was just pressing people's buttons on purpose with this movie. or else he was just insane. whatever - you don't need to waste your time watching it, it's that bad.
