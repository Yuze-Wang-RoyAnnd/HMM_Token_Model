this movie could have been very good, but comes up way short. cheesy special effects and so-so acting. i could have looked past that if the story wasn't so lousy. if there was more of a background story, it would have been better. the plot centers around an evil druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines. the movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything, it just keeps plodding on. christopher walken has a part, but it is completely senseless, as is most of the movie. this movie had potential, but it looks like some really bad made for tv movie. i would avoid this movie.
