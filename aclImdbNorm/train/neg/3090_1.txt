i really don't have anything new to add but i just felt like i had to comment on this sack. so here goes:<br /><br />atrocious. i'm running through my mst3k dvd collection again and i just watched hobgoblins for about the 10th time. it's really, really painful but it was next on the list... you can see that there is a tiny kernel of an actual movie buried under all the crap that is "hobgoblins" but it just couldn't get out. everything about this movie is 4th rate. the story, the acting, the effects, the women, the "action scenes", the... ahhhh forget it. i can watch a piece of crap like "the bloodwaters of dr. z" (aka "zaat") over and over and over with hardly any ill effects (i like it in fact- btw, it will be on tcm later this month- october, 2009) but "hobgoblins" is a whole 'nother ballgame.<br /><br />the worst part of it all may be that it's now about 12 hours after the movie ended, i had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my medications, and yet the ersatz "new wave" dance music that amy, red shorts, and laraine newman were frolicking to in the living room is still running through my head. this torment will last for days. <br /><br />good luck, won't you?
