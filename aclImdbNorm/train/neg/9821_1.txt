it is not often i watch a film that is as dreadful as this one. i continued to watch, every minute hoping that this was intended as a joke only to find it was meant to be taken seriously. well, as seriously as this genre requests.<br /><br />the acting was disgraceful and the situations horribly contrived and clich'ed. if a film was made in 1920 (for example) and had the quality of hide & seek (cord) in its direction we would think that cinema back then was naive. as it happens, this film was made in 2000 and i have yet to see a film from the silent era that has as little charm as this one.<br /><br />definitely not for the serious movie-goer.<br /><br />[not worth a rating]
