i had high hopes for this film. i thought the premise interesting. i stuck through it, even though i found the acting, save helena bonham carter, unremarkable. i kept hoping my time spent would pay off, but in the end i was left me wondering why they even bothered to make this thing. maybe in george orwell's version there is a message worth conveying. if this film accomplished anything, it has inspired me to read orwell's classic. i find it hard to believe his tale could be as disappointing as this adaption. if the film maker's message is "the mundane life is worth living", well then, they've succeeded. i would recommend this film to no one; 101 minutes of my life wasted.
