this movie is trash-poor. it has horrible taste, and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on real-events - which doesn't add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment. direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are out-of-place. not sure what robin williams saw in this character or story. to start, williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting. what's worse, his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot device. you have an older rory culkin tastelessly spouting "d_ck_smker" - in good fun- which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the williams character. finally you have sandra oh as a guardian angel adviser to williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end. toni collete's character is just plain annoying and a re-hash of her 6th sense performance with poorer direction. very miss-able.
