well, basically, the movie blows! it's blair witch meets sean penn's ill conceived fantasy about going to iraq to show the world what the "war on terror" is really about. the script sounds like it was written by 8th grader (no offense to 8th graders); the two main actors over-act the entire film; they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of film(not that i know anything about those things--but it just didn't look like real documentaries i've watched), and worst of all christian johnson took a great idea and made it suck. it reminded me of the time i tried to draw a picture of my dog and ended up with a really bad stick figure looking thing that looked more like a giant turd. i'd rather watch the blair witch viii, than sit through that again.
