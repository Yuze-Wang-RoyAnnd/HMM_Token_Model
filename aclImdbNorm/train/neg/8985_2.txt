previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on tcm, but it was a severe disappointment. lupe valdez is great, but doesn't get enough screen time. frank morgan and eugene palette play familiar but promising characters, but the script leaves them stranded.<br /><br />the movie revolves around the ego of lee tracy's character, who is at best a self-centered, physically and verbally abusive jerk. the reactions of "the public" are poorly thought-out and unbelievable, making the "shenanigans" seem like contrivances of a bad writer. and it strains credulity that the lupe velez character could fall for him.<br /><br />the "stinging one-liners" mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer, since i didn't even notice that an attempt was being made.
