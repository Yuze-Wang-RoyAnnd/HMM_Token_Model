i saw this movie, and at times, i was unnerved believing this movie 'saw me.' munchie sullies the 'farce' for years to come. re-watch star wars, don't-watch munchie.<br /><br />as a responsible parent (i'm speaking to those who are parents now), i (you) would not let my (your) child ever partake of this video festival of the pseudo-occult. to insinuate munchie is satanic, to a co-viewer, is likely to illicit a chilled 'duh.' he is fiendish, alien, rodential, and wholly malevolent - like the bogey man made flesh, invisible to adults, tempting children with lifestyles they could never afford (without the income made possible by years of self denial and prudent stewardship). he is a peddler of easy answers, and false ideals. he is everything the morally conscious viewer is not. he is the devil's own ron popeil.<br /><br />i pray (i mean this literally and figuratively, with an emphasis on the former) that this movie has not made the format jump to dvd. it is my hope that this type of 'yellow film making' died an un-mourned death in the cold nights of 1994.<br /><br />munchie also loves pizza. i forgot to mention that. it comes up a lot.
