a note to all of you budding film writers: study this film. if your dialog reads like the dialog in this film, please shred your script and try again.<br /><br />i didn't have high expectations, but was intrigued by the description indicating there was a mystery at the christmas ornament factory. the mystery is resolved very early and the film becomes a straight romance. i almost stopped watching it at 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and at the first break. my spouse , who is the hallmark & lifetime fan, gave up at the first break. <br /><br />forest river is a company town - the main business is aikens ornaments, who make all manner of holiday decorations.the patriarch of the company has recently passed away, so the companies future might be in question. we soon meet noelle, who would rather be on wall street than main street, and the mysterious justin, who gets a date with noelle after a large snowman she is inflating crashes into justins car. once we meet alison aikens, doing due diligence for the board, we have our story setup.<br /><br />if you can't nail all the story arcs by the first commercial break, you haven't seen enough of this kind of holiday film. maybe that's a good thing.
