my friends and i rented this from blockbuster because we saw nana visitor's name on the box. this movie is a travesty i hope she negates from her cv.<br /><br />the "plot" was lose and flaccid, the acting was mostly dry and unbearable in some parts. the movie made no sense whatsoever. the rough plot of an alien parasite species that infects humans has been done many times by films with much better scripts than this, for example, invasion of the body-snatchers and the faculty.<br /><br />if you ever have the misfortune to come across this movie, i suggest you burn it.<br /><br />how it classes itself as a horror movie when there was no use of fear, suspense, gore, terror or any of the usual horror film techniques i don't know, however if you still find yourself wanting to watch this film i suggest you have a lot of sugar before hand, so you can find parts of it funny.
