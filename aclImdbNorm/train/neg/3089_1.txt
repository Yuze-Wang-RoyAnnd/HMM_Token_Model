this movie is so bad, it's comical. in fact, mystery science theatre 3000, the television show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies, used this very film to mock. i suggest watching it (maybe on youtube) instead of actually seeing this movie.<br /><br />please, do not see hobgoblins if you're not prepared to stop within the first scene. actually, do not see this movie, period. please. at least not seriously. its jokes are not funny (to say the least), and you'll have much more fun parodying or watching a parody of it then viewing the movie.<br /><br />you may feel yourself becoming sick upon watching, so spare yourself. read a book. do the laundry. anything is more fun than watching hobgoblins.
