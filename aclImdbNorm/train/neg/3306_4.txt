a very "straight" nice old lady, desperate for money to save her house and possessions, grows "pot" in her house, smokes it with a few old-biddy friends and then sells it. that's the story for this low-key comedy, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation and some of the humor the predicament brings. for much of the film, it works. the humor isn't of the laugh-out-loud variety but it does keep you entertained for an hour-and-a- half, so i guess it serves its purpose.<br /><br />there are funny moments and brenda blethyn is fun to watch in the lead role. but the ending really ruined a "cute" movie with insultingly-bad messages that only the ultra-liberals of the film world would like to see happen.<br /><br />like most people, i would prefer a happy ending, too, but it should not all warm and fuzzy for those who blatantly break the law. also in here are the typical (1) children out of wedlock but that poses no problem and is deemed okay; (2) clerics portrayed as morally weak people; and (3) even a medical doctor who gets stoned, too! <br /><br />hello? and reviewers here blast hollywood? this is exhibit a how a secular society has lowered the standards in the uk and europe in general. hey, people: at least have a trace of morality instead of nothing but a timothy leary "if it feels good, do it" message.
