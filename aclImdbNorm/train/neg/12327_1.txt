a previous reviewer said the movie is not all that bad. what?!?!?! the movie glorifies child molestation. oh, but sylvia kristel was naked in it, so let's give it 5 out of 10 stars. why not a full 10? because the filmography was "agonizing," the child's looks of shock were "unrealistic," and the fat friend was "irritating." nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage that an american movie in 1981 featured scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman. i happened to catch this steaming loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had showtime. to me, even if the fat friend had acted up a storm and was a deserving of an oscar, i would still have to give the movie only 1 star. that tv's howard hessman starred in the movie at the same time as he was appearing in wkrp is particularly ridiculous. but don't take my word for it!
