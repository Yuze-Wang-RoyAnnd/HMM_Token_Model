a young boy sees his mother getting killed and his father hanging himself. 20 years later he gets a bunch of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself so he won't turn out like his father. all the stock characters are in place: the nice couple; the "funny" guy; the tough (but sensitive) hood; the smart girl (she wears glasses--that's how we know); the nerd and two no-personality blondes. it all involves some stupid wooden statue that comes to life (don't ask) and kills people. i knew i was in trouble when, after a great opening scene, we jump to 20 years later--all bad horror movies do that!<br /><br />the dialogue is atrocious, the acting is bad (except for betsy palmer--why betsy?) and the killings are stupid and/or unimaginative. my favorite scene is when two people are supposedly having sex and the statue knocks the guy off the bed to show he's fully dressed! a real bad, stupid incoherent horror film. avoid at all costs.
