whoa. in the twin cities, we have a station that shows a "big bad movie" monday through friday. tonight's nugget was a film with carrie fisher called "she's back" about a really annoying woman who ends up getting murdered when thugs break into her house. bea (beatrice) comes back to haunt her husband. she wants him to seek revenge on her killers, hence "she's back". and she won't let him rest until he does so. she irritates him endlessly... and the viewers, too! this movie is truly one of the worst movies i've ever seen. hey, i like bad movies, though (my fave movie is xanadu). i was really shaking my head throughout the whole film, wondering who thought this would be a good idea for a movie. bea is just so annoying. the plot is silly; the acting is bad; the story... well, you get my drift. anyway, if you wanna see a really bad movie - really really bad movie, check this one out. you won't be disappointed. heh.
