williamson's accent is tough to wade through. he speaks incredibly quickly, like he is in a rush to get through the lines. during the soliloquies he acts as if he is talking to someone, when he is supposed to be talking to himself. all that and his bald spot just annoyed me. he was just too old for this role. in reading other accounts of williamson, maybe he got this role because he was mad and the director decided to do a bit of life-imitates-art or forced method acting. when the actors declare hamlet mad you believe it! marianne faithful is a stunning beauty and could botch the role of ophelia and still get a pass. the set is dark and foreboding but it does look as if shot in a real castle especially the scenes in the tunnels/corridors where the dead king shines as a great light in the sky.
