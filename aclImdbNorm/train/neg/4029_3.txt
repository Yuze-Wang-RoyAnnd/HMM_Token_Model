the story idea behind the lost missile isn't bad at all, but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well as poor special effects sink this film to the sub-par level.<br /><br />the film begins with a missile heading towards the earth. in a panic because it's about to strike the earth, the soviets manage to deflect the object. this isn't necessarily good, however, as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet. in other words, with each pass it makes, a swath of death follows--one that could potentially kill us all!! so, it's up to the good scientists of the us (led by a very young and hardly recognizable robert loggia) to formulate and plan to save us--and especially save new york that is in its immediate flight path! unfortunately, they aren't able to save ottawa (i've never been there, so i can't say whether or not this is a big loss) but thanks to good old american know-how, they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction!! <br /><br />so, as you can see, the story idea isn't bad and rather original. but, so many old clips of fighter planes and guys manning radar scopes gets a bit old and it seemed like padding. overall, a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may like--all others, see it at your own risk.
