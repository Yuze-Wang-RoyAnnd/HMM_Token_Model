in keeping with disney's well-known practice of stealing.. i mean.. buying out known properties and bastardizing them, this live-action version of the venerable cartoon classic has got to be one of the worst re-makes in a year of bad re-makes. i grew up on the original cartoon tv series. any episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughs than this entire movie. not present is penny's cool computer book. also not present is the gag with the self-destructing orders that always ends up detonating on the chief. new are a smooth talking gadget convertible (the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car) and an element of a typical, unrealistic hollywood romance. don't fill the coffers to pay for disney executives and even their _ex_executives - don't see this movie.<br /><br />
