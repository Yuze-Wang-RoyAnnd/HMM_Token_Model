former private eye-turned-security guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession. his assignment: to tail a mysterious french woman newly arrived in california...and apparently wanted by suit-and-tie racketeers. unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre, without enough sting or wit (or involving plot dynamics) in the screenplay. director and co-scenarist paul magwood (who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement) doesn't give off the impression of having high regard for the '40s films his "chandler" was borne from; his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled, but also bitter-tinged and somewhat indifferent. the handling is curiously, commendably low-keyed, and warren oates is well-cast as this '70s variant on the 'private dick' archetype, but the movie doesn't have any snap. nice to see leslie caron and gloria grahame in the cast--though neither has much to do, and caron's hot-and-cold running character is exasperating throughout. vivid cinematography by alan stensvold, nice location shooting, but it fails to come to any kind of a boil. *1/2 from ****
