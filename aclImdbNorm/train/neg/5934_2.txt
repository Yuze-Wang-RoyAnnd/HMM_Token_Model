i would not consider myself as one of leonard cohen's greatest fans. he does however feature as an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. by far the most valuable element in this documentary is to hear leonard's reflections on his own life and career. warming and humble. <br /><br />unfortunately the most of the musicians featured in the concert didn't converse the nuances of leonard's musical / literary manner. nick cave, jarvis cocker & beth orton were the exceptions, even though leonard highly values rufus wainrights interpretations of his songs.<br /><br />what particularly failed in this documentary was the ability of the filmmaker to allow the viewer to see who leonard cohen is and how these musicians connect to him. a lot is said in this respect, but the viewer is not drawn into the person leonard cohen. this failing is especially evident with the interviews with bono and the edge. they view leonard as a special icon, but can't translate their exact value of leonard cohen. the collaboration with u2 is a farce. the entire live registration looks like a rushed job. and just as in the whole film, only leonard cohen remains his part and can tell about his own part.<br /><br />the entire montage and screenplay is much like a high school extramural project. the use of effects such as echo, slow-motion or flashed images are ill placed. some of the camera-work is dismal. part of the score hardly recalls any associations i may have expected. at times it seemed the filmmaker was adding psychotic elements to the film. perhaps a reference to his once use of lsd.<br /><br />some unintentional humor ... at some point leonard tells how he influenced a musical genre. initially he can't recall the genre's name, until eventually he says it was punk, the punksters really picked up on his music. the next scene in the film is a live cover of 'i can't forget' ...<br /><br />"and i can't forget, i can't forget i can't forget but i don't remember who"
