you know this is gonna be a cheesy movie when:<br /><br />1. it was made it the 50's 2. it's in black and white. 3. it has no name actors! 4. screaming makes up for the lack of special effects!<br /><br />well not to be outdone - this movie brilliantly incorporated all four of the above elements to turn this into a true cinematic blunder.<br /><br />okay - shhhhh but i am gonna discuss special effects here - or lack of them - <br /><br />did you catch the underwater scenes? it looks like it was poorly filmed through an aquarium - note the cape flapping in the breeze.<br /><br />and the repeated re-use of stock footage, (exterior house shots, the bridges scenes -- great enhanced the k-r-a-f-tiness of this film - not since "plan 9" - have i seen such creative usage of stock footage.<br /><br />and hey where there was a lack of special effects - not to worry - screaming does take the place of special effects in this movie as well. yes this movie even cleverly used that old hack trick.<br /><br />grab the popcorn - set your brain on stun (several fermented beverages definitely helps), sit back, and wonder: why the heck did they put this on film again?<br /><br />wayno<br /><br />
