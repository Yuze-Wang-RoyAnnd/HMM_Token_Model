it's impossible for me to objectively consider this movie. not that i haven't tried, mind you - but i sit down, and i pop in the aged vhs, and i watch the opening...and suddenly i'm five years old again and clutching my very own care bear and watching the movie with open eyes and an eager heart.<br /><br />i can see, objectively, that this movie is a bizarre combination of cuddly baby merchandising-mascots and creepy prepubescent children with evil powers that has a thin story and uninteresting animation. but my inner five-year-old goes, "yay! care bears!" every time i think about it. so - i'd only (cautiously, reluctantly) recommend this movie for those who saw it during their early youth and can call on the awesome power of nostalgia while watching it (like me) or those lovably cynical gen-x/y-ers who deliberately seek out the wonderfully bad/strange (a category in which this movie...definitely belongs). to those actually looking for a compelling movie or wholesome family entertainment: you might want to keep looking.
