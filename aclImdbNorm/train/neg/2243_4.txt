it doesn't even merit a review, other than as a warning to potential viewers. it's a somewhat generic ghost story about an actress haunting a studio during the filming of a wwii period drama. there's no fear involved, no suspense whatsoever, nor any surprises. one shocking moment that looks a bit too silly to be shocking. the visual style is very flat and dull, although there is some really nice editing once in a while. the story never comes together, and the films is really just a total bust. 4/10.
