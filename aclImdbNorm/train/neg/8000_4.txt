i already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a satire, there were numerous political and social messages, the names make refer to some other names etc. it might be. i cannot realize such things (i don't want to do anyway) because i am not interested in, i am interested in 'cinema'. as for the movie itself, again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful. i could not see anything which we don't see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half. yes, that scene says somethings about humanity, but it does not make the movie brilliant. the movie is entertaining (mildly) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but no more than that. as for the biggest flaw of the movie, it is visual effects. it was just shocking, i could not pull myself together for a while, because i had expected a realistic monster, because it is not one of the old gojira movies, it was made in 2006, but it was not. it is like if you don't believe that there is a monster, you cannot care about. if you agree with me about this, i highly recommend you cloverfield that is extremely realistic. the design of the monster is not interesting, but at least planned, there is an effort. dramatically powerful critique. some critics talk about it as if it is a kurosawa movie. yes, it is rather a drama than a thriller or action, but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful. i don't want to compare the host with other monster movies, but i try to mean that the host does not do something that other monster movies do not do. by the way, may be some people call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for asian cinema. yes, i like asian cinema too, but this is the fact.
