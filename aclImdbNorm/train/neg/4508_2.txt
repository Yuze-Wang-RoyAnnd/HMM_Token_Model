andrewjlau, i could not agree more. my girlfriend is watching this at this very moment, and i find this movie appalling. quote from my chinese girlfriend, laughing: "they are doing all this for a man!?" <br /><br />i find these women have no intensity, no sense of the a fight between tragedy and identity, and that these men are hardly worth fighting for. during the dance scene where zhang zi yi wins them over, the men look stupid more than admiring.<br /><br />japanese people have much more intensity than chinese people, and being geisha is japanese culture. i am sure the chinese had something similar, but the faces do not match the main.<br /><br />anyway, the dialogue is so unmysterious, so american. had a european done it with european orientals, they would have done a far better job.<br /><br />i have to add: it seems most of the people who liked the film are american. sorry to say, but no wonder. all spelt out for you, not instinctive, not passionate. i think the chinese actresses are lovely, but i could not say they were good actors in this film. yes, the cinematography is great, but really, i cannot see how it can be seen that these characters are complex, deep individuals.<br /><br />i'm going to japan to see the real thing. i am sure that would be amazing to see.
