"after the atomic bombs carried by a shot-down soviet bomber explode in the arctic, the creature 'gammera' is released from his hibernation. the giant prehistoric turtle proceeds on a path to tokyo and destroys anything in his path. the military and the scientific community rush to find a means to stop this monster before tokyo is laid to waste," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis. <br /><br />the re-produced for american audiences version of this, the first film in the "gamera" series, adds english language material that is even funnier than the regularly dubbed japanese fare. clearly, the monster is following in the footsteps of "godzilla". taking his cue from abc's faddish "batman!" tv series, musician wes farrell's ludicrous theme song heightens the us version's camp appeal.<br /><br />*** gammera the invincible (12/15/66) sandy howard, noriaki yuasa ~ dick o'neill, brian donlevy, albert dekker, john baragrey
