the acting, other reviews notwithstanding, was remarkably well-done. brad pitt handles the role of an annoying, obnoxious austrian climber quite well. other acting is fine. the story could have been riveting, but somehow, it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown, and so the story, which could have been quite dramatic, fails to draw in this audience.<br /><br />beautiful scenery and cinematography, a remarkably dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world that we live in - but i could not, try as i might, involve myself in this story. as an unabashed brad pitt fan (i consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), i expected to *love* this flick - and yet, it left me cold.<br /><br />it could be a failing within myself, but i tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction, scriptwriting, production, editing - somehow, they lost me. it's a shame, because it could have been wonderful.<br /><br />good acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent. it wasn't. probably worth watching, just to make your own mind up on it - but don't expect too much, and perhaps you won't be as disappointed as i was. mostly, it bored me.
