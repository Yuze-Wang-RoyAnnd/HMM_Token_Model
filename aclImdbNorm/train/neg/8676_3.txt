avoid the usa version. it is with added us footage and the worst dubbing you've ever heard probably done by new york amateurs. the dubbing is so bad that it sounds like mystery science theater 3000. i think a black guy from the bronx does chiba's voice. i couldn't watch the entire film it was that bad. instead of this americanized version watch chiba's other greats like the streetfighter or karate warriors.
