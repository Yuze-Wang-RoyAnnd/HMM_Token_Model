hybrid starts as water treatment planet security guard aaron scates (cory monteith) is involved in an accident which leaves him blind. luckily it just so happens that brilliant scientist dr. andrea hewitt (justine bateman) who works for olaris has developed an operation to transplant organs from one species to another, hewitt decides aaron would be perfect for her first human experiment. hewitt & her team transplant the eyes of a wolf into aaron & he miraculously regains his sight. brilliant, right? well, no not really since aaron starts to go mad as he sees random images of wolves & starts to develop a lust for blood. aaron escapes the olaris building & goes on the run but he is too valuable to just let go & a full scale search is mounted to capture him...<br /><br />directed by yelena lanskaya this is yet another sci-fi channel offering that is quite simply put terrible in every possible way, i think it probably started out life as a straight 'creature feature' but ended up as one of the most boring & dull sci-fi channel films i have seen that doesn't even feature any sort of monster or creature. hybrid is awful, the script is terrible & i am not even sure who it was meant to appeal to. the initial set-up is ok with aaron getting wolf eyes but then hybrid ditches the sci-fi elements & becomes some sort of horrible drama as it focuses entirely on aaron's mental state as he wonders around doing nothing in particular with some native american woman. yep, you don't think the sci-fi channel could make a film about wolves & put loads of rubbish about native american mythology in there as well do you? the dynamics of the character's is bizarre, aaron is shown as the persecuted hero yet he is the only character to kill anyone in the film & is a fairly unlikable, ungrateful & annoying person while dr. hewitt is shown as the evil scientist yet she gives aaron back his sight & does nothing but try to help him. i mean aaron is given back the gift of sight yet hewitt is the villain? also the regular sci-fi channel staple of us military intervention is present, the problem is why do they want aaron so badly? he isn't a soldier & while he has wolves eyes to help him see in the dark he's utterly unremarkable. the script can't make it's mind up whether it's all in aaron's mind or it's real, the ending is hilariously bad with a half naked (rememeber this was made for telly) aaron running through a forest with a pack of wolves set to some horrible music that i think is supposed to be emotional but makes it even more funny. there are so many things wrong with hybrid, it's slower than hell, there's virtually no action, there's no werewolves & the film goes round in circles trying to get into aaron's mind yet it's all so ridiculous, silly & boring you won't care one bit & there's never any explanation as to why despite just having wolves eyes transplanted aaron starts to develop other wolf senses.<br /><br />as a diabetic i have problems with my eyes, hell i have had major surgery on my right eye & i can guarantee you that after an operation your eye would be puffed up, you wouldn't be able to open it & it would hurt like hell yet despite having eye transplants as soon as aaron wakes up in bed his eyes are perfect with no swelling or even redness. there are no special effects, no blood or gore or violence & nothing to excite you. in fact now i think about it there's nothing even remotely horror or sci-fi feeling about this, it feels like a drab film of the week.<br /><br />filmed in manitoba in canada the film looks ok but is bland & forgettable. the acting is poor from all involved none of whom i have seen before & hopefully never again.<br /><br />hybrid is a terrible film that is obviously marketed as some werewolve 'creature feature' but is far from that & most people will really struggle to get to the awful ending which will probably have you in stitches.
