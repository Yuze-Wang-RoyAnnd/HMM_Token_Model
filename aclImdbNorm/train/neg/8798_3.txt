i like a movie that has at least a vestige of a story. this doesn't occur in this movie. it's a series of vignettes with no cohesion.<br /><br />there are scenes of a person collecting pineapple cans. a woman with a blond wig never removes her sun glasses. this woman shoots at other people at the beginning of the movie and we never find out why. she disappears completely after about 30 minutes. there is another coquettish woman who endlessly cleans a man's apartment. there are endless scenes at a fast food joint where the mamas & papas 'california dreaming' is vastly overplayed (i used to like the song). the dialogue is mostly concerned with food (pineapples, chef's salad and ordering drinks
