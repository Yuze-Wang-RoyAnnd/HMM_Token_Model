obvious attack on microsoft made by people who don't appear to understand intellectual property or market economies generally.<br /><br />loony liberal tim robbins plays a painfully obvious caricature of bill gates, and is a cartoonish corporate villain ordering murders right and left.<br /><br />while microsoft may engage in some anticompetitive activity at times, it's unlikely they actually murder people. therefore, the film is over the top and ridiculous from the beginning.<br /><br />the "deeper" point is apparently that major tech innovations should be free to the public, and not subject to intellectual property laws. however, this ignores the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed if not for the market incentives (and rewards) provided by intellectual property.<br /><br />it's one thing to be opposed to anti-competitive conduct -- that's common sense. it's quite another to be opposed to market competition in the first place, which is what the film's mantra ("knowledge belongs to mankind") represents.<br /><br />yet another example of hollywood being completely out of touch with reality.
