just emailed a friend who's in film school about this flick. something to avoid when making a film - characters blabbering senseless, overwrought, convoluted monologues on screen that are ultimately trite and unconvincing. if the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal barrages are so over-the-top that they actually draw attention to the film constructed as film and effectively neutralize that intent. is it the acting, or the script that is bad, or both?<br /><br />the protagonist is also highly unbelievable for social realism - ravenously consuming canonical english literature and the bible while high or hungover and able to produce such profoundly sophomoric soliloquies while intoxicated? and how is such an unattractive, unwashed and verbally noxious character able to bed most of the women he meets within minutes of encountering them? (i had to applaud when one chick finally threw him out onto the street, despite his whining and self-pitying banter).<br /><br />the viewer encounters pretentious references to ancient greek literature, nostradamus and the book of revelations. the impending doom of mankind, in the form of bar codes imprinted on our foreheads or right hands in spooky biblical fashion, is presented to a character who is oh-so-cleverly exposed in his role as a guardian of empty space. <br /><br />this flick is over-scripted and over the top - a melodrama clumsily infused with pedestrian "philosophy" about the meaning of mankind, life, etc. it is trite, overwrought and tedious.<br /><br />there are some very fine english films available with content similar to this film. "nil by mouth" is an excellent, far more interesting excursion into the lives of individuals in a similar social milieu. ditto for "in the warzone." and although the comparison is not even warranted, check out anything by peter greenaway, who far more deftly handles dialogue, wit and absurd characters and situations.
