i saw this by accident one lazy summer afternoon. it was playing on the family programming channel of hbo. at first i was drawn in, by what i thought was a disney animation. but then, after a few minutes, i found myself searching for the remote, so i could find the 'info button', to find out what in the world was on my tv. i have nothing against harvey f., i enjoy him in many of his films, but one thing he is not, is a voice-over artist. sure he has one of the more unique voices in hollywood, but it works only as a part of a bigger visual package. attaching his voice to a cute duck made watching somewhat difficult. as for the rest of the cast, uninspired. i suppose working on this film didn't appeal to the really good voice over talent out there.<br /><br />so, weak voice talent, strong animation...who was this film targeting? gay adolescent ducks? i don't get it. is there really such a dearth of role-models for young up and coming homosexuals, that we must resort to animated ducks? cute story, and like the title, this movie i found hard to love, just like an ugly duckling.
