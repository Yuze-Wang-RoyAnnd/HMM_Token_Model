i went on a visit to one of my relatives a while back, and we popped by a theatre, so we'd thought we'd go in and give this film a go. what a mistake! this film is awful in every department. i'd never heard of the film before, and literally everyone still hasn't. no wonder, this is as rank as it gets. it's a comedy, so it says, well the only thing funny is the ability, or lack of it, of the director to make such a film. getting so close to christmas, this should be titled how to under-cook a turkey in nearly one and a half hours - or however long it was, as i walked out. at the end of the film, you'll come out feeling as though you've been food poisoned on a sick turkey, and regret you wasted your time on such dribble. who knows why such things get made. some people had walked out from the theatre before the film was well over, and i blame myself for not walking out a lot earlier. it really annoys me that you pay good money to see something decent, and all that you come out and see is a poor tv movie that should be showed at 2 o'clock in the morning, in fact, it's that bad, day time tv shouldn't be showing it. what else can a say...probably not enough bad words could do it justice.
