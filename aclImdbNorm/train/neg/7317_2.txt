having read the other comments on this film, i would like to share my own view that this is one tough movie to see unless you are a total brooksophile. i am not.<br /><br />when looked at by a purely objective observer, the film is an unbalanced narrative that presents us with more undistilled neuroses than are capable of being absorbed in one sitting. it is quite difficult to watch. the brooks character (robert cole) is so unsympathetic and unpleasant that it is hard to relate to him---let alone root for him as he stumbles from one dysfunctional self-absorbed situation to the next. and he should never do a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context. no man could have that much exposed foliage and be supposed to turn on a babe like kathryn harrold----unless, of course, he is albert brooks in an albert brooks-controlled production.<br /><br />"modern romance" has its amusing moments-----but they are fragmentary and infrequent. more often than not, i felt as if i were on a confined journey with a thoroughly dislikable person and wishing that it would end already. it confirms the problems that can develop when too much control of a film is placed in only one person---someone who lacks the self-discipline to be able to step back from it and see what is clearly happening.<br /><br />as most people probably know, james l. brooks, who played the director in this film, is in fact what he portrayed. six years later, he cast albert brooks in the very successful "broadcast news." james showed us how albert can shape a credible and entertaining comic performance. albert allowed us to see james (generally not cast as an actor) do a rare comic turn in a surprisingly effective manner.<br /><br />fans of "modern romance" will by now have moved on to the next laudatory comment about it. to you i say-----there is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a film intended as an entertainment.
