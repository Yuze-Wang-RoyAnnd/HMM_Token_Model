we had starz free weekend and i switched on the station to see what was on . it was this movie howling ii: the acting was terrible but the eye candy was great. sybil danning and marsha brown as the afore mentioned eye candy. i was laughing a lot from the few scenes i saw.<br /><br />my friends wonder why i never want to go to horror movies , if they saw this film they would know why. i would get thrown out for laughing so hard.<br /><br />just a couple of trivia notes : reb brown who played ben white had played captain american in a made for tv movie marsha brown was mick jaggers inspiration for the song "brown sugar" mick has great taste in women for sure.
