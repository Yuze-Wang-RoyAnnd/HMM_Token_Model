this movie kinda let me down. it seemed a lot like the movie jaws when the hopper was telling the mayor to close parks was like when roy shider was telling the mayor to close the beaches. they both said no way its summer! but the box says hopper has to get into the mind of a killer and think like one. but he really doesn't do anything too interesting or exciting. i'm not even a little convinced he and his partner have any experience doing police work when they are in the office wondering how they are gonna solve this case. they just say lets do police work and we'll solve it. and whats up with all the old men with pool cues. i didn't even begin to believe that they were mob bosses. and then the guy who was doubting the guy the mob picked to handle finding the killer. with his hundred dollar haircut and that he thinks his di@k is the size of a schoolbus. come on what cruddy lines. i thought he was gonna hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies. i got this movie used and wouldn't buy it new. i suggest you skip this movie. oh and it was funny seeing the microphone above the scene where hopper is going out to get coffee.
