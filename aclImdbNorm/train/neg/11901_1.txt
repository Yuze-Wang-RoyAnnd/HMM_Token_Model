"land of plenty" is not a film. it is a tombstone for the directorial career of german director wim wenders.<br /><br />many felt it in "the million dollar hotel" and now "land of plenty" makes it perfectly clear; not only has wenders lost it, he's actually turned into a bad director, creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes.<br /><br />one might argue that the "time you lose it" comes for every director, but wenders' case is extreme. it's as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again - only to get sloppish results.<br /><br />in a few words, this film does not deserve your time.
