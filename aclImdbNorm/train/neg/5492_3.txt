the folks at disney have a lot to explain. first and foremost, why anyone thought this lesser-sitcom material would ever make even a half-decent motion picture. in the kooky 60's teleplay, the unique idea of martians among us had not yet been given the sophisticated x-files treatment. quaint visions of little green men have long since been dispelled by the likes of e.t., close encounters and aliens 1-3.<br /><br />any charm the property had was mainly due to the endearing relationship created between the late bill bixby as tim and ray walston as the unworldly visitor. the conceit that martians have antenna seemed dopey back then. now it seems positively idiotic. yet, christopher lloyd's uncle martin sports the metallic appendages. in an early shot, the antenna on a sign for the tv station tim works at is supposed to make us think "martian"! when's the last time you saw a tv with rabbit ears, eh?<br /><br />disney doesn't trust quaint or relationships and crams this flick with youth-wooing special effects that include a talking space suit named zoot! yes, you read that correctly - uncle martin's silver space suit speaks. he is supposed to be a real hilarious cut-up! figure again. i got stretch socks that are funnier than zoot. whenever the action lags (and it lags constantly), computer graphics are put into play to liven things up. tim is here played by the amiable jeff daniels, who can't (or won't) do anything to save this floudering mess. zesty christine ebersole brings some comic zeal to her neighbor lady role. even ray walston himself is dragged painfully into the procedings - all to no avail. this alien visitor is dead on arrival.<br /><br />constant talk of sitcoms turning to screen makes me only hope that the i dream of jeannie movie won't feature a talking harem outfit. i pray that samantha's cat in the movie bewitched doesn't have lines. i live in fear that i love lucy - the movie will proudly feature a cg conga drum named bongo.<br /><br />paging michael eisner! mickey mouse - take me to your leader.
