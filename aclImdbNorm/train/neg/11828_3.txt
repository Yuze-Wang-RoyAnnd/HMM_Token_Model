a few months ago, i was involved in a debate with another imdb poster (hey, kmadden) about this film. the poster insisted that if i gave 'flushed away' a chance, i would like it. based partially on that argument, i agreed to watch the film.<br /><br />'flushed away' has good intentions (at least on aardman's part), but lacks the strength to pull it all together. its best asset is sewer rat/boat captain, rita (played by kate winselt), who, imo, should have been the movie's main character instead of roddy (hugh jackman). rita's cool, tough, and interesting, while roddy spends much of his screen time sniveling.<br /><br />one of the things that bothered me most about 'fa' is the repetition of jokes that aren't funny to begin with. when roddy gets hit in the crouch, the film makes sure he gets hit five more times immediately. "my name's shocky," says one of rita's brothers, who then electrocutes roddy at least three times. my tolerance for cheap gags that involve pain is at an all time low.<br /><br />i won't waste time griping about katzenberg's kleptomaniac tendencies toward pixar (one similar film's a coincidence, five's a rip off.), but i will say i'm disappointed in aardman. they can do (and have done) so much better. try harder next time, guys.
