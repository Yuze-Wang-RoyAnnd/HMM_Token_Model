it seems like more consideration has gone into the imdb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />here's a review without pretensions:<br /><br />just when you think nothing is going to happen, it doesn't.<br /><br />dress it up any way you like, this is a dull film, full of unengaging characters doing very little of interest.<br /><br />one to put on if you want to convince an impressionable emo chick that you're like, so deep, man.<br /><br />not something to watch for your own pleasure though.<br /><br />unless.<br /><br />you're.<br /><br />pretentious.
