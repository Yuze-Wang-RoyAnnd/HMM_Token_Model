i had the good fortune of reading the book before seeing the movie. it was an epic of adolescence, a dream of summers gone, a great potential indie film or big budget drama. it somehow got into the hands of a hack, who clearly took notes watching boogie nights and rushmore without actually learning anything at all. the script loses the meat of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low brow gags. i feel sorry for the actors, since the characters in the book were rich and textured, but cut down to embarrassing charactures in the film. mason gamble is great when given the opportunity, as is dylan baker, but the skeleton that remains of the story plays out like a bad after school special. poor people = good, rich people = bad. <br /><br />though it's almost worth watching to see the southern california beach where gary sinise parks his trailer which is meant to pass for a bay in delaware. <br /><br />it's a good book, but an embarrassing turn for first time director mills goodloe. <br /><br />k.
