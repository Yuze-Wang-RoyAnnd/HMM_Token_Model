jack black's character, tim dingman the "dreamer" in envy, finds wealth and success in the idea of a aerosol spray "vapoorize" that when sprayed on doggie dung, makes the poo disappear into thin air. <br /><br />for a moment i was hoping that vapoorize was a real product so that i could spray it on this "stinker" of a movie and make it disappear into thin air as well.<br /><br />although envy is not the worst movie that i have seen in the past 12 months (that honor goes to the cat in the hat), it does get the honor of a close second.<br /><br />not funny, not sad, not anything. a real "stinkeroo"!!!!!<br /><br />a 0.2 out of 10!!
