i can't believe i wasted my time with this movie. i couldn't even call it a movie. it was so bad with nothing to recommend it. <br /><br />i like low budget movies and weird flicks but this one had me bored to death. badly made and bad acting ruined it from being curious. you have to wonder what these people were thinking when they spent money to produce this movie. i wonder what i was thinking watching it to the end. i recommend this movie to no one. how did they release this? was there an audience who likes this kind of movie? there must be because you can find this at almost any video store. but why?<br /><br />deserves to be forgotten.<br /><br />if you like bad movies then this is for you.
