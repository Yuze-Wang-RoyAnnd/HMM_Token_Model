this movie is horrible. everything in it has been done before. there is nothing original. i cannot stand when writers don't come up with their own plots.<br /><br />a girl makes a wish on her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult. hmm, sounds a lot like a movie in the 80s called big. what is even more annoying is jennifer garner's acting. she doesn't act like she is 13 she just acts like she is stupid.<br /><br />from then on, you can guess the whole plot. she gets a good job and it just so happens that a friend she had at 13 works with her. wow, how awesome! but, no....her friend is bad and turns on her, trying to get her job. but, of course, she wins in the end when she comes up with a "great" idea.<br /><br />there's also a dancing scene in the movie that i've seen a thousand times before.<br /><br />i hate this movie.
