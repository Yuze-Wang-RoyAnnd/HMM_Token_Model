i'm not sure if carpenter is looking to raise questions on abortion, and make the really heavy-handed and obvious point that a woman should be allowed an abortion if satan is the father, but it drags on and on. ron perlman is laughable. the baby is really stupid looking, basically a crab with a baby head mounted on it. you can pretty much see the material on the satan costume. what a mess. this episode has about five minutes of story and 55 minutes of tedium. very, very bad. and the ending is just ridiculous. after learning his baby is dead, does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a huge, bloody, gory, uproar? no! he just puts his head down and sulks out of the room. terrible.
