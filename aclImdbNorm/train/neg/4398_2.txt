tim robbins and john cusack are two actors i have appreciated throughout their careers, and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie. well, all i can say is i totally regretted it! these two great actors humiliate themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant, unimaginative and kitch to the extreme (not that this is bad on its own)sketches that are supposed to make people laugh, but fail to do so. the only reason i can think is that the director was their friend, and they decided to support his movie by starring in it-i can't think of anything else because this movie is so cheap! fortunately tim robbins and john cusack haven't disappointed me ever since. i would recommend you to avoid this film, unless you want your opinion about the two actors spoiled.
