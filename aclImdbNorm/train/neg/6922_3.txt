the one sheets and newspaper campaign suggested (as often they did) a far more lurid and violent piece than showed up on the drive-in screens. claude brook is actually an americanization of claudio brook, who worked in films for years. this one's quite hard to find anymore; i'd love to see it again to compare it to other international horrors of the day, but don't remember particularly impressed way back when. chances are it was a chopped up version that made it to u.s. theatres and video. but oh, that one sheet...still a gem of my later horror collection.
