whatever his name is (the writer and director) should be locked away in hopes garbage like this is never made again. this one is in a battle with some of the most awful movies of all time. sometimes movies are bad in a way that they're actually sort of good. not this one. this was so bad i got angry. seriously. a drunken 10 year old could have come up with a better script. what a waste. all the actors were completely uninspired to work at all, the cgi was barely acceptable, the sequences of scenes were completely retarded and hurt the little bit of story there was, it's like he just decided, "i want this to happen and this to happen, but i don't care how we got there, just shoot it and put it in. whatever, i'm going back to my trailer to pick my nose, if anyone calls for me, i'm not here." shame on you whatever your name is. shame on you.
