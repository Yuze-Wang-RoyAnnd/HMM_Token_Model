in over 70 years of watching movies,this has to be one of the very worst comedies ever made. mel brooks, mike meyers & a few other have made some very bad comedies, this however is the absolute bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />it is unfunny from the very opening,to the tacked on scene during the credits.<br /><br />diane keaton who i normally like must have needed her paycheck badly. she desperately needs to re-learn her craft.<br /><br />dax shepard (i do not know who he is),needs a better director,to show him how to act.<br /><br />liv tyler is also not up to her role.<br /><br />mike white needs to find another character,he has done this same type person a few times too many.<br /><br />ken howard who started out years back as a first rate actor, also not as good as he used to be.<br /><br />there is nothing decent i can say on this attempt at movie comedy.<br /><br />ratings: * (out of 4) points 25(out of 100) imdb 1 (out of 10)
