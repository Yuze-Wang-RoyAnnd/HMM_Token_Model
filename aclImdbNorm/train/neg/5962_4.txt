paul naschy made a great number of horror films. in terms of quality, they tend to range from fairly good to unwatchable trash; and unfortunately, horror rises from the tomb is closer to the latter. the plot is just your average story of a witch, wizard or (as is the case here) warlock, who is put to death - but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it...etc etc. we then get a s'eance and one thing leads to another, and pretty soon the executed warlock is up to no good again. the plot is slow, painfully boring and the film constantly feels pointless. the characters string out reams of diatribe and it never serves the film in any way whatsoever. paul naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me he should stick to acting because the dialogue is trite in the extreme, and only serves to make the film even more boring than it already is. carlos aured, who also directed naschy in blue eyes of the broken doll and curse of the devil provides dull direction here, which likes the dialogue does nothing to help the film. sometimes crap films like this have a certain charm about them; but horror rises from the tomb doesn't even have that. this is a painfully boring film that has little or nothing in the way of interest.
