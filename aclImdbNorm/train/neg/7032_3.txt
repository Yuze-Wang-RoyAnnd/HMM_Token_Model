when carol (vanessa hidalgo) starts looking into her brother's death, she begins to suspect something more sinister than "natural causes". the closer she gets to the truth, the more of a threat she becomes to her sister-in-law, fiona (helga line), and the rest of the local satanists. they'll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy ways.<br /><br />if you're into sleazy, satanic-themed movies, black candles has a lot to offer. the movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft-core sex. one scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed. unfortunately, all the sleaze in the world can't save black candles. most of the movie is a total bore. other than the one scene i've already mentioned, the numerous sex scenes aren't shocking and certainly aren't sexy. the acting is spotty at best. even genre favorite helga line gives a disappointing performance. the plot really doesn't matter. its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together. i'm only familiar with one other movie directed by jose ramon larraz. compared with his daughters of darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror, black candles comes off as amateurish. 3/10 is about the best i can do.
