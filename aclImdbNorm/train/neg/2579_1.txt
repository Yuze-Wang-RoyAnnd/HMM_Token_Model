i have to say that i used to be a huge fan of the series. the first 3 were great and the others had their moments, but this new beta house is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. it is a shame since this was a great series and it just keeps getting worse. i know they are made for dvd films but some effort would be nice.<br /><br />there are no laughs, just a couple of good one-liners that will bring a smile if that. there is pretty of nudity and very hot chicks. but neither the sexy stuff nor the jokes really work.<br /><br />to add to all that this is a racist film too or as racist of a film one can make without asking to be called racist. i am not one of those people who think everything should be politically correct. but the portrayal of minorities is very offensive.<br /><br />i wouldn't waste any time on this garbage. see the previous versions, they will make you laugh not sick.
