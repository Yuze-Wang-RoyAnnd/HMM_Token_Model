mona the vagabond lives on the fringes of french society, in a life without meaning, purpose or direction.<br /><br />i watched this because of all the stellar reviews, but i'm afraid i must have missed something. the character of mona has little or no personality while drifting through life being rude to people, getting high and contributing nothing to anyone's life. she's not interesting or exciting. she's just useless.<br /><br />i've seen and known enough people like that: there is no secret meaning to what they're doing. they are just lazy bums. i wouldn't want mona anywhere near me, as she tends to steal anything that isn't nailed down and leave her friends in the lurch. sure she's enigmatic - because there isn't anything to her. lots of junkies, winos and bums i've seen are enigmatic; i wouldn't want to see a film about them either.<br /><br />possibly there is something there that i totally missed. otherwise i'm assuming that all the reviews are from people who assume anything done by a french female director is high art.
