many moons ago when i was seven years old, i can vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie. it appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and i decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie. being the wise adults that they are, they told me "absolutely not! it's a bunch of trash." of course, i was very disappointed that i would not be the first kid on my block to see the "incredible melting man."<br /><br />little time passed - maybe a couple of days. i forgot about "the incredible melting man" and my disappointment faded. twenty-five years passed until it re-entered the forefront of my thoughts. while surfing through channels on digital cable, i found this long-lost relic of a movie. my curiosity was piqued and i decided to finally partake in this fruit forbidden by my parents. i should have listened to them. the "incredible melting man" is perhaps the worst movie known to man. it makes movies such as "def-con 4, "metalstorm", and "freddie got fingered" look like oscar nominees. i feel violated for wasting almost two hours of my life watching this vile filth. the story was incoherent and the effects were crude even for 1977. how anyone convinced a film company to produce this movie beyond me.<br /><br />don't make the same mistake that i did. listen to your parents if they forbade you to watch this movie. they were right.
