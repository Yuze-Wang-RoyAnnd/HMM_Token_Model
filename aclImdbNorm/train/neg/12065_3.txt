back when i was a kid and i lived with my sister, she bought every horror movie she could find and this was one of them. vcr's had just became a household item and we didn't have but about 150 movies and we watched the hell out of all of them.<br /><br />i was at a yard sale the other day and i saw this vhs copy of blood legacy and i buy any horror movie i don't have and i knew this movie looked familiar. i thought for a second and realized it was one that my sister had bought. she had sold it years ago in a yard sale i am guessing - who knows.<br /><br />i didn't recall anything at all about it and i watched it the night i bought it and it refreshed my memory because of a few scenes. i am not sure how i felt about it as a kid but i am sure i enjoyed it because it was new to me and i'd watch and enjoy anything back then.<br /><br />i am a horror freak, but there are certain requirements in order for me to consider it "good" and this one fell very short. it was one of those talk talk talk and bore me to death types. what death scenes you see are done using the shadow on the wall followed by blood splatter and thats if you're lucky you get that much.<br /><br />the story is good and i have seen a few with similar plots, so i think this one should be buried and forgotten. don't watch this people unless you're hard up.
