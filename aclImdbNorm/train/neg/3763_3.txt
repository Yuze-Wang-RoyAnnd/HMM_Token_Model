a group of forest rangers and scientists go into the woods to find fossils.they stumble on a bigfoot burial ground eventually (the didn't notice it in the dark), the scenes of the cgi bigfoot are horrid, but better than the endless scenes of talking that they rarely punctuate. i used to think that there just might be a good bigfoot movie to be made. but now after so many sad sad movies about the legend, i'm having serious doubts. to pour salt in the wound of watching this film, the one good-looking girl just doesn't get naked once. and while this one may be better than "boggy creek 2" (no mean feat there), it's still sad that the best non-documentary film on bigfoot remains "harry and the henriksons" <br /><br />my grade: d
