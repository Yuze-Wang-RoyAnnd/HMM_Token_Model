how hard is it to write a watchable film with vince vaughn, paul giamatti and kevin spacey? apparently very difficult for the writers here.<br /><br />i still have no idea how santa is younger and looks 20 years older than vince (who plays the big brother). i must have missed that part of the story but in reality, it really didn't matter. many scenes seemed out of place and contrived; the kind of "funny notion" scenes that are drug out way too far to where any sense of comedy is lost.<br /><br />the director/producer tried to go "tear jerker" at the end, which would have been suitable if anything leading up that point had been worth following.<br /><br />ugh, major disappointment. i can see how some people might enjoy this ok, since many people will take any garbage they're fed, but i would strongly encourage waiting for dvd on this one. not worth the $23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days.
