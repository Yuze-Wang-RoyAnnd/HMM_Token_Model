i was going to say this was the worst gay-themed film i've ever seen, but i can honestly say this is the worst film if any genre i've ever seen.<br /><br />you know you're in trouble when a movie starts with a "personal note" from the director, asking for the audience's "understanding" for the "many challenges" facing a first-time director. the audio track is so bad in many scenes it's almost impossible to follow the dialogue, and this from a dvd version. bad lighting, bad sets, bad photography, poor script, generally bad acting all add up to make this "film" unwatchable. i did make it through to the bad ending after several attempts, and immediately gave away the dvd i foolishly purchased. i'm sure there are many challenges facing a first-time director. but, don't try to palm off this lame attempt as a finished product. i see from imdb details that this was not only the first directing attempt of richard natale, but also the only. that's the one positive thing i can say about this alleged "movie".
