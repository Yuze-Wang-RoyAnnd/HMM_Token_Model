i had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie. after all, this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind, and it was one of the first epic tales i read as a kid (even before tolkien). i must say that it was a huge disappointment. they completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera. the elements that were faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles. it was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like achilles (who has a strange combination of nearly matrix-like powers, utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem) turn to "fabio on the beach" in the guise of pitt (who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure hollywood has ever produced). the actors were actually decent, trying to make the best of a ridiculous script. it was actually a waste of so much talent (peter o'toole stole the show, and orlando bloom and sean bean were pathetic). compare it to lotr or gladiator and it doesn't even hold a candle to them. plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege. i wouldn't recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was (at least they got that part right).
