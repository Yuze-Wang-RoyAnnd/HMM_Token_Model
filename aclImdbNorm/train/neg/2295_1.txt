pointless boring film with charismatic mercurio completely wasted. released for a minute on a thursday in maybe one local cinema and avoided by the entire population of sydney except me and four others back of beyond is a project seemingly created by a producer looking for a fee. local actors like john polson and terry serio deserve better (well polson has morphed into a director of lame thrillers like swimfan and hide and seek) and terry serio seems never to get a guernsey apart from thug roles. but paul mercurio should have become one of australia's greatest exports on screen. roles like this are major disappointments and films like this are just a waste of talent and time.
