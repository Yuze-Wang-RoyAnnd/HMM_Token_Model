this movie is just crap. even though the directors claim to be part of that oi-culture, it's still a very, very bad directorial debut. the topic itself is very interesting and i accept the bad acting due to the fact, that they are all amateurs and never acted before, but the worst thing about this film are the dialogs and very unexperienced and naive directing. there's no timing at all in that movie. i felt like the directors were so exited to do that movie (it's their first feature), that they actually never really asked themselves, what story they wanna tell. i met ben (one of the directors) on several occasions and he's a nice and thoughtful guy, but that doesn't make him a director. i think, that "american history x" is full of clich'es, but somehow manages to transport a story. "oi!warning" is full of clich'es, doesn't tell anything new or provocative and (-that's the sad thing about this movie) it's far from any oi!-reality.<br /><br />if you wanna see weird but great german films, watch the movies of michael haneke, christoph schlingensief, oskar roehler, hans weingartner or oliver hirschbiegel:<br /><br />benny's video funny games die unber"uhrbare mein letzter film das experiment das weisse rauschen muxm"auschenstill ...<br /><br />*** out of ten, because of the topic and the photography
