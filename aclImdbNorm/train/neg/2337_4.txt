i dunno what the hype around this is... this is really a bad movie...it did nothing to me, the only descent scene is where everyone comes together at the party, and a nice song is playing, uplifting beat and nice cinematic shots that make you move....that was the best part of the movie... otherwise this film lacks everything to suck the viewer in there's no story, there's nothing to think about like some people say, there's no cohesion between the different stories...it was more of an attempt to re-do anderson's 'magnolia' which was brilliant, but it fails blatantly... okay it's light and easy to watch, but that are movieclips too. maybe first write a story before you make a movie... 4/10 one of the worst belgian movies i've seen
