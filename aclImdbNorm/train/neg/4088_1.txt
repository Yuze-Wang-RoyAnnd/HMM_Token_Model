this was a watershed event in my movie watching life. i went to see this in the theater when it came out. i was completely amazed at just how bad it was. movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor - a very, very large favor. the special effects are absolutely first grade level, as in any first grader could have done them. toy rubber bats on strings with no attempt to hide the strings, arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look to be the shape of an arrow you'd find on a street sign, and a laughable story line. ed wood made masterpieces compared to "conquest". every film student should see this thing just so they'll know the very definition of a bad movie.
