i never wanted to see this film, then one day, for a joke i watched it to see how bad it was; my preconceptions were confirmed.<br /><br />for starters i'd like to question the politics of the film. it hides behind of mask of women 'making it big in the city' but the only way that women can make it big is through using their sexuality rather than their intelligence or skills. these women are nothing more the whores. are slightly less attractive girls not allowed to be successful? this is not the only right wing message of the film, there are hundreds of shots of american flags and huge wads of cash. a fine example of how the only powerful thing in america is capitalism and anything of spiritual, moral or artistic value is not even given a look in of this film. money is depicted as the only important thing to young people.<br /><br />the manageress of the bar states that she does not allow drug users in her bar, and then she goes on to poor gallons of hard liquor down her own neck and then the necks of her staff and customers. any one who knows anything about intoxicants will know that liquor can be just as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs.<br /><br />and finally, why are scenes in which the lead character is a point of sexual interest to the audience (when she is getting undressed or with her boyfriend) is her father always involved? we watch get her undressed with the camera virtually caressing her legs while she is one the phone to her father. she 'auctions' her father just as she 'auctions' her boyfriend. i find this most strange.<br /><br />in conclusion, this film is immoral, fascistic, degrading to women and frankly, disturbing. but what else do you expect from jerry bruckhiemer?
