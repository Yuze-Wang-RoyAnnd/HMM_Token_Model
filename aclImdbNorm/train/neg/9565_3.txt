i can't say that wargames: the dead code is the worst movie i've ever seen, as it had one or two decent moments, but i can easily say it's the most transparent movie i've ever seen. not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it 10+ minutes in advance. there was no subtlety to anything the movie did, no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes. every spoken or typed line's intent was so glaringly obvious it was impossible to "get into" the movie.<br /><br />i found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line, and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience, far more often than i found myself enjoying the movie.
