gritty, dusty western from director richard brooks, who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clich'es intact. early 1900s horse race attracts a low-keyed cowboy (gene hackman), a suave gambler (james coburn), a cocky kid (jan michael vincent), and even a female (a surprisingly game candice bergen). once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part), this becomes a fairly engrossing entry, though one which breaks no new ground (it instead resembles something from gary cooper's era). good-looking, if overlong piece has macho verve and a fine cast, yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome rather quickly. ** from ****
