**** spoiler warning ****<br /><br />absolutely without a doubt, one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen. totally impossible to take any of this seriously. it would take a major novel to list all of the comedy routines in it. during the glory days of her program, carol burnett and company, who often did take-offs on films, skewered this one in ways that were hard to imagine. carol played jenny who suddenly became ill with only a slight cough and immediately the treacly music came up and everyone looked around wondering where it was coming from. harvey korman played oliver with flowing locks and almost look liked ryan o'neal. the only thing funnier than this bit, is the real film.<br /><br />what a death scene at the end. jenny really looks like she's dying alright...dying for her make-up artist to come in and give her a little color. and of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to get in bed with them during the patient's final moments. the ending scene with ryan o'neal sitting on a bench in the snow contemplating his future in the movie business is an instant classic. he had plenty to worry about. he never did recover from this.
