demi moore's character in the movie was selected for the seals because of her looks. that was a bad start and the movie went down from there. the plot was totally unbelievable. the will to make it in a tough military unit is not enough. this movie did not convince me of a woman's physical ability to perform the types of tasks required.<br /><br />trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence. the differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting.
