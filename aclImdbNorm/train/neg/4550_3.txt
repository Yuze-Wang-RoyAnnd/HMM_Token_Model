my dear lord,what a movie! let's talk about the "special effects" first. don't get me wrong here, i am not one of those effect fanatics but i was truly thinking that superimposition was a practice of the long gone past, mainly the 60's. so for some time i thought they might have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release it. but as far as i know they did not have cell phones in the 60's...<br /><br />what i am looking for in movies is mainly a good story with a really good message. acting is secondary, effects are secondary, i do not even mind a few little inconsistencies. however, in a movies like this bad acting, incredibility, etc. add up to make a bad movie even worse - that's what happened for me with the celestine prophecy.<br /><br />my wife said the book was actually really good and even though i am not into all that spiritual stuff i can somehow see that it can be brought across in a believable way - the movie failed to do so.<br /><br />there could be one single reason to watch this one though. if you really love cheesy movies it'll be the right one for you. if the imdb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality i must have rated this movie ten stars.<br /><br />by the way, three stars are for the fact that there are worse movies out there, like "critical mass" (look up the comments on that one - hilarious). the celestine prophecy is at least entertaining to a certain degree.
