what an incomprehensible mess of a movie. something about a cop who extracts bullets from himself after he gets shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and from the size of the jar he's been shot about fifty times by now) and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason drive it into mexico. whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear. and you'll never hear another screenplay feature the word "butthorn" either. gary busey tries out the mel gibson role from "lethal weapon" and while busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damns the whole movie to mediocrity. william smith does another turn as a russian soldier, the same character he played in "red dawn" a few years earlier. after playing biker heavies for most of the 70s it was sort of nice to see him expand his range playing communist heavies. sadly he'll probably always be remembered best as the guy who clint eastwood whupped in "every which way you can."
