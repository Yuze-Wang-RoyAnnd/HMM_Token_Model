this is an embarrassment to everyone and everything used in making this joke. i personally don't care one way or another about jessica simpson and her talent or whatever so many people find fascinating about her. just as a movie this is something that wouldn't even get a passing grade in film school. the script is a mess, the acting is atrocious, and the fact luke wilson (co-writer of "bottle rocket") did this makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking. he did "old school" for crying out loud! this doesn't even belong in the same state as my "old school" dvd! please for whatever reason do not watch this! i see there is a comment that this is so bad it's good, but that frankly is too kind. when will we stop seeing singers that obviously can't act keep trying to, i hope ends soon. the worst part is that there are actually some decent actors (penelope ann miller, rachel leigh cook, & luke wilson) who are part of this dump. as far as the plot, well it is almost non-existent and so poorly done and written (yes i know it's another rehash) i very much doubt anyone will remember anything about this. please whatever you do don't waste your time, but if you do, feel sorry for the actual actors involved for wasting their time doing this bomb. jessica simpson you're pretty, but stick to singing, although i'm not much a fan of that either. and whoever did this film, i wouldn't put this on your resume. 1/10 because you can't give a zero.
