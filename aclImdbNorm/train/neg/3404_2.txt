i'm not going to bag this film for all the myriad technical f|u|c|k|u|p|s, it would take two days to outline how the whole thing isn't even remotely possible. others have pointed out all the relevant stupidities already.<br /><br />given all that, i still could have sort of enjoyed it, if only they hadn't included all the maudlin, nauseating, infuriating, disneyesque sentimental crap, which is so out of place anywhere, but nowhere more than out in space, where the tiniest mistake can mean instant death.<br /><br />the "crew", as well as the "real" astronaut were equally guilty of putting all their fatuous nonsense ahead of everything else. it completely ruined any value the production may have had left.<br /><br />i'm surprised nasa let this garbage out so that so many people would get so much misinformation about something so important to them. if you haven't seen this yet, save yourself the irritation. watch apollo 13 again. at least that tried to be sort of real.
