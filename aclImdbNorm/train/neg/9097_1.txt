who actually created this piece of crap this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it is such a waste of time and money. i hate it how they create low budget sequels featuring d-lister actors and a storyline so similar to the 1st one.<br /><br />i found this movie in the bargain bin sitting right next to wild things 2 and death to the supermodels for $2.99 what a fool i was to actually think that this could be good instead i watched in disgust as poor acting stereotypes ripped of the storyline and script from the 1st one.<br /><br />whoever thought that this straight-to-video production was actually even a half decent film you must be on crackd or something because i think what pretty much most of the people who've seen this film thinks what a load of crap!!!!
