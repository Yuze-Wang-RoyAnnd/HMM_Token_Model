i ended up watching the tenants with my close friends who rented the movie solely based on snoop dogg's appearance (a passionate fetish of theirs) on the cover. understandably, i did not expect much. i thought the movie would include the typical array of snoop dogg related behavior and imagery often seen in clich'e rap videos. however, my generalization was for the most part wrong. unfortunately, this didn't make the movie any better.<br /><br />most would describe the movie as a dark serious drama, whereas i would describe it as a dark seriously drawn out boring drama flick. the film tells a story of two struggling writers (dylan mcdermott and snoop dogg) who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces. their polar opposite lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship. this friendship moves throughout the entire movie like a wild roller-coaster - most of which is contributed by snoop's character - reminiscent of someone with a severe case of split personality disorder. and although the movie is a drama, the acting - which has a morbid and serious tone - from snoop and company was more comical than anything else.<br /><br />i wouldn't recommend this movie for those who are attention impaired because this one has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue after that. there are some mediocre conflicts, but even they are mostly bogged down with more dialogue. the end, however, jumped at me with a sudden surprise. it was a little bit twisted, somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to wrap up a movie that needed to end. while watching the ending credits i couldn't help but picture the director thinking, "oh god, how the hell do i end this snoozer." by the way, the director laid out carefully planted hints and subtleties leading to the climax - all of which are more visible than waldo in a crowded street of midgets wearing nothing but black sweaters.
