amateurish in the extreme. camera work especially overwrought - documentary camera operators needn't spin around all the time.<br /><br />the script is truly inane, and the acting is even worse. on top of that, the story is disjointed and meandering - with some gaping holes in logic. at one point the lead wishes to get thrown in jail in order to rub shoulders with suspected al-quada operatives, and thus get an interview with osama. i found the story entirely unbelievable as a result of so many flaws. the "filmmaker"/lead role really portrays a rash, idiot frat boy. the only item of interest really, is that the filmmakers did in fact film on location. it's truly a shame they wasted their opportunity to make something interesting.<br /><br />who financed this crap?
