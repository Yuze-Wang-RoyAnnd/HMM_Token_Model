a friend told me of john fante last summer after we got into a conversation about charles bukowski. i did not know that fante was a favorite writer of bukowski's - an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier. 'ask the dust' was the first fante book i read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. the novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad, frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident, masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of. in the novel the protagonist is a virgin, with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines. the story of his bizarre relationship with camilla, how he settles for his first sexual experience with a 'wounded' admirer, and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real, with no touching hollywood ending. the film adaptation stays true to the book for a while, but meanders into the cinematic trap of love persevering through racism, sickness and death. the heart of this story lies in the fact that bandini is a jerk and camilla is f-ing crazy, and their love never was and never would be the real thing, no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other. this movie tore out the real meaning of the story out and replaced it with schlock. i can't believe the man who wrote chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so wrong.
