wow...<br /><br />i picked this up at the local wal-mart after reading online that it had been released early. i've been following this online for some time, and just had to buy the film.<br /><br />wow...<br /><br />i guess the thing that really struck me was the editing, or lack thereof. time and again, characters (usually the narrator and whoever he is with) are shown walking...and walking...and walking. i am not an editor, but i do know that you can cut between someone leaving point a to show them arriving at point b. there is no need to show almost the entire journey! wow...<br /><br />i actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this. they seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy, depending on what action was to be added at a later date.<br /><br />wow...<br /><br />why it was decided to do almost all the effects using cg is beyond me. even ilm still employs miniatures sometimes. one of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of (according to the end credits) the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities, including london. at times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera. in one shot in london, there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator's brother (played by star anthony piana without his distracting mustache). not since gettysburg have i seen such a fake piece of facial hair.<br /><br />wow...<br /><br />why timothy hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me. it is a turkey, plain and simple. on the plus side (at least for me) it has provided some of the most genuine laugh-out-loud bits of hilarity i have seen in quite a while.
