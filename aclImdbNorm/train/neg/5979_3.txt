pokemon 3 is little more than three or four episodes of the tv series, strung together without the usual commercials. the story is typical of pokemon (conflict, fighting, and a resolution where all are happy in the end), and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation. some of the holes in the plot are filled in (over the closing credits!) without explanation, and everything is just a bit too sweet.<br /><br />why see it on the big screen? the only reason is to be a part of your child's world. both of my sons enjoy pokemon, and by my showing an interest in what they like, we are closer. seeing a film in a theatre is still different than seeing it on the tube, and my sons enjoy the full movie-going experience. i gave the movie a 4, mostly from my children's point of view.<br /><br />
