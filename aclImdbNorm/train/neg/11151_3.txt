darkwolf tells the tale of a young waitress named josie (samaire armstrong) who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend mary (tippi hedren) is killed by a werewolf, you see werewolves actually exist in modern day america & there is even a special organisation within the police force to fight the werewolf threat headed up by detective steve turley (ryan olosio) who has the difficult task of telling josie that she is in fact a pure blooded werewolf herself & that a so-called 'dark prince' werewolf (kane hodder) wants to mate with her & create a new breed of pure blood werewolves that will take over the entire world, or something like that. understandably josie has a hard time believing it, that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes. it's up to werewolf cop steve to save josie, the day & the world...<br /><br />co-executive produced & directed richard friedman i thought darkwolf was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that didn't really do anything for me. the script by geoffrey alan holliday starts out promisingly enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show & then there's a werewolf attack which leaves someone splattered everywhere but after this decent opening sequence it's pretty much down hill all the way i'm afraid. for a start it's slow going, it's dull, it's predictable & it's populated with highly annoying character's who come out with lots of bad dialogue & do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the werewolf they don't, i have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead. the script is dumb & doesn't explain itself, why has josie never turned into a werewolf before? is she really the only one? why can't this 'dark prince' find another female werewolf? there are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about half-way through but you get the idea anyway, as a whole the film plods along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is underwhelming to say the least.<br /><br />director friedman lights the film quite well with bright neon but this is noting new or original & doesn't really improve the film as a spectacle. now let's talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in darkwolf are far from special, the werewolf transformation is achieved using cgi & it's among the worst looking cgi i've ever seen, seriously a playstation would be embarrassed about these computer graphics. it's easily the worst werewolf transformation i've ever seen, an american werewolf in london (1981) was made over 25 years ago yet the special effects in that are literally light-years ahead of the ones seen in darkwolf, who says special effects have improved over the years? the animatronic puppet effects aren't much better either although at least there's something psychical on screen. the gore isn't up to much after a gory opening kill there's some blood splatter & plenty of dead bodies but not much else. thre's a fair amount of female nudity if that's your thing but don't get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it, is it really worth it?<br /><br />technically darkwolf is alright apart from possibly the worst cgi effect ever, it's reasonably well made & it at least seems to have production values. the acting is what you'd expect really.<br /><br />darkwolf is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that litter video shop shelves & clutter the schedules of obscure cable tv stations, i didn't think it was as bad as some but it's like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said & done they're both horrible still...
