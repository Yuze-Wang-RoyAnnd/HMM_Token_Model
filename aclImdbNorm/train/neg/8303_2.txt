since its release in 1983, "a christmas story", the jean shepherd-narrated story of his alter-ego, ralphie, has become a true classic. "my summer story", however, still has shepherd as the narrator, but it has absolutely none of the charm, and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original film.<br /><br />"my summer story" is basically a mishmash of mediocre and just plain not very interesting stories, which include hillbilly neighbors and battling tops. charles grodin, who i normally like, is extremely unlikeable in the role of the father (more aptly handled by darren mcgavin in the original), and his character never seems anything but forced. kiernan culkin is a poor substitute for ralphie, and the little brother is all but forgotten here. only mom seems to have any worth here and perhaps that's because she beans a cinema manager with a gravy boat when he pushes his luck too far with irate housewives on "free dish night".<br /><br />the stories in this are mostly inconsequential and stretched paper-thin. may appeal to the extremely undemanding but as a sequel to "a christmas story", it's a very poor one and not worth most people's time. 2 out of 10.
