the hysterical thing about this movie is that, according to the director, it has difficulty finding a distributor in the u.s. because most of them that viewed it couldn't reconcile the seemingly conflicting messages of christianity and american angst. the thought of anyone seeing this as a religious film in anyway is laughable.<br /><br />because a minister at a mission prays with the homeless or wishes someone "godspeed" this makes it a "christian" movie? one could interpret that it is actually mocking religion for in the "land of plenty" with all of its material excess, the best an organized mission can do is hand out a bowl of soup and a bible verse. plenty of unfortunate or downtrodden maybe? plenty of useless homeless missions? how about plenty of psycho vietnam vets? as a pill-popping delusional survivor of agent "pink" are we to think america is a "land of plenty" of paranoid patriots? maybe we have plenty of psychiatric patients? certainly we don't have plenty of people concerned about palestine politics based on the main characters phone conversation in the film. of course if you worked in a german homeless shelter the unfortunate there would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than their own personal survival as the world knows how europe is the "continent of plenty" when it comes to sophistication.<br /><br />indeed i agreed with the title in the end as the united states is the "land of plenty" and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor scripts, amateur acting and dispassionately directed films. life is too short and one, even an american, doesn't have "plenty" of time to waste watching this piece.
