"well chuck jones is dead, lets soil his characters by adding cheap explosions, an american drawn anime knock off style, and give them superpowers". "but sir?, don't we all ready have several shows in the works that are already like this? much less don't dump all over their original creators dreams". "yes! and those shows make us a bunch of cash, and we need more!". "but won't every man women and child, who grew up with these time less characters, be annoyed?". "hay you're right! set it in the future, make them all descendent's of the original characters, and change all the names slightly...but not too much though, we still need to be able to milk the success of the classics".<br /><br />well that's the only reason i can think of why this even exists. if you look past the horrible desecration of our beloved looney toons, then it looks like an ok show. but then there is already the teen titan's, which is the same bloody thing. all the characters are dressed like batman, they drive around in some sort of ship fighting super villains, they have superpowers, only difference is they sort of talk like the looney tunes and have similar names and character traits.<br /><br />this kind of thing falls into the "it's so ridiculous it's good" kind of category. think of the super mario brother's movie, and batman and robin. if you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons, check this out. if you are of the younger generation (what this thing is actually intended for), and can look pass the greedy executives shamelessness, then run with it and enjoy.<br /><br />if you enjoy this cartoon i don't have a problem with you, it's the people who calculated this thing together that i am mad at. you know how they say piracy is like stealing a car; this show is like grave robbing. they might as well of dug up all the people involved with the original cartoon, shoved them on a display, dressed them up in
