this film is based on the novel by john fante. could someone please tell me why? i see absolutely no reason why this fine book should be adapted in this way. if you want to make a romantic melodramatic hollywood production with colin farell and selma hayek, then how could you possibly make a connection to ask the dust (the novel)? -and if you wanted to make this story into a film, then why would you want to make it into a romantic melodramatic hollywood production with colin farell and selma hayek? i don't get it.<br /><br />the adaptation of the story is poorly made, and if you have read the book and liked it, i'm almost sure you won't like what towne did with it. <br /><br />in the beginning of the film you'll maybe find the casting odd, the acting bad and the cinematography just a bit overdone. but you hope for the best. i really hoped a lot during this film. i actually wanted it to be good. but it only gets worse, and it is as simple as that: whether you read fantes novel or not, this is not a good film. just another romantic melodramatic hollywood production combined with bad acting, lack of structure and - of course - plenty of shots of colin farells naked butt.<br /><br />i could complain a lot more about this film, but why waste my time. i've seen it. alright. i had to see it, because i like the book so much and was curious. and i'm very disappointed.<br /><br />1/10 is for colin's sweet little mustache in the end of the film. so sweet... had he worn it the whole time through, i'd given it 2/10.
