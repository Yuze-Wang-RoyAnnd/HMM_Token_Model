i watch lots of scary movies (or at least they try to be) and this has to be the worst if not 2nd worst movie i have ever had to make myself try to sit through. i never knew the depths of masacism until i rented this piece of moldy cheese covered in a used latex contraceptive. i am a fan of julian sans, but this is worse than i would hope for him.<br /><br />on the other hand the story was promising and i was intrigued...for the first minute and a half while the credits rolled and i had yet to see what pain looked like first hand. perhaps there are some viewers out there that enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction, but then again i know of those viewers who understand if not commemorate me, especially when we had to turn the video off, and that simply is not done with our watching (we had to make one exception obviously). <br /><br />if it were up for a remake, i'd give it a chance so long as they had at most 1% of the original incorporated into it. that's all.
