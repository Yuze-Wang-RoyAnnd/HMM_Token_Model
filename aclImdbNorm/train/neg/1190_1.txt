weak bobby "pineapple salsa" flay and mario batali bring this down.<br /><br />flay being the worst. definitely a one trick pony, i think they could have gotten other american chefs to come to the table on this one as the iron chefs. the kind of dishes this duo come up with really...don't reflect on the creativity of the original iron chef series. i don't think batali even went to chef school, actually. there are a lot of great chefs in america, i just wonder why they don't appear on the food network.<br /><br />it would also help to have more regional ingredients and perhaps co-hosts who can handle the pressure. i like alton brown, but he is a bit too flippant/funny for this role.
