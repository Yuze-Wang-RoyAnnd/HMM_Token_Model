i wanted to watch this movie because of eliza dushku, but she only has a smaller part in it, and her character isn't very likable. however, the main character, played by melissa sagemiller, is extremely beautiful and a perfect delight to look at throughout the movie. this is really nothing but a showcase for her looks and talent. she does a very good job.<br /><br />the story itself is, on the face of it, pretty nonsensical. after a car crash, some friends are possibly dead, but keeps on living their previous lives, while all sorts of mysterious things happen. some bad guys are after them, but we never really find out who they are (possibly they were the ones in the other car, but we certainly don't hear anything about why they are after them). the final scenes especially seem filmically ambitious, but i can't get anything coherent out of it. the opening scene, where the bad guys (who wear some strange masks) cut a blond girl's wrist and gather up some of her blood is never explained or followed up on. unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of the surgeons who're trying to pull cassie (sagemiller) back from the dead... but no, that doesn't seem to work. the bad guys are just bad guys; they really just mess up a story that might otherwise have been interesting. in a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice, who the hell needs bad guys?<br /><br />3 out of 10.
