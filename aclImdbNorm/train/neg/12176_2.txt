the original trancers is not by any means a great movie. it had massive plot holes and very little in the way of internal logic. however, it was entertaining, better done than most low-budget b-movies, and could be surprisingly witty. unfortunately, trancers ii is none of these.<br /><br />trancers ii suffers from many of the same problems of most flop sequels. the plot is thin enough to see through and the writing is insipid. it seems that the people behind this movie felt that bringing the familiar faces of the first movie back would be enough, and didn't bother with anything else. not even veteran b-grade actors like tim thomerson and jeffery combs were able to drag this film out of the muck.<br /><br />a brief plot overview: jack deth (thomerson) is a cop from the future who was sent to 1985 to save the ancestors of members of his government. trancers ii takes place six years after the events of the first trancers. jack deth is married to lena (helen hunt), the woman he met in the first movie, and both live with hap ashby, the man deth was sent into the past to protect. it is discovered that the brother of whistler (the bad guy from the first movie) has traveled back in time to create an army of trancers, people turned into mindless killing zombies, to kill ashby. complicating jack's mission is the fact that his first wife, who had died long before jack traveled to the past, was also sent back to stop whistler's brother, and now jack finds himself working with her.<br /><br />i have two real problems with this movie. one is that the method of creating trancers in this movie is radically different from the methods used in the first movie. what makes it annoying is that, in a rather poor example of soviet revisionism, they act like it was always the technique.<br /><br />the other thing that annoys me is that the love triangle between deth, lena, and alice stilwell (jack's first wife) is given very little screen time. this bothered me particularly because it was much more interesting than the actual plot of the movie. it felt like it was just something that was thrown in to fill space in the movie. alice's character in particular seems very unconcerned with the fact that she is reunited with her husband only to find he's re-married, making her either very shallow or very poorly written.<br /><br />the only reason i can think of for watching this movie is if you're interested in watching the entire trancers series (currently totaling six movies). otherwise, even if you're a fan of the original trancers, stay away from this tepid sequel.
