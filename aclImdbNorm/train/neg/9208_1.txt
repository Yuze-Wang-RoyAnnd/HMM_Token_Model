if you didn't know better, you would believe the christian moral majority in their preachy testimonial of the sins of the young, their questing for satan, and that hell was just brimming with advanced dungeons and dragons fans.<br /><br />none of these items bears one grain of truth, folks. this work does nothing but give the southern baptists a chance to take a breath, while the movie continues to spout their erroneous and alarmist views concerning a creative and original gaming system.<br /><br />tom hanks contributes a stellar performance for this work, but even that wasn't enough to save it. it's crap. it's beneath crap. it is ignorance breeding ignorance and as such, it rates nothing from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
