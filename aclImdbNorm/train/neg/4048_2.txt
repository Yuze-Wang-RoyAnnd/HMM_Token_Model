possibly not, but it is awful. even the fantastic cast cant save it. ok, i admit it started off quite funny but it seemed to plummet downhill as soon as they jumped those girls in the generals house. bill murray turned from being a quick witted, humorous guy into an arsehole who was shouting things at people in the street that just weren't funny, its like he was trying too hard to be funny. his character stole a weapon (an rv? come on...) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers, for a laugh. one good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the us army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are, albeit unintentionally. i actually felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda crap could really be released.
