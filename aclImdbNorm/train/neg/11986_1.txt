what horrible writing and acting. no personality. what, you can't make a good movie with a single character? hmm, it was done in castaway with self dialog.<br /><br />so this kid goes on a trip to see his father. the kid, jason, takes a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies mid-flight. so the kid crashes in a lake and survives. then he runs around, surviving in the wilderness until he gets rescued.<br /><br />during that time he fights a bear twice. the first time he fights it off in the lake. the second time he makes a spear out of a branch and spears the bear. two shots of fake blood spurting out of the bear's chest reminded me of monty python's "the holy grail".<br /><br />also the kid decides to kick a porcupine with predictable results.<br /><br />gag.
