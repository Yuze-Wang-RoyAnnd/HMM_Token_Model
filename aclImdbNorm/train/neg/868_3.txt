instead, go to the zoo, buy some peanuts and feed 'em to the monkeys. monkeys are funny. people with amnesia who don't say much, just sit there with vacant eyes are not all that funny.<br /><br />black comedy? there isn't a black person in it, and there isn't one funny thing in it either.<br /><br />walmart buys these things up somehow and puts them on their dollar rack. it's labeled unrated. i think they took out the topless scene. they may have taken out other stuff too, who knows? all we know is that whatever they took out, isn't there any more.<br /><br />the acting seemed ok to me. there's a lot of unfathomables tho. it's supposed to be a city? it's supposed to be a big lake? if it's so hot in the church people are fanning themselves, why are they all wearing coats?
