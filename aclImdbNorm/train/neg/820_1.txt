what did producer/director stanley kramer see in adam kennedy's novel and kennedy's very puzzling screenplay? were there a few pieces left out on purpose? and what about gene hackman, richard widmark, edward albert, eli wallach and mickey rooney? what did they see in this very muddled story?<br /><br />and why did candice bergen, who gave a horrible performance, accept such a thankless role?<br /><br />the domino principle wants to be on the same footing as the parallax view or the manchurian candidate and misses the mark by a very wide margin. a major misfire by stanley kramer.
