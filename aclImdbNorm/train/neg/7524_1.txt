a handful of critics have awarded this film with positive comments. i don't wish to argue with their opinion, but i strongly disagree. when i first watched this film i was mildly impressed. but after comparing it with other films, particularly with the late master, bruce lee i quickly changed my mind. in fact, if it wasn't for the title of the film, i would never have bought it. game of death 2 doesn't relate to the original game of death, (except it shares one character, billy lo.)<br /><br />i was stunned to see how similar game of death 2 was compared to enter the dragon. the plots have striking similarities: both bruce lee and bobby lo are on a mission to avenge a relative. the two locations are similar, in which they both are very isolated and are surrounded by thousands of blackbelts. there is an element of prostitution in both films (women are sent two the guests rooms in both films.) both han (enter the dragon) and lewis's henchman have a hand missing. their is an underground drug operation in enter the dragon, believe it or not, there is one in game of death 2. han has a pet cat in enter the dragon, the director has used his imagination and awarded lewis with a pet monkey! the list continues. <br /><br />regarding other aspects of the film, such as the script and the acting, i felt it was very poor. it seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists to star in the film and prayed they could act. <br /><br />on a positive scale, i cannot deny that the choreography is impressive. although the fighting sequences have strong elements of acrobatics in them, they are none the less skillfully performed. however, as the plot is insufficient, i couldn't relate to the characters, therefore the fighting sequences were more exhibitions rather than having a meaning to the film. <br /><br />in conclusion i would say this film is recommendable to any martial-arts fans, but for those who enjoy a solid action film, with a good storyline and strong characters, i seriously wouldn't recommend this film. my opinions towards this film may seem very bias and one-sided, but when bruce lee set a new standard in the martial arts cinema, particularly after his masterpiece: enter the dragon, this film failed to rise to these standards. if anything they imitated a truly brilliant martial-arts film, in hope of achieving the same level of fame. <br /><br />in reference to my evaluation, awarding this film a very harsh 1 out of 10, the film is barley watchable, and must be thankful that it had the fighting sequences it did.
