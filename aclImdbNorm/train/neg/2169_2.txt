i usually enjoy loretta young's early movies: her acting back then was light and breezy, and she sure knew how to wear clothes. but this one is just a loser from the word go except for a funny supporting turn by glenda farrell. young is a hatcheck girl who talks her writer-husband (paul lukas) into becoming a championship bridge player. it's not the most cinematic of games, and the long, talky middle part in which their marriage falls apart just about kills the film.<br /><br />there's one interesting bit though. as lukas and ferdinand gottschalk start their climactic game, a series of quick shots show airplanes, trains, football games, even a diver in mid-air, freezing in anticipation of the event. it's the earliest use of a freeze frame i've seen in an american film. wish the rest of it were that inventive-and funny.
