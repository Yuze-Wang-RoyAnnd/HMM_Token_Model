i thought i read somewhere that this was the last monogram production, but whether that's true or not it doesn't matter, because if it wasn't, then it should have been. it's a deadly dull affair starring john carradine with some gray in his hair to make himself appear like an older scientist who is experimenting with the aid of his young apprentice (robert shayne) in bringing the dead back to life. every time their subjects are revived, they seem to have a whitish face like marble as they are lying strapped to the laboratory table (big deal). carradine manages to restore his faithful dog to life after it's dead, and the mutt gains an unusual ability to walk through walls in a ghostlike fashion (wooooooooohhhh). that's about all she wrote.<br /><br />for an ultra-cheap monogram quickie, this thing at least actually utilizes a more fancy-schmancy lab setup than is usually allotted. the funniest running joke in the movie is that the "older" doctor carradine constantly refers to his "young" assistant shayne as "m'boy" when, in fact, carradine was actually 40 and shayne was 45 when they made this!
