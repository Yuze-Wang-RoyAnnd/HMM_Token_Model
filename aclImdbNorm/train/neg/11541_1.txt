this movie is the worst i've seen in the last 5 years. it is surprising how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie has accepted to act in such worthless peace of trash. the film is rape/beating and revenge genre. couple has gone to party and on the way back they hit a deer and he went out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys comes. he didn't go to their car, instead he has been kicked and well beaten while she tries to run the car engine which betray her and she has been gang raped.then somehow she is in her fathers house and one of bad guys is her neighbor so she took shotgun and wanted to kill him... so stupid scenario! bellow hollywood ! he was against that revenge but "she is raped" "they laugh to her" so she must kill them all... but once inside the house she was satisfied by pushing rifle's top in bad guys anus and went away while he has gone crazy and execute bad guy. personally i think that director run out of money before finishing this because movie ends before they execute anyone else involved in this gang-rape and beating which is not big surprise because sponsor obviously has seen this and wanted to take back his money. lol this movie is not even for people who enjoy watching rape because they won't see anything they are looking for... this director should be banned...it is for upsetting that this peace of trash has been made by british cinematography which i personally like and that is the reason i've watched this. don't do it yourself you have better things to do that watching stupid scenario film ...
