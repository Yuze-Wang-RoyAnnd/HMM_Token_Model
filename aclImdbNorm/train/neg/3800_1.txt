naming the absolutely most pathetic piece of crap in cinematic history is not an easy task, candidates being so abundant, but nemesis 2 has been my personal favorite ever since i saw it. it was so funny we had to rent it again the next day, and again i laughed so hard i was literally rolling on the floor. (this usually only happens when i see monty python's "scott of the antarctic".)<br /><br />throughout the whole movie, an overwhelming what-the-heck-feeling firmly grasps the viewer. i'm utterly confounded that this clumsy home video ever made it to production stage. it's supposed to be a sequel, yet has no apparent connection whatsoever with the first film. the hero has the same name, but this time "alex" is female, although it took us half way into the movie to stop guessing, what with all the muscles and the barbarian-nomad outfit!<br /><br />there is really no plot at all, it's merely a prolonged chase scene, only it's so slow-paced and senseless that calling it a chase scene makes it sound way more interesting than it really is. there is almost no dialogue, which is just as well considering the quality of it, and then the film suddenly just comes to an abrupt end after a blatant action scene with lots of gasoline explosions, without ever really explaining what it was all about. luckily, it never gets boring, because there's something silly and phony going on at all times!<br /><br />terrible movies are usually just tedious, but nemesis 2 is such a perfect mixture of over-seriousness and utter nonintentional wackiness that it's truly entertaining. rent this film, or buy it even, you won't be disappointed!
