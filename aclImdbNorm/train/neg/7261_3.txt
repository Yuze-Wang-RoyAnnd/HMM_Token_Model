this british-spanish co-production is one of the countless films shot in spain in the wake of the unexpected phenomenal success enjoyed by the italian "spaghetti" westerns and, as is typical of such genre efforts, features an eclectic assortment of established and emerging international stars: robert shaw, telly savalas, stella stevens, martin landau, fernando rey, michael craig, al lettieri, dudley sutton, antonio mayans, etc. ironically, however, this incoherent mess of a movie serves as a shining example as to why that most american of film genres became a dying breed in the 1970s and is nowadays practically (or is that officially?) extinct.<br /><br />i really wanted to like this film, not only because the western is one of my favorite types of movies but also because it had all the qualities, including an intriguing premise, to be a good one - not to mention the fact that my father had purchased a paperback edition of a town called bastard's novelization following its original release! as it is, the film's sole virtue (if, indeed, it can even be called that) is its sheer eccentricity: for instance, stevens, playing a widow out for revenge on the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband, sleeps inside a coffin(!) driven around in a carriage by her dumb manservant(?) sutton; savalas, as a blood-thirsty renegade, who at first appears to be the film's main villain, is unceremoniously dispatched by his own henchman lettieri very early on in the picture; the villain of the piece, then, turns out to be landau who, in the film's very first scene, is seen pillaging side-by-side our legendary hero-turned-priest shaw!; fernando rey, playing a blind peasant, is the only one who can identify rebel shaw who, in the end turns out to have been merely a front for...well, nevermind! as you can see, the plot is very confusing and it gets stranger from there! the production team responsible for this film were also behind other western fare around the same period of time, like custer of the west (1967), bad man's river (1971), captain apache (1971) and pancho villa (1972).
