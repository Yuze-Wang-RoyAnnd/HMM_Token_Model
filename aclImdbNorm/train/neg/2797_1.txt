i am a major fan of the horror genre! i love horror/slasher/gore flicks of all kinds. some of my favorites are the really "good" bad horror flicks. but this movies has nothing to warrant it's viewing!! i'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about everything that's wrong with it.<br /><br />the script is horrid. the acting is horrid. the fx are not even worth discussing. the "set" is an absolute joke!! the sad thing is i think there may be some real potential in a couple of the actors, but this vehicle left them nothing to work with!!!<br /><br />suffice it to say i saw it for "free" & feel i was robbed!! the time you'd waste watching this would be better spent flossing your cat.
