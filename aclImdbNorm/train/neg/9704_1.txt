okay, if you have a couple hours to waste, or if you just really hate your life, i would say watch this movie. if anything it's good for a few laughs. not only do you have obese, topless natives, but also special effects so bad they are probably outlawed in most states. seriuosly, the rating of 'pg' is pretty humorous too, once you see the native porn extravaganza. i wouldn't give this movie to my retarded nephew. you couldn't even show this to iraqi prisoners without violating the geneva convention. the plot is sketchy, and clich'e, and dumb, and stupid. the acting is horrible, and the ending is so painful to watch i actually began pouring salt into my eye just to take my mind off of the idiocy filling my tv screen.
