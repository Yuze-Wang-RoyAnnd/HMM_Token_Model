the fifth "black emanuelle" i've watched has, potentially, the most intriguing plot line dealing as it does with the intrepid female reporter investigating the white slavery/prostitution racket which takes her from san francisco to rome to macao and back to her own hometown, new york! the film is peopled with past veterans of the series which, inexplicably, play completely different roles, namely ivan rassimov (appearing here as a head of a united nations committee for third world countries!), karin shubert (as a feminist rival reporter) and don powell (as rassimov's chauffeur).<br /><br />unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (despite their being shown in the dead of night), it is heavily edited and a particularly graphic scene (described in "stracultr) in which an asian slave trader gets his comeuppance by being sodomized by a dog is nowhere to be seen here!! still, a harrowing sequence late in the film when a sleazy politician tricks a couple of girls (including, naturally, gemser and shubert) into a midnight rendezvous under a new york bridge with a group of bums (this is the way he gets their votes, get it!) - with his high society pals giddily looking on - seems pretty much intact.<br /><br />the most ridiculous element of this entry - apart from gemser's penchant to disrobe completely every time she enters a house (even in front of perfect strangers) - is her excursion to india to interview a charlatan/guru (george eastman made up to look considerably christ-like!) who has found a way to prolong coitus indefinitely; of course, when emanuelle calls him up on it, he ends up having premature ejaculation...!!
