this film was terrible. ok, my favourite film is 'the wicker man' (1973), so i was always bound to be a little biased. <br /><br />the plot rambles along, throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' highly dubious. (he's not a virgin, but is allergic to bees. wow!) so many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained, which i'm afraid mr labute does not a horror movie make. (how are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film?) cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout, and his character is prone to calling out "rowan!?" at the slightest noise. the 'nods' to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage. for example, certain incidents mirror the original (the girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when woodward/cage is searching the island) and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from anthony schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in.<br /><br />i'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this, i really can't be bothered to write any more about this film. it lacks any kind of substance. throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the films they were 'based' on (in this case very loosely).
