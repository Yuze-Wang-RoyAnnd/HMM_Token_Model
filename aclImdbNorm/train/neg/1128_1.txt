this movie was one of the worst i've ever seen. pure drivel. how anyone could develop a connection with the heroine, or have empathy for her, is beyond me. i felt i was watching a case history of a schizoid individual with borderline personality disorder. just terrible.<br /><br />in its most generous light, this can be seen as an attempt at producing and "art" film - except i could not, for the life of me, find any art in it at all.<br /><br />if this woman had lived in todays' world, she would have been whisked off to a mental institution and given a couple of days treatment with anti-psychotic medications. that, or simply allowed to roam the streets and become a bag woman. why other characters in this movie found anything redeeming in her - and tried to aid her in her quest to become an actress - speaks more to their pathology than any convincing characteristics she had that made her worth that effort.
