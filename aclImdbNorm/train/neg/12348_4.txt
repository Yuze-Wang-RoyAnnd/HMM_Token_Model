this movie is very much like "flashdance", you know that dance flick with jennifer beals. that film is probably the most boring film i have ever seen since it's not even bad enough to be funny. "g.i. jane" is much better than that film, but that doesn't say much. here demi moore sweats a lot and there's high music and we get to see her fight and everything, but it is certainly not very engaging. i really think the idea behind the film is kind of interesting, but the script is too clich'ed and ridley scott can't do anything about that. well, like i said... it's better than "flashdance"... (4/10)
