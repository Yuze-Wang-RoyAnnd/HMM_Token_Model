this rubbish excuse for television is the single most god-awful piece of trash ever to hit australian television. the house-mates are dull, uninteresting, ridiculously unintelligent and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them. as far as i am concerned big brother is the decline of western society, showing how us as a society are on a steep slope to becoming brain-dead morons. whatever happened to television that didn't target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience? this cannot be classified as entertainment. i think that it true that channel ten can remove your soul. it happened to rove mcmanus who was once a respectable comedian and, once moving to channel 10, become horribly unfunny. with the exception of the simpsons which is highly intelligently made.
