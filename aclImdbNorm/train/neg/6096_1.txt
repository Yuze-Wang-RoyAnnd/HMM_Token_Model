sometimes a film comes along that is unique. the nostril picker is one such film, the nostril picker is like no other film i have ever seen, unfortunately for the nostril picker & myself it's unique for different reasons than what the filmmakers had originally intended. read on & all shall hopefully become clear... the nostril picker, as it's commonly know although it was apparently filmed under the title the changer, starts with some extremely dull shots of an american town somewhere, streets & factory's that sort of thing, as the opening credits play. when the nostril picker begins proper we, the viewer that is, are introduced to a real loser named joe bukowski (carl zschering) who is in his 40's, he lives on his own in a crappy little apartment where he watches t.v., eats beef flavoured dog food & listens to old vinyl records as he dances with a blow up rubber sex doll. joe likes teenage girls, he has various porn magazines but enjoys the real thing even more. however, being an ugly git joe can't tempt any young ladies to go out with him, or do anything else with him for that matter. one fateful day an old homeless vietnam vet (horace grimm) sees the agony & pain that joe has to go through (actually he sees joe being spoken to by the cops for hassling a teenage girl) & decides to help him out. he tells joe about an incantation that he learned from the 'gooks' in vietnam that will transform joe's appearance into whatever he likes. a process he calls morphosynthesis, but at the same time he warns joe that 'it makes you crazy if you do it too much'. that night joe decides to give it a try, in a public place on a podium for some reason. joe says a few words, does an extremely silly dance & starts yodelling. joe finishes off by whistling london bridge is falling down, listen yeah, i ain't making this up either. at first joe is visibly disappointed when nothing significant happens. to console himself joe tries to buy a porn mag but is shocked when the clerk (kevin devoy) refuses to sell it to an underage girl. joe, the bright spark that he is, realises what has happened & talks his/her way out of it by claiming his/her dad had sent him/her to buy it. joe, who now calls his alter-ego josephine (ann flood), senses the possibilities & heads straight for the local high school. joe befriends four teenage girls, jennifer armstrong (laura cummings), crisi stroud (gail didia), tracy harper (heidi m. gregg) & brenda kearn (aimee molinaro) while under his disguise, oh & joe manages to become a pupil at the school simply by asking the sports teacher miss van dyke (vicki hollis). at first joe seems harmless enough, he just likes to hang around the girls toilets & stuff like that. but things soon change as joe brutally murders brenda. jennifer's dad, vince armstrong (edward tanner) is a detective so along with his partner ed simpson (clyde surrell) & walt spencer (bruce alden) the pathologist is determined to catch the sicko responsible for killing his daughter's friends, but will they succeed before joe strikes again? the imdb listing for the nostril picker is wrong, i watched it mere hours ago & it clearly states that it's directed by mark nowicki who was also a co-producer & definitely not patrick j. matthews who was credited as a co-producer & the cinematographer, not that it makes much difference & i'd have though that nowicki would have been more than happy for matthews to take the 'credit' for making this piece of crap. no one involved in the making of the nostril picker should be allowed to go anywhere near a camera again, ever. the nostril picker is easily one of the worst films i've ever seen, & that's saying something. it's absolutely terrible in every possible way imaginable. the script by steven hodge is atrocious, there's no narrative structure, excitement, tension, drama, character development & the things that do happen are so mind numbingly dumb it's untrue. the plot devices & chain of events in the nostril picker are totally incomprehensible. the scene where joe finds out the prostitute (steven andrews) he hired is in fact a man & joe starts to chase him around his apartment with two squirting dildo's is simply jaw dropping stuff. the subsequent scene when the transvestite reports the incident to the police is hilariously written & had me psychically laughing at the dialogue. i hated the ending as well, not only was it predictable but it leaves the door open for a sequel, i psychically shudder at the mere thought! on a technical level the nostril picker is awful, point & hope photography, bland & inappropriate music, forgettable locations, poorly edited (brenda is killed in the kitchen yet her blood splashes on the t.v. screen that was clearly in the opposite room), some of the worst acting i've sat through & very unimpressive special effects which consist of a few cut off rubber fingers, a slit throat & a quick scene where joe eats some flesh. it comes as no surprise that the cast & crew who worked on the nostril picker have virtually no imdb credits for anything before or after. even at 76 odd minutes the nostril picker is far to long & really boring to sit through. i could go on & on all day long about how bad the nostril picker is, i really could. one thing i can't quite work out is was all this intentional by the filmmakers? the nostril picker is indeed a unique film, unique in it's awfulness & incompetence. in the the case of the nostril picker i hope it remains unique too, having said that it's still not the worst film i've ever seen but it comes close that's for sure. definitely one to avoid.
