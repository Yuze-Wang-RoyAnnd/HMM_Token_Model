bottom of the barrel, unimaginative, and practically unwatchable remake of the road warrior. this film follows the exact plot as the filipino film stryker and is worse by far! bad acting, dialog, effects, dubbing, pacing, action sequences... the list goes on and on. italy made literally dozens of road warrior rip-offs in the early 80's, some good, some bad. this is the worst by far, no contest. not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable, the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half. there was 1 (one) good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie, and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding. but everything else about this movie seriously reeks! for actual post-nuke fun, go track down a copy of endgame, after the fall of new york, or escape from the bronx instead. they're much more enjoyable than this rubbish.
