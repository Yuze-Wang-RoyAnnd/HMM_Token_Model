well, finally got to see the remake last night in london, unintentionally hilarious, sexless and devoid of any real humour. i don't really know where to start, whilst i was entertained by this strange homage, it didn't really move me. the acting is screamingly hammy, there is no original music, the costumes are far too 'disney' there is a ridiculous 'six months later' insert after the burning of nic cage (which didn't come soon enough for my liking) the bit with cage in the bear suit had the audience suppressing mirth as did the comedy punching out of various 'baddies' on the island. it's such a weird remake that i cant quite believe i saw it, it reminded me of something that the comic strip presents would have done in the eighties, a bit like their hollywood interpretation of the miner's strike, very strange!
