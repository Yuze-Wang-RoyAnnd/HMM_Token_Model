"triumph of love" is proof that not every com'edie-francaise author who uses cross-dressing disguised courtship like shakespeare is worth seeing. <br /><br />or maybe something was lost in the translation of this adaptation of marivaux, a commedia dell arte-inspired playwright of whom brittannica says: "his nuanced feeling and clever wordplay became known as marivaudage." <br /><br />while mira sorvino has fun dangling three mixed-up romances, her pants role wasn't even up to cherubino in "marriage of figaro."<br /><br />the herky-jerky editing is annoying and just seems to indicate that a lot of takes were needed for each long speech.<br /><br />best was fiona shaw as the fooled spinster, as well as the costumes.<br /><br />the glimpses of audience we see and the closing curtain call to wink that this is all artifice doesn't really help.<br /><br />(originally written 5/29/2002)
