i doubt this will ever even be a cult film. i loved gram parsons to be sure and i did not expect much out of this film and got even less. what could have been clever and moving was campy. it was devoid of the music that made gram and had more filler than cheap dog food. there was no background on gram or the colorful people of that era. the characters shown were not familiar to me even as a fan of gram's and all the versions of his "afterlife adventures" i have heard. rock and roll is full of tales, good ones too but they should taken with a grain of salt. they can be great stories even though exaggerated. however, this movie took a good story and turned into tripe. stealing any dead body and the ensuing implications should never be a dull tale but they made it dull, somehow. i am tempted to steal every copy of grand theft parsons, head out to the desert and burn them all.
