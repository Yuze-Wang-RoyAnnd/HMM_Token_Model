this movie masquerades as a social commentary, when in fact it is every bit as ridiculous as the very racism it condemns. the premise of this movie: african-american = strong... any other race = weak. the worst part is when rapaport pulls a gun on omar epps and a jewish guy. the jewish guy, in stereotypical fashion, crumbles in fear and starts pleading for his life... but the big, strong, defiant omar epps stands strong with no fear. we also have the condemnation of every fraternity member as being a arrogant preppie drunk or rapist. the raped white girl, of course, begins considering lesbianism since she's just a weak white girl after all. when the nerdy white guy is rejected by the fraternity members he of course must fall in with the skinheads, who are incredible cowards; especially the big muscular guy who is beaten down quickly by the strong black men. wait... busta rhymes beat up a guy twice his size??? yeah, right.<br /><br />of course the black men never reject their own people and omar epps moves in with them easily. the scenes where ice cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are just stupid -- of course he is the dominating one while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually move out. this movie was just terrible and the ending made me actually laugh out loud. the overly long slow-motion between epps and banks gets hilarious with the faces they make -- it's like watching my nephew and cousins making faces at each other (and they're all under 5). do yourself a favor and skip this crapfest.
