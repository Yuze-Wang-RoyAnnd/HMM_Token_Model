hollywood now has officially gone too far and i really hope that this travesty of a motion picture creates a genuine backlash against their crap machines, in spite of the good box office returns. if you are an industry person reading our comments looking for hints on what to do next, stop. stop making our tv shows into these repellent, stupid, money grubbing waste of time movies that suck. by doing so you are proving one thing: hollywood is out of ideas, and going to see the movies they churn out only perpetuates the cycle of disgust. what's next -- you guys gonna go & ruin the bionic man??<br /><br />the film is just plain wrong, and manages to get the most stupid, simple fact of the show totally incorrect by forgetting (or ignoring) that tom wopat & john schneider's bo & luke duke were *reformed* moonshiners. they had been busted, learned their lesson, gone straight, and were there to help people and be good neighbors who just happened to shoot dynamite tipped arrows from hunting bows & drive like steve mcqueen. denver pyle's uncle jessie was also the moral center of the family, always insisting that the boys do good, even at their own expense or embarrassment while he made sandwiches and coffee for when the chores were done. they always did the right thing and had a sort of earnest naivet'e about them that was quite appealing. we wanted to be more like them than we were, sorta. my favorite gimmick from the show was how they always buckled their seat belts before roaring off, which was apparently too moral for this film.<br /><br />by transforming the duke family into a pack of leering, wisecracking, criminally minded, redneck baiting, misogynistic losers the movie has no moral standpoint, where the show was all about how honest or incorruptible the dukes were -- are the duke boys in this movie supposed to come off as good guys? i wanted to punch them both in the nose. they seem to have a lot of free time on their hands that could be spent doing chores back at the farm and end up pursuing less than noble ends, if not acting like a pair of 14 year old boys who haven't grown up. there should be no marijuana use, no gawking at buxom, nubile coeds & their breasts, no shenanigans involving the brothers in da hood. all of it looks like the work of a marketing consultant who took a poll at the mall of what 14 year old boys like to see in movies. the problem being that 14 year old boys cannot possibly remember the show, imho shouldn't be seeing this movie either, and the parents who might feel nostalgia for the show will be disgusted by what the writers, director & producers did to our collective memories just to part us from our money, which is exactly how i feel. what were they thinking???<br /><br />and boy did they *ever* get daisy wrong. jessica simpson all dolled up like a pamela anderson mall slut may be the only reason for anyone to see this disgrace, but you can service your needs just fine downloading some promotional stills of her, printing them up & pinning them to the wall in a restroom. she is hardly in the film at all (which is the movie's only saving grace), and the ten minutes or so they used her was still excessive. catherine bach's daisy may have had the same kind of shorts, and long legs that make people feel funny just looking at her, but the daisy she played was a *person*. the pratfalls she elicited by simply being who she was had an almost natural ring to it. she remains one of the most outrageously sexy pop culture icons ever created but there was somebody at home. and most importantly she was a sweet, caring person who couldn't help it if the guys went ga ga over her.<br /><br />by contrast, jessica simpson appears phony, contrived, made up, costumed, posed, aloof, bored, out of place, and i don't think she even looks that great in the outfit. she doesn't look like a person but a plot device, conjured up during a deal with someone representing her agent. ms. simpson would be well advised to fire that person immediately and pretend like the whole thing never even happened. whatever the joke was, she isn't in on it and is disgracefully exploited for t&a. if that's all she wants from her career, executive produce the sequel if only to ensure yourself enough screen time at least, because this effort was just pathetic.<br /><br />the bottom line is skip it. for the cost of two tickets and a slurpee to go you can pick up one of warner bros. excellent box set collections of the original shows on dvd and the entire family can watch them together. that was why it worked. the only real purpose i can see in the film might be it's future use as an interrogation tool at guantanamo bay. twenty minutes of this & they'll be singing a choir.<br /><br />1/10, and i mean it. and stay the hell away from the bionic man, you schnooks.
