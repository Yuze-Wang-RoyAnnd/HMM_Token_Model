my wife and i like to rent really stupid horror/sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. we saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. now, when i say this movie is awful, i mean it in a good way. everything about it, the acting, camera-work, story, costumes, is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good. i think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place. i really hope that whoever made this film wasn't serious when they made it because if they were, then that would just be sad. if you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then i recommend this one.
