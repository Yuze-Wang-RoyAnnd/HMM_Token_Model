the turgid pace of this movie numbs us to any shocks that it might provide. there was no real suspense. most of the characters were insipid. the chesty irish priest was as lame as the love interest. interest is misleading. the girl that they chose to provide the film's sensuality might be better. the central conflict of the main character was uninvolving. this film is entirely devoid of positives. it is like a tedious exercise by someone who didn't want to go to the gym that day but did anyway.
