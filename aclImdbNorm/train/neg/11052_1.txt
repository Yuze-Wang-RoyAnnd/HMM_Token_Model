the deadly wake is the perfect movie for film students... to learn how not to make a film!<br /><br />let's see... what did the crew mess up in this flick? worst music mix worst editing worst script worst all-time directing worst acting worst choreography worst cinematography worst props worst sets worst lighting etc. let's face it, if this "film" had been in ultra-high contrast black-and-white, and silent... it still would have been awful. all scenes are dark (lighting people call it "black"), often, the music score drowned out the meandering dialogs, which was ok because nobody ever spoke two whole sentences without long pauses for effect. the "evil" robot was hilarious... what was that? jazz dancing? oh... i guess it was supposed to be walking tactically or something. i'm sure it struck fear into the hearts... of the poor editors. and, how do you edit so much footage of garbage? not possible. garbage is garbage, no matter how you splice it. how did anyone ever get this thru the dailys???<br /><br />bottom line is- i couldn't stand to watch more than 15-minute segments, it was so bad... but i did see the whole thing (with lotsa breaks) just to see if it had any good parts in it at all. nope! none!<br /><br />a perfect example of how not to make a flick... a must see for every serious film student!!!
