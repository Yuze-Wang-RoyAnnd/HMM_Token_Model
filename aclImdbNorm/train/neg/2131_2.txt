i wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist (as this film was touted) but this one failed me miserably. for me, the plot was a bit confusing to follow and i rapidly lost interest. i feel so sorry for john cusack, joan cusack, ben kingsley, marisa tomei and hillary duff for getting involved with this movie. i'll remain a fan of all of them but only time can heal my feeling over this one. the one thing i can say positively about the film is that hillary played yonica's character so well that i didn't even recognize hillary; it took me a few scenes to realize that it was her. luckily i rented it for $1 through red box; had i paid to see it in on the big screen, i would be really fuming!!
