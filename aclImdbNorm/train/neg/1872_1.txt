be warned. this movie is such a mess. it's a catastrophe. don't waste your time with this one. i warned you!<br /><br />the acting, story, dialogue, music... basically everything is so over the top, it's absolutely annoying and ridiculous. it made me want to throw up (if the dialogue/acting/story wasn't doing it, it's everyone being shot crooked). you'll feel like you're watching a comedy. the problem is, the parts that are supposedly funny isn't even funny. the acting, story, cinematography, you can feel everything is just trying waaaay too hard -- but it never succeeds. practically every shot is canted, but so what?! this movie just feels like a student film. no wonder they shot this in hd because it would be a waste to spend more money to shoot this on film.<br /><br />if you're easily amused or like poor acting, writing, editing, directing, full of clich'es, everything that's forced in your face, oh and did i mention poor acting? (well, actually, it's not all the actor's fault - it's the director!) then i guess you'll like this movie.<br /><br />i had to watch this for a class. i would have turned it off right away if i could. if you still can't tell by now, i hated this movie. it made me want to throw up and get my time back... at least i didn't have to pay for this garbage.<br /><br />jeff goldblum, you know... the guy from jurassic park/independence day, is in this movie but he sure went downhill from then -- accepting roles for movies like this catastrophe.
