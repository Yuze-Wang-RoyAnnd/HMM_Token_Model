i liked it, i really did. please don't think that i'm an idiot but i have to admit that i enjoyed this film. i expected it to be crap, it was crap, but sometimes its ok to relax and watch a crappy film that you don't have to concentrate too much on isn't it? i didn't expect any hidden meanings or morales, and there wasn't any, but that doesn't matter because i only watched it for entertainment, and it did entertain me throughout. films like this are why the ben stillers (excusing 'there's something about mary') and the vince vaughns (however you spell his last name, i couldn't be bothered checking)have jobs. it's ok to watch a crap film as long as you don't expect too much from it, and i for one shall take a stand, jog, perhaps run, but not drive because i don't have a car, to blockbuster video, or even choices, and rent a bunch of these toilet humoured films and stay in one night watching them. good day to you reader. p.s if you do not say that this comment helped you then i don't like you, if you do say it helped then god bless you, you will go to heaven.
