except for the acting of meryl streep, which is of note as always, i'd avoid this film because it has a dated "movie of the week" quality about it. but it is worth watching if you keep the several understories in mind: how a couple endures media scrutiny, and how the different are treated.<br /><br />throughout the movie the issue is the credibility of the different. australians are different than "us" (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) automatically come at it with an air of "oddness" about them. the couple involved is religious (different than most of culture) and adventists (different) at that. so their lifestyle and mindset are suspect to begin with. dingos are different animals than other dogs, so again we're faced with oddness questions. the real story, then, is how society (and the world) treats the different, those who have different accents, different beliefs, than we do and how we treat what they say as suspect.<br /><br />it's difficult to hear the phrase "a dingo took my baby!" without laughing and there are humorous posts, sadly, all over the web about it. but in the years that followed the story and the movie it has been discovered (as you'll find in web searches) that much larger children have been stalked by dingos. research by experts in dingos have shown that it was not only possible but most probable that the baby was taken by dingos (maybe a pair), extracted expertly from the clothing and eaten within moments without a trace.<br /><br />yet what is left behind is the question of why people defended dingos when they were found to be endangering children rather than killing the dingo to save the children, why because a woman's affect (expression) is so cold she is assumed to be guilty, and on and on.<br /><br />haunting questions, with or without the film.
