this is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on dvd.<br /><br />television moved out of my life in 1981, so i never followed the series or any part of it - which means that i'm immune to the nostalgic charm that moonlighting appears to have for most reviewers. <br /><br />(possible spoiler warning) <br /><br />the pilot of moonlighting is your basic "caveman meets fluffball" yarn, where a "charming" red-blooded he-man manipulates a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs. the premises that the script's "wit" is based on must have already felt stale around 1950. it also contains some frankly bad writing, as in the scene where maddie demolishes the furnishings instead of shooting the villain, strictly in order to prove herself the inept female in need of masculine assistance. <br /><br />i often feel that susan faludi overreacts in seeing male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment, but in this particular case i'm all with her - moonlighting has backlash stamped all over it. <br /><br />in one sense, however, this dvd is a must for all serious bruce willis fans: in addition to the pilot episode, it contains the screen test that landed willis the job. both features show to what amazing extent willis' acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (die hard 1, in country). impressive! <br /><br />rating (and i _am_ a bruce willis fan): 2 out of 10
