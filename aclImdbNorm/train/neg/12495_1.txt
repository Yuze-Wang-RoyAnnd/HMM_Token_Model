ok, i love bad horror. i especially love horror bad enough to make fun of. demonicus, or house of the dead - those were bad enough to make fun of. severed was not.<br /><br />it was worse.<br /><br />(spoilers - who cares?)<br /><br />my friend and i sat through the entire film, and i have a number of comments, both in the "this sucks" style and in the realm of actual critiques.<br /><br />plot (sort of) - there's a guy in this city (which is possibly seattle, see comment below) who is running around and cutting off heads. he's been doing this for over a year (i'm not going back to get exact numbers - thank you very much), possibly two or three years. one head a week. and the police are just now calling in a "specialist" (who once refers to himself as a psychic, but that never comes up again).<br /><br />schya right! feds take over after, what, three connected homicides? after nearly a hundred similar killings we'd be under freaking martial law!!!!!<br /><br />anyway, this "specialist" consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time, and the two of them come to the conclusion that it's baron samedi, a voodoo spirit, who is cutting off heads to gain enough power to make himself a body (and then presumably take over the world - or possibly just go to disneyland).<br /><br />um.<br /><br />setting - where is this happening? well, if you're not from seattle, you might not realize that at the bar/rave (occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members), there's a poster for a local radio station, and that in the highly-entertaining, "pulp fiction"esqe dialog (as if) between the two cops (yes, the ones who get their heads cut off about 15 minutes into the flick) they discuss "the new stadium" which may still have been an issue when this movie was made.<br /><br />being from seattle, i apologize on the movie's behalf and hang my head in shame.<br /><br />ok, here's where it gets really critical - being a horror movie writer (not published, don't go looking for my name in the imdb), i do research. lots of research. and unlike the writers of this movie, i know that baron samedi - while a voudon loa (spirit) who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated (by various christian oppressors) with "satan" - is actually a "loki"-like trickster god. <br /><br />in other words, he doesn't cut off heads.<br /><br />besides, a major part of the voudoun religion is that baron samedi can have a body whenever he wants. their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the loa.<br /><br />not to mention, if he's already possessed someone, why make a new body?<br /><br />also, if baron samedi got a body, he wouldn't go around cutting off heads, he'd get some good rum and cigars and par-tay!!!<br /><br />in summary, the only thing they did get (surprisingly) right is that in the completely unnecessary tarot card reading (used only to show that the voodoo chick is "spooky") they didn't screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do. again, i've done research. (anyone remember the old late-night ad for phone-in tarot readings - "the lovers - you will soon fall madly in love..." and all that nonsense?)<br /><br />if you made it this far through my comments, i congratulate you. and i'm sorry again. i'll be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the film on account of me, so please don't.
