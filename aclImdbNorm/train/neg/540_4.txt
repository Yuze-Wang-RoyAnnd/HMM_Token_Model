all for love ( as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend ) is a romantic period drama featuring captain saint ives a french officer in napoleon`s army who is captured by the british and imprisoned in scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison . there`s also a storyline involving a murder .<br /><br />i will be honest and confess that i wasn`t too taken by the movie since i`m not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but i will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and it`s got a good cast that features miranda richardson , anna friel , richard e grant , michael gough and jason isaacs . the costume design as you can expect is also excellent <br /><br />i`ll be very surprised if this movie doesn`t get any complaints after being broadcast on bbc2 at teatime . captain saint ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and there`s a scene of french prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen . you really do have to worry if bbc schedulers have any type of clue as to what they`re doing
