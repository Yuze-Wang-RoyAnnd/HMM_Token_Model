i cannot believe how popular this show is. i consider myself an avid sci-fi fan. i have read countless sci-fi novels and have enjoyed many sci-fi movies and tv shows. i really wouldn't even consider this true sci-fi. every episode i have sat through was like a lame, watered down version of a star trek episode, minus anything that might make it interesting or exciting.<br /><br />it's basically a bunch of people standing around in army fatigues, talking about something boring, who occasionally go through the stargate and end up on a planet that looks just like earth, with people who look and sound just like humans! it seemed extremely low budget. the characters are all forgettable one dimensional cutouts, and the many attempts at humor fall flat. it reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it, trying to be funny, but he is not. it is just sad.<br /><br />the movie was terrible as well. there is so much you can do with a portal through space, yet every place the army people go is boring! this shows no imagination! i actually thought the tv series "alien nation" from a few years back (based on the movie alien nation) was much better. that show actually had good story lines and decent characters. i wasn't crazy about "alien nation", but compared to this overrated crap, it was great!<br /><br />also, unlike the great new "battlestar galactica" series, "stargate" copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely! they should have at least updated the cheesy "toilet flushing" special effect of whenever somebody goes through the stargate.
