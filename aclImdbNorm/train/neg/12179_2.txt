not even worth watching this tacky spoiler ruins everything about 'annie'. the characters seem almost cheapened by the poorly written storyline and they low quality feeling to the production. it was very clearly made for tv, yet if i found it on my television, i would flick it straight over. the children in the film do an alright job, yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie fails to really draw you in. this film lacked the music/dance numbers thats made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine of the annie we all love. johnson, as annie is at times annoying and over acted..you cannot convince yourself that she truly is annie. the differences in character appearance continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film. sad to say this sequel was a total flop.
