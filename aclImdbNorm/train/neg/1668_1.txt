being a music student myself, i thought a movie taking place in a conservatory might be fun to watch. little did i know... (i had no idea this movie was based on a book by britney spears) this movie was implausible throughout. it's obvious that whoever wrote the script never set foot in a conservatory and doesn't know a thing about classical music. let me give you just a few examples: 1) there is no way anyone would be admitted to a classical conservatory with no classical training whatsoever! just having a nice pop voice isn't enough, besides, that's a different thing altogether - another genre, different technique. it's like playing the violin when applying for a viola class. 2) how come the lady teaching music theory was in the singing jury? if she wasn't a singing professor herself, she would have no say in a situation like that, and if she was a singing professor, why weren't we told so? 3) being able to read music is a necessity if you're to major in music. 4) how did angela get a hold of that video tape? that would have been kept confidential, for the jury's eyes only. now either she got the tape from one of the professors or the script writers just didn't have a clue. i wonder which... 5) the singing professor gave holly the carmen song saying she "had the range", which she clearly did not. yes, she was able to sing the notes, but carmen is a mezzo-soprano, while holly's voice seemed to be much lighter in timbre, not at all compatible with that song. 6) worst of all: not only does the movie show a shocking ignorance when it comes to classical music, but it doesn't even try to hide it. the aria that angela sings is mutilated beyond recognition, a fact which is painfully blatant at the recital, where it is cut short in a disgraceful way - mozart would roll over in his grave. the habanera from carmen sounded a bit weird at times, too, and the way it was rearranged at the end just shows how little the producers really think of classical music - it's stiff and boring but hey, add some drums and electric guitars and it's almost as good as britney spears! i know these are all minor details, but it would have been so easy to avoid them with just a little research. anyhow, i might have chosen to suspend my disbelief had the characters and the plot been well elaborated. but without that, i really can't find any redeeming qualities in this movie except for one: it's good for a laugh.
