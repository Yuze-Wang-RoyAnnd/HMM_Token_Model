this film, by oscar petersson, is unique. its uniqueness doesn't lie in the story, since many a half brained hollywood production has served us comparably miserable plots, but rather in the thorough way that complete and utter lousiness in one aspect is joined with equal lousiness in all other aspects.<br /><br />the dialog is worse than embarrassing. rotten acting and abysmal direction are thrown into the mix. bosnians speaking english with heavy swedish accents add an unintentional element of humor. uninspired lightning and camera-work are icing on the turkey film cake. as a sort of surprise for the audience, there are a few completely unmotivated slow motion sequences where you'd least expect any. to add insult to injury, the whole thing is cut by someone devoid of any sense of timing.<br /><br />the "bad guy henchman turns good after hearing good guy's speech" scene in the church, is the point at which is time to dethrone ed wood from the position as the worst director of all times; move over ed wood - here comes oscar petersson!
