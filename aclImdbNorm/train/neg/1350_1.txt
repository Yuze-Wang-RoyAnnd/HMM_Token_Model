this film essentially deals with inspector gadget's arch-nemesis doctor claw who has returned after many years to the now-peaceful city of metropolis. claw's plan is to foil gadget once and for all by using a newer "cooler" crimefighter to help destroy gadget's popularity. sadly the film fails miserably, the series was great, but it was revived nearly 20 years later with tragic results. without the voice of don adams as inspector gadget it just doesn't cut it anymore; dr. claw is not only visually less frightening, but sounds more like a wrestler with a cold, than his original intimidating self. granted this is a children's movie, but the plot is so painfully weak (heaven forbid i mention the animation) that it pales in comparison to the original series. someone has decided to updated penny as well to bring her two decades up to speed, she now has some quasi-punk rebellious clothing style and doesn't play half the role that she did in the tv series. the gadgetmobile talks, as well as including a plot angle that focuses entire on talking cars. maybe i'm just a kid who loved the show who's grown up jaded, but i thought that the live-action version was more pain than i could bear, but now they go and spring this complete watering-down of the quality tv series on us. it's more than i can take.
