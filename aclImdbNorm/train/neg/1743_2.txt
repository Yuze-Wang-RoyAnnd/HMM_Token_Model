contrary to its title, this film offers no spice and thus audience is subjected to a tasteless dish. all humor appears forced, theatrical, mechanical, staged, reminiscent of those pakistani plays available on video, including even the mannerisms. everybody is screaming, shouting and doing odd things for no reason. the premise looks interesting as it is a straight lift from hollywood's 'boeing boeing". john abraham who is so natural in almost all his films is a complete misfit here. if we keep morality factor aside, even then the bizarre events looks trite. akshay kumar and paresh rawal, two experienced stalwarts try hard to lift the film by being natural but in vain. at least, the characters of three girls should be made contrasting in order to bring some interesting elements but sadly here too all of them appears those brainless, buxomed bimbettes (3bs) who talk, behave and even scream in quite similar fashion. the major hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls at his same home pretending that they will never get to know about each other? just to do some sex, what else? the same could be done in hundreds of other ways. therefore so much dramabaazi for no reason is not something audience will digest easily. but surely, great flesh show and tempting promos always gives such films a great initial. now for those who call it a situational comedy, i call it a pathetic taste. sense of humor of such cinema going audience is surely gone corrupted and demented to the extent that they are connecting to a sadistic, weird and maddening type of humor, where it is not the characters that they laugh at but rather at themselves and at their own frustrations that look how senseless we have become that in order to laugh we have to bear with such things?
