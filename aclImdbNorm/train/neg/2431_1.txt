as a turkish man now living in sweden i must confess i often watch scandinavian movies. most if them i never understand. i think actors from scandinavia work best in hollywood. last week i watched a film called "the polish wedding" together with a polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched. unfortunately i was wrong this movie " house of angels" is even worse. none of the actors can act, absolutely not the female so called star helen bergstrom. the plot is so silly nobody can believe it.i think the whole thing is a mess from the start. lots of bad acting except from selldal and wollter. ahmed sellam
