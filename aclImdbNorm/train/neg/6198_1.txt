this cowardly and offensive film had me intrigued to begin with. the characters are the familiar dispossessed young males frequently to be seen hanging around bored in a sea side town. robert is an outsider but he has his music which could have been his soul. instead clay makes robert into a freak who embarks on a journey into cannabis and ecstasy and getting in with the wrong crowd. clay seems to believe in "reefer madness" and robert ends the film as a homicidal rapist. one wonders how much experience of real life this young director has. no one can save poor robert. clay leaves us with the message that young british men are out of control. a very unsubtle link is made to the iraqi insurgents; during the needlessly graphic rape we are subjected to explosions and images of war. the film shows male peer group extremism pushed to it's limits. the young bombers in london draw a parallel with clay's hateful depiction of modern male. clay implies that men simply cannot help themselves from inflicting terrible acts of violence. it is a wonder the british film industry allows money to be invested in films which advocate such divisive propaganda, when in london we are still reeling from the recent attacks. this is clay's first film, i would be delighted if it is his last.
