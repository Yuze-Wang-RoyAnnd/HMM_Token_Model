can fake scenery ruin a picture? you wouldn't think so, but it actually for me in here. listen, i have a lot of classic-era movies and i know pretty much what to except, such as the drivers steering immobile cars in front of a screen, etc. but a lot of that hokey business has to do with action scenes. to have fake scenery, fake mountains and flowers shot after shot as seen in "brigadoon" gets insulting after awhile. <br /><br />as far as the music entertainment went, this is always subjective. what songs one person likes, another may not so that shouldn't be a big part of judging a film (whether someone likes the songs). i could blast this movie for its corny 1950 songs, dances, romances and characters but that was the '50s and a lot of people liked this sort of things. musicals did very well in the '50s. me, i liked the '30s and '40s with the great taps. by the '50s, tap was out and this new stuff - which i can stand - was it. does that make this a lousy movie? no. it just makes one i didn't care for very much<br /><br />despite the good cast, good director and high expectations, this film bombed at the box office, and with me. i should have liked it more, being a dreamer myself and that's a nice part of this story. i am not the cynical type and a nice town and nice people making me feel good sounds awful appeal. then why couldn't i connect with this film? part of it also was the dancing. i don't care for the stuff that replaced tap dancing on screen. but - no - the thing really turned me off what that staging. there was no scotland, no highlands, just a hokey- looking background to make it look that way and it turned me almost from the start. score one point for today's realism where they "go on location" most of the time.
