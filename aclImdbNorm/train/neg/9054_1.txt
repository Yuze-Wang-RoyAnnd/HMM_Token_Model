if you hate redneck accents, you'll hate this movie. and to make it worse, you see patrick swayze, a has been trying to be a redneck. i really can't stand redneck accents. i like billy bob thornton, he was good in slingblade, but he was annoying in this movie. and what kind of name is lonnie earl? how much more hickish can this movie get? the storyline was stupid. i'm usually not this judgemental of movies, but i couldn't stand this movie. if you want a good billy bob thornton movie, go see slingblade.<br /><br />my mom found this movie for $5.95 at wal mart...figures...i think i'll wrap it up and give it to my grandma for christmas. it could just be that i can't stand redneck accents usually, or that i can't stand patrick swayze. maybe if patrick swayze wasn't in it. i didn't laugh once in the movie. i laugh at anything stupid usually. if they had shown someones fingers getting smashed, i might have laughed. people's fingers getting smashed by accident always makes me laugh.
