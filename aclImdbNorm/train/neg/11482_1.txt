it, at all, you have seen when harry met sally, then avoid this one. it will not only make you bang your head on the table as why can't bollywood even make a good remake; but also annoy you with the so called funny moments in it. the charm of the movie is missing. ranee looks terrible. saif tries to act like he is one hell of an actor. the plots that have been picked up from the original, don't look effective either. the part where both of them bring their friends along and they hit a note, it just doesn't look appealing. what can be more disastrous? you wanna waste some money, this is what you can get. otherwise, put some more bucks, and watch the original. its too good to miss..
