basically this is a pale shadow of high fidelity, which was a witty and wonderfully acted film with several truly winning character turns. watching the detectives has none of that.<br /><br />the premise of a video store geek swept off his feet by a quirky mystery woman is a good one but is never fully or adequately explored, thanks to a very weak script and the miscasting of the leads, not to mention the lack of any real visual story-telling style. i mean, this film is centered around movies, yet is itself incredibly uncinematic! that's a major failing right there.<br /><br />but the main problem is we simply don't care about the main characters because the script and the actors (murphy and liu) fail to make them true or sympathetic in any real way. so the film just becomes a series of episodes involving two people who seem, well, not terribly interesting.<br /><br />oh, yeah, another thing: for a romantic comedy? it's not funny. and the romance isn't terribly romantic, either.<br /><br />so avoid it. even at its 90-something minute running time it's just not worth sitting through...
