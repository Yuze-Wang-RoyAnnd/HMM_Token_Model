sergio leone spins in his grave... if there was any film that tramples upon a man's life work its this one. the lead character's "lone wolf" bravado is uninspiring and lame, and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an eight grade education. whoever's idea this was should be horse whipped. the only reason i'm spending time trashing it is because there's a 10 line minimum. sergio leone's family should sue, not because its crap, but because now it's immortalized as crap by mst 3000. shame. disgust. i blame hollywood...at least gary busey makes crap that wont offend anyone but cocaine users and weapon experts...this film is pure blasphemy.
