oliver gruner is totally unknown to me. my friend showed me this film because he had seen gruner in, what he called a pretty good sci-fi film, nemesis. so as we watched this, we found ourselves fastforwarding through the bs drama parts just to get to the unbelievable action sequences. gruner loves to kick and kick and kick. and kick! haha<br /><br />gruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one that he grew up in. he finds himself watching after the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join in the mexican gang that keeps tormenting his family. instead of joining up, gruner tells the boy to fight back (against a gang? too crazy). gruner plays a typical van damme character who kills everyone (or maims them pretty bad) and works to rid his block of these gangmembers.<br /><br />the plot was very cheesy and easy to think of. gruner is probably not very well known because of his script-choosing if this movie is anything to compare possible choices to. this ghetto is pure hell and i enjoyed seeing the motley crew of characters go through it as if they have a chance against gruner's character. the music was typical action music (thumping pianos and timpani, swelling guitars) which actually wasn't as bad as i make it sound. the director really needed to keep the action going instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a tense family moment.<br /><br />ultimately, i gave it a 4/10 because it really tried to be an average action film for oliver gruner to star in, but the overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more closure on what you just saw.
