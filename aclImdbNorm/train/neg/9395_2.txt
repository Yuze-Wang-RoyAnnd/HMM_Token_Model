this serial is interesting to watch as an mst3k feature, but for todays audience that's all it is. i was really surprised to see the year it was made as 1952. considering that fact alone makes this a solid (lowly?) 2 in my book. the cars used don't even look contemporary, they look like stuff from the 30's. it's basically cody (the lone world's salvation? sheesh talk about an insult to everyone else, like the military), anyway it's cody in his nipple ring flying suit against graber and daley two dumb*ss henchman who sport handguns and an occasional ray gun thats pretty lame in its own right, enjoy. if you want to watch a really good serial see flash gordan, it's full of rockets that attack each other and a good evil nemesis and also good looking women, this has none of that. and flash was made 15 or so years before this crap so you can give it some slack. something made in 1952, this bad, deserves a 2. nuff said. give it a 6 if your watching it as a mst3k episode, those guys have some good fun with it; a tweak of the nipples here, a tweak there and i'm flying! and now as an added bonus, i bring you the commander cody theme song as originally sung by joel and his two character bots tom servo and crow aboard the satellite of love for episode eight the enemy planet:<br /><br />(singing at the very beginning credits);<br /><br />(tom servo singing) your watching commander cody.... he is the new character from republic,<br /><br />he gets in trouble every week... but he's saved by editing,<br /><br />just a tweak of his nipples... sends him on his way,<br /><br />a pumpkin head and a rocket pack.... will save the day,<br /><br />(joel singing) his labratory is a boxing ring... when bad guys come to mix it up,<br /><br />somebody always gets kidnapped... and cody has to fix it up,<br /><br />he drinks his tea at al's cafe... and flies along on wires,<br /><br />he beats the crooks and flies with hooks... and puts out forest fires,<br /><br />(crow singing)<br /><br />bad guys beware... cody is there,<br /><br />you'll like his hair it's under his helmut... and because we can't think of a good rhyme,<br /><br />that's the end of the commander cody theme song... so sit right back with a will of granite,<br /><br />and watch chapter eight, cause that's the enemy planet
