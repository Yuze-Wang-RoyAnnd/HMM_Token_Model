... but the keyword here is "usually." i have been known to adore movies everyone thinks are dumb. but in the world of b-rated movies, this one is z-rated. absolutely ridiculous. the thing i respect about most of my favorite b-rated movies are that they don't take themselves too seriously. the makers of movies like that sort-of treat the movie lightly, even if it's a heavy topic. i get the impression, however, that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously, like they were putting together a 10-star classic, complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots. nevertheless, despite all this, i still gave it 4 out of 10 stars, as i am biased towards movies like this. if you're a b-rated fan, however, i would try too hard to find this one.
