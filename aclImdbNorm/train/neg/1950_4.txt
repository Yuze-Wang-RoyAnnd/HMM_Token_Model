i grew up with scooby(kinda the re-runs of where are you)i hate scrappy, love daphne, and feel its not complete with out the whole gang. but this is sad, scooby doo is mystery solving comedy-not bad totally spy's jap anime. i like "whats new", they had to give danger-prone daphne a makeover sometime :( and try to lose the *sex *drug jokes of many a generation, but this "get a clue" is flat out crap and should not have the scooby name attached. they even tried to do some lame punk thing with the theme song. now i'm gonna go watch my dvd of scooby doo where are you to wash the filth of this new series off my eyes
