... so i thought i'd throw in a few words about william mcnamara. not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his tighty-whities -- it's obvious he pumped up for this role and he looks pretty darn good in them -- or less. there's an extended sequence in a cave where he has to strip down to his undies. there's a nice bit where he has to chase after miss eleniak in the buff, with only his hands cupped over his groin. william mcnamara is naturally a little on the skinny side, but he has a nice, generous handful of a booty. also, there's a moment when he's getting out of bed that if you pause the action at just the right moment you can see the whole enchilada. if you're inclined to do so, and come on, half of the people who choose to watch a movie about navy men on a "road trip" are. i'd just like thank dennis hopper for his equal opportunity gratuitous nudity. can william mcnamara act? heck if i know.
