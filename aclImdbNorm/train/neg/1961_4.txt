...the child actors were annoying. also it seems as if the makers on this film were struggling to fill 90 minutes. decent death scenes, though. if not for the death scenes, this movie would have a very disneyish feel to it.<br /><br />the main child protagonist didn't seem nearly as scared as she should have been. if i was in the middle of the woods with a tooth fairy ghost killer type individual, you can bet your arse i wouldn't be out wandering around and riding my bike.<br /><br />overall, i've seen worse (i.e. it waits) but it's nothing i would watch again, or recommend anyone bothering with it unless you're an avid horror collector.
