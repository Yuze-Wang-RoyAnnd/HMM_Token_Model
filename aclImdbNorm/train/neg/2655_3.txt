**1/2 for this diane keaton farce.<br /><br />someone should tell ms. keaton, enough with your annie hall philosophy and hats.<br /><br />this flick is just too much as keaton's daughter, sara, dies in a traffic accident, while her boyfriend survives.<br /><br />keaton, who could not be reached by phone at first, as she was in the sack with her pal and had pulled out the phone plug, grieves in a new way for grievers.<br /><br />she retreats to the summer locale where all of sara's friends are staying. she cleans the house, sleeps for two days and then begins to reveal things which were better not to be revealed. it appears that sweet sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy who ultimately married the latter. in addition, she had an abortion thanks to this guy. we're all now put on this guilt trip.<br /><br />her only hope is to find the elusive diary that sara kept. she also hopes that boyfriend,adam, who is a playwright, will not include all this in another play.<br /><br />when the diary is found, it has been written in japanese. sara had a ph.d in this language. it's not that great news for mom when an excerpt of the diary is translated by a japanese cook in a japanese restaurant.<br /><br />naturally, everything seems to tie up nicely in the end. <br /><br />the title of this shmaltz comes from the wizard of oz. every time mom and sara would speak, they would both utter surrender dorothy.<br /><br />as if this isn't enough, during the course of this bizarre extravaganza of mourning, keaton tells adam not to be another woody allen in his film, interiors, where he tried to successfully emulate ingmar bergman. ms. keaton also tries drugs with the group. come on, folks, can we realistically believe that anyone in his right mind could mourn like this? <br /><br />fair to mediocre best sums up this film.
