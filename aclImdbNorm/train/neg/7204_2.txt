this is one of those movies you think that the makers would refuse to release it because it is so terrible. obviously they were thinking that children are stupid and are excellent for absorbing endless ads and would think they are entertainment because it is slapstick funny. what is it with the talking car with buttons that say wendy's, mcdonalds, m&m's and skittles? there was no talking car in the cartoon. (dr.) claw is supposed to be evil, not handsome and charming. why is rupert everet 'claw' anyway? were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes? it looks like they were (badly) lampooning robo cop, with the turning a man into a crime fighting android thing. i tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if i watch more than 30 minutes of a movie, you don't get a refund. i'm sorry i watched more than 30 minutes of that pile of crap. after i was told the no-refund policy, i decided to watch the rest of the hideous garbage called inspector gadget.
