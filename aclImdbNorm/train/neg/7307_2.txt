this is probably one of the worst films i have ever seen. the events in it are completely random and make little or no sense. the fact that there is a sequel is so sickening i may come down with a case of cabin fever (i'm so sorry). i describe it as bug being smooshed to a newspaper because it seems to be different parts of things mixed together. e.g kevin the pancake loving karate kid is just freakishly weird on its own, then there's the cop who is slightly weird and perverted, then the drug addict, then there's the fact that they attack some random guy who clearly needs help. then all of a sudden the main character is having sex with his friends girlfriend just because she says something stupid about a plane going down. then at the end some good old family racism followed by a rabbit operating on kevin the karate kid. its actually pretty despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this film. there is no reason for anyone to enjoy this film unless you love eli roth, even that did not make me like this film. hate is a strong word but seeing as it is the only word i am permitted to use it will have to do. boycott cabin fever 2!!!!!
