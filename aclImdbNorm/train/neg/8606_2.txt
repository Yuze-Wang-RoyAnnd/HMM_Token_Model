i love killer insects movies they are great fun to watch, i had to watch this movie as it was one of my favourite horror books by shaun hutson.<br /><br />i have met him and i wish i did listen to him as this movie was terrible like he said it was,after he said that i was still dying to see how bad it was.<br /><br />the plot: people are dying mysteriously and gruesomely, and nobody has a clue what the cause is.<br /><br />only health worker mike brady has a possible solution, but his theory of killer slugs is laughed at by the authorities.<br /><br />only when the body count begins to rise and a slug expert from england begins snooping around does it begin to look like mike had the right idea after all.<br /><br />this movie as the most overacting you ever see a movie! slugs in this movie are fast (then normal) and it looks like they fast forwarding the scenes! <br /><br />this movie is nothing like the book at all, the book was ten times scarier, ten times gory and had a lot more story to it!<br /><br />i didn't like this movie at all! as i am huge fan of slugs the book and second book called breeding ground! both of books are great <br /><br />read the book then watch the movie, you may like more then i did give this 2 out 10
