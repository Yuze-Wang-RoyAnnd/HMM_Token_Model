at the beginning of the movie, the beautiful photography and the scenes of the fox were amazing. however, the story was so very slow and boring. and then the little girl begins to domesticate the fox, which leads to tragic events. we live in the forest, and frequently see foxes. one thing anyone should know is that you leave wild animals to be wild, and enjoy them from afar. this movie sets a terrible example to the children who will be watching it, in trying to make a wild creature into a pet. i do not know what the point of the story was supposed to be. even after the terrible events with the main fox, the little girl was still wanting to play with the kits. does she never learn her lesson? and there are other scenes featuring predator animals to the fox, which only adds to the trauma inflicted on children watching this movie. what a disappointment this movie was. and what a horrible story it tells. the final narrated dialog was so stupid, by which time my wife and i were screaming at the tv! i absolutely hated this movie, and would never recommend it to anyone!
