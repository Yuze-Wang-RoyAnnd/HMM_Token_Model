it was nice to see all the familiar characters again, but the story bothered me. we loved ariel in the first movie- so why is the second one centered around her daughter? the new characters were annoying and i didn't like the plot of this. worst of all, christopher daniel barnes didn't come back as the voice of eric! disney, please stop remaking classic movies with these shoddy imitations.
