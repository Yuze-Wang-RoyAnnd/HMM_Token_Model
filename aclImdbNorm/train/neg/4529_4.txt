i won't describe the story, as that has been done elsewhere. we are great clive owen fans, and when our netflix recommended the movie, we were intrigued. <br /><br />no wonder we had never heard of this "movie", because it was a bbc television movie back in 1992. hence, the poor production values, grainy image , jerky camera work and poor sound.<br /><br />but, you don't really mind the mechanics, because the story itself will put you to sleep. it's an interesting human story, but not at all compelling, and there is hardly any ending. you don't really care for the characters as their lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie. save the two hours and do something to make the time more worthwhile.
