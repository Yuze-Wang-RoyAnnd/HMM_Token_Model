this movie is one of the most wildly distorted portrayals of history. horribly inaccurate, this movie does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of dutch, british, chinese, american and indigenous enslaved laborers that the sadistic japanese killed and tortured to death. the bridge was to be built "over the bodies of the white man" as stated by the head japanese engineer. it is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors committed by the japanese captors is the source of a movie, where the bridge itself, isn't even close to accurate to the actual bridge. the actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. what of the survivors who are still alive today? they hate the movie and all that it is supposed to represent. their friends were starved, tortured, and murdered by cruel sadists. those that didn't die of dysantry, starvation, or disease are deeply hurt by the movie that makes such light of their dark times.
