i saw this movie for 2 reasons--i like gerard butler and christopher plummer. unfortunately, these poor men were forced to carry a pretty dumb movie. i liked the idea that dracula is actually a reincarnation of judas iscariot, because it does explain his disdain for all things christian, but there was so much camp that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been. i see this movie more as a way for the talented gerard butler to pay his dues before being truly recognized and a way for the legendary christopher plummer to remind the public (me and the 5 other people who saw this film) that he still exists. i actually enjoyed the special features on the dvd more than the movie itself.
