seldom do i give up on a movie without seeing the entire show. this is particularly true when i have rented it on dvd. syriana was one in which i did give up. half way through i turned it off in bored disgust.<br /><br />this movie is disjointed, boring, confusing and lackluster. the acting was dry and without credible portrayals. the general plot was good but developed in such an insipid and boring fashion that it failed to grasp my attention or interest. the multiple sub plots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than an actual connected plot. too bad such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a flop. i cannot imagine this movie receiving any nominations much less an award.
