this movie is just horrible. it's boring, it's low quality, the actors are just the worst actors i have ever seen and the scenario is so bad that it's hilarious.<br /><br />the "main" actor is supposed to be the hot guy who gets all the girls, but he's ugly, overweight and looks like he's from the early 90's.<br /><br />all the characters are away for the week-end for a get together amongst friends, but nobody are actually friends! the married couple hasn't seen the "main" guy in over 5 years and even back then they weren't really friends. the "date" of the main guy only knows him from work and than there's a girl they pick-up at a bar. now tell me that you would risk losing your job to spend a week-end at your cabin with people that aren't even your real friends. because that's what he does at the beginning of the movie!<br /><br />do not waste even one minute of your time on this lemon. i've made home movies scarier than this!<br /><br />
