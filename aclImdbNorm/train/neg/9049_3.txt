supposedly a "social commentary" on racism and prison conditions in the rural south of the 1970's, "nightmare" is full of bad southern stereotypes, complete with phoney accents. not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most american southerners, this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly-disguised "babe in prison" movie--especially in its uncut original version. nevertheless, acting is generally above average and the late chuck connors, in particular, does a good job of making viewers hate him--even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes. there's also a change-of-pace role for the late robert reed, who appears as the lecherous warden, and tina louise (previously ginger of "gilligan's island") made a rather believable sadistic prison guard. my grade: d. <br /><br />
