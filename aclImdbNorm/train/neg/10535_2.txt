<br /><br />according to reviewers, the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year-old college kids about to enter grad school. jolly joke!<br /><br />1955? the synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet, but there it is on the bandstand. the ford pony car was not invented yet, but there it is playing oldies music. the synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid 1970's. the pony car at best is from the mid 1960's.<br /><br />20 year-old college kids? josh brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this made-for-tv movie was produced.<br /><br />the plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their tv's.
