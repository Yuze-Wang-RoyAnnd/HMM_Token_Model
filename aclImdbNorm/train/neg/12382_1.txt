spencer tracy and katherine hepburn would roll over in their graves if they knew this guess who's coming to dinner rip off was actually in theaters. along with sidney poitier and katherine houghton these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with director stanley kramer's 1967 master piece. this present day rip off is a joke. so a white guy from an overly stereotyped italian family in rhode island brings his african american girlfriend home (insert gasp here) to his grand father's funeral. his family members reactions were of course....predictable. this movie was so painfully telegraphed from start to finish my girlfriend actually started fake snoring to signal to me that she wanted to leave. do yourself a favor and rent the original. take a pass on wake.
