i know that in this episode there's other stuff apart from what i am going to discuss, and in fact i think it has some virtues; for example, the fact, after we had been given a very negative opinion of jin from seeing sun's flashbacks in "house of the rising sun", we get to see jin's side of things and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life.<br /><br />but there is an element in this story that made me so deeply uncomfortable that it greatly dampened my enjoyment of the whole episode. before now, in the scene where jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, it had been hinted that sun's father was someone who was getting rich through shady, illegal methods. i thought maybe he was a mob boss, even; mobs operate in korea, just like in almost every other country in the world, so it was a reasonable possibility. however, in this episode we learn that sun's father is in fact the boss (or a top executive) of a korean automotive company, and that what jin had been doing was physically attacking a government official (who was actually going to be murdered) on his behalf.<br /><br />i may be especially touchy about this because i happen to work in the automotive industry, but i would say it is spectacularly offensive and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing goes on in korea; that huge, serious companies like hyundai or kia (which must be the model for this fictitious car company, as they are the only ones that actually exist in reality) operate with these mafia-like methods, instead of like any normal automotive company of the west. it is just unbelievable to me that the writers would have the gall to write something like that into the story, and that there hasn't been an uproar in korea over it. it feels like extraneous "buy american!" propaganda, portraying foreign car companies as criminal, untrustworthy, third-world outfits.
