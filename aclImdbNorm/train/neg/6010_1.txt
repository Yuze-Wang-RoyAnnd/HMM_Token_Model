this movie is maybe one of the most boring movies of 2000 that i have seen! especially the music fails to create suspense when people suddenly disappear. also aspects such as martial law are not treated with the necessary seriousness. the story itself has problems: the un could never take power over the world since the united states alone would not allow it but nations such as china, russia, japan, etc. would not either. this would also play against someone trying to take over the world as nicolae carpathia does. this reminds me of james bond movies, only that those have more action! naturally the movie is made for christians and only for christians and they may enjoy it. since i cannot count myself a christian i find the whole idea ludicrous. this prophecy furthermore seems to be, if believed to be true, dangerously close to other prophecies by cults for the end of the world. why fear such a possibility when we can make life as good as possible here on earth without
