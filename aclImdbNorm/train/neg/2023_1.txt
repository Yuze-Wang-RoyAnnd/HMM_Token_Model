as the summary says you just made the most ignorant comment i have ever heard on an rpg. you seriously thought they were gay? are you retarded? if you went to go save your best friend and someone decides out of the goodness of his heart to help you then you are in a serious debt to that man. lavitz was a good person and each time they helped each other it made them closer as friends. they weren't gay lovers like your bitching about. and to let you know the game is set in a medieval time period. back then, women did just prepare meals while the men fought. do you even know your history? do you know how long it took for women to be accepted in the army in present day? this game contains a lot of realism even though your too damn slow obviously to catch it, and you really need to spit out some solid proof instead of ignorant assumptions based off your misguided act to interpret the story.
