wow!<br /><br />i just was given this film from a friend of mine, who bought it for 1.98 at walmart, and he felt that he got taken! it is beyond boring, most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen, the acting is somewhat improvised, almost as if they didn't have a script. the martians are cgi, which look like they were done by a novice, or a fan produced movie. i cannot stress just how bad this dvd really is!<br /><br />example: in one of the scenes, the martians are torturing a local female captive. she goes from a woman in front of a green screen, to a cgi copy of that woman. the change is totally noticeable, and when she is killed, you can see that it is a computer figure, looking like something from a game back in 1990!<br /><br />if at all possible, avoid this movie like the plague! you can download two trailers from their site, and see how god-awful it really is!
