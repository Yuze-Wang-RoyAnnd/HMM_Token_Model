this movie was made-for-tv, so taking that into account, i'm not going to rip into it as hard as i would a feature film. the script is sub-par, but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots, whether it means to be or not. the acting is mostly over-the-top, but that is true for many lower-budget movies.<br /><br />the aspect of this movie that i really hated, though, was that 90-95% of it is shot on film, but in random places, there will be 5-10 seconds where the footage is shot on video. you can tell because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second. i'm not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn't have the money to shoot on film (i assume this is why, anyway), but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look.<br /><br />anyway, i've definitely seen worse movies, but i definitely wouldn't say that i enjoyed this movie and i can't recommend that anyone see it.
