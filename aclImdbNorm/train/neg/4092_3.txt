i like fulci films, i really do and not in some boring ironic way either but i recognise that they appear hopelessly inept and garbled to lots of people.<br /><br />conquest is where fulci tries his hand at the epic fantasy genre and doesn't really succeed. structurally, it's like most fulci films you've seen. some stuff happens, some more stuff happens and occasionally one scene might be tangentially related to another. really it's like conan with no sets, no script, no real actors (yes, arnold scharzenfartz is hardly an actor either), no budget, stupid looking dog soldiers and a bunch of gore.<br /><br />this one was a hard one to get through and i could've lived without the inch of vaseline smeared on the camera to give it that hair metal music video look.
