i was very disappointed in this movie. plotwise it was weak bordering on silly: souls who can affect reality in the way they do? a mission apparently critical to the soul hunters entrusted to one of their younger members? and the whole b-story with the "holobrothel" and the lawsuit against the station was so awful that at one point i blurted out to the television, "why are you wasting my time with this?"<br /><br />thematically, "river of souls" didn't really go into the question of the soul in any more depth than the original episode "soul hunter" did. we see that soul hunters can make mistakes, but we still don't get a feeling for their culture. (are there any female soul hunters?)<br /><br />the acting was okay, given the material they had to work with, and the special effects - especially the planetscapes in the first act - were very impressive. but overall, i'd say give this one a miss.
