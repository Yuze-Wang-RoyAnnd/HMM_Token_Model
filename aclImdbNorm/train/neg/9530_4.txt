i guess that this movie is based on some kind of a true story.... it's about two young girls who molest a grown man for 48hrs.; i don't see where the terror comes into play here.... there are some "weird' and "surreal" sequences in the movie. and the two girls (sandra locke and...ah...oh well) play the roll of two psycho-man haters to the hilt...they do a pretty good job (although some of it is just a tad over the top). the movie's not good, and it's not horrible; it's just really really dated! i mean this thing is dripping with the 70's.... it's not really bad if you like that sort of thing...you know...that thang?
