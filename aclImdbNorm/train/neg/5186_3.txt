rks films always have been commercial films which suited the 90's, from ghayal, damini<br /><br />his last few films khakee were watchable family was crap<br /><br />this film is a decent film but could be better<br /><br />the problem lies in there is lot of old fashioned clich'es thrown in and many scenes come out too filmy and lengthy<br /><br />ajay devgan's character is shown very well but his character gets heroic which could be subtle<br /><br />the lengthy flashback could be avoided as thigns are simply long drawn<br /><br />even the street play in the second half look too simplistic and hardly a solution though the message is well brought out<br /><br />direction by rks is decent, though it could be better music is okay<br /><br />ajay devgan looks the part very well and is at ease playing his part mostly though at times he does look ill at ease in light scenes he excels in dramatics vidya excels in the scene front of media pankaj has a not proper defined role and too filmy yet he excels in his part darshan jariwala hams as the old age villain the rest are okay
