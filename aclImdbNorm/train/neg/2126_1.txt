jason alexander is a wonderful actor, but it's ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead. the fact that he dances so well, croons so effectively, and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy. in his more cutesy moments (with the girl in the train station, in the final number with rosie), i couldn't take my eyes off him he was so repellent. you keep expecting him to drop the nice-guy act and start snarling. vanessa williams was the real star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie. by the way, if you see a production of the stage musical, the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie, you'll see three versions that have more revisions (different songs, same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other musical i've ever seen.
