woody allen, when at his best, has one of the sharpest pens around. he can make an acute observation and wrap it around a punch line like nobody else. however, when he's at his worst his movies can stench of pretentiousness. unfortunately, "melinda and melinda" has this stench from opening to closing. the set up is one of his more intriguing ideas in a while. four friends sit in a restaurant discussing whether the essence of life is comedy or drama. to help settle the argument, one man relates the beginning of a story and asks the two other men arguing (one a comic playwright, the other a dramatic playwright) whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy. the two men then continue the story and the movie plays out the stories that they weave. now, when i first heard about this film, my understanding was that they tell the exact same story, the genre (comedy or drama) only changes by how you look at it. now that would have been interesting. however, the stories only share one main element and a few side elements. they are entirely different stories with major plot differences. the drama is so stiffly scripted and pretentious that it can only really work as self-parody. if this was the point, then it failed because these elements prevent the audience from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters. the comedy is the story that has moments of success, but they are still short and fleeting. will farrell is obviously meant to be the stand-in for woody, but he could have played this character so much more believably without adding woody's stutters and hand-ticks. woody is the best at being woody. when someone else tries, they're not playing a character, they are modeling a recognizable actor. this type of thing only pulls the audience out of the story.<br /><br />my favorite woody allen movies make me leave the theater a little bit lighter in spirit than i walked in. this one made me wish i could get my money back.
