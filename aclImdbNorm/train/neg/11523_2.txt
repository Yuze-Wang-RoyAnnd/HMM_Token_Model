"igor and the lunatics" is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killing-spree horror movie. apparently even nearly twenty years later, charles manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trash-filmmakers. this is a typical troma production, meaning in other words, there's a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to accompany the nonsensical plot. there's a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display
