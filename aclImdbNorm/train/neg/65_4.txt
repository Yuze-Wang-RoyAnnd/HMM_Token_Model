i don't quite get the rating for the amati girls and i think i was really kind giving it a 4 out of 10. what could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes. there are so many clich'es in that flick, the women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake. there's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits that it hurts. it's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so in my eyes it's just not good. watching it i couldn't believe how something like that made it to my tv set in my living room in switzerland. but.. maybe it still was ok and it just got lost in translation? who knows. definitely one of the oddest movies i've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way! sorry.
