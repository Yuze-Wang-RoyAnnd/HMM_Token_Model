this movie was way over-hyped. a lot of the viewers, who thought this was "amazing" must have been into the old school movies, cause the whole movie is set in the past. at first i thought the movie was just showing something from the past, so i was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass, but it just going. basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past, and the 2 don't mix very well in this movie, even with special effects. you could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with. there are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did, so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying "it's the greatest movie ever done". it's just crap on a stick. it also didn't help that the story line was sooo crappy. i don't understand why hollywood agreed to have this movie produced, and i also don't understand how actors/actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this. it's almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print..."it will all be done on a computer". this was a movie that should have been on a movie network, because nothing about this movie was revolutionary. i'm very upset with myself for paying money to see this. whatever you do, don't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.
