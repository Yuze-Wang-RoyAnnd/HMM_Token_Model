maaan, where do i start with this god awful movie. bad bad bad story telling. i do not know what the director was thinking when he made this movie. namaste london was quite an enjoyable movie to be honest..even the soundtrack was good. but in this one..oh my good..for a movie which is supposed to be a musical one..the songs are soooo bad. ar rahman should have been the music director. <br /><br />given two great actors a much better job should have been done by the director. even though the first half sucks, the last 30 mins of the movie are ok. performances from salman and ajay save the movie from being a total disaster.<br /><br />watch it if you have nothing better to do. the last good movie from bollywood i watched ( and i do watch a load of them) is dev d and wake up sid.
