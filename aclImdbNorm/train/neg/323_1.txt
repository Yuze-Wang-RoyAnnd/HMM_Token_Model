this movie was so bad i couldn't sit through it without doing something else. there was no plot and no point. i was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian, i couldn't recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description. politicians with no charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less entertaining.<br /><br />so how was this made? is there no quality control in film? watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience.<br /><br />it's hard to imagine that adam sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure. he was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy.
