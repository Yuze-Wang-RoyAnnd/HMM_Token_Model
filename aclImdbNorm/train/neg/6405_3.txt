no real plot to this one, just a series of short skits acting out some very old jokes. i chuckled once or twice in the beginning, much to my chagrin. but even at only 73 minutes this film wears out it's welcome before too long and becomes stale and tedious (with some nudity sprinkled in here and there to keep you awake). still as bad as this movie is (and that's pretty putrid), it's a comedic gem compared to pretty much anything by aaron seltzer & jason friedberg (date movie, epic movie, meet the spartans) also the song is sadly kind of catchy in a sad way.<br /><br />eye candy: 11 pair of tits, 3 bushes, 3 asses <br /><br />my grade: d <br /><br />code red dvd extras: original trailer for this film; and trailers for "beyond the door", "dead pit", "the farmer", "obsessed ones", "power play", "sole survivor", & "wacky taxi"
