cute and playful, but lame and cheap. 'munchies' is another gremlins clone to come out from the 80s. i'm not much of a fan of the imitations.<br /><br />first it was the excellent 'gremlins'.<br /><br />then came the very average 'critters'.<br /><br />lets not forget the lousy 'ghoulies'.<br /><br />but the complete pits would have to go to 'hobgoblins'.<br /><br />is there more?? <br /><br />now 'munchies' for me would have to fall somewhere between 'ghoulies' and 'hobgoblins'. actually i probably found it more entertaining than 'ghoulies', but i preferred thst one's darker tone. <br /><br />from the get-go it plays up its goofy nature (which it's better for it), but due to that nature the hammy acting (alix elias and charlie phillips), can get rather overbearing that you rather just see the munchies running amok. that's where the fun occurs. mostly light-hearted fluff though, as the story mainly centres on the munchies (who are either hungry, horny and destructive) in a whole bunch of supposed comical encounters (some moments do work) in the small desert town as a couple of people are on the chase. it's silly, but strangely engaging thanks to the zippy pacing. the creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed, as they're basic dolls being chucked about. where their personalities arrived from is that they can actually speak... and with attitude.<br /><br />charlie stratton and a feisty nadine van der velde (who was in 'critters') were fair leads. harvey korman was acceptable in two roles. robert picardo also pops up.<br /><br />amusingly low-cut entertainment for the undemanding.
