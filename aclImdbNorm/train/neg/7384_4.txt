star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning <br /><br />marshall lawson (steven seagal) is assigned to france on a reconaissance mission along with three new young strike-team recruits after disobeying a direct order from above. however the night before they're due to strike, they are all found grusomely slaughtered by a killer with seemingly inhuman strength. with the french police dallying around with their own investigation, he goes in search of those responsible himself, only to uncover a corrupt faction of the military dealing in a deadly new drug that alters a person's dna and gives them terrifying new strength.<br /><br />bad cover. bad title. bad post-production tampering. and bad trailer. pretty bad film. but, i've got to say, i don't think attack force is quite his worst. i know this will make me unpopular with most of the other reviewers here (perhaps not steveday!) but i think a lot of the criticism has stemmed from all the bad news that went before the film rather than the actual quality of it itself.<br /><br />i must say there was nowhere near as much dubbing or ropey editing as i'd been lead to believe. the dubbing there was (which made him sound like martin sheen with a groin problem!) was pretty awful and quite frequent but not in use for as large a segment of the film as i'd thought. the plot flowed pretty smoothly as well considering all the messing about with the original finished film called harvester that went on. also as another reviewer noted, the film has a nice gothic look to it, a new touch for a seagal film.<br /><br />the absolute killer low point, though, was the complete and total lack of any exciting action, with only a few poorly filmed fight scenes for any fun.<br /><br />i have to be honest, though, i would rather watch this again than flight of fury, today you die or out for a kill. **
