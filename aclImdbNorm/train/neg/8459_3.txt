some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential. but it never comes together as anything more than a student's graduate thesis in film school.<br /><br />there are two primary reasons for this. fist, there is not a single likable character, not even a villain we might admire for his/her chutzpah. secondly, all the acting is awful - even from veteran willem dafoe. the ham is so plentiful here, you feel like you're at a picnic - but one of those wretched company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking. then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw up.<br /><br />all right, i'm being a little rough on a young director who might still go places - as i said, the camera work is quite good.<br /><br />but i feel cheated - the blurb for this film suggests we will get to watch a "modern western", and the dvd packaging has pictures on it that suggest this as well - but nobody actually connected to the film's making seems to know that this is the kind of film they're supposed to be making.<br /><br />that betrayal is what hurts; but even without it, the fact remains that we don't like these characters, we feel embarrassed for the actors, the story is hopelessly muddled, and in the last analysis, we just don't care.<br /><br />i took it out of the dvd player about half way through. but the rental store wouldn't give me my money back.<br /><br />now, that really hurts.
