mimicking its long title the movie finds ways to come close to the 90' mark. the beautiful sets are here with all that made the hamer production values a trademark, yet paris drowned in the fog is a sign of indolent neglect. the story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words so there comes nothing unexpected and nothing worth more than 5% of your attention to be expected.<br /><br />the directing is heavy as a direct transfer from the stage play, actors are mostly stiff as wax figures (ok this is a hamer feature, only it's sometimes better featured in the whole package). my conclusion: this movie is trash, not worth the time i spend that evening. eternal life is a boring matter and i should have hoped the guys in charge of programming at the cinemath`eque would have known better.
