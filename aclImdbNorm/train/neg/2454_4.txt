i haven't seen this movie in a while, so i'm afraid i can't be very specific about details... it did have some interesting points. ralph bakshi's attempt at an animated adaptation of j.r.r tolkien's masterpiece was a very ambitious project, so ambitious in fact that it went bankrupt at some point during the production. therefore, not only does it stop abruptly somewhere around the middle of the second book of the trilogy (with sort of a shade of a hint of a sequel that was never made), the film itself seems less than finished. it seems that some characters were animated while others were filmed, but whether or not it's intentional is hard to say. the whole thing seems shabbily made and undone, especially the orcs and the nazgul. another problem, of course, is the huge gaps in the plot. bakshi was in a rush to finish this movie, and he somehow hoped to cram a book and a half in little more than two hours (the new trilogy by peter jackson does it in about twice that time.) far too many important bits were left out (and i don't refer only to tom bombadil, which, i think, was lovely in the book but would look silly in a movie.) and of course, the ending, which is completely sudden and out of place. i'm not even sure if bakshi originally intended to end the film there, or if he even had any idea where he's going to end it.<br /><br />the characters... well, most of them were okay. the hobbits don't look so bad (except for the gay sam. did you know that the producers of the new trilogy originally wanted to make sam a woman so there would be a feminine lead character?) if you're a tolkien fanatic (like me), watch this movie (though i'm not too sure about buying it. what special features does the dvd version have, anyway?) but know in advance that you're not going to watch a real 'lord of the rings movie' but not much more than a historical curiosity, which probably looks not much better than the 60s version would have had the beatles carried on with their plan (i actually think a psychedelic lotr could have been quite cool. the idea was to cast george as gandalf, paul as frodo, ringo as sam and john as gollum.) if you didn't read the book or didn't like it much or don't like animation films or don't want to see a half-finished movie... stay away.
