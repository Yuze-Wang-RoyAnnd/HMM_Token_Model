it seems evident from this adaptation that he did not. not only did he leave the plot behind, he made up his own! the things that he chose to leave in were so ridiculously unbelievable that i was happy he chose to leave out some of the most important parts of the novel. the plot was hazy, inconsistent and choppy to say the least. i don't want to say anything mean-spirited about the actors, but they can't act! dickens is difficult, of course, but this is pathetic! micawber was nothing more than a mid-nineteenth century kramer, and the less said about betsy trotwood the better! if you want to see the real copperfield, watch the wonderful 1999 bbc adaptation. as for the screenplay writer,i think he read the cliff's notes!
