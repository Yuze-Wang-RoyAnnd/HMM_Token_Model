ah, the infamous "guinea pig" series...i honestly have to say that i've been disappointed as a whole by this entire series ("he never dies","mermaid in a manhole", and "flower of flesh and blood" being the exceptions...and even those aren't great by any means...), but "devil's experiment" just plain blows. there is nothing realistic-looking going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps anti-climactic, depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene. the victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely whines or whimpers while being subjected to "hideous" (more often sometimes "hilarious") tortures. "flower of flesh and blood" is a more violent and gory depiction of fake "snuff" material, but that film also falls flat on the realism level. i applaud the japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in "extreme" film-making, but "devil's experiment" just doesn't hold up. worth a look if you are a die-hard, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about, but i can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10 and that's only for the needle-through-the-eye scene...
