the script is nice.though the casting is absolutely non-watchable.no style. the costumes do not look like some from the high highbury society. comparing gwyneth paltrow with kate beckinsale i can only say that ms. beckinsale speaks british english better than ms. paltrow, though in ms. paltrow's acting lies the very nature of emma woodhouse. mr. northam undoubtedly is the best mr. knightley of all versions, he is romantic and not at all sharp-looking and unfeeling like mr. knightley in the tv-version. p.s.the spectator cannot see at all mr. elton-ms. smith relationship's development as it was in the motion version, so one cannot understand where was all emma's trying of make a elton-smith match (besides of the portrait).
