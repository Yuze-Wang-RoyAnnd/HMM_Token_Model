i really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and incredulous. the first shot is a camera feed from a robot traveling towards a bomb and is, naturally, shaky. but then the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode, even during quiet conversational moments, to the point of ridiculousness. have the rental houses run out of tripods and steadicams? the fact that it was shot on 16mm doesn't help, as the entire movie is grainy as well as shaky. <br /><br />for all the effort bigelow put into accurate vehicles and equipment, there are enough glaring errors and inconsistencies that they undermine the movie's credibility. <br /><br />- a car would not erupt in flames after a single shot, and once engulfed would not be extinguished by a small hand-held extinguisher. <br /><br />- a single humvee would not be driving around baghdad in 2004, but would be backed up by other vehicles in case of breakdown or attack. - it would be exceptionally unlikely to be able to hit a running insurgent at long range, where the bullet is clearly taking over a second to reach the target. <br /><br />- i believe bombs were brought to designated disposal areas on or near a base, not some random spot in the middle of the desert. <br /><br />- the oil tanker attack is stated to have occurred in the green zone, a highly secure area that experienced very few attacks from within. the zone is mostly offices and palaces with few residences, yet it is portrayed as a dangerous warren of dark alleys and lurking insurgents. oddly, james never gets in trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering his two companions to each take an alley by themselves, thus setting up the attempted kidnapping. <br /><br />- speaking of which, the 3-man team is always depicted clearing buildings, chasing insurgents etc. on their own, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there. <br /><br />- how many hours does the team have to stare at a dead insurgent hanging out a window to figure out he's not faking it?<br /><br />there were no establishing shots to show the viewer what the size and layout of the base was or where baghdad was in relation. i had no idea who the eod team reported to, nor were any other characters fleshed out. these are things the characters would know, so we should too.<br /><br />many of the "surprises" and scenes are perfectly predictable. yes, it's obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will get into trouble with the iraqis he's trying to move along, that the choice of cereals back home will be overwhelming, and that a driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle.<br /><br />finally, there was an almost complete lack of character development. renner's character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home, is reckless and addicted to adrenalin. he's exactly the same at the end of the movie. what's the point?<br /><br />if this is indeed the best so far of the iraqi war movies, it's a sorry bunch. just based on the half hour i saw of it, i'd recommend generation kill on hbo instead.
