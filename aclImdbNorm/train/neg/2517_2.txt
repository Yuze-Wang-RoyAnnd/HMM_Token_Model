this movie is the perfect illustration of how not to make a sci fi movie. the worst tendency in sci-fi is to make your theme an awful, sophomoric, pseudo-orwellian/huxleyan/whateverian "vision" of "the human future."<br /><br />science fiction filmmakers (and authors), as geeks, take themselves very seriously given the high crap-to-good-stuff ratio of their genre. i think other genres with a high ctgsr (yes, i just made it up, relax), like horror or action or even romantic comedy, seem to have a little better grasp of the fact that they are not changing the world with some profound "message."<br /><br />sci fi can certainly be successful on a serious level, as numerous great filmmakers have proven. but there is an immense downside to the whole concept, which is represented by "robot jox," with its low-rent construction of "the future" (lone good design element: the bizarre, slick-looking billboard ads all over the place that encourage women to have more babies) and its painfully heavy-handed "iliad" parallels (he's named achilles for god's sake! i actually didn't pick up on this until i saw the film for like the tenth time, but i went to public school, so the filmmakers are not exonerated.)<br /><br />of course, if you're a crazy movie freak like me, this downside has a great upside. i absolutely love movies like this, because bad movies are quite often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones. it's kind of a lester bangs approach to movie viewing, i guess.<br /><br />note: the lead in this movie (gary graham? is that his name? i refuse to go check.) is really not that bad. he makes a go of it. he's kind of cool, especially when he's drunk/hung over.
