roman polanski has made many, many movies that are unexceptional. his fame bewilders me. nothing stands out as a high point except chinatown (i haven't seen 'knife in the water' or 'tess'). any contribution he's made to film concluded more than twenty years ago; his work is just embarrassing, safe and/or dull (the pianist, frantic, oliver twist, the ninth gate, pirates).<br /><br />r's baby must have signified the end of the establishment at the time it came out. it's lux-produced and fairly high concept for a 1968 'horror' movie (never show the baby). but this is just misconceived horror sap. everything is arty to the point that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early (um, thanks for that finale-destroying title), and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for days. it did not sustain my interest. i find that whatever this movie might have been, it is utterly derailed by the 1960's version of what femininity was. farrow is such a chronic distracted, helpless waif/housewife. her frailty is oversold... she's irritating in the extreme. there's no real ideas in it... nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil.<br /><br />the dakota is barely exploited for it eerie potential.
