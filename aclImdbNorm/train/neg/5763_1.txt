<br /><br />"step aside for hollywood veterans?" (the wayan brothers were 'asked') thats what hollyweird demanded and thats what it got. however, like so many of its recent decisions this one was a stupendous mistake.<br /><br />the director is so out of touch with todays audience, attempting to bring back physical pratfalls and gags in place of funny dialogue is just a disaster. i knew it, the audience knew it and the cast knew it.<br /><br />what a shame, why did they ever consider changing directors? not only that but the two wayan brothers played as two of four primary characters, without them its just a farce and a sad one.<br /><br />sp<br /><br />
