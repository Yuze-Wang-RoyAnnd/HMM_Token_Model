hello. this is my first review for any movie i have seen. i went through the trouble of doing this to tell everyone that this is quite literally, the most disgusting movie i have ever seen. i feel like the movie was porely made, which i will give some understanding due to budget constraints on making it. i felt like i was watching a very bad remake of the movie saw. which i can agree, saw as well is also very graphic, but, i did like the movie saw.<br /><br />the scene where he takes the hammer to the head of the tied up victim in the chair is the most disturbing scene i have seen. the scene lasted almost forever, well actually, it was probably around 5 min but still. i want to note that i like some horror movies and i do give credit if they are good. this director uwe boll, and his group of people used to make this movie should think it over before making another one similar to this one. one final note haha!! for all the people who enjoy watching animals beatin to death, letting rot, with women and children as well and a five minute scene of someone getting there head smashed in with a hammer then you will enjoy this movie, if not, and you like horror, go with a higher budget film, like saw for example. i cant believe people actually make movies like this. anyway sorry to anyone who loves uwe boll and took it to heart, this is just my opinion on the movie.
