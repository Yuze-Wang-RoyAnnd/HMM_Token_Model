not exactly a new story line, but this romantic comedy makes the concept work. a young man(john cusack) and a drop dead gorgeous woman(kate beckinsale)keep meeting by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other. although both are promised to others...oddly enough they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere. a little sappy in some places, but viva la love. being a romantic i am almost obligated to be riveted. my favorite scene is where cusack is on the ground and snow starts falling. the finale is almost too sweet, but most deserving. this is not one of cusack's deeper roles, but who in the hell could not be smitten by beckinsale. notable support is provided by jeremy piven and molly shannon. john corbett plays the worst role i've ever seen him in. on the other hand eugene levy is quirky and funny. watch this with your soul mate.
