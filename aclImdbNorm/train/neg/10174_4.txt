i saw this back in '94 when it was finally released. apparently because orion pictures was in bankruptcy, i think, the movie had not been released a couple of years earlier.<br /><br />i have problem remembering details partly because i haven't seen it in a long time, but i do remember it as a very dull movie. i kept debating whether to walk out of it. the store was not at all interesting or engaging. was a 3rd rate america graffiti imitation. <br /><br />none of the performances make it worth watching either. one of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper reviewer gave it a high rating.
