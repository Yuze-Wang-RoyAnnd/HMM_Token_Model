this is not an entirely bad movie. the plot (new house built next door seems to be haunted) is not bad, the mood is creepy enough, and the acting is okay. the big problem i had is that, being familiar with lara flynn boyle (from twin peaks and other shows), i couldn't get over how different she looks with her apparently new, big lips. i kept staring at them. they look so out of place on her face! they make her look completely different (and not better).<br /><br />mark-paul gosselaar, the actor who plays kim the architect who designs and pours his heart and soul into the house, does a fine job. and lara (as col) is also quite good (but those lips!) as the owner of the house next door. her husband, walker (colin ferguson) is appropriately wooden. the various characters who live in the house were also fine. i particularly liked pie (charlotte sullivan) and her husband, buddy (stephen amell), the first people to move into the house. the attempt to involve us in the overall neighborhood vibe fails, unfortunately, as the other neighbors are not particularly likable.<br /><br />for some reason the director was unable to make the "haunted" house particularly ominous. other movies (such as amityville horror, the legend of hell house) manage to achieve that spooky feel, but it just doesn't happen here. the closest is when col paints a depiction of the house.<br /><br />another thing that didn't work for me is the plot twist that occurs with kim, the architect. initially, he appears to be a victim of the house like the others (it has sucked him dry of inspiration), but later he seems to have joined forces with it in evil.<br /><br />overall, not a bad movie for horror fans if you can take your eyes off those big lips!
