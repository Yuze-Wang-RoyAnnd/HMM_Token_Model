i bought unhinged because i got suckered by the gory picture on the cover. if you want to see all the good parts of the movie just look on the back of the box. all the kills are shown and i can honestly tell you that they look much better in the still frames than they do in the movie.<br /><br />having said that, let's look at the plot. a group of college girls driving to a rock concert (by way of the deep, dark woods in one of the longest driving sequences ever captured on celluloid) slide off the road. no visible damage is done to the car but apparently it was enough to put one of the characters in a comatose state for the rest of the film (or perhaps she read the script and was already in a coma before filming began).<br /><br />the two remaining girls wake up in a big, isolated house. the house, by the way, is fabulous and manages more drama just by its presence than any of the actors in the film. for some reason, though, this house has no roads going to it. the only way you can get to the main road is by hiking five miles through the woods. the girls spend the rest of unhinged sitting around listening to weird conversations between an old rich bitch (who looks like george washington in drag) and her equally homely, sexually repressed daughter. the girls apparently were in no hurry to get back from that concert anyway being that they packed more clothes than the cast of gilligan's island for that three hour tour.<br /><br />by the time we, the viewers, get to the kill scenes, we no longer care. we wish that someone would kill us just to end our suffering . unhinged finally wraps up with a quite shocking ending that deserved to be in a much better film. it's almost as though the ending, the one good idea in the film, was written first and then the writers tried to make a movie leading up to it.<br /><br />unhinged is ultimately a boring film with bad acting, inept directing, and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porno film (sorry. i'm not sure where that came from). you will get an idea of how bad this movie is during the opening credits when, for some reason that is never explained, the screen goes black for about two minutes while the characters talk about nothing worth remembering. don't waste your time. you'll just feel unhinged and want your time and money back.
