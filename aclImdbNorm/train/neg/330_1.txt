i wanted to punch the tv. watching it was torture. i hated it. never watch this movie. the terrorists are annoying. adam sandler is annoying. i normally like him but not in this one. i wanted to break the dvd. this is the most irritating film in the world. the comedian he's jealous of is obnoxious. the only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls. it was so irritating i wanted to punch the tv. do not buy this movie unless you want to annoy someone. if you even like adam sandler a little bit, don't buy it. it will just make you hate him. do yourself a favor, if you see it in the store, hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it. its a waste of the $1.99 i paid for it.
