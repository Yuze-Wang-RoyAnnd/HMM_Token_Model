when people ask me whats the worst movie i've ever seen its this one. its not even close to mst3k level riffing, or midnight viewing at a theatre, or even as disney channel late night filler. the only time i've ever wanted to jump off a ride at disney world (or disney/mgm studios in this case) was to grab dick tracey's jacket off the mannequin, rip it to shreds, and ram it down the tour guides throat saying "eat this! eat this unholy coat of darkness!!!" i've never been so mad at a movie, not even "nutty professor ii: the klumps" or "flash gordon". you want pretty colors and cinematography? ain't here babe. reviewers keep saying "oh, but its too look like a comic book", well, to me, its the color of a gordito after several weeks in the sun. about as enjoyable too. beatty wanders around this landscape jumping around and talking to his watch, himself, and occasional at the other actors, hoping someone will tell him what time the sequel will begin shooting. to be fair, i have only seen this movie once, but my pain threshold is that of a man, not a god.
