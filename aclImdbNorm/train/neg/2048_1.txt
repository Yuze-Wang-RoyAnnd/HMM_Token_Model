1 is being pretty generous here. i really enjoyed boogeyman, even though it is not really the boogeyman promoted on the dvd cover and we all know it! it creeped me out. but this film, it is something else. for being directed by a guy who has been around a long time and directed a lot of movies, it looks like it was shot on a vhs camcorder by a 10 year old! the story and acting are atrocious! david hess, you have let me down too. after playing one of the most menacing villains in film history, you have resorted to this? the story and acting may have been able to be forgiven however, if anyone had taken the time to make the video look somewhat professional. there are a lot of shot on video films out there that don't look like it, or at least aren't so obvious that it detracts your attention from the film. i can't say it is the worst movie ever, because i couldn't make it through the entire film, but it is certainly close.
