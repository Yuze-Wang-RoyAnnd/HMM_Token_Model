unfortunately i have to agree with the critic written by halopes.<br /><br />for a short film the cinematography, costumes, sets, sound, editing and everything else is very, very good. this might seem surprising at first but i was told that the technical crew working on this consisted of professionals, so the quality is to be expected. the problem, as usual, resides in the story itself.<br /><br />thing is, it's not really a story. to tell a story (or in cinema's case, show a story) you need plot and conflict. you need things that happen to the protagonist: events. these events happen because the protagonist wants something and, for some reason, he can't get it. tim watcher has no problems or goals. he's a kind of supernatural entity who observes mankind. that's it. so what we have here is pure exposition. instead of being shown a story, we're simply learning things about this tim watcher individual. of course, considering the peculiar nature of tim watcher and the film's short duration, it's hard to give enough background about him so the movie resorts to voice-over narration. in this case it's used in the worst possible sense which is to give information that otherwise we'd never glean. in fact, if it wasn't for the vo we'd think the character was just a kooky old man going around looking at things. to make it worse the vo also explains what's happening on the screen! the images we're shown are just decoration for the text we're listening to.<br /><br />i could say that this short film would make a good video for a band or something, but because the images don't stand on their own it's impossible to say that. what's left obviously has value as a measure of the crew's technical capabilities (not incredible, but good) but fails to entertain, amuse, thrill or, at the very least, show a story.
