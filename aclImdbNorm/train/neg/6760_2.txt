renown writer mark redfield (as edgar allen poe) tries to conquer old addictions and start a new life for himself, as a baltimore, maryland magazine publisher. however, blackouts, delirium, and rejection threaten to thwart his efforts. he would also like to rekindle romance with an old sweetheart, a significantly flawed prospect, as things turns out. mr. redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious last days of edgar allen poe. redfield employs a lot of black and white, color, and trick photography to create mood. kevin g. shinnick (as dr. john moran) performs well, relatively speaking. it's not enough.
