my comments may be a bit of a spoiler, for what it's worth. stop now if you care enough....<br /><br />saving grace should have been titled "a paper-thin excuse for old british women to get high on-screen." this film is dumb. the incidental music is an annoyance as are the obvious, hackneyed tunes that sporadically pop up to comment on the narrative ("spirit in the sky," for example - oh, i get it!) this is basically a cheech and chong movie made credible by its stodgy english setting and brenda blethyn's overwhelming power to inflict emotion on an audience using her voice alone. i could literally hear the folks over at high times magazine receiving their jollies over the enormous "buds" that litter this picture. worst scene? easy. brenda attempts to peddle her illicit wares on the street of london in a blaring white dress-suit. not funny. not original. not interesting. not a good movie. the 7.2 rating is the result of zealots over-voting. don't waste your time...
