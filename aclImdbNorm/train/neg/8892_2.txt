have to admit, this version disgraces shakespeare upfront! none can act except the nurse who was my fav! juliet had good skills as a teen but she can't give emotional depth to her lines and we really can never connect to her. she's worse doing the scene when she is contemplating drinking the sleeping potion...god stop whining! i would have poured it in her mouth to shut her up! anthony andrews...yikes! considering his other great movies (brideshead revisited, ivanhoe, scarlet pimpernel), he's quite a shocker in this one. and don't get me started on romeo...puhleasssssee! it's still good to see if you're on the hunt to see every romeo and juliet ever made in the history of film. olivia and leonard's version is still the best, followed by leslie howard's version and then the current leo and clare!
