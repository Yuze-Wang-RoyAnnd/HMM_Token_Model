revenge on us the viewing public perhaps. i sat through this 2 hour movie and i was waiting for the second act to kick in so that the movie lived up to its title. but costner never avenges his lovers fate she dies and the movie ends. i was left wondering where the rest of the movie was. if a movie is called revenge then the hero better get some by the end of the film. i had a choice of seeing this or black rain at the cinema thankfully i saw the other brothers movie at the cinema instead.i caught up with this turkey on video. there was one good thing about the film and was its beautiful theme tune. listen to the cd.dont watch this its awful. 1 out of 10
