i have to say i was very curious on viewing this film, and it was considered a notorious disaster when released by 20th century fox in 1970. it has also popped up on several critics lists of bad films, and this only deepened an interest, as i just had to see what made this movie so bad.upon seeing it, i think i have my answers. although i will say it does make for curious viewing, the acting, direction, and script are so laughingly bad, that the supposed satire is completely missing. racquel welch seems to try to carry the film, but after the opening sequence of the sex-change operation, the film goes so far down hill that she cannot handle this task alone. john huston as uncle buck loner is certainly no help, as he licks and leers at the screen, he sometimes looks like he wonders himself what he's doing there. rex reed bounces around as myron, myra's alter ego, and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene. bravo for debut performances! farrah fawcett plays a dumb blonde; she certainly seemed convincing in this role. but , of course, arguably the most notorious role went to mae west. the sight of a 75 year old woman with a plastic face making sexual innuendos seemed more suitable for a horror film. i don't mean to put this cast down personally; but in this film, no one comes out looking good. the direction seems so unassured and non-existent, that the film is not only bad, but boring as well. throw in some old film footage of old stars, and the movie becomes even more disconnected. to each his own to anyone that enjoyed this, and i was glad i at least saw it, but myra breckenridge seems to be the disaster that it was always reputed to be from the beginning.
