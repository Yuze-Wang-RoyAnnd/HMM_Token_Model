mary pickford becomes the chieftain of a scottish clan after the death of her father, and then has a romance. as fellow commenter snow leopard said, the film is rather episodic to begin. some of it is amusing, such as pickford whipping her clansmen to church, while some of it is just there. all in all, the story is weak, especially the recycled, contrived romance plot-line and its climax. the transfer is so dark it's difficult to appreciate the scenery, but even accounting for that, this doesn't appear to be director maurice tourneur's best work. pickford and tourneur collaborated once more in the somewhat more accessible 'the poor little rich girl,' typecasting pickford as a child character.
