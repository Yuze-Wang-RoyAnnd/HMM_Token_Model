well then, thank you so much disney for destroying the fond memories i used to have of my former favorite movie. i was about 5 when the original movie came out, and it was one of the first movies i remember seeing. so, now that i'm 16, and feeling masochistic enough, i decided to rent this movie. thus, i managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this sorry excuse for a movie. this movie takes everything that made the original endearing and wrecks it, right down to the last detail.<br /><br />in this movie, ariel and eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, melody, and go to show her to everyone in the ocean...broadway style! after the musical number ends, within minutes, the sea witch morgana shows up and threatens to kill melody if triton doesn't give up the trident. thus, he gives it up without even a fight. eric stands there gaping, though ariel figures out how to use a sword and save melody. morgana escapes, so ariel and eric decide that melody should never go near the sea until morgana is caught.<br /><br />well...uh, nothing of note really happens. eric is a total wuss. he never really manages to do anything. ariel sort of does something. melody manages to screw things up. plus, the animation is a new low-point for disney. the computer graphics wind up clashing with the backgrounds. ever single opportunity for character development is wasted. the songs bite.<br /><br />look, don't waste your time. i'm pretty sure even the little kids are going to be bored out of their skulls with this, since nothing even remotely exciting ever happens. they won't want to sing the songs. if you manage to grab a copy of this, throw it out into the ocean and hope that nobody ever finds it. ever.
