this has got to be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself.i first saw the trailer in 1991, it looked great.since then i have always wanted to see it but could never find it.....until today, yes, 14 years later.<br /><br />lets just say i was so disappointed its unreal, ok i knew it wouldn't be an oscar winner but still had hopes that it would be a fun no-brain film in the bloodsport mold. unfortunately it was not, it's pooh<br /><br />whats with all the american rock and roll music and the acting was so bad it was quite frightening.<br /><br />the fight scenes were rubbish and look fake.<br /><br />this dvd only cost me lb5 and i believe i was overcharged by lb7<br /><br />now i'm sad as i know that i will never get that hour and a half back.
