the plot for descent, if it actually can be called a plot, has two noteworthy events. one near the beginning - one at the end. together these events make up maybe 5% of the total movie time. everything (and i mean _everything_) in between is basically the director's desperate effort to fill in the minutes. i like disturbing movies, i like dark movies and i don't get troubled by gritty scenes - but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy/dark (literally) scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming. rosario dawson, one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here. and no, she doesn't get naked, not even in the nc-17 version, which i saw.<br /><br />if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch "descent", take a nap instead - you'll probably have more interesting dreams.
