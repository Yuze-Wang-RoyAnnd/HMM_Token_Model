i have given this show (i have only watched seven episodes) four stars because most of her jokes/set-ups appear to fail. some are not funny outright, but some are amusing -- in a 12 year old boy kind of way. she reminds me of that new york painter who throws paint upon a canvas, calls it art and sells it for a lot of money. silverman throws out what she's got, including the kitchen sink, while she prays that a few things stick to the wall in her effort to be funny but different.<br /><br />however what she's "got" often times is not enough, as though she lacks the kind of follow-through a good comedian needs to succeed.<br /><br />the whole enterprise is like an under done potato.
