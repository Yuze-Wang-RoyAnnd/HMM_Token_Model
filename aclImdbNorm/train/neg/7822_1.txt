this movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classical theme. i used to love superman movies, but this one made me want to shoot myself. very poor acting, outrageous special effects, and a plot equal to zero. to summarize : superman leaves earth, because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet, some were in space (duh) , doesn't tell his girlfriend anything before leaving (duh again), takes off in a spaceship (?!?),comes back i think 5 years later, and look forward to hooking up with his girlfriend again (who is now razing his son, which son, in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old). and what about that lex luthor ? trying to grow a new continent in order to sell land ? please !!<br /><br />i vote 1 out of 10 for this movie, only because i am not allowed to vote 0. if you have anything else to do with your time, don't go to see this movie, and even if you don't have anything else to do, stay home and watch tv !
