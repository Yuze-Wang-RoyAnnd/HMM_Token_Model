this is the result. a piece of trash movie that doesn't deserve to even be classified as a movie, it's just a bunch of stuff on a film reel, that makes no sense whatsoever. well back to the actors, which from the get go seem to be just a bunch of friends who thought they would get a little amount of money together and try to make a movie that would be a great horror film. well it's a great horror anyway, nevermind being a film. there's plenty of horrific acting in "hobgoblins," but the worse is the main guy named richard, who is just way too much of a weakling to even sorta root for. well, when you cast a bunch of friends and try to make the film scary, on a less than shoestring budget, no less, this is what will happen. oh well at least the mst3k version was hilarious. but this is still a horrid movie, that deserves all the bashing it gets. 9 for the mst version.
