as i said, the book was pretty good and this might have been a good movie if melissa gilbert hadn't been so horrible and unbelievable in the lead roll. what kind of accent was that suppose to be anyway? it sounded the same as her horrible russian accent in another movie that i have seen her in. every time she opened her mouth i cringed. it took 3 tries before i was able to watch the entire movie. brad johnson was good as the other lead. <br /><br />i really liked the beach location scenes. they added some much needed brightness to take your mind off of melissa gilberts depressing portrayal. i think they could have used san francisco views more to their advantage though. it looked like the night scenes were actually sf, but i could be wrong. i don't recall the character in the book being this depressing. <br /><br />please keep melissa gilbert out of any future movies that require an accent!
