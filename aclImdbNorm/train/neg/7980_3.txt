this service comedy, for which peter marshall (joanne dru's brother and later perennial host of the hollywood squares) and tommy noonan were hyped as 'the new lewis and martin' is just shy of dreadful: a few random sight gags are inserted, everyone talks fast and nothing works quite right -- there's one scene in which noonan is throwing grenades at officers and politicians in anger; they're about five feet apart, noonan is throwing them in between, and the total reaction is that everyone flinches.<br /><br />in the midst of an awfulness relieved only by the fetching julie newmar, there are a few moments of brightness: marshall and noonan engage in occasional bouts of double talk and argufying, and their timing is nigh unto perfect -- clearly they were a well honed comedy pair.<br /><br />it isn't enough to save this turkey, alas.
