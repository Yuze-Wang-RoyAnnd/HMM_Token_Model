watching josh kornbluth 'act' in this movie reminds me of my freshman tv production class, where the 'not funny' had the chance to prove just how unfunny they really were!<br /><br />obvious is the word that comes to mind when i try to synopsize this wannabe comedy. the jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed. the delivery is painfully bad. ouch!!!!!!! the writing is simply dorkish. it is akin to a bob saget show. <br /><br />watching this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour long saturday night live skit (post belushi). <br /><br />i hated this movie and want my money back!!!
