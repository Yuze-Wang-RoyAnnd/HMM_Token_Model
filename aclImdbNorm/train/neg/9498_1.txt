when i look for new cars, i expect not to be shown boats. when i drink fountain coke, i should expect that the drink contains coke. when i watch a movie that embellishes itself with the name of en excellent scientist, i expect that it is in some way relevant to that person or their work. this could have been people discussing my grannys' diary. the material covered is relevant only in that they vaguely tirade science. i fell asleep the first time i tried to watch it, & the second time i stopped watching it.<br /><br />i love science & documentaries. i would rather watch them over the latest blockbuster. however this falls far short of providing anything worth your time
