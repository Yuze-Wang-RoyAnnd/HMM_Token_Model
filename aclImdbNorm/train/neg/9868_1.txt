i almost never comment on movies, but i saw the 5 glowing reviews of this "movie" and decided i had to weigh in with my own review. an instructor of mine received this film in the mail, mixed in with his academy screeners (ampas, aka the guys who vote on the oscars), and was so floored with how terribly constructed this movie was that he brought it in to our class to demonstrate to us how not to put together a movie.<br /><br />this film has no plot, the scenes are horribly, horribly edited (oftentimes using faux "24" style picture-in-picture techniques), and the performances (particularly the lead, who even fails at acting like a bad actress) are for the most part, obnoxious. someone truly failed to understand the point of an introduction, namely, the setting up of the plot. there is no setup! halfway through the movie neither myself nor the rest of the class knew what this movie was supposed to be about. the opening crane shot, which sets up some kind of murder, is never addressed, and now that i think about it, was possibly meant to be a flash-forward, with the rest of the film being a flashback, but it cuts from that scene directly to the next without any indication as such.<br /><br />bah, i could really go on and on. at the very least, this movie gives me renewed confidence in my own film-making ability.
