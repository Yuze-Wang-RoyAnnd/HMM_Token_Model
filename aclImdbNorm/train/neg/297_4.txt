for the record, this film is intriguing but its hardly original. back in 1998 a movie starring talia shire called the landlady had almost the exact same plot but with younger characters.<br /><br />the story is amanda lear has had a bad life, abusive father, horny doctor, mental homes, etc. she's finally released from the happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctor...who she anally abuses and kills the poor guy. (now that was original) the doctor had financed a mansion for her before she killed him and buried the sucker in the backyard. after moving in she falls in love with a stud named richard, who just happens to be married to a blues singer. if you've seen the landlady you know the rest, she kills or tries to kill anyone that gets in between her and richard (including a roadie).<br /><br />much of the idea's came from the previous movie, same idiot sidekick that sticks his nose in, same spying on the guy with a bowl of popcorn, same flying a bodypress. it did have some original material, the beer bottle thing was brutal. the highlight of the movie was amanda's beautiful breasts in the hot-top scene. somewhat of a ripoff but not a total waste of time.<br /><br />4 out of 10
