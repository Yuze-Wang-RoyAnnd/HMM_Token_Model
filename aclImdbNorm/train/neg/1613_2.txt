now that che(2008) has finished its relatively short australian cinema run (extremely limited release:1 screen in sydney, after 6wks), i can guiltlessly join both hosts of "at the movies" in taking steven soderbergh to task.<br /><br />it's usually satisfying to watch a film director change his style/subject, but soderbergh's most recent stinker, the girlfriend experience(2009), was also missing a story, so narrative (and editing?) seem to suddenly be soderbergh's main challenge. strange, after 20-odd years in the business. he was probably never much good at narrative, just hid it well inside "edgy" projects.<br /><br />none of this excuses him this present, almost diabolical failure. as david stratton warns, "two parts of che don't (even) make a whole". <br /><br />epic biopic in name only, che(2008) barely qualifies as a feature film! it certainly has no legs, inasmuch as except for its uncharacteristic ultimate resolution forced upon it by history, soderbergh's 4.5hrs-long dirge just goes nowhere.<br /><br />even margaret pomeranz, the more forgiving of australia's at the movies duo, noted about soderbergh's repetitious waste of (hd digital storage): "you're in the woods...you're in the woods...you're in the woods...". i too am surprised soderbergh didn't give us another 2.5hrs of that somewhere between his existing two parts, because he still left out massive chunks of che's "revolutionary" life! <br /><br />for a biopic of an important but infamous historical figure, soderbergh unaccountably alienates, if not deliberately insults, his audiences by<br /><br />1. never providing most of che's story; <br /><br />2. imposing unreasonable film lengths with mere dullard repetition; <br /><br />3. ignoring both true hindsight and a narrative of events; <br /><br />4. barely developing an idea, or a character; <br /><br />5. remaining claustrophobically episodic; <br /><br />6. ignoring proper context for scenes---whatever we do get is mired in disruptive timeshifts; <br /><br />7. linguistically dislocating all audiences (even spanish-speakers will be confused by the incongruous expositions in english); and <br /><br />8. pointlessly whitewashing his main subject into one dimension. why, at this late stage? the t-shirt franchise has been a success! <br /><br />our sense of claustrophobia is surely due to peter buchman and benjamin vander veen basing their screenplay solely on guevara's memoirs. so, like a poor student who has read only one of his allotted texts for his assignment, soderbergh's product is exceedingly limited in perspective.<br /><br />the audience is held captive within the same constrained knowledge, scenery and circumstances of the "revolutionaries", but that doesn't elicit our sympathy. instead, it dawns on us that "ah, soderbergh's trying to hobble his audiences the same as the latino peasants were at the time". but these are the same illiterate latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies. why does soderbergh feel the need to equate us with them, and keep us equally mentally captive? such audience straitjacketing must have a purpose.<br /><br />part2 is more chronological than part1, but it's literally mind-numbing with its repetitive bush-bashing, misery of outlook, and lack of variety or character arcs. deltoro's che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to educate his own ill-disciplined troops. the only letup is the humour as che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant "revolutionaries", some of whom violently lack self-control around local peasants or food. we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions, nor any strategic analyses of their guerrilla insurgency, such as it was.<br /><br />part2's excruciating countdown remains fearfully episodic: again, nothing is telegraphed or contextualized. thus even the scenes with fidel castro (demi'an bichir) are unexpected and disconcerting. any selected events are portrayed minimally and latino-centrically, with part1's interviews replaced by time-shifting meetings between the corrupt bolivian president (joaquim de almeida) and us government officials promising cia intervention(!).<br /><br />the rest of part2's "woods" and day-for-night blue filter just exasperate the audience until they're eyeing the exits.<br /><br />perhaps deltoro felt too keenly the frustration of many non-american latinos about never getting a truthful, unspun history of che's exploits within their own countries. when foreign governments still won't deliver a free press to their people--for whatever reason--then one can see how a popular american indie producer might set out to entice the not-so-well-read ("i may not be able to read or write, but i'm not illiterate!"--cf.the inspector general(1949)) out to their own local cinemas. the film's obvious neglects and gross over-simplifications hint very strongly that it's aiming only at the comprehensions of the less-informed who still speak little english. if they did, they'd have read tomes on the subject already, and critiqued the relevant social issues amongst themselves--learning the lessons of history as they should.<br /><br />such insights are precisely what societies still need--and not just the remaining illiterate latinos of central and south america--yet it's what che(2008) gleefully fails to deliver. soderbergh buries his lead because he's weak on narrative. i am gobsmacked why benicio deltoro deliberately chose soderbergh for this project if he knew this. it's been 44yrs, hindsight about guevara was sorely wanted: it's what i went to see this film for, but the director diabolically robs us of that.<br /><br />david stratton, writing in the australian (03-oct-2009) observed that while part1 was "uneven", part2 actually "goes rapidly downhill" from there, "charting che's final campaign in bolivia in excruciating detail", which "...feels almost unbearably slow and turgid".<br /><br />che:the guerilla aka part2 is certainly no travelogue for bolivia, painting it a picture of misery and atavism. the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour, and the dramatic--yet tragic--capture and execution of the film's subject.<br /><br />the rest of this interminable cinema verite is just confusing, irritating misery--shockingly, for a soderbergh film, to be avoided at all costs. it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a smattering about the subject.(2/10)
