there are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the movie's trailer. i am trying to be balanced in my review because i strongly support local movies, but i can't help but support the backlash against this movie. it is slow, boring and bordering on pointless. even the "almost nice and believable moments" were immediately undercut by painful clich'es and bad acting. vernetta lopez and wong li lin, whom i usually love, were only passable in this movie. it felt like the director was trying to make a melodramatic tv soap, then got carried away and decided to put it on the big screen. the leap years should come with an ra rating (rated awful) but it hasn't changed my faith in local movies. more good films will come, so long as more films like these don't get made.
