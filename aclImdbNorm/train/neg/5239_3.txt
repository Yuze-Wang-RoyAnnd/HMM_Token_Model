i watched this film based on the very favorable reviews that i read about it here by others.<br /><br />they definitely saw something in this movie i didn't see, that's for sure.<br /><br />the movie starts off at a good pace, and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it are interesting, then it begins to get logged down and draggy, not to mention completely unbelievable.<br /><br />eventually you find yourself saying: "what?!? he's going to do that too? just how far is he going to go with this thing?"<br /><br />the plot begins with jeff goldblum's character, john, going into a deli to purchase a bottle of wine. there is a robbery and a new store clerk, auggie rose, gets killed during the robbery. <br /><br />john gets in the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy. this seems a little much, but wait, there's more.<br /><br />john becomes totally obsessed with auggie rose. <br /><br />for reasons that never make any kind of logical sense, john, who has a very good life, a beautiful, loving girlfriend, a secure, well-paying job, nice house, nice car, expensive suits--decides he wants to be a loser like auggie rose was, and experience life in a low paying job, living in a dump with a dippy girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous people.<br /><br />why this dim-witted, half-baked film got favorable reviews i'll never know. sure goldblum does a good acting job - he always does - and his looks have improved with age -- but unless you have a big infatuation with jeff goldblum and have to see every film he's in, i wouldn't recommend this turkey. it's approximately two hours of your life you're not going to get back - and believe me - you'll have nothing to be thankful about when those two hours are over, other than being grateful you're not still sitting there watching this film!<br /><br />
