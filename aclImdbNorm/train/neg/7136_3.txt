"a total waste of time" just throw in a few explosions, non stop fighting, exotic cars a deranged millionaire, slow motion computer generated car crashes and last but not least a hugh hefner like character with wall to wall hot babes, and mix in a blender and you will have this sorry excuse for a movie. i really got a laugh out of the "dr. evil" like heavily fortified compound. the plot was somewhere between preposterous and non existent. how many millionaires are willing to make a 25 million dollar bet on a car race? answer: 4 but, didn't they become millionaires through fiscal responsibility? this was written for pubescent males, it plays like a video game. i did enjoy the gulfstream ii landing in the desert though.
