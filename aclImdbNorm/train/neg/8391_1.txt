well...now that i know where rob zombie stole the title for his "house of 1,000 corpses" crapfest, i can now rest in peace. nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in "the house of seven corpses," but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot (ha!) anyway, to kill the bloody amateurs making a low-rent horror flick in his former abode! in hell house (sorry, i don't remember the actual name of the residence), a bunch of mysterious, unexplained deaths took place long ago; some, like arthritic lurch stand-in john carradine (whose small role provides the film's only worthwhile moments), attribute it to the supernatural; bellowing film director john ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum. the result comes across like "satan's school for girls" (catchy title; made-for-tv production values; intriguing plot) crossed with "children shouldn't play with dead things" (low-rent movie about low-rent movie makers who wake the dead); trouble is, it's nowhere near as entertaining or fun. "the house of seven corpses" is dead at frame one, and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis, dragging us along for every aching second...
