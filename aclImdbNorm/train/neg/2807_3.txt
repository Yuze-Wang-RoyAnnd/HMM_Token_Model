michael callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems, nonetheless, to be regarded as a perfect "catch" by any woman that runs across him; could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced the film? he's a "hero" whom it's very difficult to empathize with, so the movie is in trouble right from the start. however, it's troubles don't end there. it has the production values of a tv-movie (check out that head made of clay or something, near the end), and the ending cheats in a way that i can't reveal, in case anyone wants to see the movie (highly unlikely). let's just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows.
