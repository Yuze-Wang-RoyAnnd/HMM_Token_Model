in an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs like scary movie and shriek if you know what i did last friday the 13th, valentine fails. why did people like halloween? because it was original, new and went beyond anything that's ever been done. why did they like scream? because at least it made sense. valentine is just a stupid slasher-flick that has hardly any gore what so-ever. the plot is so similar to halloween and urban legend it's not funny. and the moment the killer comes on screen, you know who it is, it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable. the teen slasher genre is dead get over it!<br /><br />0 out of 10
