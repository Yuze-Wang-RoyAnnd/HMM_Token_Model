an unoriginal, overly predictable and only mildly entertaining low budget rehash of a sci-fi formula that we've all seen a hundred times before - a group of scientists in isolation confronting some unknown alien something, and in of all places (surprise, surprise) antarctica!<br /><br />the film features james spader and an almost nameless supporting cast (with the exception of carl lewis, who's actually not that bad for a non-actor) - who deliver ho-hum performances that do little to invigorate the script's unimaginative dialogue. to make things worse the film's pace is slow, there's almost no subplot, and the few action sequences are stereotypical and not that exciting. its little wonder that this thing went straight to dvd. what is a wonder is why spader - an excellent actor at times, who won the cannes best actor award for `sex, lies and videotape', and did a splendid job in the innovative sci-fi flick `stargate' - chose to sign onto this lackluster project. or maybe not, if you look at his career, for it seems he has invested his talents in more misses than hits.<br /><br />the most remarkable thing about `alien hunter' is how they managed to cram in so many elements from so many great sci-fi films, and still have the thing turn out so listless and contrived. there are huge borrowed bits from `the thing' (both howard hawks' original and john carpenter's excellent 1982 remake), `contact' and `outbreak'; a few hints of `alien', ce3k', `the andromeda strain', `kubrick's `2001' (i.e. the `alien black box') and `mission to mars' (i.e. the mystery message); and even a little dash of `sneakers' and `a remarkable mind' (although not sci-fi films, they share a `cryptology' connection). hell, there's even cornfields and antarctica, just like the recent `x files movie'. and the luminous translucent spaceship at the end looks exactly like something that was plucked from an outtake from `the abyss'.<br /><br />its all been done before and done a whole lot better, although i will admit there were a few mild surprises towards the end. i could say a little bit more about the plot, but there's absolutely no need. you already know over half this movie without ever seeing it.
