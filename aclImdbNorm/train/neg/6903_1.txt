probably new zealands worst movie ever made<br /><br />the jokes they are not funny. used from other movies & just plain corny the acting is bad even though there is a great cast<br /><br />the story is uninteresting & boring has more cheese then pizza huts cheese lovers pizza kind of like the acting has been do 1,000 times before<br /><br />i watched this when it came on tv but was so boring could only stand 30 minutes of it. <br /><br />this movie sucks<br /><br />do not watch it, <br /><br />watch paint dry instead
