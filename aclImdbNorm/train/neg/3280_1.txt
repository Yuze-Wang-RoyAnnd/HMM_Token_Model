i wont go and give them my 10 bucks i went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best. at least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without me worrying about what they are seeing. i have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather watch the original. and she thinks jessica simpson is a horrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like a slut than daisy duke. those shorts she might as well not be wearing anything at all. and since when is american pie have anything to do with the dukes shame on them for putting that nasty line in there about having sex with a car. that in itself should have gotten the movie a r rating. the only good thing that might come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals. lets all hope. so the people out there that went and seen the movie will see how it should have looked
