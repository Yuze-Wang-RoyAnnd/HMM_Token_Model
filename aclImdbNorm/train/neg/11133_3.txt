except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads, this movie is really, really bad. the cheap production values don't help. of course, you wouldn't really notice that the production values are cheap if they didn't keep trying to convince you they had a production values to begin with. even for a b-movie genre freak like myself, this movie really sucks.
