well, how do you even rate a movie such as this one? does it even have cinematic value really? it's a movie that tries to get as close to being a snuff movie as possible. basically the entire movie is purely a bunch of guys torturing a young girl. not very appealing and on top of that also not that realistic really.<br /><br />it's obvious that the movie tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible. however the movie is just all too fake for that to work out as intended. the slapping and stumping is all soft and fake looking, as well as sounding. they are often just kicking into the floor, rather than into the girl, obviously. also the way the girl responds to all the torments is pretty tame. i mean if this was real, surely she would had screamed it out. there is more moaning than screaming in this one though.<br /><br />the movie is obviously low budget and it's a valor attempt at trying to achieve something shocking and realistic as well as original and provoking, with very limited resources. don't really think this movie made much impact though at the time it got released, though it must had done something well, since a total of six sequels got released after this one.<br /><br />fans of shock and gore will most likely be disappointed by this movie, though there are still some fetish people out there who will get a kick out of this movie.<br /><br />4/10
