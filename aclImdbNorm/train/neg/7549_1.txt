if edward woodward was the the flicks watching this film then that's what he would scream out in horror. <br /><br />i'm sorry folks but enough's enough. we had get carter, the italian job, alfie and now this. what's the similarities? no. it's not exactly a coincidence that three of the originals star maurice micklewhite and the other stars another great british actor. the main common ingredient in those originals is the britishness of the films. they weren't made to impress hollywood. they were quirky english films with a unique charm/atmosphere that just cannot be replicated in the usa. the word is cult and what better way to destroy a cult film than to bastardise it with a remake or even a sequel. <br /><br />wicker 06 had a tough task before it even hit the road. wicker 73 is even more enigmatic that other said cult films; it defies genre, intelligent scripts, a-grade actors, the music score, set-pieces that defy description and all the stories surrounding the film.<br /><br />so here comes a remake. don't worry. no originals were harmed in the making of this remake. some major aspects of the story needed to be reworked for the modern usa - communications, paganism, virgins. but that's just about the whole premise. so we give the cop a nam style trauma past complete with shock music flashbacks for the cheap scares. then with no mobile phone mast on the island that sorts the communication out - but in the real world this wouldn't happen. cops just don't go missing. give him a blood link for motivation rather than the clash of beliefs and you have the remake. wafer thin though, isn't it?<br /><br />it's just that it was all laid on with a trowel. the name alterations were simply hammy, almost carry on, there was no sense of community on the island, no centre of town to catch your bearings, just a few houses dotted about a forest and that was it. willow was just annoying by not giving out any info at all and cage was useless to let her get away with it. when he went into the well you just knew he would get locked it. the screenplay was signposted all the way to the end - and you just wanted it to hurry up and end. the epilogue was absolutely hilarious and didn't know when to stop. <br /><br />that ending is probably the best way to summarise the difference between the two. one ends in the most beautiful sunset after the most horrific day. the other ends with a post-production explain-it-all-to-the-thickies type conclusion.<br /><br />i loved the original but went to the cinema with an open mind and was excited to see the film. i left thankful in the knowledge that this film will probably end up beneath a highway somewhere only this time mercifully forgotten forever.
