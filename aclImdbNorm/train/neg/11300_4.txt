1st watched 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (dir - harold young): the 3rd universal mummy movie is about the same as the first two as far as the final result from the viewer's perspective. the story is similar and the results are ho-hum. this time the story's location is the u.s. as the egyptian priest's new follower sends a mummy to our country in hopes he can revive him to kill descendants of those who opened the original tomb. this time the mummy is played by lon chaney(which doesn't make much of a difference because he's really not asked to do much acting for this character). the new priest becomes a morgue-keeper in the town and sends the mummy out to do his dirty deeds after feeding him the tanna leaf juice. again, a girl gets in the way, as the priest falls for one of the descendent's fianc'e and wants her, yes--- to be immortal with him(haven't we heard this before?). the plan is, of course, thwarted as the townsfolk hunt down the mummy with torches(similar to the frankenstein monster) and the burning of the creature ends the story...how do they get a sequel?? i guess you'll find out with the next one in the series ?? or not.....
