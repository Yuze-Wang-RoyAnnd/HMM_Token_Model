it's pretty clear that the director and production crew set out to paint a less than flattering picture of the palestinian girl and her family. the film and it's website tries to imply that ayat has a secret reason for blowing herself and rachel up- a boyfriend problem- perhaps pregnancy. neatly glossed over is the fact that ayat had herself just witnessed the death of a close friend at the hands of the israelis'-just outside her home. gosh,so why on earth would a young, pretty, intelligent girl with plans for college go and do such a thing? could it be that the hormonal, emotional teenager was traumatized by seeing seeing someone she loved die before her very eyes? this detail merits all of 5 seconds in the movie. another neatly sidestepped detail is that avigail levy, rachels' mother, could have prevented the destruction of the building the akhras family lived in(along with 22 other families). one distinctly gets the impression that she's offering this as a "concession" - should mrs. akhras agree to speak with her."why should i?" she says.(since the movie was made the home has been destroyed- apparently the interview didn't result in what she wanted- so bring on the bulldozers)mrs levy claimed that she "wanted the movie to be cathartic as well as a symbol of hope, a chance to transcend entrenched hatreds"- instead she uses it as an excuse to harangue ayats mother, while dangling the house as a carrot.moreover although the two women live only 4 miles apart, she is so out of touch with the realities of the occupation for her palestinian neighbors, that she really thinks that mrs. akhras can just drop over for a cup of coffee?please.and she forgoes the one chance she had to meet mrs. akhras in person and see what kind of life she lives.(the akras family originally came from jaffa, but now live crammed into a refugee camp only 4 miles from where the levys live in comparative luxury.any sympathy i would have had for the obviously well to do mrs. levy is dissolved by her air of self-righteous bitchiness.by contrast, ayats mother comes off as kind,forthright and loving- in spite of the best efforts by the post production crew to paint her and her family as monsters. heck even the music and sound design was one sided- i guess the muezzin sings all day every day 4 miles from the levy family home, always in a sharply contrasting key from the sappy new-age music that scores this drab excuse for a documentary.also there is the small matter of translations - mrs. levy directly addresses the camera in english when she has something worked out to say ahead of time, hebrew when she doesn't. mrs.akhras spoke only arabic which received sometimes a translation, sometimes transliteration, always awkward, and very suspect for a supposedly objective movie.they also "sweated" her under the lights, while mrs. levy sat in (air conditioned) comfort.rotten editing for mrs. akhras' segments too. i gave it a 2 because i liked ayats mother and father, who seemed like good decent people. shame on hbo, producers and director, for releasing such a stink-bomb.
