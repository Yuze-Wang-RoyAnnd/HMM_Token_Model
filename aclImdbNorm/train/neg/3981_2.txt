this movie really has no beginning or end. and it's really very unbelievable. mary-k and ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailing room for an italian fashion company. but, for some reason, they're put up in a 5-star hotel (conveniently located across the street from the coliseum), and all of the other interns they work with are just as abnormally model-looking as they are. one thing that i found obvious in this movie is the way that one of the twins doesn't end up with the guy. i guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit. nice try.
