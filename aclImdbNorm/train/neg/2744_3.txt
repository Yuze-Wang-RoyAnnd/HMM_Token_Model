i was bored, around 10pm, so i watched this movie. and i could not stop laughing. everything was so ridiculous. the way the kids were acting like they were older than 11 just cracked me up. one of the kids had a ring, that supposedly killed people after 3 or so years. it gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster.<br /><br />it's pretty hard to take little kids seriously, especially when it has to do with eating worms. they act like everything is such a big deal, like if billy (the main character) doesn't eat the worms then the world will end.<br /><br />this is a good movie for little kids (excluding the fact that a 5 year old says 'penis'), but not for teens or adults who don't want to waste their time.
