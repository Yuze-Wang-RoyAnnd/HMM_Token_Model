wow what a great premise for a film : set it around a film maker with writer`s block who decides to take up tango lessons . hey and what an even better idea cast the central role to a film maker who`s interested in tango. gosh i wish i had that knack for genius . yes i`m being sarcastic.<br /><br />it amazes me that these type of zero potential for making money movies are made . come on unless you`re a rabid tango fan ( i do concede they do exist judging by the comments ) or a die hard member of the sally potter fan club ( ? ) there`s nothing in this film that will make you rush off to the cinema to see it . even if you`re into tango much of the film is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house getting renovated or a man in wheelchair going along a road <br /><br />coming soon the review lesson where a failed screenwriter from scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but highly entertaining reviews of films he`s seen . gasp in shock as theo robertson puts the boot into the latest hollywood blockbusters , weep in sympathy as he gets yet another rejection letter from a film company , fall in lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well toned body . the review lesson coming soon to a cinema near you if anyone is stupid enough to fund the movie<br /><br />ps sally potter is unrelated to harry potter
