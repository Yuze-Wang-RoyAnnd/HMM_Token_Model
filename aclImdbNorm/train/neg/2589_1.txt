for those with little time on their hands, i'll sum it up quickly, in one word...pathetic. there are a lot of good examples as to why this movie fits perfectly under that description. so much so that you can barely go through 2 minutes of screen time without seeing something completely stupid and pointless forced upon you. want a fully naked woman in the first 10 minutes? you got it! the reason she appears is so pointless though that it really sets the tone for the rest of this piece of juvenile crap. you can almost glimpse into the deluded minds of the 12 year old boys that wrote this piece of garbage just by watching this crap that they expect the public to actually pay for!!??!!! <br /><br />i've watched many a movie franchise decline over the years, but american pie;beta house has to be one of the worst offenders when you consider that despite the average nature of the original movie, it's still a thousand times funnier than this dreck.<br /><br />the plot is predictable, and sometimes you actually feel like you're watching a school play. the things that happen in this movie are so unrealistic that it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to actually watch it (we're talking star wars levels of suspension, like the kind you need to convince yourself jar jar is real)<br /><br />the plot is paper thin and mostly the events that transpire are only there to show another pair of breasts or set up yet another pathetic joke. there is no acting talent to speak of, all you get is a bunch of pretty boys trying to make us laugh. and ohhh how they fail!!!! every gag falls flat and the only thing i laughed at was how socially unaware the scriptwriters appear to be. how else can you explain the bulls**t they try to pass off as a story?<br /><br />they pass up every opportunity to do something worthwhile and entertaining in favour of badly written, lowest common denominator nonsense. the characters have to complete a set number of tasks before they are accepted as members of beta house, but this is dealt with mostly by a series of very brief montages that imply that they are completing the tasks but we see little to no evidence of it actually happening. its a very lazy way of telling a story. it also misses opportunities to be funny in doing so.(imagine say the wizard of oz where all the important events happened offscreen instead of on it, and all we see is dorothy high-fiving the scarecrow every now and again and saying "gee that sure was a great adventure we just had back then") lazy. lazy. lazy!!!!<br /><br />the female characters have little or nothing to say. all they do is get naked for no apparent reason and are used as visual props through most of the movie. you braindeads that only seek t&a will not be disappointed, but for that reason alone shame on you. if you buy this on dvd you will be contributing to the downfall of society in your own special way. congratulations.
