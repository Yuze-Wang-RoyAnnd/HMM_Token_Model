i watched this movie when joe bob briggs hosted monstervision on tnt. even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable. the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad ... but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though. it's like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy ... excruciatingly painful.<br /><br />if you took the actual film, dipped it in paint thinner, then watched it, it would be more entertaining. seriously.<br /><br />if you see this movie in the bargin bin at s-mart, back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake.
