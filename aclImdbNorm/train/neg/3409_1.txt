rumor has it that when the nasa technical advisors to this film were asked to keep the picture believable, they laughed for several hours. after all, unless you are a politician or work/crew the shuttle, you are not going to get in the shuttle. furthermore, space (cadet) camp is in alabama, not florida.<br /><br />the truth is everyone on earth will win multi-billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this film ever become possible. this film was meant for kids, and had to have been written by one, because they are not aware of the myriad restrictions and requirements regarding access to ksc/ccafs.<br /><br />this is the most useless film of all time, and it was a well deserved flop.
