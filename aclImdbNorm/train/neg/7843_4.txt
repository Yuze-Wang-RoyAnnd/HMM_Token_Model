this is a weak sequel: it lacks the interest and light touch of the magnificent "man called horse" in nearly every aspect and when compared to each other they hardly seem to be the same genre.<br /><br />the return is almost a parody of the first and tries to evoke different indian ceremonies but comes across as trying way too hard to bottle the magic of the first. in this film the tribe is lost and abandoned, having lost their homelands, modern life has encroached on paradise and they are living in abject misery and poverty. perhaps this is the point: the first film took us to a place where we would want to be, a simpler time. this takes us to broken indians in a miserable world and the white man is the hero and savior which rather negates the whole idea of the film.<br /><br />the beauty of the first lay in the fact that the white man learnt and discovered that real civilization lies in values rather than western materialism. in the second film this is all but lacking and so we end up with a weak film.<br /><br />a huge disappointment.
