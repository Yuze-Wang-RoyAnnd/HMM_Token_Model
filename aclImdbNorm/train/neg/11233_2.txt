as far as i can tell you, in spite of earlier comments posted by other commentors, this film is currently available on dvd. i found it only a few weeks ago.<br /><br />it is on the value dvd label and i paid the grand total of 98 cents plus tax for it. i found it at a 98 cent store among racks of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks. now don't you people who shelled out beau coup bucks for the super-duper swedish import limited edition version feel like you were had??? i thought so.<br /><br />this film was indeed well worth 98 cents. 99 cents, i might start to argue with you. but clearly worth 98 cents. and remember that saying about getting what you pay for. for slasher film mavens only.
