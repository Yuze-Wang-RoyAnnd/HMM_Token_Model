the main reasons to see "red eye" are rachel mcadams, who delivers a stellar performance, and jayma mays, who is wonderful as the assistant hotel manager. on the other hand, cillian murphy overacts so badly that he becomes cartoonish. the rest of the movie is riddled with plot holes, on which i will elaborate.<br /><br />please do not read further if you don't want to know what happens!<br /><br />here is a synopsis of the plot. rachel mcadams's character (lisa) manages a hotel where the new hard-nosed homeland security director plans to stay that night. rachel is returning to miami from a funeral, but fielding calls from her assistant up until the plane leaves. in the meantime, someone is stationed outside the house of her father, joe (played by brian cox), ready to kill him if cillian murphy (jackson) calls. all lisa has to do is phone the hotel and move the director's suite to one where jackson's cohorts are planning to fire a guided missile (from a fishing boat) to kill the director and his family.<br /><br />so, here are some of the plot holes or absurd coincidences:<br /><br />1. jackson finally convinces lisa to make the call, and in the middle, the phones in the plane lose their connection. lisa tries to fake that she is making the call, but coincidentally, a guy across the aisle from jackson is also making a call and starts banging his phone to indicate it is dead. jackson catches on and grabs the phone from lisa.<br /><br />2. at one point, jackson head-butts lisa and she, of course, gets knocked out...but only for 30 minutes.<br /><br />3. jackson catches lisa writing a note on the mirror in the (extraordinarily large) lavatory, and he bangs her around a bit. miraculously, the only one who hears anything is an 11-year-old girl, whose word, of course, is discounted.<br /><br />4. lisa stabs jackson with a pen in the throat as the plane is landing, steals his cell phone, and makes a mad dash for the exit, fitting down the aisle between the seats and 18 rows of standing passengers. despite knowing there is a passenger with a pen stuck in his throat, the flight attendants oblige lisa by opening the door to the jet-way.<br /><br />5. ok, all those are reasonable (if not highly unlikely). but here's where it gets really stupid. lisa gets into the terminal at miami airport, and there is no cell phone signal (every major airport in america has great cell phone reception).<br /><br />6. she runs through the airport with jackson in hot pursuit, and no security officers even delay them.<br /><br />7. jackson, who lost lisa in the airport while the train from the gates pulled away to the terminal, has lost some of his voice from the pen in his throat, but he can still be somewhat understood. however, he doesn't bother to call his man outside of joe's house. (ps: there is no train at miami airport, but the one they showed looked an awful lot like the orlando airport).<br /><br />8. lisa steals a car and rides away. of course this time, when she goes to make a call, the cell phone says "low battery" and soon shuts off (when will they stop using this inane plot device?).<br /><br />9. while the phone still said "low battery," lisa had reached her assistant just in time to save the director and his family from the guided missile launched by the fishing boat to the window of the room on the 40th floor to which the director had been moved. of course, they expect us not to notice that the hotel is surrounded on 3 sides by ocean, so the missile could have probably been launched at the first suite, thereby negating the need for the whole lisa-jackson plot. what's the story here? was the director's original room on the 38th floor one of the only rooms in the hotel with a lousy view? nevertheless, everyone gets out just before the missile hits.<br /><br />10. lisa drives to joe's house to save her father only to see the killer outside. although she runs him over (as he is shooting at her) by crashing her jeep into the house, no one in the neighborhood seems to notice or bother to stop by.<br /><br />11. jackson arrives at joe's house and knocks him out (we don't see how...maybe another head butt). he then explains to lisa that he didn't kill dad yet because he wanted dad to see lisa die first (give me a break. what is this? saturday morning cartoons?).<br /><br />12. for the rest of the movie (about 20 minutes), jackson chases lisa around the house, and she resourcefully fights him off. of course a real killer (i.e. one maybe played by jason statham) would have done away with lisa (or for that matter anyone who is not a trained killer) in the first 30 seconds. during the course of this chase, jackson steps over joe at least once without bothering to kill him.<br /><br />13. finally, jackson prevails, and he is about to kill lisa when (you guessed it) he is shot by joe.<br /><br />so, here's my suggestion...tell wes craven to stick to horror. or maybe he should get together with michael bay (who directed the equally stupid "the island") and make "red island."
