watched on hulu (far too many commercials!) so it broke the pacing but even still, it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties. dean martin and jerry lewis where both parts are played by jerry lewis. if i were indian, i'd protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews. they cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them i usually enjoy indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment, especially for a modern indian film. the story doesn't take place in india (the uncle keeps referring to when mac will return to india) but i can't find out where it is supposed to be happening.
