really no reason to examine this much further because of a few very glaring and bias misleading statements.<br /><br />a perfect example is when the filmmaker claims "saul" or paul of tarus (the writer of the book of hebrews he asserts) has no idea jesus is or was a human being, this assertion is either purposely false as he accuses others of presenting, or he is ignorant of what "the bible" says.<br /><br />first we can examine his misleading claim about hebrews 8.4; which he shows a quote "if jesus was on earth, he would not be a priest", hence right here he sets up the ignorant and unlearned viewer to accept his false premise.. why? he does what most so called bible believing people he accuses of doing, the same.. that is taking things out of context.<br /><br />verse one of hebrews 8 is; 1.."now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: we have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens" the context above is clearly speaking of a jesus who was on earth and ascended into heaven after his alleged resurrection.<br /><br />it has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take his out of context scripture. here he offers a foundation, that "paul was not aware of a human jesus, but only one in "heaven"<br /><br />follow?<br /><br />lets see if the filmmaker is being honest; hebrews 7; 14. "for it is evident that our lord sprang out of judah; of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood."<br /><br />heh, didn't the filmmaker just quote from the writer of hebrews trying to show the writer of that book has no knowledge of a "human jesus"? it's likely anyways paul didn't write hebrews, but i will not go into that here, but the film maker asserts paul did, and that is the premise of the point given here.<br /><br />it is not like this film maker does not make decent points in certain areas, he does, but he is engaging in the same blind bias of the religion he is bashing on. once he engages in these tactics, in my strong opinion, he loses credibility as the religion he picks out, and the film is no longer a documentary, but a personal opinion, and a bias of the film maker, nothing more, nothing less.
