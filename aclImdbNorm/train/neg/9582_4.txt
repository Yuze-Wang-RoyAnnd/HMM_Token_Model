this thrown together piece of fecal matter adds together so many ludicrous scenarios that in the end it's a laugh riot of absolute hilarity. too bad as the premise is promising (as it so often is in duhllywood), but in the hands of this scriptwriter it segues off into la la land. <br /><br />lowe is in prison serving time for a dui that killed off his mistress. we get to see him having nightmares just so that we know he feels real bad about this. then his cell mate neighbor hangs himself. or does he? lowe has some suspicions but drops them quickly. his suspicions are so weak that the bad guys have nothing to worry about. so why do they then set him up to be killed? ah, that's where this story could get interesting. that's where it falls off the rails, and once off the rails it decides it can get away with insulting the viewers attention for the next numbing hour.<br /><br />****************spoilers****************************<br /><br />i won't bore with an endless recounting of the irrationality of what follows, but contemplate this ending. lowe has been trapped by the bad guys on a train. they want a tape he has, because that tape will screw their boss, and them. so on to the train come 3 cops, guns drawn, ready to rescue lowe. the bad guys kill the cops, in front of half the passengers and then....continue chasing lowe to get the tape. hello!!!! killing 3 cops in public will get you into deep doodo, to hell with the tape. yet off they go through a mall shooting up the place, as if the public did not exist as witnesses, and in the end lowe is grabbed and the bad guy still wants the tape!!!
