wow...what can i say...first off imdb says this is in the late 60s...which means carlito would be very close to going to prison, he got out in 75 and said he was in for 5 years. they used a bunch of nobody actors, and a story that didn't even make sense. they bring back only one actor, guzman, and hes playing a totally different guy. why did it end with him and this puerto rican chick? wheres gale? he said he was in love with her before. wheres kleinfeld? he said he knew him forever...you'd think he'd have been in this one. and if this made sense, where are rocco and the black dude in the first one? it was all just stupid...this is an insult to pacino and the first film.
