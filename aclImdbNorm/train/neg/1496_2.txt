evil breed is a very strange slasher flick that is unfortunately no good.the beginning of the film seems promising but overall it's a disaster.the dialogue is pretty bad but not near as bad as the acting.the acting is brutal and unbearable.most of the characters deliver there lines horribly and even if that is on purpose the method doesn't work because the characters become annoying.some of the kills are innovative but it took far too long to get to them.after about a half hour through the movie we get the first death (other than in the beginning)and then almost every other character is smoked within the next five minutes.the movie then turned into sort of a spoof with ridiculous looking characters,unrealistic karate like fights,and a scene in which a man gets his intestines pulled out of his a*sscrack.none of it is funny it's just plain ridiculous.the film then becomes ultra gory and ultra pointless.most of the characters are clich'ed even for slasher standards and are as solid as butter left on the counter for 5 days.evil breed isn't even laughably bad therefore it fails in it's main task.watch texas chainsaw massacre,just before dawn,or see no evil for a real slasher.
