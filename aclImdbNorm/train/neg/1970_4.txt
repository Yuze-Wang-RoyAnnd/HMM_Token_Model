watching this film for the action is rather a waste of time, because the figureheads on the ships act better than the humans. it's a mercy that anthony quinn couldn't persuade anyone else to let him direct any other films after this turkey.<br /><br />but it is filled with amusement value, since yul brynner has hair, lorne greene displays an unconvincing french accent, and the rest of the big names strut about in comic-book fashion.
