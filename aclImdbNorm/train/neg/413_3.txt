this is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression.. story writing is what movie making is about. <br /><br />incredible visual effects.. very good acting, especially from shue. everything is perfect.. except.. the story is just poor and so, everything fails.<br /><br />picture this, if you had the power to be invisible.. what would you do? well, our mad scientist here (played by kevin bacon) could think of no other thing to do but fondle and rape women.. this is all his supposedly "genius" mind could think of. does he try to gain extra power? no. he doesn't even bother research a way to get back to being visible. the guy is basically a sex crazed maniac.<br /><br />add to that, the lab atmosphere, you have all these young guys.. throwing around jokes like they were in a bar.. if it wasn't for all the white coats and equipment, you would think this is a bad imitation of "cheers." very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but lambs for the hollow man's wolf.<br /><br />even as a thriller, the movie falls way short because most of the "thrilling" scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming "this is just a stupid thing i have to do so that the hollow man can find me alone and kill me."<br /><br />if you read the actual book, while the scientist (cane) goes after women, there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character. in the movie, cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded marketplace to rub his body in women and get off on it. just sad.
