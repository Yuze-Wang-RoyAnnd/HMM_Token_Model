the whole biker movie genre has to be made up of the worst films ever made. this one delivers a lot of fighting, generous amounts of blood, bikers fighting indians, and a shanty town that gets blown up and torn down one shack at a time. the acting is beyond terrible. what ever happened to robert walker, jr.? at one point he was in some major studio productions, and then he just faded away. this movie really blows, but if you have not seen a biker movie in a long time, it is a good one to watch. at the end of the movie, you should feel a bit trashy for having watched it!
