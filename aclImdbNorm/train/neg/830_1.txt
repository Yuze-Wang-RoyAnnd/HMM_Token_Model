i really don't understand all these positive user reviews. this movie is the worst movie i've ever seen and i'm not trying to be pessimistic.<br /><br />eva mendez is hot but terrible in this film. but i don't think it is her own fault but the directors. he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial; their acting, the idea, the make-up, everything.<br /><br />the star i'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie, which was very bad executed.<br /><br />don't watch this bullshit, go watch a fellini, woody allen or some david lynch.
