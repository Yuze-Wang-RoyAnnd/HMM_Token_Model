i could name plenty of funny movies. there are comedies that set out to be funny, and are. some movies, like a gymkata for example, try to be serious but end up funny. the ladies man is a film that is desperately trying to be funny, but could not be less funny if it was about a guy who got a lot of chicks in the middle of the wreckage of a nuclear holocaust. it's anti-funny.<br /><br />i don't think i laughed harder than a chuckle at anything in this movie. it's simply unfunny. it's boring, stupid, inane, annoying, mind-bogglingly bad, but not funny. i don't particularly care for tim meadows, or this character from snl, but i expected better than this.<br /><br />the movie is completely lacking logic or common sense. it's like the script writer had a bag over his head while he was typing and he couldn't see which keys he was hitting. they tell the "origin" of the ladies man, but fail to include a motivation for his bizarre fascination with acting like it's still the seventies. the movie tries to get humor out of a man who appears to pleasuring himself to porn, shortly after he tried to hang himself. this is comedy? i like to consider myself having a pretty keen sense of humor (spending a lot of time writing comedy as i do), but maybe i'm just not quite bright enough for this film.<br /><br />lee evans, so funny as tucker in there's something about mary, is outrageously bad here. i was pleading with him in my head to shut up.<br /><br />by the end i was pounding on my chair, muttering under my breath, and had the film gone on any longer, would probably have attempted suicide. this film might not be as bad as battlefield earth, but it's the first movie i've seen that's come close.<br /><br />
