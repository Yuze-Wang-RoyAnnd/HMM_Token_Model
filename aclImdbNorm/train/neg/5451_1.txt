filmfour are going to have to do a lot better than this little snot of a film if they're going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves.<br /><br />this film is set in glasgow (although only a couple of secondary characters have anything approaching a scottish accent). the premise, about people who's lives are going nowhere, who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs, could have made for a really funny, insightful, quirky, cultish film. instead we have a group of self-obsessed saddos and a plot which has been so done to bits i'm suprised it hasn't been banned. x and y are friends. x is sleeping with z. y sleeps with z as well. oh you figure it out.<br /><br />a total waste of time. painful dialogue - it sounded like something that a group of 16 year olds would have written for a gcse drama project. the female character was completely superfluous - just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing it.<br /><br />if you're the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts and can usually be found wandering round in packs shouting on saturday nights in nondescript town centres then you will love this film and find it "a right laff". everyone else, run, don't walk away from this sorry little misfit.<br /><br />and one question, when the group left the "boring" seaside town (saltcoats incidentally although they changed the name on the film), to go back to glasgow, why did they do it via the forton motorway services at lancaster which is in england?
