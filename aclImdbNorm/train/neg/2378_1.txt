why would any legitimate actor having read the script participated in this piece of crap? my god it is actually embarrassing to even watch it. i can't imagine the shame these people must feel for being a part of it. also, there is apparently some controversy as to whether river phoenix had a cameo in the movie. he was uncredited but his list of roles here (imdb) does give him credit. btw... rain is his sister for those who have were asking before. this film is proof that no matter how many big "names" you have. sow's ears don't make silk purses. i love lorraine bracco but this was just sad, sad, sad... maybe somebody someday can explain to me the reason for this kind of film. it has no endearing, entertaining, or even comedic properties in comparison to it's bad everything else.
