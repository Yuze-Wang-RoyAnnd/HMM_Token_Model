trash/bad movies usually ain't bad because i will find them enjoyable. this one is so bad that i am out of words to describe it - its below "bad". there is an instruction in the beginning of the film that tell you what to do during the movie. needless to say, the instruction and a dozen of beer couldn't help me seat through the entire film. one tagliner compares this one to killbill which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent. obviously. this tagliner had a plan to tempt you into buying this dvd.<br /><br />if you are considering renting this one, put it down! if you are thinking of buying, dont think! if you unlucky to have this dvd, dont play it, throw it in trash bin immediately.
