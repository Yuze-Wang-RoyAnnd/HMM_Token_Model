for a comedic writer, woody allen really lets the paying viewer down with this meager attempt at character development. there are a few entertaining moments, but no more than one would have listening to their dryer tumbling tennis balls.<br /><br />will ferrell wastes his time in this movie which fails to showcase his usually funny delivery. amanda peet did well, but again, didn't have the room to move in this otherwise corpse like movie. the movie is so heavy and dull that it cannot be carried but if it were carried, radha mitchell did it. <br /><br />if you enjoy movies that go on and on in one scene and don't really accomplish anything but to show that their writer can write a few lines of snappy dialogue on occasion, then you'll love this movie.
