the acting in the film is really well done honestly, but the movie is so slow and so boring, as soon as it gets interesting everything slows to a major halt. i am glad to see sam rockwell in this, he did a great job, so did the other actors as i mentioned but man... this is one of the worst dragged out films i have ever seen. now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good, but other than that, avoid it. this film has so much filler it makes a twinkie cake jealous. <br /><br />i never, ever, walk out on films, but watching this one at home with family, i walked out. yeah, it was that boring. apparently my comment doesn't have enough lines to post, so here's some more filler. i guess i was inspired by the movie i just watched.
