this series had potential, but i suppose the budget wouldn't allow it to see that potential. an interesting setup, not dissimilar to "lost" it falls flat after the 1st episode. the whole series, 6 episodes, could have made a compelling 90 minute film, but the makers chose to drag it on and on. many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward. the music was very annoying and did not work overall. there were few characters we cared about as their characters did not grow during the time frame--- well, one grew a bit. the ending was as terrible as the rest of series. the only kudos here is to the art dept and set dressers, they created an interesting look, too bad the writer and director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with that element
