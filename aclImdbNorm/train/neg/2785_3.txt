i know that some films (i mean: european films), that are very bad films, are being regarded as great cinema by certain "critics", only because they're non-american. i saw the 8.1 imdb score for this film and noticed the fact that this was being selected for certain big festivals. don't let this fool you! unless you're one of those people that likes mind-numbing films like this, and call it great art afterwards, skip it! the film contains one hilarious scene after another (a similar, italian, film popped into my mind, the terrible preferisco il rumore del mare (i prefer the sound of the sea)). the problem with these films is that they're not only boring, like some other strangely praised films, but that they almost play like camp. i mean, let's face it, the acting is horrible (i mean: soap opera-level), the story has not one surprise (this has been done endless times before, connecting several storylines: short cuts, magnolia, playing by heart, only much better), not one realistic character in it (some true freak-seeing along the way, notice the hilarious zombie-like daughter), and so on and so on.<br /><br />as if that's not enough, the film is 135 min. (count it!) long, and at the end the director opens his can of sentimentality. after a film with such hilariously bad dialogue and scenes that made the public at the preview screening laugh at so much incompetence, well... this is an insult to cinema, and only receives high ratings because it happens to be in "another" language, in this case spanish. strange world we live in...3/10
