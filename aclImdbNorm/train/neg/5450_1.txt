such a pretentious and lame attempt to hipness. diabolical script and dialogue and truly embarrassing acting. really the worse movie i have ever seen(at the cinema). nothing in my opinion saves this movie from being a total disaster. i saw it when it came out in a cinema in brighton. people were walking out and there were more people chatting outside the toilets than in the auditorium! at the end there were boos and scorn from the meagre crowd left, which was quite sad as relatives of one of the main actors were present and looked really sheepish. however the movie was that bad that i really could not feel like that sympathetic with them. everybody has to start from somewhere and their son started off his acting career with this truly awful attempt at 'tarantinism made in the uk'. 5 years have gone bye, but sometimes i still cringe at the memory of that sad night at the movies! this is a movie with no redeeming features whatsoever! i gave it a 1 as 0 was not available. they should invent a 'shameometer' for everybody involved in this sorry mess of a movie. i know some of them have moved on to better things, the positive thing is that none of them could have sank any lower than this.
