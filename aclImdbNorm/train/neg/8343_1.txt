salvage is the worst so called horror film i've ever seen. there is nothing remotely horrific about it. it doesn't deserve to be in a genre so fine. first of all i don't see how so many people can think this piece of crap such a great movie. if i wrote something as boring and utterly ridiculous as this i would be laughed at and too embarrassed to subject others to the stupidity of it. second: the acting is terrible and the lead actress is excruciatingly ugly. third: the story sucks, its been used before, and the excuse that its a cheap movie is no excuse. read the summery on the back of the case, it reveals the whole story. i do not recommend that you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste on something that will leave you regretting that you watched it. i feel really bad for those crooks and the irony of their name. all hail anthony perkins!!!!!!!!!
