opening scene 'explains' why hurt is later 'immune' to the 'contaminated man'. too bad it doesn't explain anything else: how did he get whatever he 'caught'/what was it/why does it work so fast. then we go to "present day budapest". ok, was the opener in the past or the future? it turns out to be the past, of course, but for a minute it looks just as likely to be the nd of the movie moved to the beginning. sorry, i should have paid closer attention, huh? or maybe it's just badly done. then a lot of confusion about the different jobs he's had in related fields, and finally a mention about how he should have died from the original experiment the n s a did on him. aha! so the n s a and private industry got together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects? he must have been one of the top guys, he's friends with the c e o of the chemical company, for god sakes. then there's the substance itself: technically a poison, but it mutates in immune 'carriers', so we can have whatever we want; a poison, a disease, an allergic reaction, all very different things in real life. magically, it's not contagious from one dying victim to another, only from the carrier. how convenient. then there's the h a z m a t protocol: they jump into a situation without having any idea what's in store, or how prepare for it. did the producers not have enough money to show a proper wash-down after the crew just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance? i kept thinking hurt was going to die from bad cleanup technique, and the open scene would turn out to be the closer after all.
