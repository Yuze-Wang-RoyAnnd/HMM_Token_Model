i caught this a few months ago on family channel, and having some memories of the tv show from my youth, decided to watch it along with my 4 year old daughter. i should have got some psychedelic mushrooms to go along with it, 'cause this is just bizarre! not only is it a musical with annoyingly forgettable tunes, the requisite cheesy effects and cameos by stars long past their collective primes, it seems to have been produced as somebody's good acid trip. talking flutes, british children far too old for this kind of crap... in the words of krusty the klown "uuuuuugggghhhhh! what was i on?" if you're a huge fan of the whole sid and marty krofft oeuvre, go for it; otherwise, unless you're willing to get looped before watching, stay far, far, far away.
