this video guide was the masterpiece of the year 1995. beautifully done! matthew perry and jennifer aniston have major on-screen chemistry when they talk about what the start button does. i'm waiting for microsoft to release a special edition dvd complete with deleted scenes, bill gates commentary, a documentary of how windows 95 compares to windows xp, and more!<br /><br />overall: 10/10 (should have won at least a golden globe)
