i was so excited when i discovered this was available! i couldn't wait to see it. what a waste of energy! it's kind of like that rarities cd by your favorite band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store. being a hard core fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery. but once you heard it it became obvious why these dogs never made it onto a real album. this dvd is only recommended for 'completionists' who must have everything lynch has done. "six men getting sick" is somewhat visually interesting but short and repetitive. it lacks the power of lynch's later work "the grandmother" is quite simply an immature work. it's tedious and looks like a student film. but it was the 70's...it's interesting only if you hope to psychoanalyze the director. but you can see, briefly, the seeds of some of his trademark images and sounds. "the alpahabet" is forgettable (no really! i can't remember this one at all!) "the amputee" is pointless. "the cowboy and the frenchman" is just plain silly. "lumiere" is the only worthwhile one in the bunch. without dialog lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his best work. i had to watch this one several times. but it runs less than 2 minutes. hardly worth the trouble of renting or buying the dvd.
