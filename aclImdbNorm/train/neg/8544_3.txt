i was never quite sure where this thing was going. these people seem interested in what is going on on some mountain. they investigate, have narrow escapes, leave, come back, leave, put each other in danger, sleepwalk, get attacked by witches who have consistent wardrobes, etc., etc. the guy seems to like the girl, but leaves her unprotected numerous times. she gets taken off, he gets her back, leaves her again. you get the point. the whole thing seems to get around to some sort of sacrifice, i think, but i'm not sure, or turning people into witches, but i'm not sure. it's just dull and endless and not worth the time. there are some atmospheric scenes, but the print is so bad that there times when twenty seconds of blackness is not unusual. is this caused by age or the overuse of night filters.
