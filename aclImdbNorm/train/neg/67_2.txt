from the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed, that the outcome is entirely predictable. any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. in this film you will find none of that. the police are the baddies, and consequently are shown as shallow, incompetent and cowards. it never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society.<br /><br />the viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether ned kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. the film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence. we see him walk through the door of a gaol, but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue.<br /><br />this film contains many shots of ned looking at the camera with a serious expression. i found the film a real chore to watch. it is the direction for modern films, and this one put me off watching any more.
