burt reynolds came to a point in his career where he appeared to just be going thru the motions. he'd show up, party with his friends on film, and take home a big paycheck. it didn't seem to matter to him that the product he was representing was pure crap.<br /><br />no film epitomized this more than "stroker ace" which makes "cannonball run" look like a classic and "cannonball run ii" look watchable. save for a few race scenes there is absolutely nothing worth seeing here. even the beautiful loni anderson hams it up so bad as a dumb blonde it's embarrassing.<br /><br />if the thought of burt hamming it up with jim nabors and dressing like a chicken sounds funny then this is your movie. otherwise pick almost any other film comedy and it won't be any worse.
