this will be best known for the ferrari that was crashed when eddie griffin was doing promotion.<br /><br />tale of racing and betting is a poorly made by the numbers that appears to have a director who couldn't see the numbers. largely a point and shoot affair with a group of actors in it for a paycheck. this is not a good movie, but its not bad enough to be watchable and end up as a some what nothing film isn't worth bothering with no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />misogynistic, despite the fact one of the leads is a woman, this is a film that was clearly made just to get the producer and director close to pretty girls. want evidence? there are long lingering shots of women in next to nothing that serve no purpose other than perhaps to get a rise out of people too afraid to rent a porno or the sports illustrated swimsuit dvd.<br /><br />avoid this movie at all costs
