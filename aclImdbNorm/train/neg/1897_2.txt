this was a horrible film! i gave it 2 points, one for angelina jolie and a second one for the beautiful porsche in the beginning... other than that the story just plain sucked and cars racing through cities wasn't so new in 1970. the happyend was probably what annoyed me the most, seldomly seen anything so constructed!
