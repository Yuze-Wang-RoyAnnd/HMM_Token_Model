you can never have seen either film and still know that the jerk too is a disaster. the question is not, "how did it get made," because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film, they will do so.<br /><br />no. the question is "why, oh why, did steve martin allow it to be made?" i think he needed the money to fight a nuisance lawsuit and was determined it not cost him anything. he knew the sequel was going to be so frightful, that out of pride, he wouldn't even count it's royalties as income. <br /><br />the only way this sequel could not be an embarrassment is to have had carl gottlieb and steve martin revive the nation's favorite poor black family.<br /><br />and "dcreasy2001" (aka mark blankfield?): it's just transparently obvious that you worked on this film in some sad capacity, and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the sequel's lone cheerleader as an imdb user comment. i was praying for you to veer over into satire, but alas, you were really making an effort at spin. why not 10 stars?
