it's sad when you can see what a movie was attempting to do, and it is quite obvious that it fell far far short of the mark. film students should take this as a lesson and a warning. would be graduate has an idea. he wants total control. so he writes, directs, produces, his cinematic masterpiece all by himself. usually, his concept is far beyond his budget. usually he writes an overblown script full of every tag line he can come up with. usually, he is more interested in the grand sweep of the story rather than on the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes. usually, he ends up with a movie that is feeble in it's attempt to create miracles on a tiny budget. usually, he ends up with a series of encounters (we cannot do justice by calling them scenes) that feel like they were written by a 12 year old. and usually he ends up with badly acted scenes that fail to grab the viewer. when you look at judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it's just the usual fare.
