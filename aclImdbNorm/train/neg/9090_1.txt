a propaganda film for the palestinian "cause". if you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the israeli-palestinian conflict, you will need to look elsewhere. if you are an anti-semite (or merely an anti-zionist---nothing wrong with advocating the destruction of a country, right?) or uncritically in support of palestinian goals (e.g., mass murder, the destruction of israel), this is the documentary for you. should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the uk and us. however, any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged at the sheer number of lies presented in this video. i just hope those who truly are unaware of the situation aren't corrupted by this anti-semitic filth.
