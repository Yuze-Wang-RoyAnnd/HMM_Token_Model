mr. mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so i was interested to see what he'd do with total creative control over a movie. sadly, it is unwatchable, though not because the jokes aren't funny--some (i won't say most) of them are, and in fact mr. mike did a good job translating his mentally unbalanced screeds into visual gags. the trouble is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, you name it) is so god-awful, the movie is intolerable. some outfit called "pko productions" gets the producing credit, but it doesn't look produced at all; it looks more like mike stole one of the cameras from the snl set and made the whole thing in an afternoon. i realize mike's goal was to torture the audience, but even that deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to actually see, hear or comprehend whatever it is that's supposed to be shocking. still, the dvd isn't a total waste: it includes a eulogy for o'donoghue by bill murray and three "mr. mike's least loved bedtime stories" from snl. plus, the "cat swimming" section of the movie is a great scene to be caught watching if you want to freak someone out. 3/10
