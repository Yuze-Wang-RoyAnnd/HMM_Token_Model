i saw this movie in new york city. i was waiting for a bus the next morning, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. it was raining, and did not want to wait at the port authorty. so i went across the street and saw the worst film of my life. it was so bad, that i chose to stay and see the whole movie,i have yet to see anything else that bad since. the year was 69,so call me crazy. i stayed only because i could not belive it.........
