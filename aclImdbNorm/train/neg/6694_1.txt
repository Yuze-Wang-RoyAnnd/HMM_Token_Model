i actually had hopes for this movie since i've seen kari in a few other things and think she has some talent. alas, this dud is a case study in what not to do in a screenplay. completely undefined characters without a shred of likeability, and no plot whatsoever. is it a road/buddy/comedy/thriller/romance/drama? the filmmakers don't have a clue, and neither do we.
