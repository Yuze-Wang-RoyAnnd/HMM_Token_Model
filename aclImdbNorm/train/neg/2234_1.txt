i bought this dvd for lb1 and now i realise why. the acting was the worst i've seen in a long time. the lighting and sound are shoddy at best. the plot makes little sense even when sober (warning: i don't advise watching this film when sober.) this film feels like you're watching the home movie of someone who doesn't get out much. it really is a shame that all the very little money spent on this project went to such a waste, i look forward to seeing if any of those envoled still have a career, other than eva longoria who is the only "star" of this film that was apparently not hit with the bad acting stick. i'm sorry that none of this criticism seems constructive but i will say one thing to james cahill, don't try it again. in the words of squirlyem "its severely lacking in the good department".
