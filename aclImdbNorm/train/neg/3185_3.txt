this movie was just heckled by mst3k and with good reason. first and foremost because it is a "cop" movie starring joe don baker, who we all know is about as good a cop actor as michael jackson is a country western singer.<br /><br />all the typical cop movie plot devices rear their ugly heads, bar fights, children hostages in shoot outs, bad acting, lame police chiefs, bad acting, revenge/justice, endless goons , and of course, bad acting. don't watch this without an mst3k filter folks.
