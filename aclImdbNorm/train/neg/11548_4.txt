jeez, only in the 70's... antonio margheriti brings us this quirky hybrid of spaghetti western and kung fu flick evolving around a treasure-hunt. the spices of this trashy co-production between shaw brothers and an italian one-off company include humorous storytelling, off-the-wall happenings and some very tame t&a. extra campy moments are being served by lee van cleef's obnoxious wig, leather-clad bible-thumping psycho gunman yancey hobbitt (loveably hammed up by julian ugarte, the man who should've done way more obscure european genre productions than he did), wanna-be-witty dialogue, hilarious background music and completely laughable sound effects accompanying various little events (especially every jump made by lo lieh).<br /><br />while this little piece of action falls fare and square into the turkey territory, it's great to see van cleef and lo lieh on the same screen, and you can't deny the charisma of this duo. don't expect too much, and you'll get plenty out of it.<br /><br />this is my truth. what is yours?
