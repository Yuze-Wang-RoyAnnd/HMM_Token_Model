this is one of the silliest movies i have ever had the misfortune to watch! i should have expected it, after seeing the first two, but i keep getting suckered into these types of movies with the idea of "maybe they did it right this time". nope - not even close.<br /><br />where do i begin? how about with the special effects... to give you an idea of what passes for sfx in this movie, at one point a soldier is shooting at a "raptor" as it runs down a hallway. even with less than a second of screen time, the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail apparently taped to him running around. bad bad bad bad.<br /><br />how about the acting? if that's what you can call it. there is one character who, i suppose, is supposed to be from the south. however, after living in the south for six years now, i have never heard this way of talking. perhaps he has some sort of weird disability - the inability to talk normally. i find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent - therefore there was no reason for the actor to try to do one.<br /><br />how about the plot? it's pretty basic - raptors escape, people with guns must hunt them down. i'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest system of tunnels... wouldn't they stay outside to hunt prey? oh well, at least they have the good sense to appear very very little in the movie which supposedly revolves around them.<br /><br />other things - let's say you are in a building and you know that there are man eating raptors running around in it. would you decide to take time out to have an argument about who is better - army or marine? and then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it? how about the idiotic idea that they have to track down the raptors - split up into groups of two. didn't they ever watch any horror movies (or at least an episode of scooby doo)? in short, this is one of the dumber movies out there. miss it unless you want to groan your way through a movie.
