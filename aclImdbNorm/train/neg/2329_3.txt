when they killed off john amos's character they killed the show. he was the vital part of the info structure. you had a story of an inner city family's struggling to make it the best way they knew how. they were poor, they were black, and they were living proof that if you have jesus and your family that nothing is too hard. sure james would lose jobs and jj would fail in school but the family always managed to find a way. <br /><br />james was the strong male role model that earned the income and disciplined the children. florida was the strong lady that would everyone including james when he needed a shoulder to cry on or hug to make it. the kids had personalities and input which made them important as a family unit. their neighbor willona was also a key element because she represented not only a friend but some dear enough to be family. things were bright, gritty, funny, and honest until they changed the course of the program. james dies and jj took over the show. <br /><br />flo was still mom, thelma was blossoming into a lady and michael was still the militant midget but jj was the show. we were expected to believe that the family with no father or prominent bread winner was going to be able to stay in the apartment. i guess james's paycheck didn't do much for the family. they were only threatened with eviction because they said they were moving and not because no one in the house was working. i know that jj, flo, thelma and even michael eventually got jobs but come on here be for real. james worked so much that you could feel for him but the others weren't realistic at all and that's a shame.<br /><br />jj was the comic relief but i felt the show need substance. it's ok to be funny but they had a chance to show a real family and what it took to survive in the real world and they threw it all away on a few laughs. michael's character almost disappeared while the rest of the cast slipped into the shadows of the jj evan's show. i mean really, here was a guy that was failing in school, he kept getting laid off, and he painted for money in about two episodes. james had always been there to encourage his talent but flo and the rest of the family didn't seem to care.<br /><br />why did it take him so long to understand that painting was what he was meant to do? he could have sold painting's on the street or worked for people that print billboards and cards. (he did but something went wrong with that.) why did he not make it and why did the others give up on their dreams? i'll tell you why, it was because they didn't have a father in their life to care and to cheer them on and their mother stopped being their to support their dreams. the show stopped teaching us about growing, building and learning and started teaching us about gimmicks and catch phrases. they should have kept james. if any show needed a father it was that one.
