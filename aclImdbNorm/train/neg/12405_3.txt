the shame of it! there i was, comfortable in the arm chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn, bouyant in the hope of another splendid muppet night of entertainment. what did i get? disappointed! how can the muppets go from the sublime christmas carol to this? the humour was dreadful, the songs were worse than country and western (and that's saying something) and the plot was as confused and poor as blind pew. i think the main problem was that they bit off too much in attempting treasure island. a short tale, such as christmas carol, is perfect because you can weave the muppet high jinks around it....here the need to drag the plot along stopped all the fun. where do the muppets go next? how about muppets wizard of oz?
