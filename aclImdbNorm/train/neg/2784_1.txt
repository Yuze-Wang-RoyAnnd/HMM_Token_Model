my husband and i are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same township as the screenwriter of this movie. we were very upset that the jcc is bringing this movie to its jewish film festival because of the way that the mentally disabled character frankie is portrayed. we went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out. we demanded out money back. we would encourage the screenwriter to donate a portion of the funds to the jcc's achad program to apologize.<br /><br />we did not like seeing frankie - a mentally disabled and perhaps even autistic teenager - as part of a joke in which he keeps dropping something to look at the nanny's breasts.<br /><br />there was no point to frankie's character other than to say "hey, being mentally disabled is funny." challenges like frankie's are a serious matter. families like mine are truly suffering.<br /><br />the screenwriter needs to explain herself. does she know families with disabled kids? does she see the families with disabled kids week after week at the jcc pool?
