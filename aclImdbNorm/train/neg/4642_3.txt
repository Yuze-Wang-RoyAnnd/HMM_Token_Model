i saw "rachel's attic," thinking that i would be in for an enjoyably visceral, ride. however, it was not to be the case. visceral, yes, but enjoyable? that would be a big, fat, no! in fact, the only reason that i gave it a "3," is due to the fact that gunnar hansen appears (ever so briefly) as one of the film's reprehensible characters. how they ever lured mr. hansen into this piece of...work, i'll never know. the story idea is interesting but poorly executed. the direction is pedestrian and the acting is mediocre. the only thing that is worse than that, are the special effects. yikes!!! i've seen better effects in a grade school play. give it up, mr. w, it's time for a career change...i hear they're hiring at mel's diner! there are very few, well made, inde movies coming out of michigan...and "rachel's attic" isn't one of them.
