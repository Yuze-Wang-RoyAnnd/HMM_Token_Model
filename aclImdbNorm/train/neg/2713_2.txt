i like a lot of the actors/actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns .the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers .in 20 or 30 years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90's . i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot's and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music .the soundtrack will feature bands like nirvana , n.w.a , public enemy , soundgarden etc .the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the 60's and i gurantee you nbc will do it .see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time .next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project
