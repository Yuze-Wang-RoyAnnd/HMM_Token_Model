that's right, you heard me. i am a huge fan of james patterson. i own 10 of his books, and i have read the entire series about lindsey boxer. in my opinion, the screenwriter should be shot. <br /><br />what right did any film maker have to slaughter a terrific work of fiction and make it into a mockery of the mystery genre? if i ever thought that harry potter was butchered, then michael o'hara has proved me wrong. <br /><br />i can only pray that the next screenwriter who tackles this fabulous book will do it a great deal more justice. to michael o'hara and russell mulcahy: don't quit your day job.
