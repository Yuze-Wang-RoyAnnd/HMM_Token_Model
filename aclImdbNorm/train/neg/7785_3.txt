i didn't know this was a silent movie with narration. i don't care for silent movies - the corny humor, flickering lighting and film, etc. i'm sure that attributes to the low score i assigned it. it was about chapter 8 before i found any interest in this story and had i had popcorn i may have thrown it at the screen. maybe this appeals to the sci-fi crowd? the only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant. i went with two other people on a friday night and there were a total of 6 people in the entire theater. isabella rosselinni narrated this movie - the one enjoyable aspect of the movie. no one left commenting how much they enjoyed this nor appreciated the unusual approach to telling this story. i cannot recommend this movie.
