after being bitten by a bat in a cave,a doctor named john beck undergoes an accelerating transformation into a man-bat creature.his wife assures him that there's nothing wrong with him,it's all just due to rabies or the anti-rabies drugs he's taking.the local cop thinks that john is responsible for several gruesome murders."the bat people" by jerry jameson is one hell of a horrible film.the script is deadly dull and there is no gore nor nudity.this pointless piece of crap is so mind-numbingly boring that you'll scratch your head in a total disbelief after suffering through it.even the design of a man-bat creature by a young stan winston is completely pathetic and unmemorable.avoid this stinker like the plague.2 out of 10.
