i've barely just made it through one episode ("crouch end"). the dialog was stilted and down-right cringe worthy. the acting was tragic. eion bailey, despite his best attempts to be dramatic, remains mostly expressionless. his eyebrows hint at a recent botox treatment. claire forlani could have just as easily been playing the damsel in distress in a silent movie. the characters were cartoons, each playing their stereotypical cog in the plot mostly random, meandering plot. cheesy special effects can be excused given the tv miniseries budget. but attempts to create suspense and surprise through distracting cinematography added to the unwatchability. i get the feeling that the ending was supposed to be witty and surprising, but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story. if i had to compare it's overall quality to something else, i'd put this episode of "nightmares and dreamscapes" on par with the nbc's hercules.
