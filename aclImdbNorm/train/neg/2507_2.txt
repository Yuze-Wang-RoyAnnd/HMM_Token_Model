this is not a good movie. it's disjointed, all the acting is bad, and has a lame story you've seen a thousand times done much better else where. not to mention you can see every plot point coming from a mile away. worst of all, no one bothered to tell lonette mckee she can't sing. but who cares, she's sooooo damn good looking. but i digress, nothing new here. bottom-line, hot girl group gets taken advantage of, some one gets hooked on drugs, someone gets hooked on a guy, some one gets the hell out, and then the horrible stuff happens. surprise, surprise. welcome to the music business. i can't believe so many people out there think this is a good movie. so many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to grading black movies. i don't play that! if you want to support these films by going to see them - great! if you enjoyed it - super! to each his own. but don't try to tell me it was good. pleeeease! i wish colored folks would not fawn over these kind of movies just because they feature black actors. wanna see a good african-american movie? see love jones. ray. or the color purple. those would be great movies no matter what the color of the actors skin. why? because they told compelling stories with great acting, that made you feel something long after you left the theater. just because it's our experience does not automatically make it a good film. it's only good -- when it's good. period.
