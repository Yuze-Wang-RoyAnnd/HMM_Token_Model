i love john saxon in anything he's in. the one time he takes over the camera though he directs a movie that should have more aptly been been titled "please do not watch this movie called: zombie death house". the $1000 dollar shock insurance certificate is dear fred olen ray's tricky way of making you spend 14 dollars on a filmed dump churned out by a major 70's cheese legend. ray being the front man at retromedia. ray by the way makes charles band look hotter than stucco ceilings on a ford falcon. just plain bad now, the both of them- and boring besides. it's great that ray is digging up this old stuff and in some cases it's public domain like the rest of the dollar video hucksters but in the case of zombie death house- (the word "zombie" sloppily superimposed to add ownership and interest on the part of f.o.r.) the only way to do service to this tripe is to release it on the dollar market for the curious collector and fans of saxon!!! if you wanna see real saxon, pick up black christmas, nightmare on elm street or the glove.
