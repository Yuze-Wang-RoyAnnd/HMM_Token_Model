i wasn't really hoping for much when i went to see this. after mst3king the heck out of jasonx with some friends though, i was hoping for a similar experience here.<br /><br />unfortunately the movie took itself way too seriously. do i care about jason's problems? i'm sorry no. there are a legion ft13th movies that cover that anyway. at at then end of the day, he's an undead serial killer, i'm just not going to get that sympathetic.<br /><br />freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not, but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie, it had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatch...only not funny.<br /><br />
