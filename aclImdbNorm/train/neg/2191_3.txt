a doctor who is trying to complete the medical dream of transplantation is experimenting secretly on corpses from the hospital with varying success. his final best chance comes when he lovingly wraps his girlfriend's head in his jacket as he rescues it from a burning vehicle.<br /><br />i was looking for cheese and with this premise i believed i found it. it has everything everything that bad movie hunters look for - chest and brain surgery with the surgeons leaving with pristine white scrubs, unique camera angles (i always love watching the rear passenger wheels of cars), cheesy clarinet stripper music, and one of the longest death scenes in movie history. but unfortunately these so-bad-they-are-good moments can't overcome the too-bad-they-stink stretches.<br /><br />jan in the pan annoyed me, with her droning monologues in a hoarse whisper, the somewhat less than evil laughter, and the fact she was kept alive with some columbian home brew coffee and 2 dd batteries.<br /><br />i couldn't even entertain myself with dr bill's horrid overacting and moral self righteousness. usually such ham makes these movies a must see in my opinion, in this case i was bored with it.<br /><br />the best part of the movie in my opinion was the 1960's version of "body shopping" and i even found myself nodding off during that.<br /><br />don't spend money on this one - there are better bad movies out there to entertain your sick sense of humor.
