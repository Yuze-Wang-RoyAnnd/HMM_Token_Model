this movie sucked ! they took something from my childhood ,and raped it in an outhouse! this movie was so bad i wanted to go home and hold my "dukes" dvds and cry in a corner. the cast was terrible ! it wasn't "the dukes", it was stiffler and jackass driving a car. when was boss hogg evil? when was rosco a tough guy? they never were ! boss hogg was greedy and rosco was an idiot. when did jesse smoke pot? he never did ! now don't get me wrong,i'm very liberal and there's nothing wrong with a little chiba, but it had no place in this movie! the only thing good about this movie was the trailers before the movie and the end credits. it was a waste of money time and air. avoid at all costs!!!!!!!!
