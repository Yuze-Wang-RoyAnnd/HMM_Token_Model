the japenese sense of pacing, editing and musical score must be different than american tastes, but surely this movie could have been so much more with a little more post production work.<br /><br />someone in hollywood needs to re-make this movie and i think it would be a big hit. the story is interesting and creepy. there's something about the edges of the city, gritty policemen, earthquakes, sanitariums and mysterious saltwater killings that is enough to be captivating. however, this story has to make just a little bit of sense and maybe be about 40 minutes shorter.<br /><br />i do have to say that the "sixth-sense" effect was in full force in this movie, and that was evident from the very beginning.<br /><br />as it stands, only the die-hard japanese film lovers should bother seeing this oh-so-boring movie.
