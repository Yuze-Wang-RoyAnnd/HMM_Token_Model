if you liked the grinch movie... go watch that again, because this was no where near as good a seussian movie translation. mike myers' cat is probably the most annoying character to "grace" the screen in recent times. his voice/accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound, which is about the only laughing i heard at the theater. not even the kids liked this one folks, and kids laugh at anything now. save your money and go see looney tunes: back in action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie.
