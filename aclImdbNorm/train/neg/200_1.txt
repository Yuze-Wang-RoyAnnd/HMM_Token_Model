that reviewers liked this movie surprises me. the plot is a muddle. the characters are wooden. michael bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them. no one has any redeeming quality or point-of-interest. this is not an edgy work. it is not imaginative. it is not ironic. it is no clever. there is nothing straight forward about this tedious work. that is missed theatrical release is not surprise. that the "this network" airs it diminishes that venue. i definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the garden smart show on pbs or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television. if you encounter it on daytime television, take a long walk. even if you walk in smog, you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles. life is short. this movie is long.
