as long as you can suffer it! if you like watching people waking up, getting up, getting dressed, having a shower, preparing dinner, watching each other, having sex in the dark, then going back to bed to sleep... if you like tacky flats, narrow bedrooms and kitchens, long minutes of silence.... if you like getting bored for two hours, feeling the thrill of "real intimate false art", then you will like it. but if you don't, just try to see a good movie, there are thousands. "as long as you are here", but do we want to stay? this german movie got the award of the torino gay film festival: italian journalists still don't understand why the jury took such a bad decision, as the festival presented lot of talented movies. maybe to be nice with a german, as they don't often get awards? well, "the lives of others" did... but this one is excellent but not gay. so maybe it is a question of fashion. germans are they "in" again? no matter what? or maybe only for a hustler's glance of some directors?
