i'll keep this fast and sweet. five girls on their way home from a football game decide to take a 'short cut' that leads them down a deserted forest-ridden road. of course nothing but good things happen to them, and they safely arrive at their destination.<br /><br />alright, they don't. soon they're hunted down by a deranged chick who has some severe mental issues, and what ensues is 90 minutes of sheer boredom.<br /><br />i hope to never see any of these actors in any movie ever again. their screaming, screeching voices gave me a headache, and the script was so poorly written that it included a lot of repeat phrases and nonsensical hysterical screaming. all in all, one of the worst cheap horror flicks i've ever seen...and i've seen a lot.
