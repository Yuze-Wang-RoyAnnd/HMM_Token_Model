for me, this movie just seemed to fall on its face. the main problem for me was the casting of glover as a serial killer. i don't know whether this grows out of type-casting or simply his demeanor, but i doubt glover could ever portray a convincing villain. he's a good guy, and that's always obvious in his performances. other than that the film is your run of the mill serial killer story. nothing very innovative .
