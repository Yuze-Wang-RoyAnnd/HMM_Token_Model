unless you understand wretched excess this movie won't really mean much to you. an attempt was made to interject a bit of humanity into a cold and bleak period consumed by alcohol and drugs -- it doesn't work.<br /><br />when salma hayak does her big disco number her voice is so obviously dubbed it is pathetic -- the producers could at least have gotten someone that sounded remotely like her.<br /><br />the documentary that has been playing on television lately is far superior and gives a much truer view of that period of our history.<br /><br />no one, with the exception of mikey myers, could be accused of acting; however, he does an incredible job.
