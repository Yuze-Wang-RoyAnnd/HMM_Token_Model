this review may contain some spoilers.<br /><br />just when you thought they didn't make them so extremely bad anymore, along comes rae dawn chong as a space vixen and willie nelson as a native american witchdoctor! it's even worse when you factor in that these two are the better aspects of `starlight,' a film that should only be viewed for laughs.<br /><br />chong is an alien sent to earth to seek out the only remaining half-breed, part man and part alien. apparently, the earth is in dire straits. something is wrong with the genetics of mankind, and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland. only by duplicating the dna of the half-breed can the kindly alien race save the planet. don't ask me how that is, since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution, which is caused by humans. you would think earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures, not saving them! anyway, the half-breed turns out to be billy wirth, a man living in a small southwestern town and is part native american from his mother's line, despite the fact that his mother is a red-headed caucasian and his grandfather is willie nelson. wasn't this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic carmen electra bomb `the chosen one' such a howler? chong arrives in her ship just as wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend. before you can say utter the word `hogwash,' chong is revealing her secret to wirth, who isn't surprised for a moment, and spreading the word to wirth's family. chong also makes pals with wirth's mother, who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years. well, this is because wirth's father was an alien that abandoned her. of course, he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to earth for wirth so he can use wirth's dna to make the people of earth his slaves. (huh?) his laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie. not only are they boring, but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most.<br /><br />the ideas might be nice on paper, but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity, particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien. but the effects are the bane of the movie. the opening scene involves chong on her spaceship, communicating with her superior, someone who we do not see but that chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light. they use no spoken words, but telepathy, so we are treated to subtitles. trouble is, both chong and her superior's subtitles both look alike, and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually `speaking' at any given moment, which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish. the spaceship is the worst effect to come out of hollywood this side of an ed wood film. now, i am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this, but these effects really got to me. the most offensive was the most simple one: a fake night sky. the stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone. most notably are the moments where chong tells someone she comes from pleiades, and we get a shot of the seven stars. thing is, the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie, but any stargazer knows that pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations perseus and taurus, and the cluster doesn't take up much room in the sky at all. these effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment. be careful, for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have willie nelson turn into a human spotlight and . . . oh, it has to be seen to be believed!<br /><br />starlight, star bright; last star i see tonight; i wish i might, i wish i may; not have to watch any more of this trash today.<br /><br />zantara's score: 1 out of 10.
