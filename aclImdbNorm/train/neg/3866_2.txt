i thought this movie had absolutely no moral. i mean, how would you feel if your fianc'e left you on your wedding day for your cousin??? i would be heartbroken!! it's classified as a comedy but i didn't find it funny at all. i thought it just mostly found cheap laughs and took them. i normally love julie stiles movies, but this is an exception. jason lee stars in another disgraceful show, which once again proves that class and decent morals are not relevant in todays society. it had a complete lack of taste and i despise movies like this. i understand that people will defend this movie and it's morals because it is 'just a movie', but i still stand by my mark that this bad behaviour shouldn't be allowed on screen. i'm not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie, you are a bad person, as everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and parts of this movie were enjoyable, i'm just saying that in real life, people acting like the characters in this film were doing is shameful.
