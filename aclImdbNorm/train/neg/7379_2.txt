what was steven seagal thinking? i mean firstly i love seagal. i love all his movies up to the mid 2000s. his early stuff is some of the best in the genre. this however does not live up to its excellent name. attack force (with protagonist marshall lawson {seagal}) would be expected to be a mindless action movie with seagal in typical one-liner ass kicking form. however, what we get is a crime mystery, bordering on a political thriller with little or no action. seagal is always in shadows because of his weight. i could not follow this story. there's people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug. what happened in this movie. the dubbing of seagal is a disgrace, a shambles and a shame. why dub the man? the story is terrible. this got a 2/10 from me because of the scene where seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him, and an hilarious fight scene where seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera! "revenge is a two way street" seagal says in this movie...well forget revenge steven, you need redemption!
