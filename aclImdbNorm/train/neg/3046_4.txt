i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old. my mom bought it at our local kmart because it was on sale for $5 on vhs. she thought that it would be a nice christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch. this movie, however, scared the hell out of me. you may be asking yourself, how could a movie about santa clause scare anyone? the plot of the movie revolves around satan sending one his minions, pitch, to earth in an attempt to kill santa and ruin christmas. that's right, satan sends a demon up from hell to kill santa clause. pitch stalks santa throughout christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on christmas day, for if santa doesn't make it back to his home in space, he turns to powder. don't get me wrong, the movie is funny and fairly entertaining, however, the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell (which occurs at the beginning of the movie) is just downright creepy.
