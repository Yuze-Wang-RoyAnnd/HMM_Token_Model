how could i best express my feelings about this movie: hideous? a headache? lack of coherent writing? plain stupidity? try all of the above for this travesty. and that just for the direction.<br /><br />story? well i guess there is a story. two dumb blondes look for a job after they crash a plane into a golf course. they are mistaken for a 'world renounced assassin' (sarcasm) and are 'hired' by two 'mobsters'. one thinks "taking him out" means a date, and the other gets the minor actor she dreams of. and of course, the turtle reserve for the farting turtle, that they build with the casino winnings.<br /><br />sounds likes all this could be funny? guess again. they try to make it funny, but its not. filming sequences aren't well done. i've seen better filming in hong kong movies. visuals are average for a late 80s film. but the problem is that its a 2007 movie.<br /><br />not worth my time to ever watch this again. it still doesn't beat danny glover's "out" movie from the early 80s as the worst movie of all time, but then again that film is in a class of its own.
