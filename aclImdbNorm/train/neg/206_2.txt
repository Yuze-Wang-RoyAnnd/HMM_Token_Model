i gave this film 2 stars only because dominic monaghan actually put effort through in his acting. everything else about this film is extremely amateur. everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed. not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films. as dominic monaghan is a very credible actor, placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful. whomever the "actor" was that played jack's best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera. i didn't expect much from such a small film, but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings. don't waste your time or money on this film (like i did) you will be sorely disappointed.
