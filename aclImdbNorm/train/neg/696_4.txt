eh, not a particular good slasher flick. so-so acting, effects, decent yet familiar and uninventive soundtrack.<br /><br />there are three deaths in close succession near the beginning of the movie that make for a fairly good scene in which it would seem anything goes. apart from that, there's a lot of characters wandering around, not realizing what's going on, or chasing after red herrings; more killing of time, than of people. there are other deaths, and the killer is an equal opportunity murderer, not partial to any one implement. the killer also likes to set other people up to kill innocent people as well. the identity isn't revealed towards the end, and motive is pretty thin, and we really don't care.<br /><br />supposedly the movie takes place around christmas, but this isn't a major factor. one scene gets lit by christmas lights, that's about it.<br /><br />the movie is rather dark with a muddy picture most of the time, at least on the videotape i watched. some of the dialog got a little lost in some of the opening scenes. the ending should have been stronger than it was. we think we realize what happened, although there's a chance something else did.
