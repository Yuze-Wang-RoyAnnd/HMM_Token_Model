chris rock, apparently desperate for a cozy star-vehicle which would cross his appeal over to white and mainstream black audiences, updates the hit 1978 comedy "heaven can wait" with an urban agenda. he plays a struggling comedian involved in a car accident who has his soul removed too soon from his body--consequently, his angels must find another body to place him in, and can only come up with that of a white businessman. rewriting a movie as bland and sentimental as "heaven can wait" only shows that rock's eye was on the box-office (this was strictly a corporate move organized by the most mercenary of hollywood players). why not strive for something loftier or more memorable than a silly reincarnation comedy that culminates with an evening at the apollo? terrific supporting cast (including the usually-reliable regina king, the wonderful mark addy, wanda sykes, eugene levy, and terrific frankie faison) do what they can, but rock seems awkward and unsure of himself throughout. *1/2 from ****
