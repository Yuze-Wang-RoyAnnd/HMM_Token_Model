i watched this with a growing sense of unease. why would god, in the shape of ian hunter, help these particular people in their attempted escape from devils island ? and what was he doing there in the first place ? i mean, i know god works in mysterious ways, but helping thieves and murderers and prostitutes find redemption, forgiveness and changes-of-heart in such a godforsaken location.... in any event it is hardly a likeable movie. whatever gable had by way of charm is missing in this portrait of a thoroughly selfish man, crawford is as endearing as ever she was i.e. to me, not at all, and the whole look of the film makes it seem as if it was made 10 years before.compared to contemperaneous films like "stagecoach" and "mr. deeds goes to town", this looks prehistoric.
