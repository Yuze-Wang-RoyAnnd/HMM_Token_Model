after a quasi-gothic, all-fruity music video, the movie starts with cassidy the lead singer killing herself. in a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll. we don't live n that world. the insipid band members decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence. when i say clown, i mean actual clown. he tell them they're all going to die via cassidy's ghost (the spirit possesses dora, one of the band-mates) we couldn't care less as the characters are all boring, vapid, and extremely horribly acted. written by adam hackbarth (an incredibly apropos surname if there ever was one), and directed by corbin timbrook (who after the attendant, and tower of blood, has to know that he keeps making crap for a living), this movie s a constant battle between the film's incompetence and the viewer's need to stay awake. not enough blood to appease gore-hounds, nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs. this movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone.<br /><br />my grade: f <br /><br />eye candy: amanda carraway gets topless <br /><br />where i saw it: starz on demand
