it's obvious that all of the good reviews posted for this movie so far are from insiders who were either involved with the film or who know somebody who knows somebody and have thus seen multiple cuts. well, i don't know anyone involved, and i've seen the final cut, and it is pure garbage. the only thing it has going for it is ambition and multiple cameos from horror legends (none on screen for terribly long). it's as if the filmmakers made this movie on a weekend during a horror convention and got actors like tony todd, tom savini, david hess and michael berryman to film scenes during their coffee breaks. this is an ultra-cheap, shot-on-video wannabe x-files with terrible acting from a cast of non-actors with more mullets than is acceptable in the 21st century. there is little or no action; it's all overly explanatory dialogue that attempts to explain a pointlessly convoluted plot. ther computer fx are a joke, but there aren't enough of them nor enough action to make this film enjoyable in a mst3k way. after about 8 straight scenes of nothing but talking, you'll find yourself reaching for the fast-forward button...and not letting go. absolutely worthless.
