don't get me wrong, the movie is beautiful, the shots are stunning, and the material is dramatic. however, it was a big disappointment and i actually left very angry at what disney had done.<br /><br />bbc's planet earth was all of the above and more. it was subtle. it had an overall feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death. there was tragedy and triumph, loss and gain. it was balanced.<br /><br />disney's edit of earth is none of this. they tried to make it a movie us americans would talk about. they made it dramatic. they put an over the top musical score there to frighten us. they made predators evil. they made walruses evil. they showed every encounter as negative. it tried to be suspenseful and succeeded, but at the expense of the lesson of balance. the movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about 10 minutes of positive.<br /><br />i am all for preventing global warning, but this was over the top political and environmental junk.<br /><br />that's another thing, i went to see it on the big screen, but was disappointed in the picture quality. it looked better on my tv at home.<br /><br />if you want to see something like this and get the whole picture, go out and buy, rent, or borrow the bbc's planet earth series. it is better lessons, better sound, and (if you have blu-ray)better picture quality.
