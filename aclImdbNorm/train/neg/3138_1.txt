i see people writing about how great this movie was. it was horrible! the acting was sub-par at best. it made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of leonardo. where the hell did they get the money? anyway, i wanted to learn more about the titanic; why it sank, what was running through a lot of people's minds; maybe even a little conspiracy stuff. does anyone realize that certain people didn't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off? no, you don't because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked (did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid?).<br /><br />i did cry in during one scene, though. the scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship. it looked like pool water! i'm thinking this movie made all this money and they couldn't even make the water from the ocean look real? unbelievable...<br /><br />ohhh the band played on while the ship sank.. just ridiculous. this was the worst movie until pearl harbor outdid it in the "nothing to do with reality" department.
