tim (gary daniels) wants desperately to break into serious television reporting. when a job he begged for goes awry, he is fired. his beautiful but empty girlfriend (elizabeth hurley) says sayonara, too. coming home, tim is startled to discover his house has an uninvited visitor (christopher lloyd) from the planet mars! calling him uncle martin, tim soon tries to help his new friend navigate life on earth. but, martin gets in trouble wherever he goes, from the bathroom to the laundry room and more. lovely lizzie (daryl hannah) finally sees an opportunity to make time with tim but the course of true love does not run smooth in this case, either. soon everyone in television is stalking tim, hoping for a story about a true alien. what's a man to do? for those who loved the old television show of the same name, with bill bixby and ray walston, this film is not worthy to tie the proverbial boots. its truly, undeniably awful, with no plot and a reliance on supposed special effects which fall flat, too. daniels is okay as the earthling but lloyd is simply terrible as the alien, overacting up a storm. the rest of the cast is adequate, as are the costumes, set, and production details. even if your children see the cover and beg for this film, convince them to pick out another flick at the video store. be assured, kids and adults will find this movie a colossal bore, so opt for a night at the museum or around the world in 80 days instead.
