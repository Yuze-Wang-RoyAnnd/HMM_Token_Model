although i had seen "gymkata" in a theater way back in '85, i couldn't remember anything of the plot except for vague images of kurt thomas running and fighting against a backdrop of stone walls and disappointment regarding the ending.<br /><br />after reading some of the other reviews i picked up a copy of the newly released dvd to once again enter the world of gymkata.<br /><br />it turns out this is one of those films produced during the '80s that would go directly to video today. the film stars champion gymnast kurt thomas as jonathan cabot, recruited out of the blue to infiltrate the nation of "parmistan" to enter and hopefully win "the game," a suicidal bloodsport sponsored by the khan who encourages his people by yelling what sounds like "yak power." the goal of the mission involves the star wars defense system. jonathan is trained in the martial arts by princess rubali, who never speaks or leaves the house. once trained tries to blend in with the locals by wearing a bright red sweater with dashes of blue and white. needless to say cabot finds himself running and fighting for his life along the stone streets of parmistan, on his way to a date with destiny, and the game.<br /><br />star, kurt thomas was ill served by director robert clouse, who it looks like was never on the set. the so called script is just this side of incompetent. see other reviews for the many howlers throughout. the town of crazies has a few good moments, but is ultimately ruined by bad editing. the ending...meh. still there's the germ of a good action adventure here. a hong kong version with more visceral action and faster pace might even be pretty good.
