"ambushed" is no ordinary action flick. it's much to bad to be ordinary. one man walks toward another with a machine gun blazing. the other man fires one round and fells the man with the greater fire power without so much as a nick from the hail of lead raining down on him. guess which one is the good guy. duh. such is "ambushed" through and through. not a good action flick, not a good drama, not a good movie, "ambushed" fails on all levels with it's cast of b-movie veterans mechanically going through the motions almost as though they know they're making a real loser. not recommended for anyone.<br /><br />
