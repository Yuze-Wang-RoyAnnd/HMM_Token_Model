cavemen was by far the biggest load of crap i have ever wasted my time watching. this show based on the geico commercials is less entertaining then an actual 30 sec ad for geico. the makeup was half ass-ed to say the least, hard to imagine a caveman with prefect white teeth even after going to the dentist. this show could of had potential for a funny series if they could of gotten the cast from the commercials, that in it self makes for a lousy show. perhaps if the writers were the same from the geico ads this may of had a chance, instead the pilot lacked a good story line. i give this show a 1 out of 10, i would of liked to put a zero out of 10 but that was not an option. i pray for a quick death to this show, i'd give it less then 5 episodes before it dies a deserving death.
