i actually didn't enjoy this movie.<br /><br />i saw it at a camp, and we didn't rave about it, we laughed at it. sure, some parts are touching, but the acting is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the whole overall movie idea is terrible (now, i know it was based on a book which i haven't read, but i hope that the book was better than this, because frankly, i thought that this movie was very bad and boring). like i said, i went to it with a bunch of people from a camp, and we were excited to be there, plus i got a caffeinated drink, but nonetheless, i struggled to stay awake. the only thing that kept me up (other than my fear of being embarrassed once i woke up) was the gunshots, that were quite pointless as well. i just really didn't like it.
