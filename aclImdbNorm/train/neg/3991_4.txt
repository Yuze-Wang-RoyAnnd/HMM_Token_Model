i'm not sure why spike lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor stevie wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess. i also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional blacks. the abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame. scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes, play as if some college kid wrote this. i especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up snipes. the overacting of the leads makes one feel as if spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about. the final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in. this movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the f-word in casual conversation. i am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker. i think his union with scorcesee in clockers was a wise move. he should stick to making documentaries like the four little colored girls. shock movies do not an oscar make.
