a terrible movie as everyone has said. what made me laugh was the cameo appearance by scott mcnealy, giving an award to one of the murdered programmers in front of a wall of sun logos. mcnealy is the ceo of sun microsystem, a company that practically defines itself by its hatred of microsoft. they have been instrumental in filing antitrust complaints against microsoft. so, were they silly enough to think this bad movie would add fuel to that fire?<br /><br />there's no public record i see of sun's involvement, but clearly the makers of this movie know scott mcnealy. an interesting mystery.
