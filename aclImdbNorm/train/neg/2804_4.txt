i've probably been spoilt by having firstly seen the 1973 version with michael jayston and sorcha cusack so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment. i just didn't get any chemistry between the 2 main stars. a lot of staring and theatrical acting just doesn't do it for me, and what was all that about putting tim in the role of rochester. had the casting director actually ever read the book. very strange! he's a fine actor but mr. rochester he definitely isn't! and zelah was just, well, strange, bit of a mix matched couple. in it's favour the supporting cast were pretty good and the lowood scenes for me were the best of the adaptation, but overall didn't capture any of the magic of the novel. certainly wouldn't ask anyone to watch it as a true adaptation of the novel. a real let down!
