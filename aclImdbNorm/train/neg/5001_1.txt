i don't know why i'm commenting this stupid reality-show i happened to watch a few episodes of(a cable marathon broadcast when they aired 5 episodes in a row or something,i didn't watch the entire thing though.only like three episodes)as i was nine months pregnant and about to go into labor any day.maybe i'm just bored today:-)<br /><br />i feel sorry for britney,i really do.for all her money and fame she seem to have very little sense of dignity.or she's self-centered to the extreme.she married the nitwit federline(okay anybody can make a mistake) and before that she "starred" this horrible show about her everyday life with him,where she shoves a camcorder wherever she feels like it,no matter if it is in someone's face or into the shower as federline is standing in there. she's babbling about her sex-life without leaving anything to your imagination,i don't care for my part,but i can't help wondering how she feels about it now when she's divorced.and yes,for her sake i'm embarrassed.but i shouldn't be.she seem to live a pretty empty,shallow life though.i don't want to swap lives with her even if i could. road-kill tv if you like.
