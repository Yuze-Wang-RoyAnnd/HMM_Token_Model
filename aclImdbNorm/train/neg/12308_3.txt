even steve martin and dan aykroyd couldn't save this movie from laying an emu-sized egg. based on the classic phil silvers tv series, it bombed because: a) it was updated to the 1990s, and b) the simple premise of the tv series was turned into a confusing, feeble and silly screenplay.<br /><br />the original tv series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovable characters acting out simple yet hilarious pranks. to expand this premise into a 1990s movie was asking for trouble, and it shows. no one could pay me enough to sit through this stinker a second time.
