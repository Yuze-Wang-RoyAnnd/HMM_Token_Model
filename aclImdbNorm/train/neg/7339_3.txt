maya is a woman without any interests. she just dreams her life away and wonders, why she does not feel fulfilled. this could be an interesting topic. that would need a good story, a nice setting and good dialogues. it doesn't have any of these. this movie is totally boring. there are only lengths and no climaxes.the only climax is shahrukh khan. but although i am a huge fan of his, i couldn't stand this movie. even he can't make this movie exiting. the movie is not as bad as "king uncle" and if you're an art-house fan or like it slow, you might maybe like it. it's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not catching. my recommendation: don't watch it.
