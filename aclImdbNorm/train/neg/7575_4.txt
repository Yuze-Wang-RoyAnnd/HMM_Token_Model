a retired diplomat, played nicely by michael york, goes to russia to get revenge on the russian gangster that murdered the diplomat's policeman son. there the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent russian cop who helps him bring the russian gangster to justice.<br /><br />i remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portray the russians as evil bad guys out to undermine the righteous u.s. government. it's interesting to see this time the russian guy as a hero.<br /><br />not a great flick, it's really typically a "b" action flick. michael york lends some class to this mediocre movie. alexander nevsky, who plays the russian cop is kind of "blah" but surprisingly has some chemistry with michael york. face it, michael york is such a good actor that he'd have chemistry with anyone he's doing a scene with. disappointingly, the handsome adrian paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie. now, if adrian paul was in this movie longer, it would've been an above average "b" action flick. all i can say about adrian paul is that he is real nice to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie. the villain, played by richard tyson, is your typical bad guy. he's very blonde and very villainous in this movie.<br /><br />rent this flick if there is nothing else on tv to watch. it's okay. it doesn't suck too bad. the action scenes are decent. the acting could be better, the plot could've moved much faster, but hey, you get to see what russia looks like today!
