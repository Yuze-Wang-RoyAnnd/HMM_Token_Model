nicole eggert was listed as the star of this, despite micheal dorn & stacey keach being much bigger stars than her.<br /><br />basically this is a bit of a spin on the "alien lands on earth" film. eggert plays the girl who feels sorry for an alien being chased by the military and takes in the runaway creature in her very sexy disguise. a bit of nudity and partial nudity, a pointless sex scene all feature along the way.<br /><br />the film stumbles through a few obvious set-pieces and running jokes about being shown photographs. i quite liked the star trek jokes when micheal dorn had been taken over and he got a really cool death scene.<br /><br />it was fairly obvious that stacey keach was going to be taken over and the film had quite a weak ending, it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the alien passed to eggert.
