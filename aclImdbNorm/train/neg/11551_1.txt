seriously, there is absolutely nothing good about this crap fest at all. randolph scott, a closet homosexual who lived with his lover cary grant for twelve years, is at his most wooden and boring in the least role. at 57 he was clearly far too old for these romantic roles, although it doesn't matter so much here because gail russell looks so much older than her 31 years and she is so ugly due to her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking. lee marvin plays his usual villainous role but it isn't enough to save this garbage. thank god they don't make westerns any more, they're just dated, racist old movies that glamorise guns and murder.<br /><br />0/10.
