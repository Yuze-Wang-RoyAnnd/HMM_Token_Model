there is a dvd published in the uk in 2002 code hrgd002 on the cover, no asin, vfc 19796 on the disk, no ifpi code in the inner rim.<br /><br />probably a straight transfer from vhs. <br /><br />there is no much point is commenting an adult film. but this one contains a minimal plot, and the characters are believable. it was shown in the united states in normal cinemas.<br /><br />i've seen it in pensylvannia way back in 1975.<br /><br />as such it deserves a place in an encyclopedia of movies. the dvd has no special features and no subtitles, and was probably made using a vhs tape as source
