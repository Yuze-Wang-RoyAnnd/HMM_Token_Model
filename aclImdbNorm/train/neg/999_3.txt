i saw 'descent' last night at the stockholm film festival and it was one huge disappointment. disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing rosario dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and, being a fan (sounds pervy, i'm not!) of 'rape/revenge' flicks of the 70's, i was needless to say very curious to check this movie out. my conclusion: let's stick to the classics! yes, the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat, the actors unconvincing. even dawson is empty. some would say that it's a right depiction of the college world in the us, that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial. just like the scene where dawson gets raped: it seriously lacks intensity! i wasn't expecting anything 'irreversible'-style but still, aren't we suppose to feel compassion for her? i didn't. not for a minute, she was so lame all the way ;-) and i read that the photography was impressive. well, it is good indeed but nothing ground-breaking either. i must admit that the screening at the festival wasn't so good so maybe i missed out something here but at the end of the movie, i couldn't help thinking 'i feel like watching argento's 'inferno' again. lol. more seriously, the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but i had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the american-canadian border in lynch's 'twin peaks - fire walk with me'... the crude red and blue lighting, the heavy bass music, the general lascivious/decadent atmosphere... no, i just couldn't get into this movie. too bad.
