perhaps the worst thing about carlos mencia's comedy is that every joke needs to be followed with an insult at the people in the crowd that aren't laughing. if there's anybody who's insecure, it's a comedian who won't shut up about his audience.<br /><br />then again, perhaps the worst thing about carlos mencia's comedy is that he doesn't get off his free speech high horse. if you want to be funny, just make a joke, don't explain all the reasons why you're saving the american way with your failed attempts at generating laughter.<br /><br />hmm... actually... the worst thing about carlos mencia's comedy is that it substitues meanspirited jabs at ethnicities for legitimate humor. avoid this like the plague.
