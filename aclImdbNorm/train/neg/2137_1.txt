even the first 10 minutes of this movie were horrific. it's hard to believe that anybody other than john cusack would have put money into this. with a string of anti-military/anti-war movies already being destroyed at the box office, it's almost inconceivable that a studio of any kind would want itself associated with this script.<br /><br />at first, it may have seemed like some kind of politically motivated derivative of grosse point blank with akroyd and cusack(s) all over again. but only about 90 seconds into the movie, it becomes obvious that this is a talentless attempt at dr strangelove.<br /><br />i liked so many of cusacks movies that i thought i would risk seeing the dvd of this one. i have to say that i don't know if cusack is sane enough for me to even watch another feature starring him again unless somebody else can vouch for it. cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred for george bush and the iraq war that he is willing to commit career suicide. tom cruise was never close to being this far gone. not even close.
