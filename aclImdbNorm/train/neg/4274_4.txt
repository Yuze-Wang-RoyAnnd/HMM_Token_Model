we are not in the fairy tale of the naked emperor. we may confess the truth of what we see, without being stupid, confess, that this show is in many aspects just incomprehensible and that it is clear, that much of it was created out of pure intuition without real concept.<br /><br />well, obviously many people like such stuff. i don't. i prefer well thought and planed shows. and i also confess, that the show is much to serious for my taste and boring...those love and drug stories...there are so many exciting soaps with lot of suspense (dallas e.g.), but twin peaks can't catch my attention. i don't care about those people, except cooper and gordon cole.
