<br /><br />as with the other episodes in this made-for-tv series expanding on the many adventures of the sea legend, horatio hornblower's super human infallibility ruins all chance for suspense.<br /><br />as little wesley crusher ruined many seasons of the next generation, horatio hornblower invincibly saves every situation. each and every clever solution inevitably comes only from the lips of horatio hornblower. immeasurably superior, hornblower's main trouble in this movie series seems to be tolerating the many error ridden characters above and below him in the chain of command. a perfect being makes for dull story telling. so superior is our hero, that even those who attempt to help him are powerless to do something correctly unless hornblower is there to direct and control their every move.<br /><br />what is the sense in telling a story about any person who cannot do wrong and will repeatedly win at everything every single time? what is the point of watching such a story?
