this movie probably had some potential for something; my bewilderment is how these utterly prosaic unfunny themes keep making it to theaters, it's as if ideas are being recycled just because generations are. truly the decerebrate oafs behind most films are like dogs, they return to ingest their own vomit. well, they're 19 bucks richer now because of me. this was not at all imaginative, there was no redeeming moment, anything remotely funny was shown in the trailer (and nothing amusing was in the trailer), performances were strained (especially molly's, totally unconvincing). what was theoretically supposed to be some comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a penchant for disney films; none of his analogies hit home, his little moral speeches were flat, i was literally waiting for them to go on to say something meaningful, only to find out he was done. the so-called "hard 10" is the most insipid plastic creature there is (apart from having a horse-like face with a weird smile); i honestly found her friend patty (referred to as the hamburglar) to be much better looking than her. but then again, gentlemen prefer brunettes ;) well, anyway, the whole premise is that society is superficial and if love is true it transcends all social facades; the way they showed this, with a dude shaving another's scrotum and the million-times-mutilated-and-beaten-to-death-horse premature ejaculation routine (with obvious allusions to american pie and happiness - the latter in the disgusting scene denouement involving the family dog). i feel as if the movie was like adjoining ridiculous jokes into an unformed wretched ball of raw sewage. goes to show marketing can push anything out there, shine whatever fetid mass and call it gold, people will come (worked for me). done with tirade.
