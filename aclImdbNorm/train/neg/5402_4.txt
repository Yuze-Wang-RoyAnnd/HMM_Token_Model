this film is so unbelievable; - the whole premise is bunkum; the fact that a serial killer (vampire or otherwise) could fly around untraced and kill as many people as the film implies is laughable. the vampire himself would not look out of place in a bela lugosi film. most of the acting is so wooden the actors should be treated for dry rot. i await the day when someone makes a decent film from a steven king novel (with the exception, possibly, of stand by me). this film suffers from what most stephen king films do - lack of money used for the "special" effects, poor actors, appalling characterisation and dialogue. this film is cheap, tacky and fails in everything it tries to do.
