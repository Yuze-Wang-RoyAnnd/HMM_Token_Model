i watched this movie last night and was a bit disappointed. a lot of the "time facts" were off. at the beginning of the movie, the grandfather made a comment to this grandson and his friends about how they felt when 9-11 hit. this movie was supposed to be taking place in 1994. also, one of the grandsons friends was wearing an eagles donovan mcnabb jersey. he hadn't even been drafted as of yet. the story line was good but the facts and actuality of the time frame was so far off base that it made the movie seem cheesy. my boyfriend is an avid reader of wwii books and memorabilia. i rented this movie hoping that it would be good. the acting was so-so. the dog was cute. but the way that this movie was carried out made me glad that i only paid 4 dollars to rent it as opposed to the 50 it would have taken me to watch it in a theater. i hope that who ever reads this understands that i mean no discontent to those who fought the war but the facts and time frame should have been a little more closely monitored.
