the film is a collection of cliche's on just about anything out there. it has no focus whatsoever, no goals, no real message. symbolism is pushed over the top and stereotyping is abundant and outrageous. this movie can't resist the temptation of making drama where non exists. every small exchange of words turns immediately into a lengthy, unjustified dialog that is so typical of an acting class rehearsal. where there is no substance to this exchange, the actors (regardless of how good they are normally) can't help but compensate with exaggerated emotion, aka "raising the stakes". over acting, to put it simply. the directing is of no help here. nothing can save this non-story. it is forced, faked and boring to tears. inaccuracies in portaraying punk rock with the who, piercings and flashy 90's outfits. characters wander without a role, detail and motive. locations are arbitrary. this is boogie nights cum the good fellas cum saturday night fever, with meaning and art ripped out.<br /><br />good dp. i'll give it that.<br /><br />some films have flaws. this film is lee's flaw. he sold out, like the rest of them. became irrelevant. he has nothing of interest to say anymore.<br /><br />i have no desire to see anything again from this guy (whom i'll refrain from naming from now on).
