in 1692 salem, a devious child's lies about a slave's involvement in witchcraft sends an entire community into an uproar. costume drama starring claudette colbert and fred macmurray isn't stuffy, though neither is it a vivid depiction of contagious hysteria. worked on by three writers (walter ferris, durward grimstead, and bradley king), the story elements are rather interesting (especially coming out of hollywood in 1937), though to anyone who has since read arthur miller's "the crucible", the hoked-up melodrama on display here won't be tolerated for very long. biggest problem with the picture may lie in the casting: colbert and macmurray are an ill-matched pair of lovers hindered by the witch-hunt, macmurray being far too contemporary a presence for these surroundings. *1/2 from ****
