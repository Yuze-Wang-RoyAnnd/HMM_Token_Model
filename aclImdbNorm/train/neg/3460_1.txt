oh man, does this movie ever bite! if you were ever afraid of seeing a rehash of the slasher genre, done as cheap as possible and as cautious at the same time (pc-friendly, means no nudity, a classic element of slasher films) cut is it. every cliche is retread without a hint of self-awareness and the acting. oh, the acting redefines the word horror. i should have known better as the direct dutch translation of the title would have tipped me off.
