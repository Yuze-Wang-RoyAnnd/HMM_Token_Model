i think that's this is awful produced and directed movie. benicio del toro shouldn't work in production of movies, he should put accent on his acting and that's it. steven soderbergh missed the whole point of the idea about revolution, about it's ideals, and most important about life of che guevara and so on. camera is awful, like someone with 2 day working experience is shooting with it, music is ...i don't know..is there some music in the movie???? i will not recommended this piece of sh.. to no one. it's just wasting about 4 hours in front of the tv or whatever.... i can't figure out how can someone rate this movie more than 3 stars. disaster....disaster....disaster....disaster don't watch please. save yourself from this misery of "movie"
