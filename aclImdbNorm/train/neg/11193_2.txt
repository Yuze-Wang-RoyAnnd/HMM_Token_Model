ok, i didn't have high expectations but this film descending into depths i could not imagine.<br /><br />the plot, as it were, involved a priest of an obscure 2 member order investigating the death of the founder of the order by a sin eater. the sin eater allows for catholics to achive salvation outside the authority of the church and is yet another immortal in film with loads of ennui. nevermind that this makes no sense since then a baptist could give you salvation....we'll move on.<br /><br />i'll layout the plot w/o giving much away: the priest goes to rome with his buddy to investogate. he brings with him a mental patient (i'm not making this up) who shot him during an excorism and who loves him (not one lick of this btw is explained), a drunk irish priest and peter weller as a cardinal. they get to rome, find some creepy kids who do nothing in the film, meet with a bondage gear s&m anti-pope that the drunk irish guy knows (not explained) and who gives information by killing people (oh, btw, he's a bad guy so he has an industrial/techno soundtrack) and then...umm, seriously, i'm not sure. the plot meanders about. heath chills with the sin eater, flies to new york with the sin eater for an overnighter and then some other stuff happens and then (all off camera) the anti-pope falls and the film ends.<br /><br />about 1 hour into the film one really wonder if anything has happened. by the end something has happened but you can't be at all certain that it matters and since most of the drama takes place either before the movei or off-scren you're really feeling cheated.
