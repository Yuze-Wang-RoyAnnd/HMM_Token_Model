i was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of tigerland. it was a liberal's fantasy of how the military should be. the dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things colin farrell's character was allowed to get away with by his superior officers.<br /><br />i kept thinking, "hey, there's a reason why boot camp is tough. it's supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit. there's no room for cocky attitudes and men who won't follow orders." i was rooting for bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers. i would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with people's feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit.<br /><br />--<br /><br />
