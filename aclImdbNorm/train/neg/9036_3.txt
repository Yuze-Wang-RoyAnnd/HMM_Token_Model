i can't believe i waste my time watching this garbage! i did because leonard maltin gave it an "aa" rating, and for tv movies this is usually a reliable indicator of some quality entertainment.<br /><br />the acting was ok, but whoever wrote it should be forever denied access to any medium of communication. the plot is ludicrous, the motivations of the "bad guys" totally absent, and the various family interactions silly and shallow. for example, dad preaches that violent reaction to aggression is bad, but he turns out to be an "admirable" person not because of his "ignore the idiots" philosophy, but because he's pretty good with his fists...<br /><br />the only message i was able to glean from this pap was that the nuclear family is good and alternate living arrangements are bad. oh, and bad people happen to good people.
