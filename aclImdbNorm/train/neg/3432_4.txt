a killer, cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder. at his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave. this of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look. the two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem, are back on the case. two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing. thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection. sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish.<br /><br />the acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays dr vincent van gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film. the other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out. now i'm all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible. if it wasn't for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness i would probably have fallen asleep. there is a bit of gore but it's never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims. the zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times. there is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. the doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing i have ever seen in a film. it is just a plastic toy on a fishing line.<br /><br />the ending is extremely bad. you would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does. god knows how they made enough money to make a sequel. <br /><br />4/10
