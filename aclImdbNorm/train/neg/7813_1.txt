in my eyes this is almost the perfect example of hollywood ego, only beaten by the new king kong movie. superman is the original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears tights. brandon routh was the worst superman i've ever seen, from the start of the movie u just wanna shove a chunk of kryptonite down his throat. he looks just silly wearing the costume. but enough about him, kate bosworth was a bad choise for lois lane, she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter, but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl. the plot was weak and predictable (wow, he is actually supermans son, who would have ever thought....) and the acting was horrible. this movie has one good thing going for it, and it's name is kevin spacey. his portrayal of lex luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie. what this movie needed was the cast of "lois and clark" (except kevin spacey of course) and a different story. i watched this movie after watching "the hills have eyes" and i was chocked to learn that there existed worse movies then that.
