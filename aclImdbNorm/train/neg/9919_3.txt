in the opening scene of "malta story" mr a.guinness bore such a startling resemblance to noel coward that i fully expected his first words to be "certain women need striking regularly - like gongs" or some such world - weary bon mot.unfortunately his dialogue is hardly deathless prose and even the master would have had trouble bringing it to life.indeed mr guinness wanders through the picture as if looking for a focal point and failing to find one.and therein lies the fatal weakness of the whole movie.mr j.hawkins likewise gives up early on and ends up giving a "jack hawkins" performance without an ounce of individuality.it could have been spliced from any of a dozen british war movies.many of the early fifties usual suspects turn up and do their schtick to very little purpose. the luftwaffe failed to bomb malta into submission in much the same way as it failed to bring london to its knees.the courage of the maltese people in the face of incessant danger was recognised by the king and the island was awarded the george cross.a worthy subject you might think for a movie,but "malta story" does not even qualify for the term "worthy" in its most patronising sense.it gives the appearance of being hastily cobbled together to meet a deadline,perhaps before the actors lost the will to live.
