a very cheesy and dull road movie, with the intention to be hip and modern, shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles, resulting only in sleepiness. <br /><br />the cast is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious. the only thing worthwhile is the top-notch lalo schifrin's soundtrack, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /><br />run if you can, the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved; it is really pure garbage. of course that this has its charm, of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire, but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do.
