(david h. steinberg)'s script seemed initially having some real smart points that could've made good romantic comedy, but but but, oh dear ! what did ever happen in the way ???!!!! <br /><br />i'll tell you what happened. originally it's (animal house - 1978) and (porky's - 1982). although that was long time ago, but those are the pioneers, the godfathers of the new genre : the crude teen comedy. then the 1990s came. after important instances that became smash hits (repulsive ones am i add) such as (problem child - 1990), (dumb and dumber - 1994), (the nutty professor - 1996), and (there's something about mary - 1998) which i think slackers is affected by, there was the top of the era and the prophet of the next era, the one and only : (american pie - 1999) which's undoubtedly and incomparably a genre's icon. after that i think every comedy of that kind got to be that highly filthy, cum laude nasty, to be admired by the youth otherwise it might be out of fashion !<br /><br />i believe that (slackers) had a smart plot first as a script, then its makers got to add some real big amount of : rudeness, filthiness, strangely shameless sex to be made - at those days - as easy as pie ! like they had to fill every scene with freely elements such as : masturbation, oral sex, urination.. etc just to look a la' mode. they're wholly unnecessary elements to the story but surely they are so necessary to make the profits, and to catch the latest vogue in making teen comedies. the problem is in how all of that has replaced already any possible comedy in it.<br /><br />some of its moments looked literally horrible, and that as you see is the point. it's all in (jason schwartzman)'s looks and performance; memorably disgusting to the utmost. so the ambition transformed from being that romantic comedy into making what wasn't done before of pure skinning images. to be more like a horror where you're asking all the time; what nastier would happen ? (vomiting, farting,.. etc); these are the easiest combination to create a comedy nowadays.<br /><br />though even if you hated it you've got to love something (mostly for being bold), for me it was only gina gershon cameo's scene. anyhow they designed it as a whole to achieve being outrages-for-outrageousness, like an adolescent's naughty dream. though the majority of it was near to anybody's nightmare.<br /><br />what made me sad is that this one at its core was a real potential work, and not another cheap, another stupid comedy as it eventually managed to be. remember well the details of stealing the exam (the first 2 minutes), so the movie's main plot (weirdo trying to reach a girl by blackmailing cool guys) through the pattern of (boy loves girl, and girl loves another boy) because save that, it's nothing but a candidly schlock. it dealt with its material the tacky way bunch of dirty college boys, who got nothing to do but making mawkish quip out of anything, would do. it ended up as being, and i'm sorry to say it, a smiling sh*t !<br /><br />at its end it said something (can you imagine !) about how it's the time and the place too for the impostor or the slack to win, totally like this comedy itself. it sounds good ending yet for totally another better movie; which could assure my opinion about this one as smart one.. once ! and it doesn't need much to understand that this movie's makers were the real slackers ! maybe being stupid is a way to be smart in hollywood, but even if.. the final result here wasn't at least witty by any sense of the word. <br /><br />p.s : its scriptwriter (david h. steinberg), who wrote the story of (american pie 2) as well, has a main page at the imdb where you'll find under the "additional details" his usual "plot keywords" which are : sex / vulgarity / crude humor /... they just forgot to write urineing while showering or baring 70 year old women !
