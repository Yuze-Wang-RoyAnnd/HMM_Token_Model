i had the misfortune of wasting 10 quid buying ss new movie on dvd: attack force. now i usually can suspend my belief watching films like this. a pinch of salt and some beers on a dark evening on the sofa watching a noisy late evening shoot em up is perfect for a single alpha male like me. i bought this film thinking i'd see cool martial arts and shoot em up.<br /><br />did i hell. segal is old and bloated, the plot was ludicrous even by ss standards and to cap it all off segal's acting (such as it was to start with) is exceptionally dire. so dire in fact that half of his voice was dubbed over by a man who sounded nothing like him. either ss cant act no more (a moot point) of the crew were so dreadful at their jobs they couldn't record the sound properly. the voice would flick back and forth between mr whisper segal and the man who does voice overs for honda adverts!<br /><br />plot wise isn't the issue because most action films work along the same premise as this one, nothing new there. the usual mix of characters who will die horribly as cannon fodder and stereotyped bad guys waiting to get blown away.<br /><br />avoid this film like you would avoid walking in front of a speeding train or a dose of h5n1 avian flu.<br /><br />utter garbage.<br /><br />1/10<br /><br />this has been a public health warning.
