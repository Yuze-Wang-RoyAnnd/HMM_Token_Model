i'm a big fan of westerns but this one.... whew, what a stinker! i think what turned me off almost right off the bat was the inane dialog. i think i could have written better dialog than this when i was in eighth grade. and the poor actors! given this terrible dialog, none of them came across looking anything but ridiculous. really, i'm not kidding. some of this is little better than what you'd get in an ed wood film. <br /><br />the biggest tragedy is sterling hayden. he was probably the "big" star in this movie which if you called it a b-western, you'd be lavishing praise upon it. this is what should be called a b-minus western perhaps. pity sterling hayden, who appeared at other times along with joan crawford, bette davis, frank sinatra, and other major talents. for him to appear in a vehicle this poor must have been something he tried to downplay for the rest of his life.<br /><br />one annoying thing about this movie is all the men look like they haven't shaved in a week and their faces are all greasy. i know in the old west guys weren't always well groomed but to a man this is a movie that makes you want to just go 'ewwww!' really, this is a crummy western. denver pyle also had to live this one down, especially after appearances in so many great westerns. bad, bad movie.
