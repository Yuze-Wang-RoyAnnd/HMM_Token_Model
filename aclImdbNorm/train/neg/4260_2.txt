yeah, right.<br /><br />i spent the first hour waiting patiently for the movie to take off. it was horribly boring, and consisted mostly of people riding randomly around the hills with no apparent direction. then the hero comes into the picture. born as an asian, but when he grew up, he became white. obviously white. he wasn't even close to passing for asian. he looked like justin timberlake. it was extremely distracting, and the story did nothing to help the cause. pointless battle sequences and lame dialogue. it's an hour and forty five minutes long, and by the end i was trying to eat my own face. i watched this because people at the video store where i work are always asking me if this movie is any good. now i have an answer. it goes something like this: ahem. "no! good god no! it's horrible! don't do this to yourself! i would recommend another movie, perhaps one that's entertaining."
