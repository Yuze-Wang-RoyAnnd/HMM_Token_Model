my first clue about how bad this was going to be was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us blair witch project which was a masterpiece in comparison to this piece of garbage. the acting was on the caliber of a 6th grade production of oklahoma and the plot, such as there was, is predictable, boring and inane. 85% of the script is four letter words and innumerable variations on them. mother f seems to be the "writer's" favorite because it is used constantly. it must have taken all of 10 minutes to write this script in some dive at last call. thank god i rented it and could jump through most of it on fast forward. don't waste your time or money with this.
