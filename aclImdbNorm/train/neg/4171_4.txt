i'd passed this title 15 or 20 times while in blockbuster, looking for something halfway decent to watch. all i can say is that they were all out halfway decent films the night i chose to rent this.<br /><br />i will give it credit for being leaps and bounds better than "dracula 3000", but in actuality that's pretty easy to say since this one didn't have caper van dien in it. the other things it lacked in spades were: an interesting cast, interesting story, good dialog and originality, but i suppose you can't have everything.<br /><br />***spoilers ahead*** the misfit crew of vampire hunters (one of which was a vampire... go figure) flew around from mining colony to mining colony trying to wipe out all the vampires it could find. the crew consists of: the cocky, ne'er-do-well captain (who dies early on), his by-the-book, yet inexperienced first mate, the aforementioned vampire vampire hunter (not a typo), a wannabe cowboy and a really, really butch asian commando, "tough guy" female... it almost sounds like the cast for mtv's 'the real world'. after the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a mob of bloodsuckers (and as it turns out, lovers of the finer parts of human anatomy) his first mate takes over... blah, blah, blah... everyone hates him... blah, blah, blah... i could go on, but as i said it's the same storyline used in about a hundred other 'films' of the genre.<br /><br />the effects were cheese and why michael ironside was in this movie is beyond me. the vampire vampire hunter (still not a typo) was pretty hot, but of course if you're waiting for her to expose more than just her cleavage, look elsewhere.<br /><br />i can't say that it was the worst film i've seen, as i actually rented 'starship troopers 2', but wait for this one to come on the sci-fi channel.
