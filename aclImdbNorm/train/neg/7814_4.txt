after a long period in the space, looking for the remains of planet krypton, superman (brandon routh) returns to earth. he misses lois lane (kate bosworth), who got married and has a son with richard white (james marsden). meanwhile, lex luthor (kevin spacey) plots an evil plan, using crystals he stole from the fortress of solitude, to create a new land and submerge the usa.<br /><br />after so many delightful movies of superman with the unforgettable christopher reeve, or tv shows like "lois and clark" (and teri hatcher) or "smallville", a great expectation was created for the return of superman in this bryan singer's version. unfortunately, the awful story is too long and boring, with many unnecessary parts, lack of emotion and overrated in imdb. in addition, the romance between lois lane and superman is something shamefully ridiculous. the twenty-two years old actress kate bosworth is wrongly miscast, playing the role of a mature reporter and experienced mother of a five years old boy. brandon routh is two years younger than tom welling, who plays a teenager clark kent in "smallville". the character of parker posey, kitty kowalski, is actually a silly caricature. last but not the least and in spite of being a terrific lex luthor, kevin spacey is forty-five years old, therefore older and older than the rest of the lead cast. the corny conclusion looks like a soap opera and is terrible. my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil): "superman returns"
