nut case is murdering college students, can new teacher stop the madness?!<br /><br />believe me, you won't care.<br /><br />with a title like splatter university, one would immediately gather that this movie just isn't high art. but worse than that splatter university doesn't even qualify for amusing garbage. splatter u is so poorly made - the story is mindless, the characters are throw-aways, and the whole movie lacks any essence of imagination. needless to say there is no suspense or atmosphere or scares. this drivel isn't even brave enough to throw in any nudity (for the cheapest thrill of all). so all around this endlessly flawed slasher offers nothing in the way of entertainment (not even cheap laughs) and just becomes a complete bore. bottom of the barrel folks - even die hard slasher fans will want to think twice before viewing, let alone paying money for this flick.<br /><br />bomb out of ****
