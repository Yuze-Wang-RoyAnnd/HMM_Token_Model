anyone who has said that it's better than hostel is talking complete crap, believe me i'm not a fan of hostel but this is just ridiculous. this is just another shot on camcorder, straight to dvd, low on ideas waste of your time, i can't believe how many of these films there are and i'm yet to see a decent one. in the 80's video nasties, gore and horror movies were made with no budget but a great story and a load of new ideas and most importantly the heart and soul of the director who had something to say. now they just seem to be pumped out in an attempt to trick people browsing in blockbuster to rent a copy, until people stop doing this then i guess these films will keep appearing. this film is so low on ideas it's just amazing how it ever got made, the acting is also terrible, the location completely unconvincing and the soundtrack is so annoying it beggars belief. this waste of time has absolutely nothing going for it, unless you're on a quest to compile a list of the worst movies of all time. my best/worst part of the film is when a female character is pointing a gun at someone and threatening to shoot them if they don't back off, you can see that she isn't even covering the trigger with her finger just holding the grip. an absolute joke.
