this movie was horrible. i could barely stay awake through it. i would never see this movie again if i were payed to. the so-called horror scenes in it were increadably predictable and over played. there was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the $7.50 i payed to see it. don't go see it, don't rent it, don't read about it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time. sarah michelle geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for sullying her good name with this movie. shame on you sarah for being associated with this horrible, horrible movie. horrible movie, no need to ever see it.
