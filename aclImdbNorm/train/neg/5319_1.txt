recipe for one of the worst movies of all time: a she-male villain who looks like it escaped from the wwf, has terrible aim with a gun that has inconsistent effects (the first guy she shoots catches on fire but when she shoots anyone else they just disappear) and takes time out to pet a deer. then you got the unlikable characters, 30 year old college students, a lame attempt at a surprise ending and lots, lots more. avoid at all costs.
