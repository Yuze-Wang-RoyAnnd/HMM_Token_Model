first of all my heartfelt commiserations to anyone who bought a cinema ticket in the hope of seeing a film in the same mould as the fantastic gregory's girl and local hero but ended up leaving the theatre feeling disappointed and vaguely cheated. while it's true that sequels are usually, bar a few notable exceptions, a mistake and exist merely to provide studio executives with an opportunity to cash in on the success of a previous film by offering us either a thinly disguised retread of the original story or a plot line so far removed from the intentions of the original that the resulting film makes no sense. in the case of gregory's two girls, bill forsyth has the dubious honour of managing to commit both sins - on the one hand revisiting the plot of gregory's girl, while at the same time serving up a frankly incredible and moronic storyline involving scottish arms dealers. schoolboy gregory is now a teacher at the same school where at the tender age of sixteen, he harboured a hopeless passion for the football playing dorothy. although now thirty five, gregory still harbours a hopeless passion but now for the football playing frances, also sixteen, despite the fact that music teacher, bel has made it clear that she is attracted to him. his passion for frances and his desire to impress her lead to his involvement in a scheme to expose a local arms dealer who also happens to be an old schoolfriend. there's no point in going any further as the rest of the story is forgettable and the ending makes no real sense at all. the main problem lies with the character of gregory himself, in that there is no sign of the endearing and charming sixteen year old gregory who actively and comically pursues dorothy convinced that he would eventually win her over. at thirty five, gregory is presented to us as a rather sad and friendless creature whose life is neither active nor comic. outside of work his time is spent watching videos of noam chomsky and reading magazines about international injustices. as his friends and family from the previous film have seemingly vanished, save two pointless scenes with his younger sister, who no longer offers him advice or seems at all interested in his life, we are left confused about what it is gregory really wants, who he is and why he is the way he is. why for example is he friendless? why does he never see his father, who is clearly still alive? why has he returned to teach at the school he once attended? why is he so interested in noam chomsky and injustice? why has he become so apathetic? why is he attracted to frances? why isn't he attracted to bel until the last twenty minutes of the film? what in heaven's name do bel or frances see in him as he is neither drop dead gorgeous or even interesting? why does he continue to try and impress frances even after he and bel have become an item and when their association threatens to completely disrupt his life? are we really to believe that a scottish arms dealer openly selling weapons of torture to oppressive regimes could manage to evade media scrutiny but fall foul of a couple of school-kids? does gregory really think that dumping a handful of computers into the sea will change anything? to make matters worse, actor john gordon sinclair attempts to rehash his performance as the adolescent gregory right down to the facial expressions and awkward body language. unfortunately on a thirty five year old it just comes across as odd and vaguely creepy. on top of that, it's hard to feel any sympathy for, or empathy with a teacher who has erotic dreams involving sex with one of their uniform wearing pupils while they both lie on a pile of gym mats. rather than being amusing it simply smacks of paedophilia. it's hard to know what was going through bill forsyth's head when he wrote this script or why he thought fans of the original film would embrace a story so completely lacking in the charm, wit and warmth that turned the first movie into a classic. i can only assume that the plan was to craft a film about a man who was refusing to grow up and commit to adult life and perhaps whose happiest memory was of being sixteen and pursuing the best looking girl in the school but who by degrees is forced to accept that a life lived in the past is no life at all.that at least could have been the basis of a film which was thematically interesting and intelligent. as it is gregory's two girls adds up 116 wasted and pointless minutes saying nothing and signifying even less. gregory's girl was responsible for launching bill forsyth's career, here's hoping that gregory's two girls won't be responsible for sinking it.
