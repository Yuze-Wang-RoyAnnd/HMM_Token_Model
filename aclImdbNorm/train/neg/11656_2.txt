scary movie 2 was a grave disappointment. simply referencing movies, like mission impossible 2 does not lead to comedy. the movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of james woods ands andy richter. the movie plummets from there unfortunately. the acting is awful. tori spelling looks and acts completely out of place. the movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced. some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie, involving joints and a previously mentioned tom cruise movie, werent funny to anyone in my theater. the movie, thankfully, comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending. (i say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor) i dont know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make miramax some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers. overall, a very poorly done movie.
