this film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness. while a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony, it certainly can't promote winning bridge, so the satire didn't work for me. but there were some items i found enjoyable anyway, especially with the big bridge match between paul lukas and ferdinand gottschalk near the end of the film. it is treated like very much like a championship boxing match. not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring, there is a referee hovering between the contestants, and radio broadcaster roscoe karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings. at one point he even enumerates "one... two... three... four..." as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event. and people were glued to their radios for it all, a common event for championship boxing matches. that spoof worked very well indeed.<br /><br />unfortunately, few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire. paul lukas doesn't have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast; lovely loretta young and the usual comic frank mchugh weren't given good enough lines; glenda farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film, but she practically disappears thereafter. what a waste of talent!
