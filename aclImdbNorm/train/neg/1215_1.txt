i don't often give one star reviews, but the computer won't let me do negative numbers.<br /><br />the opening titles tell us we're in deep water already. although this is a low budget exploitation film, there are 17 producers credited. no. no.<br /><br />at the beginning of the story abusive husband kenneth comes home to his family in an upscale gated community. the house is a pigsty. his wife, della (kim basinger) has let the children run amok all day.<br /><br />ok. we're already in deep water. ms. basinger was 55 years old when the film came out. uh, are these her children or grandchildren? it's christmas eve. della drives to the mall, a lengthy scene that could have been cut. to bludgeon home the idea of eeeeeeevil male aggression rampant in the universe she drives past football players in full uniform playing in pouring rain on christmas eve. sure. for a bonus she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer tied to it.<br /><br />we get some actual suspense in the driving scenes, though. it's raining and traffic is bad. first we see della try to drive and smoke at the same time. then later della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time, at one point turning completely around to check the cluttered back seat for the charger for the phone.<br /><br />she wanders the mall, sees an old friend from college, tries to buy stuff but her credit card is declined- gosh, maybe her husband is grumpy because he's going broke, but that's too complicated for the script to follow.<br /><br />in the parking lot she runs afoul of the most ludicrous gang in the history of films. one white boy (lukas hass watching his career go down the toilet), one black, one asian, and one hispanic. imagine a company of up with people gone to the bad and you'll have the idea.<br /><br />although they have a gun she gives them attitude. a mall cop comes to investigate the ruckus and they shoot him in the head, firing more than once. the parking lot is crowded as can be, people everywhere, and nobody notices.<br /><br />della escapes in her car and rather than choosing a police station or well lighted safe area, she drives to a construction site, where she kills all four bad boys one at a time with simply the tools (literally) at hand.<br /><br />major spoiler ahead.<br /><br />she drives back home. the car poops out so she walks through the pouring rain. checks on the children, goes downstairs, and when her husband petulantly asks what she got him at the mall shows him the gun and shoots him at point blank range.<br /><br />the experience with the four punks was supposed to result in personal empowerment for della. instead we know that her children will probably spend christmas in foster care or a group home, because the state will collect them while she answers to murder one charges. the four punks can be classified as justifiable homicide in self defense. the husband, different story.<br /><br />i'm so glad i saw this on cable. if i'd seen it in a theater (did it get any release?) i'd have been furious. as is, i'm just sad seeing talents like ms. basinger and mr. haas waste themselves on garbage like this.<br /><br />one very good thing, though. this was written and directed by susan montford. ms. montford has not gotten another writing or directing credit since passing this turd. there is justice in the world.
