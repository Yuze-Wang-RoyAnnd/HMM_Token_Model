the story is similar to et: an extraterrestrial run around on earth and tries to come back home. while its stay on our planet, it will create friendly ties with humans.<br /><br />but, unlike et which exudes drama, comedy, poetry, this movie is only fun. it is indeed a pure dysney production: its core audience are children & the movie is more more in the visual than in the message.<br /><br />thus, you will find some funny scenes (the first sighting of the town, a "cosmic" stray toaster) and the casting is experimented, with special mentions to "doc", who rejuvenates in a "mac fly" character, and to hurley, who seems open to auto-derision.<br /><br />ice on the cake: the main title is scored by danny elfman, and like every other great composer, you recognize his "voice" before he is even credited.
