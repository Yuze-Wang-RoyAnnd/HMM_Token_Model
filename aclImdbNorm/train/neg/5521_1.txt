i just came from seeing this movie and decided to see what others thought of it. i'm left wondering if these people who give glowing reviews saw the same film! this is potentially a very good story, but it fails to hit the mark. the script is very weak - the plot has so many holes that it would make a great dip net for the fishing scenes. the characters were not well developed and the storyline jumps around so much that i found myself asking the question "how did we get here?" at least a half dozen times during the movie.<br /><br />there was a lack of any chemistry between the cast members. this is probably related to lindsay lohan's antics during the filming. it was pretty clear that everyone showed up and did their job, but didn't commit to their roles.<br /><br />this is not a movie worth seeing...go for a walk, play a board game, take a nice warm bath and save your money for something that's worth it!
