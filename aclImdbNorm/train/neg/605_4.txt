i'll keep this short as a movie like this doesn't deserve a full review.<br /><br />given the setting, this movie could have been something really special. it could have been another "28 days later" or even a "blair witch project"<br /><br />the first 20 or so minutes of the movie i was really excited, directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense, although i don't think he managed to capture true eeriness of an empty london underground.<br /><br />characters were a big let down. our "heroine" in this movie is a worthless piece of crap, and you really don't care if she dies or not. as many people have said before, i was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy, who managed to give me a chuckle or two(whether intentional of the writers or not).<br /><br />the main villain, is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie, but when he is revealed i was really disappointed. i won't spoil it but lets just say my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match.<br /><br />all in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple hollywood formula. this film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark.<br /><br />just to highlight how lame this movie was, the characters in this movie had at least five times to finish off and kill the main villain. instead they run away.
