a great concept gone wrong. poor acting, even worse writing....after watching the first two episodes i was wondering why it ever made it to season two. the characters are forgettable, the writing is poor, the sets are just ok. the special effects are simply sad - so much better has been made in the same time-frame - where is the money going on this one? the first episode starts out interesting then goes downhill fast - the precept of the whole show is just silly. now don't get me wrong, i am a huge sci-fi fan and 'geek' - but this show simply doesn't cut it. as i said in the beginning, i am truly surprised it made it to season two - so much better has been canceled after only one season (jake 2.0 for example). this show was just bad.
