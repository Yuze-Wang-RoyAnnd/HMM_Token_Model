this was longer than the ten commandments, all lord of the rings and the matrix trilogy combined. my oh my, what a nightmare. this is the single biggest over-hype of 2006. there is not a moment that is not scripted and clich'ed. movie musicals can be done brilliantly and bring genuine excitement to the viewer. dreamgirls takes the route of chinese water torture, in the form of endless music montages, shoddy acting, and poor directing choices (seriously, mr. condon, did you have to do the old billboard countdown shots? it's at #58! no wait, look its rising up the charts and here is the passing billboard notice to show you again....and again....and again)
