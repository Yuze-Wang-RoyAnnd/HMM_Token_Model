this movie stinks. i don't think i have ever seen a movie so strung up on shock value. the plot was relatively interesting, but the dialog was super flat and the acting was bland. this could have been an a good movie. i think it just relied on it's grotesque visuals. i can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos, but it felt like miike shot it for the sake of shooting it. just one poorly executed film. there just isn't anything to be entertained by watching this film unless you are fascinated by exhausting yourself with explicit scenes of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, self milking, parental and sibling abuse, and fecal dispersement. i think i just sold the film to many of you, but i meant it when i said this stinks. he has succeeded in other films, but i think you'd be better off watching someone pooping.
