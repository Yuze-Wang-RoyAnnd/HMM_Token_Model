"i just viewed this movie last night and i don't think i will ever think the same about any of the actors involved, because this movie will stick in the back of my mind."<br /><br />the above statement can be thought of as a good or a bad thing. i mean every time i see tom cruise or demi moore in a movie, i think of "a few good men" which is a good thing. now, every time i see ron perlman or kristy swanson, i will think of "tinseltown" which is a very bad thing.<br /><br />i picked this up thinking that it might be something intelligent or at least make me chuckle and with arye gross and the aforementioned swanson and perlman, i thought that it at least wouldn't be bad. you could tell the movie was made on a budget the size of wheeling, indiana (where? exactly.), but maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie. wrong.<br /><br />this movie is not funny or entertaining in any sense of either word. it is just there and lasts for 84 excruciating slow minutes.<br /><br />the characters are paper-thin. you almost care about none of the characters, and since the leads are two struggling hollywood writers with a dream that is all the two struggling writers with a dream who wrote this need you to know about them. okay, the two real writers know all about there onscreen versions of themselves, so they figure so does the audience. they don't even think about character development, except for trying to tie there story back to "gilligan's island".<br /><br />the plot is unoriginal. two guys live in a storage center, where one of them stores a bed, and there are about twenty other people living there, too. the rest of the story is contrived and stupid. have you seen "national lampoon's favorite deadly sins"? the second story with joe mantegna is about a television writer who can't find a good story to make a tv movie about, so he creates one. now substitute the television writer for a screenwriter, morph mantegna into to annoying actors half his age, and take away the comedy and you have this movie.<br /><br />the actors try. kristy swanson is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie. she is still hot, but it would help if she would actually star in a movie instead of constantly making cameos. as for everyone else, i don't think it was the actors fault because they have bad material<br /><br />go watch the national lampoon's movie, but stay away from this movie.
