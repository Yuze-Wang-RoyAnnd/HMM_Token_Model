i've come to realise from watching euro horror, especially films made by cult luminary jess franco, that you can't expect a plot that makes much sense. however, franco has gone overboard with this film; and despite a surreal atmosphere, and the film's reputation as one of the director's best - succubus is unfortunately is a truly awful film. i've got to admit that i saw the american cut version, which runs at about 76 minutes; but unless it was just the logic that was cut, i'm sure the longer european version is just as boring. the plot has something to do with a woman marauding around; practicing s&m and talking rubbish, and it's all really boring. there's no gore and the sex is dull, and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film; i had difficulty making it all the way to the end. i have to say that the locations look good and franco has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere; but the positive elements end there. jess franco is definitely a talented director that has made some classic trash films - but this looks like it was one he made for the money, and overall i recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director's more interesting works.
