the real irony is this: joe besser was a top notch comedian, in other situations away from the stooges. he had a definite track record for being very funny and clever. moe and larry and shemp had actually known him or at least of him for many years and liked his work. so what on earth was going on when he joined the troop as the "third stooge"? obviously, nothing. in most of these "late stooge" era shorts, more often than not, the boys are pitted against each other or joe against the other two and this is not accurate stooge etiquette. "one for all, all for one, every man for himself", to quote curly from "restless knights". one thing about a good comedy team, laurel & hardy, abbott & costello, the marx brothers, no matter how much they all try to take advantage of each other or slap each other around, when the chips are actually down, they stick together and come to each other's aid. in this particular one, none of that happens. it's almost like watching a dog fight as one tries to cheat the others or be mean and nasty, and not for comedic effect either. one might assume that there was something behind the scenes going on here, art imitates life. maybe there really was hence why besser did not stay very long with moe and larry. just look at the history of the other teams and tell me i'm wrong.
