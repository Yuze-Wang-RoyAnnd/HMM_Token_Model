sure, it had some of the makings of a good film. the storyline is good, if a bit bland and the acting was good enough though i didn't understand why olivia d'abo had such a pronounced australian accent if her character was supposed to have been raised in the us. my biggest problem, however, was with the wardrobe. i know as rule, the average american is considered a frumpy dresser by any self-respecting european but this was beyond that. anna's colour combinations were positively ghastly!! and that potato sack-like, sad excuse for a coat she wore throughout the film made me break out in hives. i suppose the idea was to be as realistic as possible (how many school teachers walk around in prada?) but simple doesn't mean an absolute lack of taste. a word to the wise...
