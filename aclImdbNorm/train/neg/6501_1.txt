this movie is once again, one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to make others think that they understood it. anyone who tries to make any sense of this is a moron! my advise would be to take two not one but two hits of very strong acid and at least you'll get a visual thrill out of it!! although at the end you may kill yourself for wasting your acid!!!! being that this comment requires 10 lines of info, let me write something for those of you that will try to defend the movie. unintelligble. garbage. schitzoid. waste of talent. movie is ice, with paper on destination with ringing clouds, on a sunny dive in the pudding.... sounds like lion in a red light with seeing hair. now explain that to me!!!!
