i just couldn't stop laughing!! this movie is incredibly funny and stupid! but, never mind that, it is very entertaining! in this film, you don't need to pay attention to anything! the acting is the same - lame! the dinosaurs are the same - rubber (oh, my i could see the stick that holds t-rex head for a moment.) the raptors are the same from the carnosaur 2, t-rex is also the same, but... in some scenes his head looks kinda stuffed and it looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten. action is fast, sometimes too fast, actually i talk about fast editing, they edited it so fast, so that we cannot see the rubber dinosaurs, but oopps! to late, they are rubber! well, only things interesting here is to see rick dean in this sequel.<br /><br />what can i say... don't rent it... watch it on tv, with friends, it is much more entertaining!
