i doubt jigsaw was hip even at the time, the whole lsd theme married to a murder mystery being a patently obvious attempt to grab a young audience of the era without in the least truly showing any understanding of the sixties counterculture. the dated aspect aside, jigsaw suffers from many problems, including overwrought acting, silly and stilted dialogue, lsd flashbacks that go on interminably long even after the point has been hammered home in the first 60 seconds, a failure to create any true suspense even though the actual plot is, on paper, a great vehicle to do just that, and an ending that is so trite and predictable (not to mention reminiscent of a lot of bad television shows) that the climax is actually an anti-climax. if it was a better movie, we might be able to suspend disbelief on a few things where it would help enjoyment, but the weaknesses are so glaring they only serve to highlight the improbabilities viewers might otherwise overlook. i saw jigsaw on television and it is definitely late night tv fare meant to fill airspace and pass the time to kill somebody's insomnia rather than anything anybody ought to actively seek out. at very best, a three out of 10.
