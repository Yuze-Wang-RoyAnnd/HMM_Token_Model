i had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time, after seeing "return to paradise," which i found to be gritty. i was so disappointed. the most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable ending which i think was partly stolen from "return to paradise." <br /><br />maybe i was expecting too much. <br /><br />on the positive side danes, beckinsale and pullman were fantastic in their roles. although i didnt like danes's character and first and found her very annoying. <br /><br />i couldnt see anything realistic about the film. it could of been done so much better, for example there could of been more emphasis on the prison conditions and the sheer horror. it was too cheery a movie to be realistic. there could also of been more action and tension<br /><br />the best thing about this film is the "tragic" ending. i couldnt of predicted that. but by that time i really didnt care what happened to them.<br /><br />3/10
