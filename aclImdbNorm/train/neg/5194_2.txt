don't get me wrong , i want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy. i shall digress now. the writing, though, was unrealistic. a pta mom dealing drugs but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of an underage person. give me a break. the smugness of very pretty mary louise parkers character was an insult to my intelligence. the characters were not at all likable. basically, the plot lines went nowhere. i understand its only tv land . the hypocrisy was blatant. mary louise parker is supposed to be a great mom and i am supposed to believe this.... why ???? i just got the feeling i was being preached by a show reeking of seediness. its like saying its ok to cheat on your wife , but with someone of legal age status. ok not exactly the same thing , but i think you people get my point. that save the children stuff is wonderful for campaign trails , i guess, but it does not hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburbanite mom , as the local pot dealer.
