fred olen ray is a lousy director, even as far as b movie directors go, but 'haunting fear' is probably one of his better films. yes, it does butcher the great poe story 'premature burial' and yes, it is badly paced and uneven throughout, but it is also pretty entertaining. scream queen brinke stevens is better than usual as a pretty, fragile housewife whose worthless husband (jay richardson) is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster (played by robert quarry). delia sheppard, a veteran of many early 90s soft-core movies, actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress. you will also enjoy small roles played by karen black as a psychic, robert clarke as a doctor and michael berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes. the ending didn't make much sense!
