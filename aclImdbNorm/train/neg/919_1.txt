although i have to admit i laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies i saw.<br /><br />the budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors. the production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch. reminds me of the robot monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on.<br /><br />in one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off. geez, hard to believe but the black knight scene from holy grail was more realistic. i kept wondering why the victim didn't start shouting " none shall pass" and " it's only a flesh wound, i've had worse". it was one of the funniest scenes i've seen in the past year.<br /><br />the "gladiator/demon" was a stitch too. between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical.<br /><br />truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable. kind of like seeing a slow motion auto accident on film.<br /><br />
