scary.. yes scary!! jam-packed with nudity (from fat people to skinny people), maslin beach takes place on a nudist beach in s.a.<br /><br />i first saw this film two years ago - it's safe to say it made a bizarre topic of discussion at school the next day. this film was horrible! hardly a romantic comedy - just a showcase of nudity! this movie hit its lowpoint with one of the new-age characters staring down between a girls legs.<br /><br />girl: you're not going to find god in there! guy: nah, but i think i found heaven.<br /><br />steer clear of this one, unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics such as farting, adultery and the process of superlguing one's genitals together. avoid!
