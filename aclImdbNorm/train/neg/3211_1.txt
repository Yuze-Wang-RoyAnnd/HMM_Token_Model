and it falls squarely into the category of "awesomely bad" - ie a movie drunk students would rent to get a kick out of. i was at the sci fi movie festival and all i remember is a wave after wave of hysterical laughter as this movie premiered. other critiques will better describe this movie's fecal nature, and i felt oh-so-bad at the poor guy from the production company who had turned up, obviously to gauge the audience's reaction. what he got was the sci fi equivalent of a drunken student audience, and after a "serious" anime movie, i think it was "sky blue", the audience was in a sombre mood, and then this movie opened and within seconds everyone in the room was rolling in the isles. i will bullet point the worst parts;<br /><br />script: the funniest, and worst part of this movie, it clunks along a linear and predictable road with the occasional ill-thought-out aside. rubbish, but eminently laughable.<br /><br />animation: poorly done, and put together, if you can put up with drab backgrounds and gradually skimpier costumes for the heroine (i know i can!), then watch out for the montage where she "trasforms" from a swedish peasant girl into lady death!!!<br /><br />characters: so one-dimensional its painful, there is a brief backstory (with side-splitting lines of dialogue) and little light is shone on the actual motivation behind some of the main characters.<br /><br />so, in a nutshell, if you've got a captive audience and a few beverages lying around (try and make sure they're alcoholic to ease the pain), then slip this movie into the dvd and get in a "mystery science theatre 3000" mindset. there is no other motivation to watch this movie other than to laugh at it, and its not meant to be a comedy. do not watch this movie alone. it could possible be even more boring to watch solo than "new world" with colin farrell as you won't be able to have a laugh at the ridiculousness with a friend or two.
