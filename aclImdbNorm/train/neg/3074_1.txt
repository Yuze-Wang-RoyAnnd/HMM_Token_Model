even for the cocaine laced 1980's this is a pathetic. i don't understand why someone would want to waste celluloid, time, effort, money, and audience brain cells to make such drivel. if your going to make a comedy, make it funny. if you want to film trash like this keep it to yourself. if you're going to release it as a joke like this: don't!!! i mean, it was a joke right? someone please tell me this was a joke. please.
