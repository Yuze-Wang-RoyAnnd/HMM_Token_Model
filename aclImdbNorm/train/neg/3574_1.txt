i simply could not finish this movie. i tuned out after what i would say is my nomination for the most wretched attempt at sexual suggestion award: a scene in which pia zadora, at a picnic, stands between two boys who want her. one (the good boy) pleads for her to see the error of her ways. the other (the bad boy) simply asks if she'd like a hot dog, which he then holds out for her. at crotch level. i hope i'm not spoiling anything to say she turns, and takes the hot dog, with a smile. just pathetic.
