somewhere between the food court and zip's, the mall in this film<br /><br />has an explosives store. this is the only place the title character<br /><br />can purchase the bomb he plants in the mall in the dull finale.<br /><br />a fictional town has a new mall, built on some land that was<br /><br />condemned. cute girl (i didn't catch her name) gets a job as a<br /><br />waitress there. she lost her boyfriend in a fire at the site where the<br /><br />mall stands. the villainous mall owner hires the arsonist<br /><br />responsible for the fire as a security guard after his first security<br /><br />guard ends up dead. rob estes, eons before "silk stalkings," is a<br /><br />photog/reporter trying to find a story. he hooks up with cute girl,<br /><br />and their mutual "funny" friend pauly shore, and try to find out if eric<br /><br />is still alive. he is, living in the mall basement (?) and traveling<br /><br />through the air ducts and offing different people who upset his<br /><br />former girlfriend, including the arsonist. eventually, he kidnaps her<br /><br />and the finale involves the bomb and everyone running from the<br /><br />scene before the big kablooey. morgan fairchild is along for the<br /><br />ride as the mayor...yes, she's the mayor.<br /><br />of course, you probably did not need a plot sketch since the entire<br /><br />story is in the title. someone named eric is taking revenge against<br /><br />people as a phantom of a mall. this also means there is no<br /><br />suspense. we know eric is behind this, but we still have to see<br /><br />estes and cute girl go through the motions of a silly investigation.<br /><br />watch as fairchild, who we know has been in cahoots with the<br /><br />mall owner all along, pull a gun on our heroic duo in the middle of<br /><br />a crowded party, yet no one says a word as she leads them to her<br /><br />office, and her eventual death. the fictional town is huge, yet nary a<br /><br />policeman is ever called, everyone relies on mall security for order.<br /><br />eric has been hiding since the mall was built, but i am not sure<br /><br />where. he seems to live in a basement area, but you would think<br /><br />some construction worker would have found him. he also has<br /><br />furnished his love pad quite well, and found a few outlets, since he<br /><br />has electricity. it might be nicer than your own apartment!<br /><br />pauly shore fans, both of you, take note. he tricks a security guard<br /><br />out of his booth by mooning the camera. yes, stop scanning<br /><br />celebrity skin and playgirl, this is where you get to see a grainy<br /><br />black and white shot of pauly's south shore, although no weezil.<br /><br />this is just junk, and proof positive that i am down to renting just<br /><br />about anything at the video store to stay in the horror section. this<br /><br />film is not eric's revenge, it is the film maker's revenge for me<br /><br />being dumb enough to watch it. here is my revenge: i do not<br /><br />recommend it. that'll show 'em!<br /><br />this is rated (r) for physical violence, some gun violence, gore,<br /><br />some profanity, some female nudity, brief male nudity, and some<br /><br />sexual content.
