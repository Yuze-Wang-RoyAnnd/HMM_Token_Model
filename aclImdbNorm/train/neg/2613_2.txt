this sequel is thoroughly uneven, incoherent and rambling in "plot" (if there really is one)and tries too damned hard to be modern (ridiculous, out of period and character 21 st century style songs predominate) and cute (yawn: there are too many manufactured, belaboured jokes with animals.) the actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot. even glenn close (and she is normally very good) sweeps through this film, parodying herself as the original de ville and the lead from sunset boulevard! it's a film that isn't even good to look at. this is a very good example of a bad and pointless sequel. even basic instinct 2 had a plot, characterisation and acceptable acting. this doesn't. it is bad.
