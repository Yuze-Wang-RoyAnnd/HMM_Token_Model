beast wars is a show that is over-hyped, overpraised and overrated. let's meet the characters of this obnoxious show whose creators must have been on acid to try and make a show like this.<br /><br />cheetor- seriously, they need to have censor bars on this guy. how come he dosen't creep out the viewers having the same voice as baby taz? (at least razzoff from rayman 3: hoodlum havoc is voiced by slip & slide) action blast- if you want a line of show that suck, get g4 tranceformers cybertron- a show that should go down in a toilet. good job creators (sarcasm) show it self-retarded & boring (at least the super mario games are better) this show had a lot of followers sayin' bring it back, but i believe that it was cancelled for its own good.
