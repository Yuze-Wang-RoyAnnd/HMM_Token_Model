basically, take the concept of every asian horror ghost movie and smash it into one and you get this movie. the story goes like this: a bunch of college kids get voice mails from their own phones that are foretelling their deaths. there's some s*** going on with ghosts, which if you've seen any asian ghost movie, isn't scary by now. this movie was quite upsetting because it's very clich'ed. it's the same bullcrap, different movie.<br /><br />the acting was pretty good. unfortunately the actors are put into a very ring-esquire situation, so it's nothing we haven't seen in the past. the two lead acts did a solid job though.<br /><br />as far as gore, there's not much going on. we get a cool sequence that includes an arm twisting a head off (i don't know how else to explain that), but it was cut away so you don't see anything except the final result. you see some blood at times, including decapitated arms and a zombie (that looked really cool i might add), but this movie isn't too bloody.<br /><br />the scares in the movie are few and spread out, and it's really not that scary. you'll get some creepy images at times, but it's not enough for me to consider scary. it's nothing different from ringu, ju-on, or dark water, and none of those scared me either. that's really the downfall of this (and most asian horror movies) is that if it doesn't deliver the scares then it's just not that good.<br /><br />as far as directing, takashi miike still did a pretty good job. he seemed a little tamed in this movie compared to his past movies, but he still portrays a lot of his messed up style he's become famous for. a lot of images were a lot like miike (including a scene with a bunch of jars of dead fetuses), and the last 15 - 20 minutes seemed far more miike then the rest of the movie. still, the movie is flawed by its unoriginality.<br /><br />i would recommend this only to people who are huge on asian horror movies (even if you are, i can recommend much better) or big miike fans. warning to those who want to get into miike, this is not his best work.<br /><br />i'm giving it a 4 because it's just mediocre. perhaps if this was released 4 or 5 years ago it might be worth a higher rating.<br /><br />also, i'd like to b**** about asian horror movies real quick. how come if it's an asian horror movie it's automatically suppose to be good over here (us)? a lot of these movies are the equivalent in japan to what scream, urban legends, and i know what you did last summer were over here in the 90's. if you've seen one you've seen them all. and a lot of these movies rely way too much on scares and imagery that if it doesn't deliver the scares they set out to do then they're just not that good, and nothing would change that. more asian horror films need to be more like audition and a tale of two sisters, two movies that if they don't frighten or scare you, at least they have great stories, acting, direction, cinematography, and much more to back them up. two movies that aren't just great horror movies, but great movies in general. more asian horror movies need to be like these instead of the clich'e, "a ghost just wanted to be found so it went around killing people through their phone/video tape/house/electric appliance/water pipes/google search engine/vibrator/groceries/etc."
