this film is a massive yawn proving that americans haven't got the hang of farce. even when it has already been written for them! the original film "hodet over vannet" is a witty comedy of errors that i would rate 8/10. it isn't just about a linguistic translation, but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely, robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap "oops there go my trousers" style of farce.
