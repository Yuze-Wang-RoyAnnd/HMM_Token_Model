i saw this movie years ago in a group tradition of fast forward film festivals, where we would set out to rent a bunch of b-movies and vote for who picked the worst.<br /><br />the night we watched this, it was voted the best, due to semblance of plot and fun costuming.<br /><br />this is certainly a silly, kitschy, movie, to be watched under the full understanding that you are watching low-budget fluff. personally, however, i wouldn't recommend additional substances ... this movie will leave it's own mark on you.<br /><br />it made enough of an impression on me that i've actually been trying to get my hands on a copy for a few years.<br /><br />a good choice if you are setting out to watch bad movies. this one is fun, and i remember bouncy music ...
