this movie is a muddled mish-mash of clich'es from recent cinema. there are some promising ideas in there, but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film, what he ended up with was a confusing mess. lead actor daniel wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn't have much to work with. furthermore, the movie is largely devoid of scares (although, in fairness, there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery).<br /><br />*mild spoilers*<br /><br />we have the mysterious death of an estranged twin, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by savage monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and crime gang connections. the only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. <br /><br />perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the dvd cover, the act itself is never directly portrayed. instead, director julian lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - not very scary.<br /><br />*end spoilers*<br /><br />avoid this one. for an excellent psychological, ambiguous horror tale, check out the korean film a tale of two sisters (2003).
