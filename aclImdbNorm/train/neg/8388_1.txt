comes this heartwarming tale of hope. hope that you'll never have to endure anything this awful again. *cough* razzie award *cough*<br /><br />i disliked this movie because it was unfunny, predictable and inane. while watching i felt like i was in a psychology experiment to determine how low movie standards could get before people complained. when i requested my money back at the end of the movie i was informed that because i watched the whole thing 'i wasn't entitled to reimbursement'. i was told by the assistant manager that several people had complained and gotten refunds already though.<br /><br />the movie summary is pretty basic. the midget thief steals a diamond and the poses as a baby to elude police. underneath this clever outline however, lies a repertoire of original, fresh and hilarious skits. or not.<br /><br />ask yourself the following: do you like to see people getting hit by pans? do you like fart jokes? do you like to see midgets posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus? do you like tired racial jokes? do you think babies say 'goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa'? do you drool?<br /><br />if you answered 'yes' to any of the above then this movie is definitely for you. although it has been billed in some places as 'the worst movie of the decade', there is probably a movie or 2 that are worse...somewhere. i can't say for sure. i gave this movie 2 stars because we all know a review with only one star would indicate bias on the part of the reviewer and then the review wouldn't be taken seriously. <br /><br />this lowbrow comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience and i cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. save your money for something funny.<br /><br />respect
