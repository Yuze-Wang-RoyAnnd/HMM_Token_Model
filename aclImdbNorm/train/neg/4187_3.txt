a film written and directed by neil young, "greendale" is little more than an 87-minute music video set to a doxen or so of the songwriter's works. in lieu of dialogue, the film relies exclusively on young's lyrics, which are heavily laced with sociopolitical commentary, to tell the "story" while actors act out the scenes.<br /><br />given the hammy performances and the shoddy graininess of the picture, the effect is the equivalent of young blowing up some of his own home movies and releasing them for public consumption. although there is allegedly a "story" running through the film, we really have no idea what is going on thanks mainly to the unpolished look of the film, the lack of dialogue and the amateurish ineptitude of the acting. all we get for eighty-seven minutes is a bunch of aging hippies cavorting silently through an incoherent narrative while young's songs play endlessly on the soundtrack. the whole thing turns into a tedious exercise in self-indulgence. "greendale" gives off-hollywood, low budget movie-making a bad name.
