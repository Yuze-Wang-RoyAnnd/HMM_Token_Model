for starters, i would like to say that i'm a fan of the american pie series. even though 'the naked mile' and this one are the two worst, this one seems to be the downfall of the whole series.<br /><br />first of all, the best part of the film was that it was an american pie film, which is always appreciated.<br /><br />however, there are tonnes of bad things to say about this film. first of all, the story has a very stale 'arc' structure. first, there is the introduction of the characters, then the pledging of the beta house and finally the greek olympiad. each of which has exactly 25 minutes of length. apart from the general staleness of the plot, there is little to no character development, which makes a double whammy of a bad plot.<br /><br />apart from that, i deeply disliked the stereotyping in this film. that is, showing the jocks as the extremely cool, only-thinking-about-sex guys, and explicitly displaying the geeks as inferior. also, it shows females only as sexual objects, and males as only wanting to treat the females as sexual objects.<br /><br />apart from that, the acting was also poor. with perhaps the exception of steve talley.<br /><br />so, in the end, a generally horrid film, if seen from a critical point of view. if seen from a teen point of view, i guess that it's better, but this film is rated 18+ in most countries, so it shouldn't really be seen by minors.
