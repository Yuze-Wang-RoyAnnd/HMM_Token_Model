warning: this review contains a spoiler.<br /><br /> wow. almost impressively bad. note i said, "almost". this is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story. the protagonists (you cannot call them "heroes") shoot innocent bystanders for their food, and also rob same for similar reasons. there's also tons of homoeroticism, which was a turnoff for me. (spoiler: it seems as if the villainess (who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim) gets killed early on, but miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes of audience-torture.) i can't shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic abomination. if you're in a mst3k mood, you might find this watchable, but for the most part you can forget it. go rent the original conan dvd instead.
