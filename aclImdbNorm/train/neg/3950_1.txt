i was previously unaware that in the early 1990's devry university (or was it itt tech?) added film to its wonderful repertoire of technical degree programs. well this movie must have been the product of the class valedictorian. my friend and i rented the original 1980 boogeyman on my netflix and this movie was on the flip side of the dvd. do not waste your time with this movie. awful awful awful. <br /><br />the filmmaker adds 2 main character's, a woman and her therapist. the woman has been having dreams about the boogeyman and his victim's from the first film. over 50% of this film is stock from the original movie. the rest of the movie is the main character having the bad dreams while her therapist drones on a the narrator. these scenes are shot through a filter so thick the characters glow. they would make angela lansbury look 25 years old. so, to recap, awful. don't watch this movie.
