i do not envy barry levinson, rachel weisz, ben stiller or jack black for doing this film. it's, in one word, boring. maybe the fact that is too predictable, the more-than-exploited ben stiller's loser role or the not-at-all funny scenes make this film just something to forget. even christopher walken's appearance finishes in a pathetic way. i was very disappointed. i love ben stiller's acting. i loved it in most of his films, the last one i saw before this was duplex with drew barrymore and was not that bad. about jack black... well, apart from high fidelity i've never seen him doing something good. what about school of rock? ooops, frightening.
