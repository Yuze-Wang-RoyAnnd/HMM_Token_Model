christopher lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal as gideon. this movie could have been a classic had lambert performed as well as tom hanks in forrest gump, or dustin hoffman as raymond babbitt in rain man, or sean penn as sam dawson in i am sam.<br /><br />too bad because the story line is meaningful to us in life, the supporting performances by charlton heston, carroll o'connor, shirley jones, mike connors and shelley winters were excelent. 3 of 10.
