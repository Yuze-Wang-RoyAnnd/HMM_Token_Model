this poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well, then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects. for example, in the original, one of the most chilling moments occurs when nell and theo are lying side by side in twin beds, listening in terror to the noises outside their room. nell tells theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her. nell then looks across at theo, who is several feet away and realises that it was not theo holding her hand. in the latest version, nell is lying alone in bed, when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor. it is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened. and can anybody explain what nell's final words mean - "it's about family. it's always been about family"?<br /><br />the one redeeming feature is lili taylor's performance, but even this cannot save the film. catherine zeta-jones demonstrates once again that, beneath her pretty exterior, there is little depth. in the original, claire bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion. zeta-jones, however has to spell it out, for example, by asking nell if she has a boyfriend - or girlfriend.<br /><br />definitely one which should be consigned to the pointless remakes graveyard.
