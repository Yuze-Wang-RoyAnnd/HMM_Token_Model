this film was one of the worst i've seen in a long while. <br /><br />it's a combination police drama and comedy about two hollywood detectives, harrison ford and josh hartnett, investigating a shootout at a hip hop club. <br /><br />the plot is contrived and there are way too many side issues going on. ford is hustling real estate on the side (martin landau is one of his clients), hartnett runs a yoga school where he's hustling chicks in his spare time, the two are under investigation by internal affairs, ford is screwing the ex-girlfriend (lena olin) of the ia investigator and she's a psychic who has a radio show, the man who set up the killing at the club is a dirty ex-cop who shot hartnett's father years ago.<br /><br />toss in the obligatory car chases and some lame attempts at humor, and that's about the gist of this turkey.
