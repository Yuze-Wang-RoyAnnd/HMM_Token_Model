the movie was a huge disappointment. especially since it was directed by priyadarshan, it was sad to see such dismal standards. poor screenplay(almost non existent) and song sequences with bad songs every minute and at the most odd times killed whatever humor the movie could offer. some of the scenes were funny, but it amounted to probably only 5 mins of the whole duration. the editing was pathetic. dismal! overall the movie disappointed as the lack of story was only too evident. in fact only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the interval.<br /><br />one wouldn't miss anything at all if you don't watch the movie. not worth spending valuable ticket money on this movie. wait till it appears on tv...
