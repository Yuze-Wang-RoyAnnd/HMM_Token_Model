ah, bait. how do i hate thee? let me count the ways. 1. you try to be funny, but are corny and unenjoyable; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. instead, i want to hurl. 2. you try to be dramatic, but are unbelievable; the woman overacts to a terrible degree, and the "bad guy" looks like bill gates, and is about as scary as...well, bill gates. (just try to imagine bill gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun. doesn't work, does it? a lawyer, maybe, but not a gun. doesn't fit.) as for jamie foxx, well, just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous, and makes me want to hurl. 3. you try to be action-packed, but instead are dull and dragging too many times. and when the action heats up, the tripod for the camera must have been lost, for the scenes wobble more than those in the blair witch project, and i find myself nauseated, and once again i want to hurl. 4. you try to be a good movie, but you failed, you failed, you failed! i would rather walk barefoot across the sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water, no sunscreen, and only meryl streep for company. this hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with bill gates for a bad guy, and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that jamie foxx's character has just driven off a cliff, but somehow manages to escape...just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow i'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad, ever again.
