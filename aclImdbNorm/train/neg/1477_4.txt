i have seen dolemite and also (avenging) disco godfather, two other fine works of the blaxploitation canon from our friend rudy ray moore. but this film, the human tornado (aka dolemite 2) will always hold a special place in my heart. for sheer goofiness, lack of skill in film production, and absolute enthusiasm (frankly a little too much), the human tornado cannot be topped.<br /><br />the opening scene sets the tone. our old pal dolemite is shacking up with a white woman, when some racist local cops raid the house for no good reason, and wouldn't you know it! the woman in bed with ol' dole is none other than the sheriff's wife. her cry when she sees him: "he made me do it!" dolemite's cry: "&$*@$ are you for real???" subtlety was never his strong point.<br /><br />highlights? the cameo by a very young ernie hudson (of ghostbusters fame), the continuity errors (characters looking one way in one shot, and another in the next, dolemite's suit changing colors in every single shot of his nightclub act), and queen bee's demonic eyes in her first scene.<br /><br />but the real joy here is rudy ray moore himself. did the man really think he looked cool in this movie? i certainly don't know why, but you have to admire the sheer enthusiasm he has. whether it be jumping totally naked off a cliff, or barking orders to his gang in rhyme (e.g: quick! into the cave! i have a plan to let that mother $*@(%& dig his own grave!) the man commits totally. certainly he goes overboard, nevermore so than any time he's doing kung fu. the climactic battle is filmed at high speed, but occassionaly slows down to let rudy pose and grits his teeth. i'm not sure if they wanted it too look like they sped up the film as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe he was that fast. in any event, "the matrix" it is not.<br /><br />human tornado, much like the original dolemite, is an incompetent film of enormous proportions. but at least it's fun, and certainly you have to give credit to these people for the effort. just not that much. enjoy with my hearty recommendations.
