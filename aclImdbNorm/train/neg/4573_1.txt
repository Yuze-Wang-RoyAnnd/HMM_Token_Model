i didn't know much about this movie before i watched it, but i heard it had something to do with quantum physics so i was interested. what i didn't know is that this is not actually a story but a bunch of new-age blowhards who love the sound of their own voice talking about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics. i say it belongs more in the documentary category than comedy or drama.<br /><br />marlee matlin is in the movie, in order to give this new age symposium *some* sort of a storyline. her portions of the film feel horribly tacked on and are meant to display the speaker's thoughts so we won't die of boredom. matlin has a real job as a photographer, unlike the new age hippie that crashes on her couch. we get to listen to nameless people ramble on about what quantum physics all "means" to them. the one bright spot in this movie was the speaker from india (i assume), but i think he showed up for the wrong film.<br /><br />it looks like barbara eden really let herself go and she goes on and on about how quantum science has something to do with her crazy new age beliefs. it looks like quark from ds9 was running low on cash and he also makes a brief appearance in the film. there is a lot of whizbang cgi we're supposed to be impressed with; cells in the body are shown as dancing jello molds, because the filmmakers have apparently seen flubber one too many times.<br /><br />people in the movie say that the arawak people on san salvador thought columbus's ship the pinta was invisible because natives had never seen clipper ships before, as if people today had any way possible way of knowing. of course they leave out all of that information and just say "columbus's ships were invisible to the indians in america." the film takes many such arrogant leaps. thomas young did a double-slit experiment around 1805 and found that light can look like a particle some of the time, and a wave some of the time. of course you'd never *know* this from watching this stupid film because the only reference to it is that "atoms can be particles and waves." and that must mean that people can pass through walls, walk on water, and never grow old if they just wish upon a star!! then i'm sure marlee matlin could stop being deaf if she just *believed* hard enough. i'm being sarcastic, but this film is chock-full of false hope and beliefs that the people espousing them don't really hold.<br /><br />these are new age kooks who have grabbed onto quantum theory as if it reaffirms everything they believe about meditation, zero point energy, crystal healing, etc. if these snake-oil salesmen truly believed the crap they were selling, couldn't they just *wish* their paychecks into existence instead of appearing in this joke of a film? we get to listen to another nameless man, with no credentials that we know of, talk on his couch in front of a fireplace (or tv screen) about how he creates his own life. every time he was on the screen i wanted someone to rush in and throw a pie in his face. these people take themselves way too seriously. some other balding guy in a suit says that nobody ever *really* touches anything because there's a magnetic force preventing it at the quantum level. if only someone had walked onto the screen and kept punching him in the stomach, screaming "i'm not touching you! i'm not touching you!" a moral relativist in the movie claims that there's really "no such thing as good or bad." so apparently it's ok that hitler gassed millions of jews to death? another person says that there is "no such thing as love." it's just a chemical and that we really don't love people, we're just addicted to the chemical rush we have when we're around them. i suspect this guy is doing this film as community service for being addicted to heroin for so many years.<br /><br />we are witness to a truly pathetic sequence where two young adults walk around a wedding reception, seeing everything like robocop. they evaluate if women are cows, dogs, or foxes, and a sexual position pops onto the scree. marlee matlin gets drunk at the wedding she's supposed to photograph and the next day decides to love herself and take a bath because she's a beautiful and unique snowflake.<br /><br />i liked when the film said people often find evidence for their pre-conceived notions. perhaps in this review i'm only seeing what i want to see, but i truly wanted to see these people get pies to the face, and it never happened.<br /><br />if you've never heard of any of the ideas presented in the film before, you may find them interesting, but there are better sources for all of the ideas here. if you want to watch a good movie that talks about the heisenberg uncertainty principle, go see the man who wasn't there. if you want to read a good book about quantum field theory, read hyperspace by michio kaku. if you want to see a film that talks about different philosophies with imaginative visuals, see waking life (although it can feel boring, self-important, and pretentious at times). all in all, you should go and read quantum psychology or prometheus rising by robert anton wilson instead of wasting your time on this movie.<br /><br />i normally have a very hard time giving movies a score from 1 to 10, but this one was a very easy for me: 1/10 stars.<br /><br />the movie's title is true. the people in this film don't know #$*! hands down, the worst movie i've ever seen.
