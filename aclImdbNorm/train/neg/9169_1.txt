it gets really bad. the only half-way redeeming quality is the effects from the thousands of bullets used during the film. there are context errors everywhere. the acting is horrible, save kirk. the story is as holey as the grail, and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself just kills the movie, if it wasn't already a corpse. so all in all it's a waste of your life. i would have given this a zero had that been an option on the rating scale.
