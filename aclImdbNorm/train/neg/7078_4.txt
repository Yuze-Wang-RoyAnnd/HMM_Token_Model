this movie could have been a decent b-movie if 3/4 of the the movie wasn't so much focusing on the sex scenes. i mean, he's a sex addict, and i'm sure that there's a lot more that goes on with sex addicts outside of having sex on a constant basis. michael des barres did a good job considering what all he had to do, which wasn't much. at one point or another, one would have to laugh at him, because his character was so pitiful. nastassja kinski was alright in her role as the concerned sex therapist, she could've of done more though and i'm not suggesting her having sex. the person that stood out the most to me in this movie was rosanna arquette in her convincing role as the loving and concerned wife. there's something about beautiful inside and out that strongly appeals to me. she played that role and as you watched the movie, you start to feel bad for her.<br /><br />"diary of a sex addict" while not oscar material or a modern classic to anyone's standards, is quite informative and does a fair job in showing you how one's personal demons can take over and ruin the very things in life you think highly of.
