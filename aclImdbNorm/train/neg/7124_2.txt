a man brings his new wife to his home where his former wife died of an "accident". his new wife has just been released from an institution and is also very rich! all of the sudden she starts hearing noises and seeing skulls all over the place. is she going crazy again or is the first wife coming back from the dead? <br /><br />you've probably guessed the ending so i won't spell it out. i saw this many times on saturday afternoon tv as a kid. back then, i liked it but i was young. seeing it now i realize how bad it is. it's horribly acted, badly written, very dull (even at an hour) and has a huge cast of five people (one being the director)! still it does have some good things about it. <br /><br />the music is kinda creepy and the setting itself with the huge empty house and pond nearby is nicely atmospheric. there also are a few scary moments (i jumped a little when she saw the first skull) and a somewhat effective ending. all in all it's definitely not a good movie...but not a total disaster either. it does have a small cult following. i give it a 2.<br /><br />also try to avoid the elite dvd drive-in edition of it (it's paired with "attack of the giant leeches"). it's in terrible shape with jumps and scratches all over. it didn't even look this bad on tv!
