ok, let me say that i didn't expect a film starring jerry springer to be cinematic gold, all i asked for was it to be cinematic...and it wasn't even that. it looked like someone's bad home movies. poorly acted, scripted, and filled to the brim with nudity of the most unnattractive people i've ever seen.<br /><br />the film's "plot" focuses on a low-class family who decide to go on the "jerry farrelly show" to discuss multiple affairs between a mother, daughter, stepfather and the daughter's fiancee. from there, the movie fizzles and develops into a unique experience: white-trash pornography. there's redneck sex, interacial sex, even sex between jerry and his wife? (yuk!) this film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision. at least it was mercifully short. disgusting and degrading. african-americans and working class america should be offended. (howard stern should be pleased however, he didn't squander his attempt for film stardom. his was smart, funny and entertaining)<br /><br />my grade: f+ (the daughter was hot)
