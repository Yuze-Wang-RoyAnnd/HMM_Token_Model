i admit, i had to fast forward through this poorly transferred dvd after about 30 minutes -- nothing was happening, and everyone has already described the "plot." but has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard! i'm guessing the bratty kid did it, put it's never explained. really trippy opening.<br /><br />i wish this had been a better written or thought out film, because what we're left with if pretty daft and a movie that makes no sense isn't a "clever" movie, it's just a poorly executed film.<br /><br />i would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage, i would like to see if it would help. otherwise, this is an odd little film that is best if fast-forwarded through!
