maybe this isn't fair, because i only made it about halfway through the movie. one of the few movies i have actually not been able to watch due to lameness.<br /><br />the acting is terrible, the camera work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy. for example - during a coke deal, the coke is just kept loose in a briefcase - i'm no expert, but i think people generally put it in a bag.<br /><br />they use the same stupid sound effect whenever a punch is thrown (it's that over the top 'crunching' sound" and they use toy guns with dubbed in sound effects.<br /><br />worst movie ever.
