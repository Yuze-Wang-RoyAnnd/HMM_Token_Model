this movie was boring! <br /><br />yes, there are a few funny moments and jokes, but you cannot base a whole movie on that! <br /><br />the characters are too stereotyped, there is no real story - but short episodes with freaky side-characters, who are not freaky enough to make the plot genuine.<br /><br />shame, because most of the actors are acknowledged in hungary, a mystery why they took the roles. <br /><br />this is *not* a new hope for the hungarian film. it was boring, though it was meant to be genuine or unique. they could have tried much more harder than this... 2 out of 10
