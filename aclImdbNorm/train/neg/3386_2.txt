yes, i was lucky enough to see the long-running original production of michael bennett's hit musical. it was an amazing experience and i paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in 1985. it is awful. almost everything fails. first off, attenborough (a fine actor, a good director with the right material) is a sorry choice - almost as bad as when john huston was hired to mangle annie. the camera is always in the wrong place - they chop up the songs and the casting!!! they are awful - the power of the play was these dancers - these hungry, talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance - you couldn't take your eyes off of them. but this cast just gets by dancing, does a "nice" job singing but none of them spark one bit. in fact, look up the cast on imdb - none of them really went on to do anything much. (ok, ok, janet jones married gretzky - sheesh). so this cinema trainwreck does not capture for one second the magic, the desperation, the passion of the stage musical. a total strike-out! (but even though they try to smother the music - the great music still rises up at times and reminds people how great the score was).
