i bought this video at walmart's $1 bin. i think i over-paid!!! in the 1940s, bela lugosi made a long string of 3rd-rate movies for small studios (in this case, monogram--the ones who made most of the bowry boys films). while the wretchedness of most of these films does not approach the level of awfulness his last films achieved (ed wood "classics" such as bride of the monster and plan 9 from outer space), they are nonetheless poor films and should be avoided by all but the most die-hard fans.<br /><br />i am an old movie junkie, so i gave this a try. besides, a few of these lesser films were actually pretty good--just not this one.<br /><br />lugosi is, what else, a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he concocts from young brides. they never really explained why it had to be brides or why it must be women or even what disease his wife had--so you can see that the plot was never really hashed out at all.<br /><br />anyways, a really annoying female reporter (a lois lane type without jimmy olsen or superman) wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the bodies were stolen! so, she follows some clues all the way to the doorstep of lugosi. lugosi's home is complete with his crazed wife, a female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the assistant's sons (an ugly hunchbacked sex fiend and a dwarf). naturally this plucky reporter faints repeatedly throughout the film--apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! eventually, the maniacs all die--mostly due to their own hands and all is well. at the conclusion, the reporter and a doctor she just met decide to marry. and, naturally, the reporter's dumb cameraman faints when this occurs. if you haven't noticed, there's a lot of fainting in this film. or, maybe because it was such a slow and ponderous film they just fell asleep!
