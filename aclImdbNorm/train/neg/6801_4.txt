firstly, i won't tell you why i rented this movie, as i'm still confused myself...<br /><br />air rage is much like any movie i've seen where a plane is hijacked. there is of course that one important person on the plane, and the hijacker looking for revenge. the sad thing is, some of the methods to stop the hijackers have already been used in other movies. are we really becoming so unoriginal so quickly?<br /><br />although it's ice-t (who for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts at acting while he's not busy putting the "c" back in front of rap) who is glorified on the cover, the movie actually stars the less than amazing kim oja as a stewardess who is 'surprisingly' overlooked by the five hijackers, which naturally comes back to haunt them. as for the rest of the cast, the only person i managed to recognize was steve hytner, more commonly known as kenny bania from "seinfeld".<br /><br />i can't forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie, when a hijacker used about a pound of plastique to blow a lock off a door... brilliant.<br /><br />the plot was unnaturally predictable.<br /><br />the script - atrocious. it got to the point where i could say something, which i felt would make a stupid comment, and it would be the next line in the movie.<br /><br />as for special effects... the only thing special about this movie is that i wasted the cost of electricity to run my tv and vcr for 100 minutes.<br /><br />and the title - the movie did take place in the air. but due to the less than stellar performances, the only rage in the movie was that of the viewer.<br /><br />so, if you're in the mood to even pick apart a movie, just because it's bad. please save yourself, don't choose this.
