i was unsure whether or not andy sidaris could repeat his success with the cinematic hit "malibu express." with his film fit to kill he has proved that sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a one-shot director. the plot written by sidaris, which was ungratefully passed up by the academy, is a complex screenplay involving many unseen twists and turns. the main characters composed work for a sexually based radio station known as ksxy. cleverly, ksxy is actually their secret headquarters. in "fit to kill" they confront their long-time nemesis kane, who is trying to steal one of russia's most prized diamonds. a well-written screenplay is not all, excellent acting by the cast helps to ensure this film as a cult classic. panned by the critics and the box office, this film will be appreciated in years to come. it is now suffering the same fate as clockwork orange and taxi driver did, but in the future will undoubtly become recognized. i am disappointed no critic circles have recognized andy sidaris's trademark filmmaking. the costumes, the special effects, all help to compliment this already beautiful piece of filmmaking. it may do you best to ignore the dismal 3 rating on this film and go out and rent it for yourself. my personal rating is 10/10. the drama is as thick as the blockbuster runaway bride, and the action better or equal to the cinematic masterpiece last action hero. andy, keep up the good work.
