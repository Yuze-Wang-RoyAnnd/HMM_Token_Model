for all the subtle charms this student film may contain, was anyone else bored to death waiting wendingo to show his paper macho face??<br /><br />the anti-climax pretty much ruined any sort of momentum we had speed actioned to develop.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, i'm all into exploring america's dark underbelly, but this is a turd-a-flamb'e that gets a nod to watchable only for the fact that p.clarkson looks hot taking it.<br /><br />sadly, from a guy from wings.<br /><br />the best 2 minutes the film has to offer.<br /><br />if you felt like ripping off deliverance, you could do better.
