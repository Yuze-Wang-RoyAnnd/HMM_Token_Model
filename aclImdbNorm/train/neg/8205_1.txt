very bad acting, and a very shallow story. not even a decent b-movie<br /><br />events that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were boring and very lame.<br /><br />this is one of the worst sci-fi i've ever seen. i saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre, but it sucked so bad.<br /><br />now there's really very few good movies on alien subject, i think because most of them are low budget<br /><br />i give it 3/10
