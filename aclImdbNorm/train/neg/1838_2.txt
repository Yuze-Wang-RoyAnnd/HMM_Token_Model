"envy" is bad for a number of reasons. yes, there are unlikeable characters. that's not the problem. it is that they are unlikeable and we do not care for them at all. "the war of the roses" featured unlikeable characters but due to proper introductions we grew to at least find ourselves interested in their fate, whereas in "envy" the introduction is thin, the characters are never believable, and the plot only makes things worse.<br /><br />ben stiller is simply repulsive in his role and i'm a fan of his work most of the time. stiller campaigned to have this released straight-to-video and now i can see why. the movie proposes that he's "best friends" with jack black, but from the first five minutes we are given footage that seems to indicate stiller hates black. i thought this would develop into some sort of one-sided relationship (a la "the cable guy") but it never does, instead stiller insists he's his "best friend" and i felt confused as he seemed to treat black like, well, "poo." the movie's plot is ridiculous but it doesn't matter, because it's supposed to be an exaggerated morality tale. unfortunately the message is lost in the mess. walken gives a good performance but black is off-key and annoying (and i usually find him very funny). no, it's not a horrible film but i still can't believe barry levinson ("rain man," "sleepers") is responsible for this - it's not one of the worst films of all time but it could certainly be a whole lot better. i wish va-poo-rize did exist - so we could make this film disappear forever....
