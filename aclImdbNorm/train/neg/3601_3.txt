was it foreshadowing when tori complained that her first boyfriend was treating her like a robot, and then her new boyfriend (the murderer) turned out to be a designer of artificial intelligence? i think so. scenes to make you squeal with delight: montages galore, a strip-tease in a kimono (what do you call it when you seductively put clothes on, instead of take them off?), and a climactic battle on skis! definitely tune in for the beginning and end, but you can grab a sandwich during the second act when all the plot is happening. is it better than co-ed call girl? nah. does tori ever make it to paradise, or out of the snow, even? nope.
