gillian anderson is an arrogant, driven, career woman who picks up working class oik danny dyer for a night of fun. after a stupid accident in the countryside, they are brutally attacked. after recovering, and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers, their thoughts turn to that of revenge...<br /><br />i thought "straightheads" was terrible. violent, brutal, misogynistic and unpleasant. if i didn't dislike the phrase a great deal i would call "straightheads" a video nasty. certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980's. frankly i don't know how "straightheads" got a cinema release.<br /><br />i am not a prude. i don't mind sex and violence in the movies, but they have to be married to a movie with a) a good plot or b) good characterisation or c) preferably both. "straightheads" had neither. no progression in the plot or the characters and too much left unexplained and unsaid. luckily "straightheads" went nowhere fast. it was only 80 minutes long.<br /><br />it was a shame, because there was the germ of an interesting film here, with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third. how often do i say this, but it could have been good if it had been done properly. what a shame. i really like gillian anderson and danny dyer, but they were on a hiding to nothing with this film. she, especially, is very underrated (and is still particularly fit).<br /><br />if you want to see a good british revenge movie, rent or buy shane meadows' "dead man's shoes". it is a little masterpiece. last weekend i should have seen his "this is england" instead. ce sera sera...
