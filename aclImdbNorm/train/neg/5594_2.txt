that's the question you have to ask yourself when you watch this movie "what was the point?" this movie was nothing but an hour and a half of confusion with completely unlikable people (not going to use the word actors) and a script that you could tell didn't exist.<br /><br />one of the things that made me laugh the most about this movie was how it said "victorian story written by" which means that there was actually a script to that part of the story. the entire victorian section had no dialogue, and was just comprised of shots of a guy staring at a girl and vice versa. making that part of the movie as scripted as a camera left on at a train station.<br /><br />ok, time for the story. it starts out with a guy sitting in a chair never once getting out of it. oh blocking, who needs you? these newspeople come to his house and practically beg him to tell this story about these dead girls. so he starts off the story in victorian times. and here's how the scene goes (guy and girl are in a field. pretty music starts to play) (guy stares at girl) (girl stares at guy) (guy stares at girl) cut back to movie. that's pretty much all that happens for about half the movie.<br /><br />the rest of the film is incredibly awkward dialogue about a bunch of models wanting to buy an apartment. so this real estate agent shows them one and when i say the dialogue is awkward i mean, if it were a dancer it would trip during the macarena. none of the characters in this movie are likable. the models are incredibly irritating, the victorian people don't talk, and the guy telling the story has the personality of a sack of onions. so eventually all the girls get killed off. and by killed off, i mean drug offscreen. ooh. you showed one death? and by death i mean holding her face till they put the blood makeup on? awesome.<br /><br />how this guy even knows this story baffles me. he says it's because he saw it. but how? there was no guy in that apartment! the door was locked shut with no way out, the windows were attached to a fire escape that was too rotten to work, how the hell did he see all that? oh plot holes. we do love you. so the movie finishes up with the newswoman saying "i think you made it up. you're wasting our time" despite the fact that she begged him for the interview in the first place. whatever. this movie was stupid, pointless, and made no sense with a lot of plot holes. i could go on and on about this movie, but i don't see the need. i'd much rather spend my time doing something uselful. like widdle something. "hell's threshold" more belongs in purgatory with 2 dumb models. out of 10.
