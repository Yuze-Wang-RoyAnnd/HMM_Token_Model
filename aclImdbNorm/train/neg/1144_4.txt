recap: doctor markov has developed a new theory how to produce energy, knowledge that might unbalance the world. he keeps his knowledge coded and secret and desperately wants out of the soviet union. kgb on the other side desperately wants the new technology. so, they sets a scheme in motion. during a rescue attempt to free markov, kgb steps in, takes markov to a secret location and lures him to reveal his secret by saying they are in sweden, and working for the un. as a backup, kgb kidnaps markov's estranged daughter. cia now send their best agents, a team of (swedish?) ninjas to thwart kgb and rescue markov and his daughter.<br /><br />comments: a cult movie that despite not being very good needs seeing. the movie is quite ambitious but lacking in many areas. first off is that it is very dark, probably to conceal locations and bad effects, that some scenes are hard to comprehend. you can't see what is happening. the second thing that it is lacking is martial arts, despite being a ninja-movie. sure there are some, of quite poor quality, but mostly the ninjas fires automatic guns or sets of explosions. the automatic guns pose a problem too as they seem to have a endless supply of ammunition. and the ninjas seem almost immune to bullets while soviet guards die like flies.<br /><br />what does it have that speaks for it then? the idea and ambition foremost. some actually, and especially for a swedish movie, decent action-scenes albeit not of martial arts. some nice slow-motion scenes and pretty much blood and gore. and some very interesting new weapons technology that makes the victims heart or brain explode. mostly all parts that you look for in a b-movie.<br /><br />because it definitely is a b-movie, no mistake could be made there. but if you expect it, and watch it like a b-movie, it is entertaining. but don't forget, it is not only a b-movie it is set in the eighties. some girls, for example, besides wearing... lets say "interesting" clothes, have lethal doses of eye shadow and makeup.<br /><br />in all, see for the cult status and the ambition. enjoy it, and then forget it.<br /><br />4/10
