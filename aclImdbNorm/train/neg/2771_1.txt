the movie was to be shown here in bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater, it failed miserably.<br /><br />apparently the story writer just don't hold water. something was definitely missing. in my opinion people must have a reason why they watch it other than historical glimpse of the past. accuracy of history is not what we look for in entertainment.<br /><br />the movie just lack any substance. the only way to do this movie right was somehow make changes where it stands as some kind of a legend instead of just a story. and a legend will have certain elements that tries to tell you something that people have forgotten through time, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. it is called the central theme.<br /><br />the movie fails to answer, why would i watch it anyway?<br /><br />at least some strange legendary flying elephants, psychic king, or the eccentric king such as "the king and i" would have been lovely, something would have added greatly to the movies' appeal. i guess there was no appeal other than a plain vanilla movie. <br /><br />once you got the appeal, then the story is the next thing we concentrate on. in marketing terms, we call it "must see". upon hearing the title of the movie people would say, oh, i must see it. now where's the appeal in kingmaker? why not just redo the title and call it, "how not to be a king?" and make a black comedy of the old siamese days, to the style of "dr. strangelove". that would have been much more interesting. narrative-like experiences of the foibles of the king from first persons goofs off would have made the movie extremely funny. <br /><br />most movies today have that "must see" appeal, such as spiderman, men x, these titles speak for themselves. if they don't have familiar characters, some other movies such as, the island, had an appeal itself when the advertising asks "do you still believe there is an island?". <br /><br />or for the movie, retitled "how not to be a king" might ask the question, "so do you still want to be a king?" <br /><br />parhat
