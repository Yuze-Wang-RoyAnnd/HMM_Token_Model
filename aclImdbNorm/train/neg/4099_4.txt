mulva is put in a sugercoma by teen ape. when she awakens she's considerably hotter (the parts played by debbie rochon in this sequel), and out for revenge on those that did her wrong. as the sub-title and box art implies this is indeed a take off on the "kill bill" films, but this being a chris seaver's film, it's a wildly incompetent satire (and i use that last term extremely loosely) i'd love to say this is better than the first film, but truth be told i was so impossibly drunk off my ass when i saw the previous film that i can't even hope to compare the two at this point in time. but i must have enjoyed it since i bought the sequel (see when i'm drunk i like, for lack of a better word, complete and total crappy movies) there are a few laugh out loud moments (very few) but i do remember bonejack being funnier though. well at least at slightly over an hour, it is over mighty quickly for what it's worth.<br /><br />my grade: d+ <br /><br />dvd extras: audio commentary by director chris seaver, actress debbie rochon, and the lbp gang; second commentary by seaver; 31 minute making of featurette; lloyd kaufman's 6 minute tribute to low budget pictures; fake 2 minute syrup commercial; stills gallery; promo trailer; and trailers for :mulva", 'quest for the egg salad", "fiilthy mcnasty"1, 2, & 3; "the feral man", "the bonesetter", "midnight skater", "demon summer" & "splatter rampage wrestling"
