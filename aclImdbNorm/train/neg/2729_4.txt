actress ruth roman's real-life philanthropic gesture to help entertain troops arriving from and leaving for the korean war at an air base near san francisco jump-started this all-star warner bros. salute to patriotism and song. many celebrities make guest appearances while a love-hate romance develops between a budding starlet and a painfully green and skinny air force corporal (ron hagerthy, who looks like he should be delivering newspapers from his bicycle). seems the corporal has fooled the actress into thinking he's off to battle when actually he's part of a airplane carrier crew, flying to and from honolulu (you'd think she'd be happy he was staying out of harm's way, but instead she acts just like most childish females in 1950s movies). doris day is around for the first thirty minutes or so, and her distinct laugh and plucky song numbers are most pleasant. roman is also here, looking glamorous, while james cagney pokes fun at his screen persona and gordon macrae sings in his handsome baritone. jane wyman sings, too, in a hospital bedside reprise following doris day's lead, causing one to wonder, "did they run out of sets?" for undemanding viewers, an interesting flashback to another time and place. still, the low-rent production and just-adequate technical aspects render "starlift" strictly a second-biller. *1/2 from ****
