i had to stop watching this film (a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious film viewers) twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and dull enough to inspire yawns, not to mention that i was soon near tears over the $3.99 i had wasted at blockbuster. joanna pacula's acting and her awfully rendered slavic accent are sufficiently terrible to set one to gritting one's teeth. i knew that two hours of her would be two hours too many. both breuer and nietzsche are played by unremarkable actors of strikingly few talents. while we're on the topic of talent, breuer's supercilious assistant appears to have been pulled out of a local acting troupe. she clearly has not learned her craft. in fact, she's really quite awful. all the public scenes looked staged, with the extras walking mechanically about in their sunday best. turning this film off was far more satisfying than turning it on. don't rent this terrible movie. you will be sorry you spent your money.
