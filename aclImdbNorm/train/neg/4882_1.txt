there are some bad movies out there. most of them are rather fun. "criminally insane 1" was one of those flicks. so bad that it was enjoyable and had re-watch value to it. "criminally insane 2" has to be one of the worst movies ever made and coming from me, that's saying a lot because i am not the type of person to say anything is the worst. but trust me, this was just completely awful and running just 1 hour is 1 hour too long.<br /><br />the movie has a rather incoherent storyline, but who cares about story when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around killing people because she isn't being fed. well, you don't see that in this movie, except for all of the flashback sequences that are from the first one. the new storyline could have been really funny with ethel being sent to a halfway house and murdering everyone in there, but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie and at that point you are already falling asleep.<br /><br />the camera work in this movie is just atrocious. this literally reminds me of something i shot with friends of mine back when i was 15. the sound quality is something else as you can't understand a word most of the characters are saying. to give an example of how bad it is, go into a new york subway and try to understand what is being said over the loud speakers, that is what this movie sounds like. not that it matters what they are talking about anyway because the actors are about as dry as a dead piece of wood.<br /><br />now i know that saying this is the worst movie out there is pretty harsh but words can't describe just how bad this movie is. if you don't believe me, see it for yourself. 1/10
