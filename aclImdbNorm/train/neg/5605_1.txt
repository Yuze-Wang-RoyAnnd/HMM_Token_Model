i was very disappointed with this film. i expected more of a thelma and louise female-buddy crime movie. instead, the women prison escapees in this flick, had no sense of loyalty to one another. they were an extremely vulgar pack of hyenas, who beat each other up, double-crossed each other, and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the film.<br /><br />instead of being shrewed thieves, who stuck together to plan their escape and find the hidden stash of money, the women escapees were too selfish and vicious, to trust each other for long. these women weren't liberated in a positive sense. they just ended up being a bunch of loose-cannons, incapable of respect for themselves, or each other. if you like 70s female crime caper films, skip this bomb, and see the great texas dynamite chase, which stars claudia jennings and jocelyn jones.
