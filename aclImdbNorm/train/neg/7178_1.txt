overrated and only for those people in their 20's whom wear particularly thick rose tinted glasses, who never actually saw it in the first place because they were to young. awful animation, dialogue and a tired narrative. a real product of the 80's, the novel gimmick of a puzzle toy (thats right, toy not the absurd, pretentious and child alienating "collectors action figurine"), sold on the back of a poor cartoon and other paraphernalia, only matters to those who bought the toy when they were "actual" children in the period of '84' to '87'. it has become cult because of those same adults are to immature to let go of their memories. avoid.
