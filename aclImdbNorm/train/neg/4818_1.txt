i was about 7 when this dire monstrosity of a film was released. in the uk it was advertised on the tv in the summer of 1977 for weeks, as if it were some incredible blockbuster film. it was actually the first film i ever saw at a cinema, and i was put off going for years to come. the following week i was invited to go and see the new film "star wars" and i declined. to this day i have never seen it, in protest at having to watch sasquatch! seriously, even at the age of 7 i could tell that i was watching garbage. it's just so bad, it's almost unbelievable. rambling nonsense that should never have made it to a cinema. i was however amused to read all these years later that the director never directed again, just as well as far as i'm concerned. avoid at all costs!!!
