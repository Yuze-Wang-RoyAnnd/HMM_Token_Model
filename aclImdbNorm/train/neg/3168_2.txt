i had to shut this off after about 15 execrable moments..<br /><br />i was hoping it might improve,<br /><br />what i saw was badly acted, directed & written.<br /><br />this movie should never even have been released directly to dvd,.<br /><br />the lead character who is a bride top be from hell has an huge ice sculpture fall on her killing her. she was such a revolting person i was not even sorry for her. she winds up there in a sort of heaven, & was still repulsive, i left shortly after.<br /><br />eve longoria portrays her & i hope i never see her again, she cant even act.she is just plain annoying.<br /><br />paul rudd an actor who normally can do no wrong also was in this dud.<br /><br />jason biggs ( no longer a teen) is also present,<br /><br />i do like comedies but not stupid ones about stupid people.<br /><br />rating: * (out of 4) 30 points (out of 100) imdb 2 (out of 10)
