even though many people here praises this movie, i have to warn you. it has no logic whatsoever. i think that basinger does a decent job at acting, but you can't make a thriller if there is a great lack of realism.<br /><br />this scene paints a good picture for you of the movie : while basinger is pursued by murderous thugs she decides to sit down and gaze upon a picture she finds from her pocket. the picture is from her daughter and it reads "we love you mommy". who does something like that ? what the eff? and believe me when i say that it is not nearly as stupid as some other scenes of the movie. someone stated that this is a "hidden gem". well, i have to strongly disagree, this movie has stayed hidden for a reason. and it's not a gem. oh, and please, i don't even want to start commenting about the red toolbox. it hurts my brain :d usually the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small amounts, but this movie basically is made possible only because of the lack of logic. but, i still give it a 4 because even though it is embarrassingly flawed in logic, it has certain mood that kept me watching till the end.<br /><br />so if you choose to watch this, you know you have been warned.
