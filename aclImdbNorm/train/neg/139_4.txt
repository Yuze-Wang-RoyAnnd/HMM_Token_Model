this movie was rented by a friend. her choice is normally good. i read the cover first and was expecting a good movie. although it<br /><br />was a horror movie. which i don't prefer. but no horror came to mind while watching the movie. it was a dull,<br /><br />not very entertaining movie. the appearance of denise richards<br /><br />was again a pleasure for the eye. but that's it. we (the four of us)<br /><br />we're a little bit disappointed. but feel free to see this movie and<br /><br />judge it yourself.
