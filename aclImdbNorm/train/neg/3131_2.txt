the fallen ones starts with archaeologist matt fletcher (casper van dien) in the desert discovering the mummified remains of a 42 foot tall giant, now there's something you don't see everyday. matt is working for property developer morton (robert wagner) who wants to build a holiday resort on the land & he calls in fellow archaeologist angela (kristen miller) for reasons i'm unsure of. anyway they both try to figure out what they've got on they're hands when some of the team go missing, morton calls in security guy ammon (navid negahban) to handle the situation. meanwhile ancient text translator the rabbi eli schmidtt (tom bosley) translates some ancient text (as he would) & is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up & take over the world for the fallen one, or something like that. it's up to matt to save the day & the whole planet...<br /><br />written & directed by kevin vanhook, who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the start, i personally thought the fallen ones was a terrible film & it's as simple & straight forward as that. there are so many things that are just plain bad about the fallen ones both on a technical & conceptual level, the script doesn't make a whole lot of sense & it doesn't really get going until the final 20 odd minutes by which time i had almost lost the will to live. the character's are awful & as clich'ed as you like, the dialogue is bad as in very, very bad & the entire film is predictable, i mean it's not going to come as a surprise that casper van dien is going to save the day is it? it's not a huge surprise that the mummified giant is going to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of comatose state. this is bad, very bad. you have been warned.<br /><br />director vanhook doesn't impress, the fight scenes are absolutely awful & why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple? they look naff. to give it a bit of credit the special effects on the giant mummy itself are actually good although there's not that many of them since he doesn't make an appearance for over an hour, there are also some normal sized mummy's that look to have come straight from the set of the mummy (1999), unfortunately these aren't used to any great effect & in fact are wasted as some comic relief. the mechanical mummy was a pretty good idea but looked silly & there is no way on earth that all those people inside could work in sync with each other to operate it, actually the more i think about the more ridiculous the idea is. forget about any scares, tension or atmosphere & don't even think about any gore or violence because there isn't any.<br /><br />technically the fallen ones isn't anything special & apart from the impressive giant mummy effects there's little her to get excited about. the ghost cgi & water effects are terrible, it was made-for-tv & it's shows. the acting was poor, wagner looks embarrassed & this is probably the only thing the likes of dien & bosley can get these days.<br /><br />the fallen ones is a bad film, there's no two ways about it as far as i'm concerned. not recommended on any level or in any way, one to avoid.
