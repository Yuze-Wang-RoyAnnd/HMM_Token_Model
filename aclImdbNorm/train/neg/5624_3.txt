in his brief 40 years on earth, author jack london managed to cram as much adventure and incident as would seem possible. this 90-minute film, purportedly a biography of the man's life but patently fictionalized, doesn't even scratch the surface, and remains a story very ripe for a modern-day retelling. here, michael o'shea, in one of his first roles, portrays london, and his performance is both rugged and sympathetic. he is not the problem here. nor is a young and very beautiful susan hayward, playing his future wife, charmian, whose biography on london is the "basis" for this film. london's life has here been broken down into a series of episodes, which the film skips lightly through. so we have brief incidents with london as an oyster pirate, a sealer in the bering sea, a gold prospector in the yukon and a correspondent during the russo-japanese war...colorful events, for sure, but hardly given anything like in-depth treatment. and alfred santell's direction (he also directed one of susan's first films, "our leading citizen," in 1939) is lackadaisical at best. making things rougher here is a very poor-quality dvd, with a crummy-looking print source and hissy sound. perhaps the best thing about this movie rental, for me, was one of the dvd's extras: a catalog of all the alpha video films, featuring hundreds and hundreds of full-color movie posters. let's just hope that these films are in better shape than "jack london"!
