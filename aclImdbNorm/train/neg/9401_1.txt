in this extremely low-budget ( i've seen home movies made with better production value) australian utter rip-off of "the burning" & "friday the 13th", a band is planning to make a music video while on a houseboat. they're stalked by a serial killer who was burned years before. this movie is even proclaimed to be 'the worst australian film ever made' in it's dvd promotional material. that's it's only selling point! complete and utter rubbish in every considerable way. perhaps a few chuckles here and there for bad movie lovers, but it still made me want to burn out my retinas.<br /><br />eye candy: a quick flash of barely existent itty bitty titties in a lame shower scene<br /><br />my grade: f
