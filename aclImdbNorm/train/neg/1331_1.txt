collusion course is even worse than the typical "evil white male corporate capitalist" movie of the week. this movie is less pleasant than a toothache. jay leno can act. he's good in his underrated debut movie, the silverbears, in which he gives a performance consist with the demands of his character. this movie is so bad leno's character, a sanctimonious buffoon, is less annoying than morita's character, a sanctimonious fool.
