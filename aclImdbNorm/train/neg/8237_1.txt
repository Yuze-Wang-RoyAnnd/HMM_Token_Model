how, in the name of all that's holy, did this film ever get distribution? it looks as if it has been shot on someone's mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim scenario to whole new depths. they literally scream for the full 90 minutes of the movie. and that's all they do. there is no plot, no tension, no characters, and not a lot of acting. just screaming and more screaming.<br /><br />i gave up after fifteen minutes and fast-wound through it to see if anything happened. it doesn't - except for screaming, of course. odlly enough, the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem - there is no camera-work to speak of. every shot looks like every other shot - middle distance, one angle, dull, dull, dull.<br /><br />it's not so bad it's good. it's just plain bad.
