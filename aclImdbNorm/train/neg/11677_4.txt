this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isn't that great. sure, "chaos" and "inside man" are literally the same movie, just with variations in suspense. but i found "chaos" more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film "swordfish." the reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the states and "chaos" was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has yet to find a distributor in the u.k. and u.s.a. <br /><br />it's true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like dog day afternoon and other spike lee films, but that doesn't mean that it is a pleasant film to watch. <br /><br />watch it if nothing else is on t.v., but you'll probably get bored with after awhile.
