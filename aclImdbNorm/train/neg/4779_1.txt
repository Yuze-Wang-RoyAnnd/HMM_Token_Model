in 2004, i liked it. then it became very stupid. it suggests that kids are brainless. it insults children. cartoon network used to be great. one of the shows i liked was hamtaro. it did manage to be interesting and imaginative in its approach to children programming. the show (foster's home for imaginary friends) is like putting 20 spoons of sugar in your sprite. it seems as if today's television producers are only interested in making money, rather than engaging the imaginations of children and making money! lately, my children are tuning in to the old shows (60's) to find something interesting to watch. perhaps, in the absence of originality, for television to look to its past and recycle children's programing from days gone by.
