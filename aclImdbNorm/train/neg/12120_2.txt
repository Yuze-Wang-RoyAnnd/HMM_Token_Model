in what could have been an otherwise run of the mill, mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties (the subtle "free-love" period), the creators of this film pile on ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario and top it all off with a trite little cherry on top, happily ever after ending. at no time did i ever feel sympathy for diane lane or anna paquin in their troublesome middle-class care free life, nor did i feel for the emasculated liev shrieber. the story line plods along slowly to its predictable, pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and watchable about this film is the stunning diane lane topless. here's a hint, it occurs about 30 minutes into the film. fast forward to that part and skip the rest.
