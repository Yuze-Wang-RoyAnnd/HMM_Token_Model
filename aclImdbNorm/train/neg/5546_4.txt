this film is something like a sequel of "white zombie", since it is made by the same man (halperin) and features zombies. halperin, the george a. romero of his day, fails to deliver with this one, though.<br /><br />we have a man who can control the minds of people in cambodia, and a search to destroy the source of his power so the zombies can be sent free. also, a love interest for the evil man.<br /><br />where this film really excels is in the imagery. the cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and the zombie look very powerful in their large numbers. unfortunately, we don't really get to see much of the zombies in action and the love story seems to play a much too large role for a horror film (though this has a valid plot reason later on).<br /><br />i would have loved to see some 1930s zombies attack helpless city folk, but this film just did not deliver. and no strong villain (like bela lugosi) was waiting to do battle against our heroes. and the use of lugosi's eyes? a nice effect, but misleading as he is never in the film... why not recreate this with the new actor's eyes? overall, a film that could be a great one with a little script re-working and could someday be a powerful remake (especially if they keep it in the same post-war time frame). heck, if they can fix up "the hills have eyes" then this film has hope.
