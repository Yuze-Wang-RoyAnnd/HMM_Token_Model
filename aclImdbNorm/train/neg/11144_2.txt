this flick reminded me of those lame "erotic thrillers" i used to stay up late and watch on cinemax when i was 13. i'd label this flick softer-core since there is just no simulated bump and grinder. there is, however, a ton of nudity- the opening scene is in a strip club, we see kane hodder's keester (or at least a stunt butt) and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they mugged on of the munster's for a costume. 13 year old boys rejoice.<br /><br />other than that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst cgi i've seen in years. the shots look like fmv's from the video game resident evil in terms of quality. the wolf is too bad to be explained and, despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way, way too many times.<br /><br />the plot and acting make no sense. there is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybrid-werewolves- the darkwolf is the latter but from what i can tell hybrids do the same thing all werewolves do- look human, change to a wolf an kill people. the darkwolf is trying to find a mate but oddly can't find the mate but can sniff out anyone she touches. once more, this skills proves less than useful since the darkwolf winds up killing several folks his target never touched, met or even saw as best i can tell. the mate doesn't know she's a werewolf and she's fighting the transformation or something.<br /><br />you'd think it'd be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but, well they did. want quality low-end werewolf-ism, go rent dog soldiers want a ton of t&a this is your flick.
