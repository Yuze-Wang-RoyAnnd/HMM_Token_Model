i read the reviews before i watched this movie, and i didn't believe them. i love crap movies and i expected this one to be average. it wasn't. this film makes camp blood 1 and 2 look like greats. the film contains bad acting, poor sound, poor confusing storyline, bad makeup- and it bored me so much i turned it off. even the nudity was rubbish! did they even have a budget for this film? i don't think they did. you can tell if your gonna like this film or not in the first 5 minutes. if u want a good cheesy gory film go watch toxic avenger 4 or even camp blood. avoid this trash - i watched it on tv and felt riped off, so don't spend anything on it. the best part is probably the end.
