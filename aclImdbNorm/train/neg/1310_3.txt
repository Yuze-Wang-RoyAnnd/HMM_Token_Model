the plot is straightforward an old man living off a main road in woodland one day witnesses a man murdering a child in the woods. soft for digging follows the old man's attempts to try and convince the police that what he saw was not a figment of his imagination. however, there is a problem each time the old man guides the police to where the murder happen no corpse can be found. soft for digging has a diminutive dialogue which reflects the majority of the scenes of the film, an old man living by himself in a house. during the film i found that i was scared twice namely when the murdered child abruptly appears before the old man. the rest of the film i have to admit did not engage me; i found the tempo of the film a little too slow. the limited dialogue was not a problem. however, the development of the story and its conclusions, after watching the film, took too long. i feel more could have been made of the relationship, ghostly encounters, with the child and the old man. alone in the woods at night unsure of your own mind can lead to some eerie situations, children are always scary as ghosts, see dark water.
