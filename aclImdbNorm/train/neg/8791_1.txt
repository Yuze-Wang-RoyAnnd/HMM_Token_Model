be warned! <br /><br />this is crap that other crap won't even deign to be in company with because it's beneath them! okay, got that out of the way, let me say something more substantive.<br /><br />i've seen ashes of time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly revered wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director, wong kar wai. well, despite of all of that wkw hasn't succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of wuxia fans; mostly it is just shots of dripping water, beads of sweats, legs of horses running, etc. i couldn't sit through most of the movie.<br /><br />fast forward many years later when i wanted to give mr. wong's movies another shot after hearing many praises, especially from cannes. i was intrigued by his latest, 2046. a friend told me to start w/ chungking express because it is his most accessible movies. so wrong! i was just p.o. that i got duped into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness. some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city, blah, blah, blah. it's all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it. but no, he merely shows what is. faye wong's acting is very typical of hong kong's style: garbled enunciation, deer in the headlight wide eye expression, try to be cute and girlish kind of acting; the rest of the cast is equally uninspired.<br /><br />i think the word, auteur, is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different, which is to be applauded, but not one who hasn't yet mastered the art of cinematic story telling, which is what mr. wong is, for the last 17 years!
