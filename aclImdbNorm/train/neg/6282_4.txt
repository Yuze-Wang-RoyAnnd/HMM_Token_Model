if the myth regarding broken mirrors would be accurate, everybody involved in this production would now face approximately 170 years of bad luck, because there are a lot of mirrors falling to little pieces here. if only the script was as shattering as the glass, then "the broken" would have been a brilliant film. now it's sadly just an overlong, derivative and dull movie with only just a handful of remarkable ideas and memorable sequences. sean ellis made a very stylish and elegantly photographed movie, but the story is lackluster and the total absence of logic and explanation is really frustrating. i got into a discussion with a friend regarding the basic concept and "meaning" of the film. he thinks ellis found inspiration in an old legend claiming that spotting your doppelganger is a foreboding of how you're going to die. interesting theory, but i'm not familiar with this legend and couldn't find anything on the internet about this, neither. personally, i just think "the broken" is yet another umpteenth variation on the theme of "invasion of the body snatchers" but without the alien interference. "the broken" centers on the american mcvey family living in london, and particularly gina. when a mirror spontaneously breaks during a birthday celebration, this triggers a whole series of mysterious and seemingly supernatural events. gina spots herself driving by in a car and follows her mirror image to an apartment building. whilst driving home in a state of mental confusion, she causes a terrible car accident and ends up in the hospital. when dismissed, gina feels like her whole surrounding is changing. she doesn't recognize her own boyfriend anymore and uncanny fragments of the accident keep flashing before her eyes. does she suffer from mental traumas invoked by the accident or is there really a supernatural conspiracy happening all around her? writer/director sean ellis definitely invokes feelings of curiosity and suspense in his script, but unfortunately he fails to properly elaborate them. "the broken" is a truly atmospheric and stylish effort, but only after just half an hour of film, you come to the painful conclusion it shall just remain a beautiful but empty package. there's a frustratingly high amount of "fake" suspense in this film. this means building up tension, through ominous music and eerie camera angels, when absolutely nothing has even happened so far. by the time the actually mysteriousness kicks in, these tricks don't have any scary effect on you anymore. some of my fellow reviewers around here compare the film and particularly sean ellis' style with the repertoires of david lynch, stanley kubrick and even alfred hitchcock, but that is way, way
