i think its time for seagal to go quietly into the night. what i have just seen makes all his direct to video releases in the last few years look like his early 90's smash hits in comparison.<br /><br />a secret bio lab is making a new kind of drug that jacks up a human's adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something. somehow seagal is supposed to stop the infection or its the end of the world...or something. seagal also went through hit squads like jellybeans, every time i look up he was commanding a new face so it kinda got hard to follow character development as well i know steven's athsma prevent him from yelling at the top of his lungs but even so why is he constantly being dubbed by people who sound nothing like him? usually the films plot and action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time but this was not even close. like i said, it was more of a horror movie with a lot of blood and shank stabbing rather than straight up fighting. the problem was it wasn't really scary and seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have speed of light movement yet the 40 year old 280 lb seagal killed them all singlehandedly? i guess the lone highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes where the new recruits ask seagal to come to the strip club with them.<br /><br />2 out of 10
