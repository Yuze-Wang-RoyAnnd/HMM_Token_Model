this has to be the worst movie ever!!! the acting is scarier than the movie. lots of blood, but no idea where it comes from, cuz they don't even show you the cuts. i can't believe i wasted my time watching this movie. we laughed like we were watching a comedy and not a horror movie. this is a disgrace to horror films!!! for one if they are in asia why is there a white cop driving past waste management trash cans?! there's so much of another language that you don't even know what's going on half the time. the film editing is a joke, my teenager could do better. and if i went to a movie theater and that nasty old man was working the window that would be the first clue. do not watch this movie!!! not to even see how bad it is, you will be sorry you did!!
