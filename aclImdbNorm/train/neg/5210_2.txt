first let me be honest. i did not watch all this movie. i watched the first five minutes and when i realized that i had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that i may as well fast forward and see if it got any more interesting later on... it didn't. this film is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story which is already uninteresting and badly told into something that it would never become: a decent horror movie. because i feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor special effects can still be good if it is well made. this film isn't and will only put you into a deep sleep if you attempt to watch it. lastly i feel it is important to say that i think this movie is in the publicdomain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it than a littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place where you won't need to pay to watch this pile of cinematographic dung.
