this movie is an idiotic attempt at some kind of action thriller. a tour bus on its way to las vegas is attacked by a group of white trash hijackers driving dune buggies. they drive them out into the desert and then steal all of their valuables. the plot changes constantly. one minute they are looking to kidnap a rich ranchers daughter, the next they are looking for a collectible stamp worth 90,000 dollars. the dialogue is horrible.<br /><br />please don't watch this movie.
