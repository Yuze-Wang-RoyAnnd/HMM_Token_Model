i am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this, but come on! this has to be the worst piece of monkey s@#t i have ever seen! i ignored the reviews posted on this site figuring that it would fall into my taste in horror, but i got bored and turned it off.let's see:<br /><br />the wardrobe: consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot. the masks were made from what looks like tin foil. <br /><br />the gore: the gore was pretty good, i must give it that. but ittenbach's burning moon was better for a low budget movie. <br /><br />acting: was horrible! i didn't mind the dubbing. i find this humorous like in ittenbach's "premutos" (great movie). the fighting and action sequences were pi$$ poor.<br /><br />bottom line: don't watch any of schnaas's movies. there are much better directors like jorg buttergeit and olaf ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter. check premutos, house of blood, schramm and the nekromantiks.
