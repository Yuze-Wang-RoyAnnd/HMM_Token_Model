a few weeks ago, i read the classic george orwell novel, 1984. i was fascinated with it and thought it was one of the best books i've read recently. so when i rented the dvd, i was intrigued to see how this adaptation measured up. unfortunately, the movie didn't even come close to creating the ambiance or developing the characters that orwell so masterfully did in his book. the director seems to think that everyone watching the movie has read the book, because he makes no attempt to demonstrate why the characters act and feel the way they do. john hurt, the main actor, is droll the entire way through, and hardly does any acting until the end. we never really find out what he does for a living, or why his love affair is forbidden, or what the political climate is and why the main character desires rebellion. this book cannot be done justice in movie form without proper narration and explanation of the political system oppressing the characters, and the fact that those are missing is the greatest shortcoming of this film. besides that, john hurt was a terrible casting choice, looking about 15 years older than the 39 year old winston he was supposed to be portraying. on a more positive note, however, the rest of the cast was well chosen. it's just too bad they were put in such a horribly adapted film with the wrong lead actor. -brian o.
