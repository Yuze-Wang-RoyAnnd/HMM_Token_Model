problem child is one of the worst movies i have seen in the last decade! this is a bad movie about a savage boy adopted by two parents, but he gets into trouble later. that junior can drive grandpa's car. he can scare people with a bear. he can put a room on fire! it is a bad movie as much as battlefield earth. a sequel is an even worse fate. rent chicken run instead.<br /><br />*1/2 out of **** i give it.
