this is very much a television version of the tale, the film starts out like an episode of 'xena...', with little meaningful dialog or character description. it does get a bit more substantive after a while, but all characters are still cartoonish. <br /><br />salma is the exotic beauty. richard harris is an evil and sexually repressed frollo, fiending to bust a nut up in salma. the other characters, including quasimodo are quite forgettable. <br /><br />its also a sorta liberal version of the story, frollo is a suppressor of enlightenment ideals, like the abbot in 'name of the rose', and quasimodo is a champion of liberty. the shadowy side of the quas character is ignored, though he does pour liquid led on people. he is really only an outsider in that he looks different and enjoys playing with bells more than the average person. <br /><br />perhaps the film is intended for children, but i doubt it, considering frollo flogs himself bloody to amend wanting to spank his monkey. a mostly uninteresting and forgettable, but not awful, and sometimes entertaining, rendition of the tale.
