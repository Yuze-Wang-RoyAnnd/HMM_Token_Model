this is a made-for-tv and rather needless sci-fi channel retelling of the beowulf story, especially after the recent 2005 film "beowulf and grendel". this movie doesn't really get into beowulf's story, but just takes us through his battle against the ravenous beast known as grendel as it leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and turmoil while the powerful viking warrior, beowulf is called upon to rid them of the monster's rampage. if this is successfully accomplished, the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep it at bay. after a few failed attempts, the creature is slain, but it's angry and vengeful mother soon attacks, leaving it up to beowulf to, again, lend his mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat it. "grendel" looks like it was shot on a tiny budget and the cg effects are terrible. like i said, this movie is absolutely needless.
