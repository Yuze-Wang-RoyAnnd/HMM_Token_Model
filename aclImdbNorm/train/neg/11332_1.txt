as big as a texas prairie and equally as boring. even liz taylor, james dean, chill wills, and dennis hopper can't float this overbloated boat. taylor actually looks bad--wrong wardrobe, wrong hair, and wrong makeup--a unique accomplishment in her remarkable career. hopper gives the only believable performance, and dean in the climactic scene displays remarkable talent as something we usually don't remember him for--a comic actor. rock hudson is his usual prototype of barbie doll ken and makes one wonder what a, say, redford could have done with the male lead. there is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the final twenty minutes, just a pastiche of milestones that have little relationship to each other. except for hopper, there is no character development, only a collection of cardboard cutouts that pop up periodically for no discernible reason like random targets in a shooting gallery. to its credit, the film does tackle racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects, and it does have size, making it an excellent choice for ridding yourself of unwelcome house guests. those with the dvd version can spare themselves some of the tedium by starting with the second disk. you won't be missing anything of interest.
