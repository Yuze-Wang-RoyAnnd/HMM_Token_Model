i really liked zb1. really, i did. i have no problem with extremely low-budget movies, and i have enjoyed movies with worse production values than zb3 (if you can imagine such a thing. check out 'wiseguys vs. zombies,' if you're interested). indeed, i prefer lower budget zombie films, because i am suspicious that hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are 'about.'<br /><br />but zb3 was just so bad. it was retarded. i don't want to bother being dignified in my criticism. i want my 90 minutes back, etc. except that it really only took ~80 minutes, because partway through i put it into 1.4x fast forward.<br /><br />okay, here's some criticism.<br /><br />1. the pacing was terrible. everyone talked in monologues. even when someone just had a single line, the camera work and the editing and the insertion of a bunch of f-bombs into every sentence made the line feel like a monologue. at first i was excited about the 90 minute running time compared to zb1's 70 minutes, but there were actually fewer 'events' in zb3. it's all talking.<br /><br />2. the gore effects got stupider. just glop rubbed around on people's tummies.<br /><br />3. despite the epic exposition, there really wasn't a plot. and the exposition is indeed epic! i won't spoil it, if you're going to watch it. (don't watch it.) but then, it's just a bunch of lame characters walking around and bickering for ~80 minutes. or fewer, if you so choose.
