this movie is really bad. the acting is plain awful except michael ironside. i don't get the story. richard grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two mc-gangs. he comes to a town and suddenly he is choosened to fight against the bad people who wants indian-land. at the cover it said he was a indian himself that returned too his home-town, i didn't hear that in the movie, if so it wasn't clear.<br /><br />richard grieco was one hell of a bad actor. stiff and ugly. he said his lines like it too. and we wouldn't talk about sean young, she hasn' been any of my favourite actors but in this movie she plays a indian women who falls in love with bolt (grieco). she is awful.<br /><br />when i rented it i choosed between this and subterfuge with amanda pays. i choosed this one because of michael ironside was in the cast. maybe i should have taken subterfuge.<br /><br />don't see this unless you think richard grieco looks tough on a motorbike with sunglasses.<br /><br />i will soon uptade the cast-list because i have it at home. i wrote it down after i seen the movie.
