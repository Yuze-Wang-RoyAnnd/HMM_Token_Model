i usually read reviews before i watch a movie. guess what, i didn't do that before watching tlb, and i have to say i was very surprised to see the above average rating at imdb. i found it to have a total lack of story. you just get dropped into it (and, sadly, not in the way saving private ryan dropped us into the movie), and it also has a sudden end, which was very unsatisfying for me.<br /><br />i have to admit, the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me, especially with the low budget in mind. but prepare yourself to have a laugh... some guys are being tossed through the air after an explosion as if they are olympic gymnasts. a mid-air corkscrew or somersault during ww i is a bit too much for me, especially when it's performed countless times during the movie...<br /><br />but the parts that really got me laughing until i almost cried were the scenes containing close combat. the screaming and shouting german voices...unbelievably funny. it seems as if they are spoken by one single actor / voice performer, because they all sound exactly the same, and it just sounds like a 'typical' german voice.<br /><br />i would absolutely not recommend this movie to anyone, except to people who just want to have some laughs because of the sad and corny quality of it.
