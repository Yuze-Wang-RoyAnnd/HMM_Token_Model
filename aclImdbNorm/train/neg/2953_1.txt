these reviews that claim this movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one. this movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that leonard part 6, battlefield earth and gigli had. those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful. i haven't been in this much pain watching a bad movie since i watched baby geniuses and superbabies. before i start the review let me tell you the story. theodore rex is a $35 million dollar bust the new line cinema refused to put in theaters. they cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straight-to-video movie in decades. whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck.<br /><br />plot: a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another ice age. a female cop named katie coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named theodore rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaur.<br /><br />the plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery. then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful. whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail. theodore rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen. most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tail(on accident and on purpose). i thought burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to theodore rex: the worst movie of whoopi's career.<br /><br />don't let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable. i didn't see that when i watched this movie. all i saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie howard the duck. the humor is on that level and theodore rex looks like the inbred cousin of barney. utterly painful from start to finish.
