just plain good old stupid. <br /><br />i mean really stupid, not the good stupid like killer tomatoes, or ed wood movies, this is probably the most stupid movie i ever have seen. to give this movie an golden turkey is an insult to turkeys. to call this movie dumb is offensive even to dumb people.<br /><br />if this is the future of american cinema and art we are better off to really start world war 3 and 4 at the same time and let the cockroaches run the show after. <br /><br />now i have to get drunk to wash this insult to my single braincell off....<br /><br />this is a really good movie if you are suicidal.
