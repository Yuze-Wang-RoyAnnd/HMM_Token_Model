annie potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film. mark hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod (quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie), and heads off to las vegas with annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy.<br /><br />i would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasn't for the fun of watching annie potts in a very early role, and it's too bad for hamill that he didn't take a few acting lessons from her. danny bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo.
