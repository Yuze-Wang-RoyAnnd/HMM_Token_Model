i have just seen this movie and have not read the book. the good thing of the movie is that at some parts it gets you thinking for a little while on the spiritual subject, evolution, sincronicity and your part in the world.<br /><br />however, the movie's immersion is easily broken and there is very little rapport between the viewer and the characters. it is very clear that the book looses a lot in this movie version. the events that were suppose to show sincronicity taking place are almost unrecognizable. a lot of reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence, and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose. <br /><br />enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create the better feeling that it was supposed to. do you recall the enlightenment with keanu reeves (in little buddha) ? well, this is nothing like that.<br /><br />most scenes are poorly executed. there are a lot of scenes that really don't develop the story and also do not help in creating an atmosphere.<br /><br />the better actors in this movie, namely hector elizondo, joaquim de almeida and j"urgen prochnow cannot save it. the first 2 seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters should in an attempt to save the movie, and because they were paid more, but this does not work. most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all.<br /><br />j"urgen does good in his scenes and sells as an evil guy (as always), but the script does not help him at all. the scene where he first tries to convince john (matthew settle) to join him is just bad script. the execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly bad executed. the flashbacks throughout the movie cannot even be commented.<br /><br />overall this movie is a big waist of time, read the book! i have not read it, but it is probably a billion times better than this, it has to be.<br /><br />it is so bad that i had to write my first comment in imdb.
