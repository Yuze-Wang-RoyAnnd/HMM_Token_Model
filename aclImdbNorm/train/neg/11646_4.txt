kojak meets the mafia. telly savales is one of those guys from the past that seems pretty forgettable. i never thought that his show was all that great. this is his one dimensional characterization of a crime boss, with very predictable results. if you take the car chases and the general rambling out, there isn't much plot development or action. i find mafia movies to be dull because i have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions. hollywood, and in this case, the italian cinema, treat these guys as heroes. i saw the film and in a few days i won't remember much about it. lots of shooting, innocent bystanders dying, betrayal, and that sick loyalty. the film is photographed pretty well and the acting is decent. but the dubbing is so bad (due to voices that just couldn't come out of those bodies), that i almost started looking for godzilla approaching the bay.
