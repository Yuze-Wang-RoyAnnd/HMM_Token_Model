what can you say about a grainy, poorly filmed 16mm stag film, where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd? nothing that would be positive. avoid this travesty at all costs. in any case, it would be difficult to find, since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa. i strongly suggest imdb to re-visit their weighting formula for establishing ratings, since an 8.8 rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd! i am, by no means, a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70's & 80's; but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the (then illegal) stag loop.
