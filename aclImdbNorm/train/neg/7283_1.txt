facts about national lampoon goes to the movies, a.k.a. national lampoon's movie madness:<br /><br />1. the movie is poor, even by lampoon's typical standards. 2. it's not funny. 3. no one goes to see a movie.<br /><br />so, after i finished watching it, i began wondering why on earth it's called 'national lampoon goes to the movies,' and why it was ever conceived, much less actually made. it would be like calling austin powers 'an american guy goes to the movies.' how lame. he isn't american, and he doesn't go to movies. none of the characters in lampoon's so-called 'satire' are funny, and none go see movies, which causes a bit of a problem. i had hoped it would be something in the vein of mystery science theater 3000, but it isn't.<br /><br />this was national lampoon's first film after animal house, although you couldn't tell it from the quality of film. poorly developed, rough and amateurish by any standard, it induces headaches
