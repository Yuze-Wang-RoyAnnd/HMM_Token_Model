i feel much less generous with this film than others of its ilk. the portrayal of madmen in this century is always done with them being so totally bizarre as to be a different species. their antics are so outrageous as to be totally fictionalized. everyone is napoleon or some other historical figure; or they have a fascination with chickens. they are on the make or beating each other up. it's as if the scriptwriter said, what can i make up for them to do, without an sense of what insanity or even mental illness is. watch the wonderful human portrayal in "one flew over the cuckoo's nest" where the illnesses are believable and real. i once worked in a state mental hospital. i didn't see any of these guys. these are too smart and calculating to make them come to life.
