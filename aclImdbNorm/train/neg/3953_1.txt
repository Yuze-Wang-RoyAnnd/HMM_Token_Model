i can't believe this film was allowed to be made. these people should be drug out and beat with blunt objects. they should be tortured. this film is an abomination.it's nothing but footage from the first film. whatever is original is freaky and makes no sense whatsoever. it's like some sort of drug hallucination.like, what's with the laying on a mirror naked therapy. also, whatever moron patched together this turd didn't even bother to watch the first film, because they kept calling suzanna love's character natalie, when it's lacey. i felt like shouting that at the screen, "it's lacey, it's lacey!!!!". i give it a -50 out of 10. my god!!!!
