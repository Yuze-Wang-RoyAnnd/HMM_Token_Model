i think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons i have ever watched. i would recommend this cartoon to people who are under 5. i did used to like this show when i was 4 and 5, i still only watched it when there was nothing on. now i am other 5 and i would rather do my homework than watch it. the cartoon used to be a bit funny but they were not enough to make me burst out laughing. now i am older i am interested in show witch are not rated us. i have started to watch doctor who (12a), torchwood (15) and sarah jane adventures (pg). i am interested in things to do with doctor who so i am not interested in 5 year old cartoons. this cartoon didn't last very long it only had 6 seasons, it got cancelled because of it was low on viewers but some people say it was because the writers ran out of ideas but for most other shows they have at least 8 seasons.
