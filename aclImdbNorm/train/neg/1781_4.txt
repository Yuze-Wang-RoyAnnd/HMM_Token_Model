written by stephen king, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film. a mother and son move into a small indiana town with a secret. they are sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. this little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus hints of incest.<br /><br />alice krige is outstanding as the mother. others appearing are madchen amick, brian krause and cindy pickett. look for very small roles for john landis and clive barker. stephen king cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery.
