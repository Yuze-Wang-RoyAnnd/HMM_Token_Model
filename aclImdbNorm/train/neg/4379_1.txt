<br /><br />ok, well i rented this movie while i was bed ridden hopped up on pain killers, and let me say, it didn't help the film any.<br /><br />the film is about a man who buys a car as he is going through a midlife crisis, he loves the car more than anything around him, one day his wife decides to borrow the car. since i don't want to spoil (not that there was anything to spoil) i shall let your imagination figure out the "zany" (and i use that word lightly) antics that follow.<br /><br />i had to fight to stay awake through this snore a minute sleeper of a film, and i would like to say that if you are venturing to the movie store and are thinking about being adventurous, please don't, it's a waste of the film it was printed on.<br /><br />then again i could be wrong...
