(spoilers)the one truly memorable part of this otherwise rather dull and tepid bit of british cuisine is steiner's henna rinse, one of the worst dye jobs ever. that, and the magnificent caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil dude who was trying to steal steiner's invention. mst3k does an admirable job of making a wretchedly boring and grey film funny.i particularly like it when crow kills mike with his 'touch of death', and when he revives him in the theatre, mike cries "guys, i died, i saw eternal truth and beauty! oh, it's this movie..." that would be a letdown, having to come back from the afterlife to watch the rest of the projected man. the film could make a fortune being sold as a sleep aide. some of the puns in the film were wicked: police inspector-"electrocution!" crow-"shocking, isn't it?" police inspector-"that's lowe, all right" tom servo-"very low, right down by the floor!" police inspector-"can i get on?" tom servo-"he's dead, but knock yourself out" mst3k is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer.
