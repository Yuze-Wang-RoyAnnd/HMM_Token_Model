the orders fatal flaw-besides an asinine plot-is that the character's simply don't resonate or even react.<br /><br />two examples: a priest, walking through a graveyard late at night, is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirits. after fighting them off, he calmly resumes his walk when his buddy come up. "anything wrong?" his buddy asks, having seen the attack. "just some demonic spirits-nothing i couldn't handle." no reaction, no surprise, just like he'd changed a tire. his buddy is equally unconcerned... must be standard priest training... ["and then you put the wafer into their mouths. any questions? ok, moving on, demon spirit attacks..."]<br /><br />example two: at one point the priests need an answer to a question, and only a demon (or something, who cared by now) could provide it. how? why, you have to ask a dying man! so the demon has some random person hung in front of the two priests so they can ask their question to the thrashing, gasping man. "hey, don't kill him!" or maybe "that's not nice!" would have been more realistic then their response. they never ask that they let the man go or stop-in fact, the closest to reacting they get is mild annoyance. they ask their question and go.<br /><br />i had to shut it off at that point-my brain was starting to atrophy.<br /><br />avoid<br /><br />* / **** (one star out of four)<br /><br />
