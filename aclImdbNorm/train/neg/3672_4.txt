i watched the entire movie recognizing the participation of william hurt, natascha mcelhone, and desiree nosbusch. i'm glad that i had no idea of the presence of peter weller. at the end of the movie i said "that was peter weller?" kudos to mr. weller for an outstanding performance. weller played a major character, and his performance was such that i didn't even recognize him.<br /><br />overall the plot was bad, the writing was bad, and the performances, aside from those of nosbusch and weller, were subpar. the scenery and setting were interesting, and weller was amazing.<br /><br />4 stars, of a possible 10.
