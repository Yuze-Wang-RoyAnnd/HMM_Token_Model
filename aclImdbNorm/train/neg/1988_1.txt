alright, i got passed the horrible acting. i got passed the fact that lil kim was blasting some cannons and her arms or hands weren't moving, i got passed the weaves, i got passed the colored contacts.<br /><br />this is what killed it for me: in the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing. lisa-raye and monica calhoun stand up and, and then lil kim gets up to break up any hostilities by saying, "whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up. let's chill out here for a hot second." i am a fan of the western movie genre, and i never heard anyone talk slang like this in any of clint eastwood's movies.<br /><br />if anyone thinks this movie deserves over a 1 rating, please tell me another movie that's worse than gang of roses.<br /><br />i'm through.
