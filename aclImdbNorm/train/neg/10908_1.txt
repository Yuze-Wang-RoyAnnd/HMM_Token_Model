nothing in this movie is funny. i thought the premise, giving a human the libido of a randy ram, was interesting and should provide for some laughs. wrong! there is simply nothing funny about the movie. for example, the main character making a pass at a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer's yard is not funny, it borders on obscenity. they are toying around with bestiality in this film on one level, and it just aint funny.<br /><br />we all know that dogs will eat anything, anywhere, anytime. the main character doing this with everything, everywhere, everytime is also not funny. it becomes a cliche.<br /><br />rob schneider is, i guess, acceptable in the role. by this, i mean that he's not a bad actor, but with rotten material it's difficult to comment on quality. however, coleen haskell, the other half of the human-romantic leads (does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too?), seems embarrassed by the whole thing, as well she should be. she seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum, detached from all the other actors in the movie. <br /><br />see this film only if you wish to be bored by tasteless, dull, repetitive material.
