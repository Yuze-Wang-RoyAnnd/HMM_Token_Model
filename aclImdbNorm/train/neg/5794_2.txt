the germans all stand out in the open and get mowed down with a machine gun. the good guys never die, unless its for dramatic purposes. the "plot" has so many holes its laughable. (where did the german soldiers go once they rolled the fuel tank towards the train? erik estrada? please!) and the whole idea, hijacking a train? how moronic is that! the germans know where you are going to go, its not like you can leave the track and drive away! what a waste. i would rather bonk myself on the head with a ball peen hammer 10 times then have to sit through that again. i mean, seriously, it felt like it was made in the 60s, but it was produced in 88!! 1988!! the a-team is more believable than this horrid excuse for a movie. only watch it if you need a good laugh. this movie is to tele sevalas what green beret was to john wayne.
