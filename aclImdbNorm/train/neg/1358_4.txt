the words "swedish" and "action movie" do not mix. that becomes more and more obvious with every attempt made in the genre. this is yet another failed attempt.<br /><br />lasse brunell (shanti roney) works at a military air base with top secret computer systems. one day foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he doesn't do what they tell him. they want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it.<br /><br />this movie has it's ups and downs. and usually in swedish action movies there are no "ups", just "downs". so i guess something in this movie showed some quality. to begin with the positive remarks i can mention that the movie is technically well made. the footage of planes and helicopters flying are well shot and look very nice. the acting is of very varying quality. shanti roney makes a decent performance while maria bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual (i wonder how long swedish directors are going to keep using her even though she has the acting skills of a wooden plank?). stefan sauk is laughable as the "cool" special forces man who comes to the base to investigate.<br /><br />and what about the action scenes? well as i said above the scenes of planes and helicopters flying are nice. but aside from that there is not much action to talk about. and that is a common problem with swedish action films. there is just not enough action going on. maybe it's a budget problem, maybe it's film-making culture. i don't know, but it negatively affects the experience. because quite frankly, the story and acting is not good enough for this movie to rely just on that.<br /><br />i rate this 4/10 for effort.
