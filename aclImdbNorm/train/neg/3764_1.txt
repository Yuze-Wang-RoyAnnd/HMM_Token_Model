this is definitely the worst bigfoot movie i've ever seen and quite possibly the overall worst movie i've ever seen in my life. the actors and actresses were horrible and it seemed like they were trying way too hard to play their roles as dorks, tough guys, jerks, know it alls, etc. and the bigfoot itself was terrible. it appeared to be some kind of computer generated image from the days of atari & intellivision. at one point near the end of the movie as an army of sasquatches were chasing after the remaining survivors, one gets shot and as it's running it looked like a poor man's version of donkey kong himself! and one gets hit by a bullet and the blood that comes out of it was just awful animation. another thing that was annoying was the music. way way way too much music (classical score or whatever you call it) throughout the entire film. it was never ending. oh yeah, the movie is boring too. absolutely one of the worst films i've ever seen. i highly recommend taking your $3 or whatever they charge to rent this movie and spending it on a gallon of gas or a value menu somewhere. truly awful!
