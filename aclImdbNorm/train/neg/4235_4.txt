i just finished watching this movie. i was very excited since i'm a big fan of punk rock, horror films and spoofs. i was very surprised at what i saw. i knew it was low budget, but i wasn't expecting it to be taped with a video camera. it opens with a good song and a great, very underrated band, the horrorpops, reforming their song, where they wander, and promptly getting killed in various gruesome ways. it's a great opening. but the problem is the fact that, up until the end, this was really all that the movie was. a live performance, a death. another live performance, a death. it gets old. and there is a gross(literally) overuse of intestines in the death scenes. why doesn't the killer use other body parts, like legs, or eyeballs, or brains? don't get me wrong, this movie has some parts that are awesome. like the hardcore french band, known simply as beret, the prospect of a band named atticus, the scene containing a performance by members of the the used and simple plan playing together, since neither bands had enough members to play their show, and bowling for soup's overweight-and-proud-of-it guitarist getting killed in a truly hilarious manner, that i will save for the future watchers of this movie. but the big problem i have with this movie is the at first comical, but after a while, terrible lack of acting talent in a lot of the "actors". especially warped tour creator, kevin lyman. he tries very hard, but i suspect that he didn't want to make the film, but was contractually obligated or something. in addition to that, the sound quality is terrible and there are no subtitles on the dvd. the movie's resolving plot is very hazy and very random. something about a magic sword and lloyd kaufman as the devil. bottom line, this movie has a lot of good qualities, but not enough to be anywhere near a decent horror, music, or comedy film. although i have to credit it with turning me onto a few bands that i would never have listened to, otherwise. such as tsunami bomb, and the phenomonauts(an insane, psychobilly band). i recommend that you rent this movie, watch the first 10 or 20 minutes, if you like it, watch the next 20 or 30, if you still like it, then watch on. if not, just go to the special features and watch all the music videos and live performances. they rock! long live punk rock and horror!
