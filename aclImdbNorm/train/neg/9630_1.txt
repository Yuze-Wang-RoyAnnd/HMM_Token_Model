i realize several ben stiller movies are out or will be out this year, but perhaps he should insist on quality, not quantity.<br /><br />i was dumbfounded at what the filmmakers thought passed for comedy in "along came polly." <br /><br />stiller's reuben is grating, charmless and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year. stiller's schtick is getting tiresome. he undoubtedly has comic talent, but he needs to either find another schtick or take a break, find some material that is actually funny. because his movies are going from painfully humorless to excruciatingly bad.<br /><br />there's absolutely no chemistry between stiller and jennifer aniston, which is a shame because she's a good, smart actress with a promising career. as long as she keeps making more movies such as "the good girl" (in which she's terrific) and less like "along came polly," she'll have a career of which she could be proud.<br /><br />aniston tries desperately to overcome the limp material with which she's working, but it's a daunting task for any actress. with the exception of a few moments with alec baldwin, as reuben's boss stan, and philip seymour hoffman, as reuben's best friend sandy, there's nothing funny in this awful film. other supporting characters, including debra messing as lisa and hank azaria as claude, are annoying. azaria's accent is not only stupid, it's terribly unfunny.<br /><br />the premise of "along came polly" certainly showed promise. unfortunately, it needed a writer who could actually turn it into a good comedy, instead of this lame, dull, boring excuse for a comedy.
