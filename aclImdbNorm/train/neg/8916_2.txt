i rented this dvd having seen it while looking for something else. when i saw the title on the jacket i couldn't believe my eyes. i read yalom's book about a year ago and loved it, in fact admire yalom's work in general. (i am a clinical psychologist.) i have watched perhaps 30 minutes of this movie and have had to turn it off. i'm not sure if i can take much more. at a superficial level, the faux accents, as others have commented, are simply distracting at best and irritating and vapid at worst. the acting is dull when it should be passionate and comical when it should be serious. the portrayal of lou salome is simply flippant, and the brilliant freud comes off as little more than a schoolboy. i see very little of the book's spirit conveyed thus far. i had hoped to be able to recommend this film to my students. instead, i will refer them to the book. imagine that.
