watching tom hanks as a hit man for the irish mob is a little like seeing jimmy stewart as a serial rapist it just doesn't work. i had a really hard time accepting this.not that i don't think tom can't act he can i've been following his career since mazes and monsters but for some reason this fell flat for me. maybe because i'm such a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a fanboy(the only form of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroach)the movie as a whole fails for me.the additions jude law, and the subtractions everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little disappointed. i was expecting a great crime movie more in the vein of bonnie and clyde mendes took all the heart out of the story and left us with nothing but the bare bones. there are things to like in this flick however the cinematography is breathtaking filling the screen with beautiful images paul newman is as usual excellent and i really did enjoy the score, but tom as "the angel of death" sullivan was completely flat.
