if this movie was about a fictional character, the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively. unfortunately for the viewer, the movie is based on "facts" that are shaded very unfairly toward ruben carter. many of the smaller facts were disregarded (carter was not number one contender at the time of the murders, there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the larger facts, like apparently being robbed of a decision to joey giardello because of "racist" judges, is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape, and completely disrespectful to giardello. why hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who, at best, was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be (was arrested multiple times for beating women) is strange to me. ruben carter was never, by viewing his actions in the 60's and even now, when he refuses to speak to his son, a person that people can look up to. everyone knows that jewison can direct, and washington can act, but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me. is hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable? (heres a suggestion how about denzel playing a movie about himself? now thats inspirational) based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie, i would suggest passing on this one.
