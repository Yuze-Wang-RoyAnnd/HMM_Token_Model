watching a videotaped replay of about 8 various 1994-1997 spider-man cartoons made me realize why i couldn't stomach it when it first came out.<br /><br />i'm from the old school, where the 1967 spider-man cartoon was the best and still remains the best. (i won't get into the psychedelic version which is terrible - give me traditional villains please.)<br /><br />the acting in the new stuff is lousy, read off a sheet with either no feeling or overacting. paul soles, where are you now? this guy was the best at voice acting for spider-man. no one comes close. watching secret wars, a great idea for a cartoon mini-series, made me wince. dr. doom sounds like a comedy version of bela lugosi. in a scene with red skull and doc ock, red skull has no german accent while ock is heavy russian! the old marvel comic hero series from 1966 had much better voice acting. iron man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask, captain america sounded authoritative not like some teenage kid. paul frees as the thing in the 60s was the best thing ever. the old voice actors were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them. ever hear mel blanc's son? no way can he replicate his dad.<br /><br />the animation is clunky. okay, so they have all the fancy character shadings and nicely painted backrounds. sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad. sometimes when you let the computer take over the movements they become robotic. i really don't think any of these animators know what in betweeners are. <br /><br />the stories are badly written, and some of the lines they give the heroes are horrible. why, for example, when heroes are teamed together for the first time they start fighting with each other? in secret wars, it was a lame excuse that got them in disagreement. i can see if the hero was dark, unknown and mysterious - like the punisher, but why the thing and iron man can't hold their tempers with each other is ridiculous, then the torch joins in. this is just another of the later comic trends to get heroes to square off at each other for a few seconds because 'everyone' wants to see that stuff. give them a better reason to fight and maybe it can be pulled off, but "hey what are you doing here" and "you don't tell me what to do" are lame reasons. another badly written scene is in the wedding where harry osborne unmasks himself to spoil peter's wedding. that whole scenario was awful.<br /><br />last, but certainly not least, is what another critic calls juvenile violence - meaning no punches at all. in secret wars, the lizard carefully ducked the thing's charge. but the thing punches the bad guys across an entire block in the comics. he must simply revert to lifting heavy things and subduing a bad guy by grabbing hold of him in the cartoons. sure, these cartoons were not made strictly for us adults but for kids under 12. that's why they can't have punching, because mommy and daddy don't believe in that type of violence. but you can blow things up, these cartoons will include that. as a kid before political correctness came in fashion i saw cartoons punching each other. what's wrong with a punch to the chops? is there really less violence in the world today because those slick and crafty new cartoons took out the punch? i find this the most insulting of all when i watch the new stuff. they've written out "the punch' because we could all hurt ourselves.<br /><br />kids, enjoy these cartoons all you want, i've seen enough.<br /><br />3/10 rating
