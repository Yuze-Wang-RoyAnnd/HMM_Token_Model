i was able to hang in for only the first twenty minutes of this low-budget movie. the most glaring absurdity was that while the american inmates in a north korean pow camp are all supposedly suffering from severe deprivation of food and medicine, going without bathing, shivering in flimsy and filthy parkas, and sleeping on bare floors, and - let's not forget enduring torture - they always manage to sport impeccably coiffed hair. with the exception of a suitably austere-looking harry morgan as an army major, the casting and acting are simply awful. ronald regan cannot seem to stick to portraying a single character and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam of past roles. a mostly caucasian cast portraying the north korean camp officers might have been forgivable, but when supposedly russian officers acting as advisors to the koreans strut around wearing re-badged nazi uniforms complete with jodhpurs and jackboots (obvious costume-department recycles from wwii flicks) and speaking with accents like general burkhalter from hogan's heroes, well, that's just six kinds of silly. don't waste your time on this one.
