it is one of the worst movies i've ever seen, but hostel is definitely much more worse. this movie is more funny and ridiculous, than scary. i laughed most of the time when watched it. low quality effects (when you gonna watch it, you'll understand what i'm talking about and how low quality is that), bad actors (i hear of them for the first time), and it seems like it's shot by an amateur camcorder (so it looks more like a tv show, than a movie). but at least i've had the patience to watch it till the end. like comedies? watch it. wanna horror? go watch ju-on: the grudge or some other good horror movie.<br /><br />if i'm talking about the legend of diablo, i don't even know if i can classify it to a horror genre. just some low-budget crap.<br /><br />i rate it 3 out of 10
