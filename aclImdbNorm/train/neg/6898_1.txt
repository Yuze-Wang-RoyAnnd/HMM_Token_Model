avoid this crap at all costs. bad script, bad directing, bad acting, bad editing, bad sound, and bad music. get the idea? this movie tries to be western flavored, it's not. it tries to be hard core violent, it's not. it tries to present a fresh look at an old genre, it doesn't. the actors try there best, and my heart goes out to them. but with such inane material to work with it's hard to make something shine. to me this has all of the looks of a "fresh outta film school gonna set the world on fire" first attempt. freshmen film makers often bite off more that they, or their budget, can chew. the best thing they can do is to take a few steps back, reassess what is possible, and work within their limited budget the next time out.
