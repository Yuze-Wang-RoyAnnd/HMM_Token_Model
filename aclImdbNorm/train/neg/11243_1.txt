in short, this movie is completely worthless.<br /><br />the idea is to make movie from the point of view of what someone from the early 1900s might think of the future. an interesting idea, but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from ever suspending our disbelief, so the idea just flops.<br /><br />apparently the whole movie was done with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed. but as a graphics person, the over softening was an obvious crutch for hiding the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening. the color is majorly washed out to no relevant effect except reduce the visual quality. and i don't understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie to be in any way ground breaking. if anything, the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics -- they don't measure up even to the ancient jurassic park graphics. the models for the robots were so simple, plain and very uncompelling. there were a bunch of weirdo prehistoric-like animals on that island, but they are not explained in any way.<br /><br />the story is horrible beyond belief. in fact i can't believe i didn't just walk out of this movie. the relationship between polly and joe is unmotivated, and throughout the movie is based on distrust and deception. why is the morris paley character even there? we are not in any way convinced that joe is heroic -- i mean he flies a plane, and saved one person (polly) for personal reasons. yeah there's a great hero for you. dex has very little screen time, so why are we supposed to care about joe wanting to save him? who were the nepalease that locked joe and polly in the mine vault, and why would they do it (remembering that the entire totenkopf operation was robotic)?<br /><br />plot holes: (1) why did bai ling's character (a major fall from her excellent character in "the crow") halt the robots who had captured joe? they were looking for the vials, and had not found them. (2) why in the hell would dex be captured but not killed (he doesn't have or know about the vials, and the bad guys didn't know that polly had the vials and was connected to joe and therefore to dex)? (3) polly indicates that "they" don't know anything about totenkopf, yet she has some secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete fbi-style file on him. (4) the blank spot on the map as described by the nepalese -- if they know all about this mysterious area, then why the hell is their map blank in that spot? (5) at one point, polly and joe have to give up their clothes (they are burned) -- joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes, yet polly is forced to wear some very odd looking bulky dress, then in the same line of continuity suddenly polly has her original clothes back.<br /><br />*sigh*. how far off am i supposed to switch my brain to watch this crap?<br /><br />we are supposed to be exhilarated by the over produced music, even when nothing interesting or remotely exhilarating is happening on screen.<br /><br />and the acting? we're supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad british accents? which character isn't annoying? i think ling bai's dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie (she doesn't have a single line). the dialogue wasn't camp, and doesn't even rise to the level of cheese. its just bad and annoying. these people aren't hero's or compelling; they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate with if you ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real life.<br /><br />i can't believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on imdb. imho it should be competing with "batman forever" in the bottom 100 of all time.
