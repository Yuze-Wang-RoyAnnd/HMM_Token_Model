this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time. the story was boring, the dialogue was atrocious and the acting hammy. i'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project, but it certainly played like one. it is not even particularly successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as a single continuous take. the whooshing horizontal camera pans are a cheap and unoriginal way of hiding cuts.
