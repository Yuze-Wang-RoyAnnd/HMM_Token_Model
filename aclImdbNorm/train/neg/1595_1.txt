the movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of pokemon celebi. but the plot was out of course and didn't have as an interest as the other movies. it was a waste of money and time. the same corny humor and cliche bad guys. the movie was of no use to make if you wanted to make pokemon famous. the movie should better not associated with animes such as dragonballz, digimon, or yu-gi-oh. the drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime. it is a shame even to talk about this movie. i bet pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on pokemon. digimon is more of an anime and doesn't fall anywhere close to pokemon.it's second movie is coming out late 2002.
