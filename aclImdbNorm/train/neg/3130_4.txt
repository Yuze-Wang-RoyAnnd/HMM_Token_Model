i came into this movie really wanting to line it. i thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie. don't get me wrong here, i wasn't expecting citizen kane, i was taking this for the b movie that it is. that said, it still fell short of the expectation. the historical aspect of the story is glazed over and the ending left me a bit cold. the acting in the movie was very wooden. all in all i give it 4 for a great idea, but the movie could have scored much higher with a bit more attention to movie making fundamentals. is it worth seeing? i didn't wish for my two hours back, but i don't know that i'd recommend it to others.
