i am a great fan of martin amis, on whose book this film is based. unfortunately the director has been unable to translate the book to the screen. the novel is thoroughly post modern and highly artificial in its wildly overblown characters and the disintegration of traditional plot line and character development. it is an hilarious examination of human greed, excess and emptiness by one of the most moral of contemporary british writers. the director of the film has completely missed the point of the novel. in his hands, the film screams along at breakneck speed, indulging in every known trick shot and 'odd' camera angle possible. it is like ken russel on acid, and suffers from that older director's self indulgence cranked up to a hundred. not even the (brief) glimpse of gorgeous actor christian solimeno's penis was enough to save this wretched film for me. abysmal!
