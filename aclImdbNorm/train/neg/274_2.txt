there seems to be little in the way of middle ground where watch on the rhine is concerned. one either likes it very much, applauding its sincerity, its liberal point of view and fine acting, or else loathes its obvious propaganda, mediocre dialogue, cardboard characters and overall tendentiousness. i fall very much in the latter category, and found the film and play,--concerning the activities of european refugees in washington during wartime--a crushing bore, worthwhile mostly for the acting, and even then only intermittently. that author lillian hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant. her plays were written for people who shared her point of view, and she seldom explored ideas that weren't already held by the author and audience except to point out how dreadful the "other side" is. even when i find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she has to say,--as in rhine--i still can't stand the way she says it. her characters are unreal, and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no real brilliance or originality. she really had nothing new to say. i thoroughly agree with the late mary mccarthy's long overdue dismantling of hellman reputation some years ago. for those who think the theatre is dead or in extremis and yearn for the good old days, i urge a peek at watch on the rhine, as bad in its way as angels in america, which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago.
