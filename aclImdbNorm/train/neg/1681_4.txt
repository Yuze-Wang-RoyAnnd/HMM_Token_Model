freeway killer, is a madman who shoots people on the freeway while yelling a bunch of mystical chant on a car phone. the police believe he is a random killer, but sunny, the blond heroine, played by darlanne fluegel detects a pattern. so does the ex-cop, played by james russo, and they join forces, and bodies, in the search for the villain who has done away with their spouses. also starring richard belzer, this movie has its moments especially if you like car chases, but its really not a good movie for the most part, check it out if you're really bored and have already seen the hitcher, joy ride, or breakdown, otherwise stay away from the freeway.
