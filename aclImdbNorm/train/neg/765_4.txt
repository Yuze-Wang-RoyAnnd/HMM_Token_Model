seriously what were they thinking? over the course of years the columbo series has tried out some new things and diverted away from the usual successful formula but this movie really overdoes it. this movie is basically very different from any other columbo movie but the differences are not for the good of the movie.<br /><br />main thing that of course makes this movie different from any other columbo movie is the fact that there is no murder being committed. the entire premise of this movie is totally different and it places the columbo character in a totally different environment and situation. also the overall is just totally different and more 'modernized'.<br /><br />director alan j. levi did some other columbo movies in the past, which all very much sticked to the usual formula. it also makes it an odd choice that he got picked to direct this movie.<br /><br />the columbo character himself also feels quite different, perhaps because of the reason that he gets placed in a totally different environment and situation, when he helps out his nephew after his bride disappeared right after the wedding. the absence of some good relieving and trademark columbo humor also doesn't exactly make this a good or enjoyable watch.<br /><br />in all honesty, the movie doesn't begin too bad but the movie starts to become more and more ridicules with its story as it progresses. it's such a stupid written kidnap-thriller with a story that starts to become more and more unlikely. it also makes the movie more and more unwatchable. this is a very little interesting columbo entry that also really doesn't know to entertain its viewers in any way.<br /><br />it also doesn't help much that the supporting actors aren't the most talented ones around. despite the fact that his character is put in such a totally different situation and the movie is shot in such a completely different style, peter falk still holds up well and his presence still somewhat saves this movie. can you just imaging how this movie would had been without him? it would had been an extremely bad and ridicules cheap movie i can tell you.<br /><br />an odd columbo entry, which could be described as a failed experiment to divert from the usual formula.<br /><br />4/10
