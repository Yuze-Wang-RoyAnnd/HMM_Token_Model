i gave this movie a 2, and though i consider myself a science fiction fan, i found this movie very difficult to take seriously. it was on amc one late night, and i'm glad i saw it for free. this movie is probably good for a few laughs, but not much more.<br /><br />the special effects are about average for the time period - not awful, but not great, either. of course we know more about mars now than we did back then, but we really can't hold that against this film. the main reason i did not like this movie is because of the story.<br /><br />there were several parts of this movie that i wish would have been explored in a little more detail - the astronaut's injury/condition, the city on mars, the creature in the lake, etc. overall, the movie is much like a lengthy episode of the 1960s version of the outer limits - complete with a cheesy ending.
