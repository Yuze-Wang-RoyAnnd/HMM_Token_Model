wow! i remember so many awful films that loosely revolved around high school from the early 1980s. they usually had someincredibly strained plot and lots of 27 year old actors pretending to be students. as i watched this film i felt a little of the nostalgia of growing up in the 1980s. however, then i find out that this film was made in 1989? say what! well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, this is just bad. the plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools. which is odd, in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant. in fact, the main character lives in a mansion. makes you wonder how they cannot find money to keep this school alive, have they never heard of property taxes. oh, but here is the kicker. the school board says that they will keep the school alive, if the students can raise $200,000. so the seniors go about doing this. hmmm, you raise $200,000 but instead of saving that for college, you put it towards saving the high school that you are a senior in? and why exactly would they close an overpopulated school before the year is out? and...ahh forget it, this film was stupid and made in 1989!?
