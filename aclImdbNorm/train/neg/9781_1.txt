i don't think i'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie i've ever seen. i've been working on a list of my favorite war movies: "the longest day," "to hell and back," "bridge on the river kwai," (all black and white) which all have good plots, rich characters and great acting. i've seen better dialog and acting in student-written high school one act plays. the plot, however isn't a bad premise - just poorly implemented. it's kind of like a traffic accident, though, i couldn't seem to turn it off! a movie doesn't need big money or great sets i.e. "twelve angry men" and "lifeboat" to be good... so budget is no excuse. what were they thinking?
