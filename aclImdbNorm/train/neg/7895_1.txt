germans think smirking is funny (just like americans think mumbling is sexy and that women with english accents are acting). i had to cross my eyes whenever the screen was filled yet again with a giant close-up of a smirking face. one of those 'housewife hacks corporate mainframe' tales where she defrauds a bank by tapping a few random keys on her home pc which is connected only to a power socket. the director obviously loves the rather large leading lady. can't say i share his feelings. there's quite a funny bit when the entire family sit in front of the television chanting tonelessly along with the adverts. apparently this review needs to be one line longer so here it is.
