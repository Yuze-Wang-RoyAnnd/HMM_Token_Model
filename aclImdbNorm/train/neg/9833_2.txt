falsely accused, skirt-chasing chums john wayne (as john scott) and eddy chandler (as kansas charlie) change identities to become "alias smith and jones". mr. wayne becomes "john jones". mr. chandler's is supposed to be "rev. smith", but wayne calls him "dr. smith". at no time are either of them as entertaining as roger davis, pete duel, jonathan harris, or ben murphy; although, wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them, career wise. pretty blonde mary kornman (as anne), grown-up from her days in "our gang", is a lovely interest for wayne. she and chandler have a couple of cute scenes with wayne. if you're not a fan of low budget john wayne films of the 1930s, this movie won't make you one.
