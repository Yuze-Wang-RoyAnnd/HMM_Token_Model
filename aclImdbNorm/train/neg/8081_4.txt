one of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it starts to become satire, is that it be somewhat plausible. i would think that an anti-matter bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended. but i'll leave that to the physicists who might have seen solar crisis.<br /><br />it is a crisis the earth is facing because solar flares are getting totally out of hand. they're getting close to earth, so much so that it's become unseasonably hot, as if the entire earth were death valley. the answer is an anti-matter bomb which a space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there. that will divert the flares off in say the direction of say mercury providing it's not in direct alignment with the earth. <br /><br />who to deliver it, but captain tim matheson and his crew. that is if he can keep his mind on the business at hand and not on runaway son, corin nemec. taking care of the personal side of the family problems is admiral charlton heston, matheson's father, and nemec's grandfather.<br /><br />there's a villain here too, peter boyle who is the ceo of a multi-national corporation which in this crisis is trying to control the world's food supply for the survivors. the idea he might not survive doesn't enter into his thinking. he's doing his best to sabotage matheson's mission.<br /><br />solar crisis seems like a bad mix of 2001, a space odyssey and voyage to the bottom of the sea. boyle seems to be taking his cue from gene hackman as lex luthor in superman, apparently he's the only one in the cast who realizes he's in a turkey and overacts accordingly.<br /><br />the rest of the cast are stalwart, true blue and dull. except possibly desert rat jack palance who finds nemec and cares for him. <br /><br />the key here is that the film was directed by that noted hollywood purveyor of flop films, allen smithee. the film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was out in time for a thanksgiving carving.
