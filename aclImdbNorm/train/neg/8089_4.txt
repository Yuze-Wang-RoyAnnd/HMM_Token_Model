i don't know what it is about donald sutherland's acting style, or vocal style, but he always seems to be acting from behind a massive wad of soggy kleenex. he's just...i don't know, thick? somnambulistic? on meds? weird.<br /><br />that said, i just saw the flick again for the first time since its original release, and frankly, i don't remember it ending anything like that. a bad ending, too, because nothing gets tied off. what about the dead husband? the annoying child (and was the kid dubbed?)? the scotland yard and military pursuers? i would have liked something wrapping things up and giving some dramatic closure to it all, not just the big panoramic pull-away.<br /><br />and what woman sleeps with the man she knows just killed her husband? even if she was trying to allay needle's suspicions to protect her kid, she could always have had a headache. that last encounter made me feel way too itchy and uncomfortable...
