don't bother. a little prosciutto could go a long way, but all we get is pure ham, particularly from dunaway. the plot is one of those bumper car episodes... the vehicle bounces into another and everything changes direction again, until we are merely scratching our heads wondering if there were ever a plot. gina phillips is actually good, but it's hard playing across from a mystified dunaway playing lady macbeth lost in the marx's brother's duck soup. ah, the raven...now there's an actor. and there is the relative who just lies and bed and looks ghostly. or dr. dread who's filled with lots of gloom and no working remedies. i'm one of those suckers who just has to see a movie to the end. quoth the raven, "nevermore."
