... and yet, we were told, there was another hour and 20 minutes left to go.<br /><br />why, oh, why wasn't there an editor to tell the writer/director to snip, snip, snip? apparently that writer/director has previously done shorts; as a short, this would have been okay. but the lack of dialogue starts to grate after twenty minutes. the lack of much music glares. the background noises (talking, traffic, and especially a ubiquitous helicopter) get old really fast. but the worst failure is in story. there is precious little beyond a short.<br /><br />after an hour we saw variations of the same scene over and over again. i nearly screamed at the screen, "we get it, we get it!!!!!" it's amazing that after that left the theatre, we could drive home, watch the daily show and parts of the colbert report, get ready for bed,and know that the audience was still trapped in the theatre.<br /><br />it's not enough to indulge your vision. you have to give the audience enough to share your vision.
