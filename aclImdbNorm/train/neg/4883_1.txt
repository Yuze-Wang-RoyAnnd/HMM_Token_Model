during the cheap filmed in video beginning of crazy fat ethel ii, i wondered if it was the same film that was on the cover. unfortunately, it was. the story itself is mindlessly simple. ethel, a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder, is released into a halfway house because of hospital overcrowding. she is by far the most sane resident watching while one man puts dead flies into another's soup. ethel is then teased by one of the halfway house employees with a chocolate bar after he hits on the cost cutting measure of feeding the residents dog food. ethel retaliates by strangling him with a wire noose on the stairs and then....well, you get the idea. if this all sounds like fun, it isn't. this film was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting. the characters are so wooden when delivering their lines that they should be standing out in front of a cigar store. to make matters worse, half of the film consists of flashbacks to the first ethel movie, criminally insane, which is little better. a very poor effort.
