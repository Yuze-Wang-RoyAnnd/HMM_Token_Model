this was a nice attempt at something but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above it's low budget trappings. the use of virtual sets almost works but at some points it fails miserably. they made good use of the small budget i guess. i just wish the story and most of the acting was better. there are a lot of parts where you see what they were aiming for and it would of been great if they actually hit those marks but they don't. confusing and unbelievable story. bad dvd transfer too. it doesn't take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting. this i had to shut off. it was too boring. i can do slow movies. but just make them appealing in some aspect. visually, story-wise, acting, etc. this was lacking in all departments so it never added up to an engrossing experience. maybe the film maker's next attempt will be better.
