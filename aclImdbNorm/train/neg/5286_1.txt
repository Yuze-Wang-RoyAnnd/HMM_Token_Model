i am a huge jane austen fan and i ordered the movie from amazon.uk just so i could see it without waiting forever for it to come to the u.s. i really should have saved my money. what is with anne running after wentworth? the whole point of anne elliot's character is that she was quiet and refined. she is not impulsive and vulgar. and mary, was she suffering from a stroke or something? her speech wasn't normal, nor was her walking normal. there was no chemistry between the two main characters which made their whole "romance" completely unbelievable. in the final scene they even have sally hawkins wearing the same dress amanda root wore during the letter scene. the same clothes do not make it the same movie. in my opinion they didn't watch the 1995 version, which even though it had it's flaws, it did stay pretty close to the book. the book, i don't even think they read it. this is kind of like a cliff's notes movie of persuasion. hit on all the high points without explaining anything.
