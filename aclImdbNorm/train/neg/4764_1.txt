86 wasted minutes of my life. i fell asleep the first time i attempted watching it, and i must say i'm not one to ever fall asleep in the cinema.<br /><br />i have never seen such a pointless plot acted in such a stilted and forced manner, and can only surmise that the actors were as hard-up as the protagonist writer allegedly was in the film itself.<br /><br />everything in this dire adaptation is overacted. and if it isn't the wooden acting, almost as though you can see the teleprompter, then the set itself, which is overlit and interfering in utterly unnecessary ways, and overdressed to an unimaginable extent, is enough to put you off the entire farce.<br /><br />as to the supposed shock of a detective under disguise, any person who does not see that - as well as the entire rest of this ludicrous plot - telegraphed light years in advance, should check their eyesight immediately.<br /><br />bad acting, and from two very decent actors, coupled with the hyper-coddled branagh trademark overdirection, is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourself.<br /><br />on top of it all, there is a completely risible undertone of homoerotica in this, heightened towards the end of it. all i can hope for is that this was such a flop that people shan't try to emulate this level of cinema ever again.
