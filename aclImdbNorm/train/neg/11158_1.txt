what a horrible, horrible film. the worst collection of cliches i have seen in a long time. not that i saw much. i left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves. meryl streep was awful as usual. how many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have? aidan quinn's talents were - as so often - totally wasted. and who told gloria estefan she could act? trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes. (brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school). the kids weren't even cute! just written in to suit the appalling script. aaargh! wes craven really made me cringe for once. real horror this one!
