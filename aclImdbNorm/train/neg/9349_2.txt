this film was terrible. i have given it the high score of 2 as i have seen worse, but very few.<br /><br />from the clich'ed start of having the end of the film at the start and going back to the start at the end this film used everything in the box of tricks used in film making just for the sake of it, like a kid with too many toys. there was the endless, boring repetitive narration, slow motion, freeze frame, flashbacks and merged images etc - none of which made a dull film any better.<br /><br />it is called "16 years of alcohol", but there was little drinking or drunkeness and no depiction of withdrawal with the film jumping about all over the place with no coherent sense. the story was badly written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally poor and it is a shame that people have put up further money for more films by mr jobson, previously know for being in a rubbish group and on tv making as much sense as this film does.<br /><br />i found it a major struggle to see this to the end but in the hope of it getting better i carried on to the bitter but it really was a waste of time and i would have been better off not bothering.
