ooof! this one was a stinker. it does not fall 'somewhere in between star wars and thriller', thats for sure. in all actuality, it falls somewhere between the cracks of a wham! video and captain eo, only with not as big of a budget, and a lot more close ups of ugly teenagers crying. simon le bon preens front and center, while the rest of the band gamely tries to hide the fact that they stole their whole career from roxy music's last 3 albums. brief clips from barbarella add nothing. avoid at all costs. (however, i liked the part when they played 'hungry like the wolf' but why was there a tiger lurking in the audience changing into a woman painted with tiger stripes? i mean, they aren't singing 'eye of the tiger' or 'hungry like the tiger' it's a wolf! whatever.) a dvd of duran duran's '80s videos is probably worth a look for nostalgia's sake
