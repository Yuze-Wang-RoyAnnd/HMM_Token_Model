my favorite part was when the credits started to roll. i wish i could give it a .0000000000001 out of 10. i really wish i had that hour and thirty minutes back. don't waste your money or time on it. i really could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards.<br /><br />nadia was really pretty and i hope the movie didn't destroy her career. but she chose to be in it.<br /><br />all in all it sucked more than any other movie has sucked. more than kazaam and glitter combined. that's saying something.<br /><br />don't<br /><br />do<br /><br />it!!!!
