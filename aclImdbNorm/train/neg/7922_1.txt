in a far away galaxy is a planet called ceta. it's native people worship cats. but the dog people wage war upon these feline loving people and they have no choice but to go to earth and grind people up for food. this is one of the stupidest f#@k!ng ideas for a movie i've seen. leave it to ted mikels to make a movie more incompetent than the already low standard he set in previous films. it's like he enjoying playing in a celluloid game of limbo. how low can he go? the only losers in the scenario are us the viewer. mr. mikels and his silly little handlebar mustache actually has people who still buy this crap.<br /><br />my grade: f <br /><br />dvd extras: commentary by ted mikels; the story behind the making of (9 and a half minutes); 17 minutes, 15 seconds of behind the scenes footage; ted mikels filmography; and trailers for "the worm eaters" "girl in gold boots", "the doll squad", "ten violent women" (featuring nudity), "blood orgy of the she devils", & "the corpse grinders"
