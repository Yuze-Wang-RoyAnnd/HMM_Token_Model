this was quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen. i watched it with a large group of friends and after it was over not a one of us understood the plot. aside from the lack of plot, the acting was atrocious, the "special effects" were not so special, and the writing was absolutely horrible. the movie's only redeeming factor is that it's so incredibly bad that it's quite funny. you can't help but laugh at a zombie being run over while actors are spewing crappy dialogue. i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie, but it's something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about. it's now a running joke among my friends and i. 1 out of 10.
