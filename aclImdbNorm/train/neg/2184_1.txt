this movie is a loose collection of unintelligible analogies and ill conceived plot devices.<br /><br />movie history: the director of this film was a pervert who drove around town filming random women. when his wife discovered the film reels, he was forced to quickly contrive a story. he claimed he was making a movie called "the brain that wouldn't die." eventually, his wife demanded that he show her his "so called movie." that night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and "the brain that wouldn't die" was born.<br /><br />i hate this movie! plot synopsis: the main character's fianc'e is killed in a horrible car accident(that he caused by ignoring the clearly posted road signs). he grabs her head from the wreckage and reanimates it. after reanimating the head, he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers. that is pretty much what happens for the rest of the movie. at the end, he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet. the monster appears with little to no explanation. however, the monster saves a hooker and i assume that they live happily ever after.<br /><br />side notes: the end credit screen claims that the movie is called "the head that wouldn't die".<br /><br />i hate this movie!
