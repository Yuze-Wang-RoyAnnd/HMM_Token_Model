national lampoon's class reunion was a flop when it was released. it didn't stay long in theaters in my big city. why? because it's bad!!!!!<br /><br />not bad in a good way but bad in a really painfully unfunny way. the entire cast of actors were mostly unknowns then and have remained unknowns after this turkey.<br /><br />the idea is actually great (a parody of slasher flicks) but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect. <br /><br />just avoid this "comedy". your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond watching this embarrassing misfire.
