a truly unpleasant film. while rick baker's special effects are quite impressive (if stomach-turning), it has no other redeeming features. like many 70s movies, it leaves you feeling as if you need to take a long shower, and scrub the slime off of yourself. the characters are uniformly unpleasant, and plot makes no sense.
