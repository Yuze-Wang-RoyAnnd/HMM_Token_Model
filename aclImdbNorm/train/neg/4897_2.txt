this film comes as the ultimate disappointment in tsai ming-liang for me. it oozes laziness from its every frame. so i'm not going to analyse it thoroughly either. but some observations:<br /><br />1. if the premise is drought, why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees? i wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film (in which thirst notifies the craving for intimacy, and watermelon the trivial substitute, sex). or it is only a matter of lousy film-making, not giving a damn about being coherent.<br /><br />2. we don't get to know what had happened to the porn actress, why she is unconscious or, presumably, dead. it seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully (=bombastically) delivered, but in retrospect, her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick, a pretext
