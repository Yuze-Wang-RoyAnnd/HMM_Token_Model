unless you are an evangelical christian then make like an egyptian and avoid like the biblical plague.<br /><br />awful - why oh why does imdb list the most favourable reviews at the top of the list - it was due to one of these that i have just wasted the end of what started out as good evening on this claptrap.<br /><br />the plot premise started out strong enough - i was drawn into the film and was interested right up to the point where the bible sermons took over. what a waste.<br /><br />this film has so incensed me that i have registered with imdb for the first time just to complain about it - i hope at least that by doing so i save someone else's evening.<br /><br />hay - what a christian act on my part ;-)
