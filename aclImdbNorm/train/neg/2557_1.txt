i actually like asylum movies. i've made it a habit to see as many as possible. even the rip-offs they've done have been cool like exorcism and when a killer calls. this is just plain lame. i can't believe that the same people who made dead men walking and dracula's curse actually made this movie too!!! it's not even laughably bad like jolly roger or alien abduction (which, by the way are pretty bad). this is just bad! i mean, i can appreciate and/or forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an asylum movie, but this film takes itself way too seriously. i really hope that snakes on a train is better. now that's a movie i can't wait to see.
