the acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay. it was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes. the ending was even worse. everyone kept dying, but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly ok! they did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had, etc. the movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline. the only reason i give this 3/10 is that i kind of feel bad for the young actors. they needed better coaching. they could have really made this an ok film, but the screenplay and acting failed miserably.
