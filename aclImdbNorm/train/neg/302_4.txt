i really wanted to like this movie. i absolutely love kenny hotz, and spenny rice has a charming side to him. not that i like spenny at all. spenny ruins this movie. he should of let kenny and his hot girlfriend pitch the movie.<br /><br />anyways, it's pretty boring aside from a scene with roger ebert in it. there really isn't too many celebrities in this movie, and most don't seem to say more than one line. overall this movie was disappointing. i would only suggest watching it if you got it with the season 1 dvd of kenny vs spenny (it comes for free on the 3rd disc). regardless of this production, i am still very excited to check out the papel chase.
