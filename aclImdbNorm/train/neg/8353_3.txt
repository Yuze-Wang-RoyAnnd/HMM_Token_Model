beaudray demerille(a weak peter fonda, who also directed), an aging gambler, wins young teen wanda "nevada"(pretty, but not talented brooke shields) in a poker game. together the unlikely pair(of course)embark on a search for indian gold in the grand canyon.<br /><br />that's the story and there really is no need to search for a deeper meaning in it. it just isn't there. the acting is very weak too, which was quite a surprise given the fact that peter fonda was in the lead.<br /><br />if you're looking for something interesting in this film, take a look at the nice scenery and some good looks of a young brooke shields. her character however is so irritating(especially at the beginning)and dumb, that she never quite comes off as sexy or appealing. too bad, but, given the story, i doubt anything more could be made of this. i wonder why peter fonda directed and starred in this film. he must have even talked his father(henry fonda)into a (useless) cameo in this ridiculous mess. unfortunately, this was their only film together. couldn't henry be in easy rider for example? 3/10
