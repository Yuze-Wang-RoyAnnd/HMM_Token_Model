the movie uses a cutting edge title for a lame story. kill kill, would have been nice. the movie incorporates taboo scenes to make the viewer move back in their chairs. the scenes are unnecessary and choppy. the movie is something a novice screen writer could have conjured. just a waste of movie props and network money. i have to write 10 lines of text to critique this film when it is not worth 10 lines of my time, but i have to push on to let the people know to avoid the nonsense. if people are counting on you to choose a good movie for movie night, pick something else. if you have a soul don't damage it by subjecting yourself to this filth.
