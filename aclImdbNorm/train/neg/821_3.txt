stanley kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things: action and thrills. the domino principle features gene hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task. richard widmark, edward albert, and eli wallach are his operatives --- they presumably work for the government, but that, like most of the movie's plot line, is never made clear. hackman asks a lot of questions that never get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere. while it strives to be like night moves and the parallax view, the domino principle mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. the film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it. kramer's direction is devoid of any style. it's a very sunny movie!<br /><br />the acting is fine with hackman proving he's pretty much incapable of being bad. widmark and wallach are suitably nasty and albert is well cast as widmark's cruel lackey. even the usually obnoxious mickey rooney is pretty good as hackman's sidekick. one oddity however is the casting of candice bergen as hackman's wife. we're told she's done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang. kramer's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig. it's a role better suited for the likes of valerie perrine or susan tyrell.
