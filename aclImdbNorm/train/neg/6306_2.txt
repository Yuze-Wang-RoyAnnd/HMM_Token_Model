working at a video store i get to see quite a few movies and on occasion i try to watch some of the not so big movies. proud happened to be one of them. the initial idea of telling of the story of a primarily black crewed ship during wwii had some merit. however in less than 10 minutes of watching the movie you find out that the primary point of the movie was to tell about racial tension in wwii. the underlying story is about the ship, the crew and their exploits in the war. this primary point is hammered at you to the point of excessiveness all throughout the movie. i commend the men that served on the uss mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and for the hardships that they endured. a movie should have been made focusing on the accomplishments these men did for themselves, the navy and for their country and not making a movie whose focus is racism during wwii.
