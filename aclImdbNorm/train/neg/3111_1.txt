i would have rated this film a minus 10 but sadly it is not offered.<br /><br />why i didn't walk out in the first five minutes of this movie i cannot say. i should have gone with my instinct and left immediately!! several people in our theater did and sadly i didn't follow them out.<br /><br />the story lacked all criteria for a movie. no plot. awful acting! even robin williams was so disappointing that i may never see another film he is in. not a single relationship in the story went beyond parlor talk. i did like the tazer scene. too bad it didn't shock some meat into the senselessness of the plot. someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this film!
