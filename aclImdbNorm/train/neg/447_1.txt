well, what can you say about sitcoms. there often quite lame, morale dedicative, and just plain. so is this show! it got a boring cast, although a.bynes is okej in her perky way, the rest is just stereotypical crap....as always. we have all seen it before, and will probably see it all over again when this show is cancelled. cause, lets face it, its a mediocre and self righteous show. as the most sitcoms are....<br /><br />well, in short. if you wanna see some good entertainment, you can rather take a twenty minute pause in front of the mirror. do some faces and move on.... its more entertaining than this show!
