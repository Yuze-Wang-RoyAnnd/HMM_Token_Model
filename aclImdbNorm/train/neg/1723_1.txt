man, what a scam this turned out to be! not because it wasn't any good (as i wasn't really expecting anything from it) but because i was misled by the dvd sleeve which ignorantly paraded its "stars" as being stuart whitman, stella stevens and tony bill. sure enough, their names did not appear in the film's opening credits, much less themselves in the rest of it!! as it turned out, the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure las vegas lady (1975)
