wow! this film is truly awful. i can't imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight. the cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast. the story is disjointed, fragmented and incoherent. the telling, leaden and predictable. no wit, no charm, no humour. not sexy in the least. the characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake. there's also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on. when your lead (carrell) is unfunny and unappealing it's uphill from there. despite it's phony turn-around ending where love triumphs over lust i was left with a sick feeling in my stomach. if this is what passes for humour and social comment then we're definitely doomed.
