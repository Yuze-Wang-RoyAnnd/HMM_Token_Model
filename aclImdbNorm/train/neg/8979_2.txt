it was jon pertwee who said " it`s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly " . well if that`s the case pasty faces is " very easy " . david baker ( as director /screenwriter ) and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior britcoms like lock stock.. and trainspotting , using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loudly . alan mccaffrey especially suffers from this type of ott performance but not enough to ruin the film because there`s not enough of a film to ruin .<br /><br />pasty faces is terrible on all fronts especially scriptwise . i couldn`t understand why it ended the way it did , it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner . oh and other glaring errors are that you need a visa to visit the usa and a green card in order to work there - this film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in america without any authorisation - that you still get paid to donate blood in america - people who i know in america , and who donate blood tell me payment for donations stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop . as far as i know gun laws in america differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter . so we`ve got a very erroneous view of america from a very unreal and oh so unfunny film . maybe this is revenge for braveheart a very hollywood view of the scots ? perhaps , but this doesn`t stop pasty faces from being a crap comedy
