this film was not nearly as much of a chore as i expected it to be. there are a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore ufo conspiracy paranoia-fest. most of the acting is mediocre, but fairly typical for 1970s-style stuff replete with pregnant pauses. a photographer and a model witness some strange goings-on in the woods and soon fall victim to these same goings-on. flying saucers are spotted, more people disappear - but is it the aliens or our own government's ultra-secret group of cover-up guys? soon enough, a reporter and a "ufologist" (apparently modeled on the character of the writer-director) are drawn into this unraveling fiasco and become the target of the ultra-secret agents who are as menacing as they are improbable and witless. then the fun really begins.<br /><br />the movie, predictably, makes about as much sense as the average ufo conspiracy theory, but should be commended for taking itself so seriously. the camera work is ok for a low-budget film, the pacing is pretty good, the script is silly and absurd, and there are continuity issues which are fun to look out for. what are the few seconds of brilliance i mentioned? honestly, i can't say much you without writing a spoiler. suffice to say that the end of the film is, at least, worth fast-forwarding to if you can't take the middle.
