when i say " doctor who " you might conjure up an image of tom baker , or jon pertwee or maybe peter davison . when i say " james bond " you`ll almost certainly conjure up an image of sean connery while a small handful of people may think of roger moore or pierce brosnan . but when i say " sgt bilko " absolutely everyone will think of phil silvers . unlike doctor who or james bond the role belongs exclusively to one actor . and that`s the problem with this film version you`ll continually wish you were watching the old black and white show . in fact the whole idea of making a film version of bilko without silvers in the title role comes close to sacrilage
