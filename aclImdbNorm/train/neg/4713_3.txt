as you can guess by my rating and my title of this review that i don't like johnny test. now i think i know what people are going to say, " how do you know how bad it is? have you ever watched it?", i did watch this show a couple times because i am studying film and animation and this just doesn't hold a candle to my standards.<br /><br />i want to first talk about the animation because it is one of the most confusing things i have ever seen. like the first two seasons or only first season had hand drawn animation. i thought it was a nice show to look at when it was hand drawn but then it switched to flash animation and the quality went down by a huge amount.<br /><br />so that is one strike in my eyes but lets look at the story of the show. it tries way too hard to be like dexter's lab but there are differences because instead of one red headed scientist there is two and they are both female. there is a talking dog(why?), and the parents attitudes are switched somewhat. i have others but i don't think i can write them here ( i don't mean cursing but i mean i don't know if there is a limit for words.). everything else though is spot on, even a deedee character johnny himself. it just tries so hard to be dexter but it just seems to me like a heartless knockoff.<br /><br />lastly i want to talk about the jokes. remember in dexters lab some of the jokes involved yelling? yes, yelling can be good for a joke or two but dexter's lab also had sly remarks that made me have to go back and check to get the joke. johnny test just forgets all that and just yells 50% of the time and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or one liner appears. that isn't comedy, thats stupid comedy (i know what some people are thinking. isn't three stooges stupid comedy? watch that and johnny test back to back and you laugh more at the first option.). sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations which, like chowder, makes me mad. i have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together: to much bizarre doesn't equal comedy, it makes you just think "what am i watching?".<br /><br />so it strikes out on all accounts. don't watch this show if you have any respect for comedy in anyway, shape, or form.
