my husband and i bought the old school sesame street dvd's for our daughter and i have to say, i don't let her watch the new episodes on tv, because i find all of the characters annoying. baby bear and telly? omgosh, how annoying and useless blabber can someone think of for their 'skits'? elmo? give it a rest not every kid likes him, once again, annoying and doesn't teach my child anything. mr. noodle? what a reject. i think the one time i turned the 'new' show on for her, she and i were left dumber than before. the show has definitely taken a wrong turn. i remember the yip yips, kermit's breaking news, 1-2 2 little dolls, mumford the magician, bert and ernie, grover the waiter, all the great educational skits of old school s.s. sesame street has suffered a direct hit of boredom and dumbness since jim henson's passing in 1990. the show no longer has the educational, funny and interactive skits it used to. i find the new versions simply unbearably annoying and full of useless non-educational blabber. way to go s.s. producers/writers you have yet another cartoony show for the parents to sit there non-creative, non-exercised kids in front of so they'll get out of their hair. per producers/writers : i suggest you whip out the old muppets and start taping similar content to that of the first sesame street's. lord knows i sure don't want my child talking like baby bear or elmo.
