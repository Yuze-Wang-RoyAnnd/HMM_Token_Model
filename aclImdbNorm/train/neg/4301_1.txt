i was staying in one night and got extremely bored around 2:00 a.m. so i flipped aimlessly through the channels and happened upon h.b.o. where this "classic" was playing. initially i was happy to have caught something at the beginning, but my happiness faded about two minutes into the movie. the whole movie centered around an unattractive man who had a fear of females, four beautiful but empty minded women who worked as waitresses at his uncle's diner, and his enormously fat and extremely miserable cousin who also works at the diner. there are a few strange twists in this movie that make it somewhat interesting, but certainly not worth watching. basically, if you have nothing to do some night or just can't sleep medication works much better. however guys there is a lot of skin so it may be okay to watch with no sound, but even that can get annoying
