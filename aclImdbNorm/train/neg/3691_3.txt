i am not a big fan of rajnikant in the first place, but baba was a huge disappointment. in between an awful storyline, the action and songs were only mediocre. the storyline becomes very preachy. instead of running for office like ntr or mgr, rajni almost appeared to be running as tamil nadu's next big guru. my wife tells me that since this film came out, rajni swore off doing any more movies!<br /><br />we were lucky initially to have bought babu (an oldie by sivajiganeshan) online by accident when trying to buy this one....that was a great film, which made up for having bought this dud...except it makes baba look even worse by comparison!<br /><br />bryan
