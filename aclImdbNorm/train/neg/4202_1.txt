...am i missing something here??? "unexpected plot developments"? "plot twisting with subversive glee"? are these viewers watching the same arquette vehicle to which i just subjected myself (in an now-obvious sub(un)conscious bout of sadomasochism)...i just joined this site simply to make sure that no one else ever rents this stinker...this movie was an embarrassment to every single person involved...quick question: did sir stevie read the script before he gave the thumbs-up to kate c.? if so, then it must be the same spielberg who greenlighted "howard the duck"...don't give me that, "it was a hit play" crap--i'm guessing mssr. reddin ain't too pleased ...the dvd cover promised "surprising corners" and a "twisted story..." story!!story?? it's crap like this that make old bobby mckee and his wandering band of structuralists sound like geniuses...sundance??berlin??toronto?? i have a home video of my cat farting that evokes more interest than arquette's negatively-dimensional portrayal of anguished loss...and, talk about deux ex machina for mr. stanley t.; thank god, just in the nick o time he thought to have dave call the cops! and thank shiva that the cops had just caught the true killer...what!!! up until the credits i was still waiting for it to be some kind of grift against arquette and his "hidden millions"...no, mrs. spielberg, you don't escape unscathed: what the hell was that kitchen scene with the "athlete's foot in my crotch" gag??? are you worse in this or "just cause"?? i dunno...hey film lovers: why don't you make it a blockbuster night and rent this along with "jersey girl" and "white chicks" and then commit sepukka (or is it seppuka)...and take e. dunsky with you....
