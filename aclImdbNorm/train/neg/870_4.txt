towards the end of this thriller ally sheedy's gaunt latter-day image is used creatively to make up more than one hauntingly evil image. she convinces one that, if a nasty bette davis-type role were to come her way, she could carry it off brilliantly. unfortunately, i can't find many other reasons for seeing this. if you've wondered what sheedy looks like in a pair of old-fashioned glasses (but why should anyone?) then here's your answer. for the rest, sally kirkland's sex-starved crazy woman is really tiresome, and even if you like this sort of thing more than i do you'll have to admit that the tension sags badly during these scenes. savage's drunken brute of an insurance agent is equally distasteful but at least it's a small role. of the leading actors, nicholas walker inspires no sympathy at all for paul keller's plight and his acting is wooden. dara tomanovich is better and during her scenes with sheedy the level rises a little. sheedy's meticulous, understated performance (though she often seems to be on automatic pilot) is admirable in itself but out of context with the rest. the sets are drab, the camera-work undistinguished.
