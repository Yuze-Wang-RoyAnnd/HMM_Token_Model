this movie had a imdb rating of 8.1 so i expected much more from it. it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous. but before the movie is half-way through, it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable. the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie, but we get to know them a little too well; they become caricatures, not real people at all. this is the same story i've seen hundreds of times, only told here with slightly different circumstances. the thing is, i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so stale!<br /><br />the only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations, and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office. hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon.
