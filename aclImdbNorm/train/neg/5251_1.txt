this self proclaimed "very talented artist" have directed easily the worst spanish film of the 21st century. lack of emotion, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor... it repeats the same situation over and over again. it shows no character development. it does not even show any violent and/or sexual content, and it does not add anything new to the psycho-killer sub genre. so lame it should be shown at film schools as an example of "what not to do" in a first movie.<br /><br />btw where the hell is the "talent"? there are scenes which have been shot almost identically; there are scenes which have two or more master shots and it is quite awful to see the action jumping from one master shot to another without a reason. the camera almost never moves, as if the "very talented artist" was afraid of showing his lack of visual skills. the actors playing the main roles act like amateurs, and the supporting cast is hardly believable. there are more holes than plot in the script (if ever there was one)...<br /><br />a really disheartening movie, and a whatsoever talented director.
