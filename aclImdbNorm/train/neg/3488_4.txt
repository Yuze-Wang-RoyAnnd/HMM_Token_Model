question: how does a bourgeois director treat a subject like immigration ? answer: by turning it into an existential alienation parable.<br /><br />yes, we're back in the early 90s, just after the disintegration of the eastern block and the subsequent flooding of immigrants in the european union, and what better way to deal with the subject than making a film about an existentially alienated middle-class journalist, an existentially alienated upper-class politician, his existentially alienated rich wife, and so on.<br /><br />in the background, immigrants are asking for political asylum in an unnamed greek village near the borders. i guess that way angelopoulos can show some social awareness, while dealing with the existentially troubled upper-classes. i mean honestly, the scene where some top-ranking army-officer curses his destiny cause he sent his daughter to study in london is enough to make you puke.<br /><br />anyway, it can't be that bad, angelopoulos is a master of the cinematic art after all, right ? wrong. it's at this point when his mannerisms start getting too artificial, sort of like a filtered image in photoshop. his usual tricks show up: there are blurred windows, blurred lights, a weird wedding, a walk by the river-shore, and people with yellow water-coats. also mastroianni breaks new ground for most sleepwalking performance ever. avoid really. go for his early films.
