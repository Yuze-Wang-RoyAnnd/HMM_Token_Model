i saw not so fabulous rating on imdb, but i went to see it anyway, because i am a big fan of bible related material. first thing that bothered me was a little too much indiana jones wannabe movie, but it also looked like casper van dien didn't see those jones movies through (but he should). i believe he tried his best, but script just stunk. music tried to be kinda jones style too. great work, but for such movie it seemed like too much work, like the video part did't deserve all that great music. robert wagner gave his best acting skills, he did a good job, but somehow the script was bringing everything down. "jokes" are old school, somewhere 20 years old; they brought only cynic smile to my face. there are some really bad camera angels, sfx looks like homemade and unrealistic. kevin vanhook had probably a good idea on the story (in my opinion, but i love such stories), but things just didn't work out in the end. maybe he should put it on a paper when it was still fresh in his head. when i (in first minutes) saw that movie was going to be one of those 'low budget movies', i hoped that i will at least 'hear' a good story, but sometimes movies just disappoint.
