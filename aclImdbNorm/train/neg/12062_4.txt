when great director/actor combinations are talked about the team of j. lee thompson and charles bronson is not usually mentioned. probably because the output of nine joint ventures between the two of them runs the gamut from the really good action entertainment to the mediocre. unfortunately kinjite: forbidden subjects falls in the latter. <br /><br />that's sad because kinjite could have been a whole lot better. but for the life of me i don't understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing japanese girl, a guy used to getting some cheap jollies because the romance in his marriage has run out. that might have been good for another film altogether, but it served no purpose here.<br /><br />a straightforward cop drama with charles bronson as a vice cop who's seen a bit too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against orientals. that part could also have used a little explaining as well. but he's going to have to overcome it if he and patient partner perry lopez are going to locate a captured japanese school girl.<br /><br />bronson's time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. a stylish, murderous pimp played by jaime fernandez is the guy and he and bronson have some history. in fact in the film's best scene, bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and set his car on fire.<br /><br />at one point fernandez happens to spot bronson and lopez in an all night delicatessen and this being after his rolex snack, he sprays the place with an uzi killing everyone, but bronson and lopez. i really think that little incident would have had more than a couple vice cops from the lapd after fernandez. but that's another terribly big hole in the plot.<br /><br />still there is a very rough justice in the end for fernandez. i wish the whole film had been better though. this was the last film of the bronson-thompson team and j. lee thompson's last as a director. he should have gone out with something better.
