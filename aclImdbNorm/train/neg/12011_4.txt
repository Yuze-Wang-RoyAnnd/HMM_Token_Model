john pressman (micheal 'i shoulda called ditech' lerner) works at a doctor's office as an orderly. his mother (zelda 'poltergeist' rubenstein) hypnotizes him to off the people who see thinks wronged him. but this turns out to be a movie within a movie, but the lines soon blur as john goes a movie theater to kill. prompting a guy who's watching the movie to do the same. lerner is suitably over the top in this, but zelda repeats lines of dialog over and over again. that gets annoying fast. but not as annoying as the two girls who are watching the movie within a movie.as a horror film this one fails, it's too busy trying to be clever, trying to impart a message and seems to forget a slasher film must evoke a sense of tension, or at least a jump or two. no, what we have here is the worst kind of slasher: an art-house one.<br /><br />my grade: d+
