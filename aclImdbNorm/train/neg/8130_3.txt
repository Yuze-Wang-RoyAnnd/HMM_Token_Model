while exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor is bitten by a bat which causes some alarming side effects...<br /><br />occasionally creepy atmosphere and some decent (though under used) makeup effects don't save this b horror flick from being a sub-par tale of man-becomes-creature. the bat people aka it lives by night suffers from its senseless story that's awkwardly plotted and lackluster in pacing. the plot never seems to go anywhere much and the movie never offers an explanation for what happens, or even a satisfying conclusion for it all. the cast is fairly mediocre in their performances.<br /><br />still i give the film some points for its haunting theme song and nice filming locations. the makeup work of the late stan winston is pretty good too, but it doesn't get much of a showcase here. a missed opportunity for sure. <br /><br />definitely one of the lesser man-creature flicks out there.<br /><br />* 1/2 out of ****
