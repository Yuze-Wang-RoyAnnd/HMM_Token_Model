i want to state first that i am a christian (and that i do work in the film and tv industry) so i understand what it is like to work on a feature length film so props to the filmmakers in that regard. i'm all for positive, uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life (that this is a fallen world and that things don't always work out ... even for followers of christ). i'm glad that others are having such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the overt christian message; for me it was just that the execution is where the film fell on its face. a movie lives and dies on its story and here you have one dimensional stereotypes, exposition aplenty, and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicably to say the least. i believe that a film does not have to club you over the head with its message to get the point across. i'm sure the kendrick bros. will improve with time and that their storytelling methods will as well. maybe they could direct someone else's screenplay as their next project.<br /><br />* sports films are not exactly my first love but a good one (hoosiers, field of dreams, etc) can inspire in a multitude of ways. if you would be interested in a pg-rated film that inspires, give steven soderbergh's 'king of the hill' a look. all truth is god's truth ...
