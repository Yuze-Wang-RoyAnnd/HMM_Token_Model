need i say--its a stinker! (i gave it a rating of 2)<br /><br />only watch it if you suffer from insomnia.<br /><br />there's plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up, but not much else happens in this movie. there is no suspense, no deep, shocking secrets revealed, no real threat to the heroine's well being. a few disagreements, slight raising of voices--that's pretty much it. the secrets are nothing that couldn't happen to anybody - the last "secret" revealed in the film is totally predictable by that point.<br /><br />the plot, such as it is, revolves around a young woman named faith (meg tilly), who is an artist, who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very, very wealthy, older widowed woman, and a growing mother/daughter type relationship that the older woman craves with her.<br /><br />it turns out the older woman's daughter, cassandra, is dead. you can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces together.<br /><br />even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two. why he's still hanging around years after cassandra's death is a good question.<br /><br />there's also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant, a faithful butler who seems to do everything--cooking, cleaning, serving the meal, answering the door, etc. everything except apparently locking the door--since that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where faith is.<br /><br />there's nothing that will have you grasping your chair arms, and leaning forward on the edge of your seat, because there is no "mounting" tension in this film--just bland, pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to time.<br /><br />
