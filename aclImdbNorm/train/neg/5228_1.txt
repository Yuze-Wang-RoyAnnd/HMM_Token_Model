i saw this movie the other night. i can't even begin to express how much this movie sucked. the writing, the voice acting, even the claymation. terrible, terrible, terrible. it's like watching 24 hours of c-span for the sake of comedy. it just doesn't work. it literally falls flat at about every spot possible.<br /><br />also, the movie's animation is very poor quality. i know that this is an movie made by one person, but to think that he could make 97 minutes worth of crap, maybe he could at least make 1 second worth of funny.<br /><br />this show may take the cake for being the worst film of all time. yikes. it really was that bad. if you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh, steer clear from this abomination. my advice: don't even buy it, or look it up for that matter. your brain will than you.
