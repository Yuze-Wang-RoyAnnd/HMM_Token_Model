perhaps because i was so young, innocent and brainwashed when i saw it, this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me. i haven't seen it since i was in seventh grade at a presbyterian school, so i am not sure what effect it would have on me now. however, i will say that it left an impression on me... and most of my friends. it did serve its purpose, at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions. i was particularly terrified of what the newly-converted post-rapture christians had to endure when not receiving the mark of the beast. i don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it so i will not mention details of the scenes, but i can still picture them in my head... and it's been 19 years.
