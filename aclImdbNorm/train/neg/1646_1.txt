i like movies about morally corrupt characters, but this was too much. the acting wasn't great, but that wasn't the real problem. the issue was the sinking feeling i got in the pit of my stomach about 20 minutes into the film. these characters were hollow. they had almost no depth, and what little they did have was devoted to the cruelty they displayed to each other in the guise of friendship. exploring the darker sides of a set of characters can be fascinating, but you have to give those characters actual personalities or they are just cardboard cutouts. these characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly.
