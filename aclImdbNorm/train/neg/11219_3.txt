this was a movie about infidelity and revenge. a twin with the "twin" connection senses that something is wrong with her sister. this movie took forever to establish the plot. a plot that has been done many times. the acting was lousy for the most part. once the plot comes together, the movie ends. laura and ashley are twins that live with an abusive father. the father seems to favor ashley, so laura gets the blame for everything. there is a promise made that the girls would never be apart, but as they grow up, their lives go in different directions. ashley gets a job in a diner where she meets barry, a married man. of course no good can come of this. the fact that barry had tinnitus was a poor excuse for a way to track him down. i kept waiting for this movie to get better and for there to be some resolution somewhere, but it never happened.
