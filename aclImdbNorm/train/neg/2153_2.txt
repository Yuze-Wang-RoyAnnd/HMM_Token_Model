the 3-d featured in "the man who wasn't there" stands for dumb, dumb, dumb! this inept comedy features lousy 3-d effects that makes the 3-d effects in "jaws 3", "amityville 3", and "friday the 13th part 3" look better by comparison. not to mention the movie is asinine to the extreme. this was one of many 1983 movies to feature the pop-off-the-screen effects. steve guttenberg and jeffrey tambor got trapped in this mess, but at least it didn't kill their careers. tambor would go on to star on hbo's "the larry sanders show" and ron howard's box office smash "how the grinch stole christmas", while guttenberg followed this flop with "police academy" and "cocoon". what them in those projects instead of them here in "the man who wasn't there". if you do, you'll regret it.<br /><br />1/2* (out of four)
