from the mind of harry alan towers comes another piece of cinematic sludge. supposedly based on the work of h. rider haggard, the only similarity it bears to anything haggard actually wrote is that it takes place in africa (albeit an africa that has dinosaurs - which our intrepid adventurers use to pull their canoes!), and has some characters with the same names.<br /><br />our heroes (david mccallum, patrick mcnee and john colico) set out to seek treasure, armed only with a medallion, and end up precisely where the treasure is, purely by chance. on the way, they meet a motley assortment of extremely lame monsters, pick up a french chef, and mccallum has an affair with the queen of phoenicia.<br /><br />it's so ridiculous, it's a hoot. that's the only reason i didn't give it a 1.
