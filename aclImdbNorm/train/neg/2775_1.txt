this was the worst acted movie i've ever seen in my life. no, really. i'm not kidding. all the "based on a true story/historical references" aside, there's no excuse for such bad acting. it's a shame, because, as others have posted, the sets & costumes were great.<br /><br />the sound track was typical "asian-style" music, although i couldn't figure out where the "modern" love song came in when fernando was lying in his bed thinking of maria. i don't know who wrote & sang that beautiful song, but it was as if suddenly norah jones was transported to the 1500s.<br /><br />the hershey syrup blood in phycho was more realistic than the ketchup spurted during the kwik-n-ez battle scenes.<br /><br />but the acting. oh, so painfully sad. lines delivered like a bad junior high play. if gary stretch had donned a potato costume for the county 4h fair he may have been more believable. towards the end he sounded more like a little italy street thug. at times i half expected him to yell out "adrian!" or even "you wanna piece of me?!".<br /><br />favourite line: when the queen says to her lover (after barfing on the floor) "i'm going to have a baby." he responds "a child?" i expected her to retort "no, jackass, a chair leg! duh."
