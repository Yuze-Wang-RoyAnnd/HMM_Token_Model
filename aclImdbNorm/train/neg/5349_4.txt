this straight-to-video duffer is another nail in the coffin of rick moranis's career. as is the disney tradition, quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick cash-in; this is a lazy retread with moranis accidentally shrinking himself and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie. instantly dated visual effects and crummy dialogue abound in this cheesy lamer, which did nothing but make me pine for the days of 'the incredible shrinking man', when this kind of thing was done properly. shockingly, this is directed by top cinematographer dean cundey, who should either stick to the day job or pick better material next time.
