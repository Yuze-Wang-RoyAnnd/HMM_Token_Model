payback is the game being played in this drama and the revenge plot is undone by the absurd story line that sets the stage for the fireworks that come later. why would a man become involved with the trophy wife of a ruthless mob boss in the gangster's own mansion with suspicious henchmen all around? why would an unhappy wife encourage the attentions of a complete stranger and expect him to carry her away with him and leave her husband and boredom behind to live happily ever after with her new love? surely the hero, here kevin costner, must have expected a reaction from the cuckold husband that gives the movie an excuse to indulge in senseless gore and violence. anthony quinn, great actor that he was, surely deserved better, and madeleine stowe is the tragic figure who suffers greatly as she latches on to her prince charming. stowe is okay but her spanish accent doesn't work. the cameos of the lesser players are good, especially miguel ferrer and john leguizamo and sally kirkland is interesting as a fading rock star.
