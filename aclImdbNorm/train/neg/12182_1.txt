well where do i start? i think it's very insulting to the original annie with aileen quimnn. i love the film annie, and i was expecting this to be a brilliant film, but i was so disappointed! the acting is awful, the original annie came out a few years before i was born, i'm now 25 and annie is still one of my favourite films, so i was really excited to see annie 2. the acting was awful in the film, were any of the characters original? very badly written, directed and acted. this is not a film i wish to see again, and any annie lover i recommend that you don't watch this film because it will only leave you very disappointed. the young girls singing isn't bad but still doesn't compare to the original
