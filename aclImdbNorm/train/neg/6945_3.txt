thomas archer (ron eldard) has his child killed and his wife viciously attacked in a home invasion. dr. heller (christopher plummer) tries to help him through the post traumatic stress. then archer finds himself confronted with a man (til schweiger) bound and gagged to a chair. he is told this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes to him. and there's a large assortment of instruments there to help him...<br /><br />film is interesting at first (and shows real restraint in terms of blood and gore) but gets stupider by the minute and has some highly unlikely plot twists and turns. it all ends in a final twist that was so old and stupid that i was shocked anyone would actually think of using it anymore. how such talented actors like eldard, schweiger and plummer got involved in crap like this is beyond me. this gets three stars for the acting but the stupid plot and truly unbelievable twists make this a chore to sit through.
