let's cut to the chase: this movie is softcore pornography marketed for the masses under a name that the studio is milking every last penny out of the american pie teat. period.<br /><br />the whole plot (and that shouldn't imply that there's a whole lot to go around) serves as a vehicle to show the audience more boobs and sex scenes.<br /><br />if you're a tween guy, and you're too squeamish to purchase actual pornography, then this is the movie for you. otherwise, the movie doesn't have much to offer at all.<br /><br />the acting is sub-par, the character development is virtually non-existent, and the story is a nonsensical knarl of nudity, binge drinking and pranks (none of which are particularly memorable).<br /><br />go buy real porn if that's what you want to see, and if not, go watch a good movie. animal house, kids, or even the original american pie are all great cinematic works, and all of them contain heavy alcohol use and nudity.<br /><br />"it's not how much, it's how you use it"
