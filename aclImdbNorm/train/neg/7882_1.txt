after stopping by the movie store to find something to watch, we stumbled on this. it looked appealing from the summary, at least, so we gave it a try. and here's the kicker: the first 20 minutes are interesting! it's actually enjoyable! oh, wait, spoke too soon.<br /><br />somewhere in there, the movie took a disgusting turn into fundamental, right-wing christian brain-washing. not entirely sure what happens, but i think the screenplay writer found god somewhere in there, finished writing this script, and had no time to edit it because he had a kkk meeting to get to with his friends from the westboro church and his hood wasn't clean.<br /><br />can they put warnings on this? i refuse to support this religious idiocy. much like video games have rating systems, movies need some sort of symbol: maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that a movie is going to take a turn for the worse.<br /><br />unless you share sentiments with whatever moron came up with this story, and will have your bible open in your lap while you watch this and plan on how you'll convert your neighbors, don't waste your time. it's some of the worst junk that's come out in a very long time, and the radical religious nuts don't need anymore funding.
