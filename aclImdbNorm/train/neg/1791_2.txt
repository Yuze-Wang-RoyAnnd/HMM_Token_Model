what's with the murky video in the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie? it's like someone put muddy water on the camera lens.<br /><br />the violence and nudity might turn some people off but, that, along with the mostly bad acting is what makes a good cult movie i suppose.<br /><br />my favorite line is delivered by tarquin the vampire, "alas, your breed is dumb." okay, no one should ever say "alas" in a movie line unless they're english and living in the 18th century.<br /><br />the acting by the van helsing character and bad girl "rally" isn't bad. i also liked master little played by ron little. wicked martial arts! don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it.
