if the only sex you've ever had is with a farm animal, then the tag line for this movie is probably still misleading.<br /><br />this is by far one of the most boring movies i've had the pleasure to try and watch lately. i found the dvd lying around at my friend's house, and i made the sad mistake of not burning it.<br /><br />i am unable to tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about 5 details to this movie. just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on c-span only the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate on c-span.<br /><br />i think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie, but i was unable to tell exactly what it was after i gouched my eyeballs out and threw them at richard gere.
