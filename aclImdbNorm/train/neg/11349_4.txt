actually, this is a lie, shrek 3-d was actually the first 3d animated movie. i bought it on dvd about 3 years ago. didn't bug's life also do that? i think it was at disneyworld in that tree, so i'm saying before they go and use that as there logo. also, shrek 3d was a motion simulator at universal studios. they should still consider it as a movie, because it appeared in a "theater" and you could buy it for dvd. the movie was cute, at least the little flyes were. i liked iq. i agree with animaster, they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out-and-back adventure. i recommend it to families and kids.
