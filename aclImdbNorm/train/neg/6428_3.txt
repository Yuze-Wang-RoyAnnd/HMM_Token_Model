this makes the third errol morris movie i've seen, and i'm increasingly not liking his style. he seems to find very interesting and varied characters, great personalities to create documentaries for, and then with tongue-in-cheek editing make fun of everything they are about. it's never really a direct caricaturation of them and morris seems most of the time to be saying, "but no, no, these people are really fascinating, really!", but there's always these subtle little canted angles and not-so-subtle editing techniques that show that morris seems to be mocking them behind their back.<br /><br />this movie tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation... a man who studies african hairless molerats to find that they are amazingly ant-like, a lion tamer, a man who keeps a garden full of animal-shaped shrubbery, and a robot designer. the general theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what designates animal, human, and life features? so the title of fast, cheap, & out of control doesn't really seem to mean anything in terms of the movie... right? except of course morris seems just a little disturbed by these individuals' passions (he might call them "obsessions") making synthetic designs on life. i share not that fear and honestly don't appreciate some of the connections morris makes in the film.<br /><br />but i stress his subtlety. with no voice-over narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees, it's not as if morris ever pounds that anxiety onto the spectators' collective head. instead he mixes circus footage and ant footage together often at times when they're taken out of the context of the circus and the ants, showing a sort of collective absurdity behind what all of these people are talking about. i don't find them absurd, i find them all very neat and interesting individuals.<br /><br />unless, of course, he didn't intend such juxtapositions, which means he's just a bad craftsman instead of a silent subverter. considering none of this films i've seen so far have particularly impressed me, i don't really care to find out what he's trying to do.<br /><br />--polarisdib
