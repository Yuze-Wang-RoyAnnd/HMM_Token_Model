this isn't art, it's inner-urban, politically-correct propaganda! jindabyne's political intolerance is beyond unforgivable... it doesn't see people as individuals, but rather, as members of categories.<br /><br />this is the most patronisingly offensive australian movie i can recall ever (and it's up against some pretty stiff competition!). a message movie, every tired theme beloved of the trendy left is there: aborigines are victims; white men are violent or alcoholics; white women aren't that bad -particularly if they are lesbians - but they're most likely of a depressive nature.<br /><br />four men who go away fishing, find the body of a murdered woman (aboriginal, naturally) and leave her in the river for several days while they catch trout. it's a strange decision taken with almost no discussion, as if the men are animals. the one man who briefly demurs is the goodie... we know this because he's living with a bisexual woman - he likes to hold his baby a lot - and eventually moves to a more fashionable costal location (away from all these beastly bush-dwellers).<br /><br />this is a film made by those trendy urbanites who live in fear of the australian landscape and those evil rednecks who reside within. it's ignorance of country life is almost as shocking as its contempt. the film is shot through with long-distance views of the bush backed by foreboding, mysterious music. it's made very clear by the end that aboriginal people are the only ones at home in this landscape. it concludes with an excruciatingly implausible scene of black-white reconciliation.<br /><br />in jindabyne, country life is reduced to little more than a backdrop for a story that by implication proclaims the superiority of the values of enlightened leftist urban dwellers over those of other australians.<br /><br />this film was not made by people with real jobs but funded by the government's film finance corporation. it's a product of the artsy set, that soulless void populated by the beautiful people for whom lavish government funding sustains these patronisingly offensive projects (which are as detached from real life as possible), as opposed to actually making popular films people want to see. it doesn't matter if the film is a stinker, they still get paid.<br /><br />spare yourself from wasting time, avoid it like the plague. more jaded social commentary than actual entertainment, this film deserves to pan!
