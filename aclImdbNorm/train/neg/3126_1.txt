mr. vanhook took a good idea and kicked like a football. unfortunately, it didn't make the goal. the historical subject of giants is a good one, but pour in the goon milk and you end up with a giant wheel of cheese. i say, take this reel wheel and roll it off a cliff. i couldn't even watch the entire film. that says a lot because i rarely walk away from any movie. i always like to give them a chance for last-minute redemption. it's impossible to redeem something this bad. well, at least the acting was good....not! <br /><br />the only thing "falling" in this film is the rating. 1/10 and sinking into the negative numbers!
