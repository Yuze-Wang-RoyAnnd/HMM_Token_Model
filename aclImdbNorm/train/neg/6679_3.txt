manoj agrawal after the failure of pardesi babu(1998) returned with this film<br /><br />the film has govinda in 8-9 roles, as his father, mother, grandfather, sister and later-on he also has disguises <br /><br />he in short is a useless detective send on a case by his friend to get proofs against his wife, whose photos he looses at the airport while flirting with rani<br /><br />he disguises as a sardarji in the plane and again as a girl the funny part is how easily and in short time he does that?<br /><br />then he disguises as a french singer and enters a tv to get proofs lol and then as a maharashtrian(yes inside the tv itself) <br /><br />the rest of the film has the same mistaken identities and ends on a predictable note there are some funny scenes like govinda being bashed by an african and also many other portions <br /><br />direction by manoj agrawal is okay music is okay<br /><br />amongst actors govinda again proves he is one of the most watchable actors he as usual is fantastic though he has done such roles before he fits in all the get ups and roles too well here again though the much hyped 6-7 roles don't actually fit in the film rani looks fat, teams up well with govinda thatz it she is nothing great and kept doing such type of roles amongst rest nirmal pandey is as usual johny lever is too loud at times and funny in places in 1 role and irritates as the older tinnu anand is okay satish kaushik is hilarious, paresh is okay tanaaz is okay
