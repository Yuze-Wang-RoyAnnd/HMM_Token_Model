i am a huge adam sandler fan, and one day i was looking at the cast&crew selection on one of his dvd's and saw 'going overboard' and decided to go out and rent it. so i went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it. we put it on and we were shocked to see an adam sandler that didn't hit puberty yet, he looks as if he was 12 when this movie came out. i couldn't even watch 30 minutes of this crap, i didn't laugh, chuckle, or even smirk at this movie, actually the only time i smirked was when i saw how horrid this movie was. i could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie...and it didn't work once. although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script i realized why i had never heard of this movie,...because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before. this movie, in my opinion, was the worst movie ever made,....ever!
