dear friends and family,<br /><br />i guess if one teen wants to become biblical with another teen, then that's their eternal damnation - just remember kids, "birth control" doesn't mean "oral sex", i don't care what the honor student says. on the other hand, even if the senator's aid quotes himself as a "bit of a romantic guy", he's still only hitting on a high school girl. if she was my sister, i'd eat this guys kneecaps.<br /><br />other than that i found out that mongolians don't kiss the same way the french do and that baseball players named zoo like delicate undergarments.<br /><br />i think i'd almost rather watch richie rich one more time than suffer the indignity of this slip, slap, slop. thank you, and good night.
