ok - the helicopter shots are fantastic, and the director made good use of some of barcelona's top sights. otherwise...production value was blown in the first few minutes and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week. ellen pompeo was charming and fun to watch, abel folk had the most depth and was very effective, and william baldwin was...well, william baldwin. he got to put his martial art training to good use and be a running-jumping-earnest action figure. the rest of the cast was wooden at best, but mostly paper. so - if you're nostalgic about spain - it's a picture postcard with an action twist, and a healthy dose of el greco. if not, skip it.
