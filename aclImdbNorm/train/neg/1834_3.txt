i can't say much about this film. i think it speaks for itself (as do the current ratings on here). i rented this about two years ago and i totally regretted it. i even /tried/ to like it by watching it twice, but i just couldn't. i can safely say that i have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever, ever again. and i'm not one to trash a movie, but i truly believe this was awful. it wasn't even funny in the slightest. the only bits i enjoyed were the few scenes with christopher walken in them. i think this film ruined both jack black and ben stiller for me. all i can think of when i see one of their films now-a-days is this terrible movie, and it reminds me not to waste my money. amy poehler is so very annoying, too.<br /><br />overall, well, i think you get my point. the stars are for walken, by the way.
