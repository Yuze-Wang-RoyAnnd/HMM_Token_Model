this was the worst movie i have ever seen! molly (molly hall) could not act at all! she had no emotion it was all blah blah blah like she was reading out of a boring text book. the smart kid and the kid who loves food (there names weren't worth remembering) were so annoying it drove me crazy.when ever the talked it was about some scientific thing or food. mollys dad didn't show enough emotion about his daughter missing. the police officer and mollys dad said the same thing like four times. it was just horrible. everything was repeated way to much. beatrice should have had something bad happen to her for being so mean. i just wasted a moment in my life by watching this movie!
