i also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago. first, i'm going to say that it looks great. cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer. i just wish the movie had been as good as it looks. i would not call this a horror movie. putting in a few shots of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie. there's no mystery, there's no suspense, you know who did it the entire time. <br /><br />it's a drama. you know what's going on with both sides the entire movie. the acting was okay, i guess, but nothing special.<br /><br />and the tagline, "revenge can be deadly"....really?...they should have check how many hundreds of horror/thriller movies have that exact same tagline?<br /><br />it pains me to say some of this, but i know a lot of the people who worked on this movie, and i know they don't want people blowing smoke up their ass, so i give my honest opinion.
