there is one really good scene in faat kine. the title character gets in an argument with another woman and after being threatened, faat kine sprays her in the face. the scene works because the act is so unexpected, bizarre, and rather funny at the same time. in that one instance, writer/director ousmane sembene gives the audience a character that is easy to root for, an interesting film character that could be worth watching for two hours. in the scene, he presents a brave woman who is bold in her actions. for the rest of the movie, the only other thing he seems to present is conflicting tones. <br /><br />the tone is all over the place. it's true not all movies have to clearly fit within a specific genre, but i don't think faat kine fits into any genre. supposedly, it's a drama, though there are moments of such broad comedy (the aforementioned spraying in the face) that it cannot be taken seriously. on the other hand, the film is certainly not a comedy with the abundant amount of serious topics sembene has crammed into the picture. there is a way to successfully mix comedy and drama together. unfortunately, semebene doesn't find that balance. instead, one scene after another just drift into each other without much rhyme or reason, leaving two different tones hanging in the wind. <br /><br />faat kine also has the problem of running two hours long with an extremely drawn out finale. the film ends with a big party where all the characters' conflicts are resolved, only they aren't resolved quickly. the scene lasts longer than any other scene, going on for probably twenty minutes. because the rest of the scenes up until this point have been meandering, the finale is particularly hard to endure with repetition beginning early on in the scene, making for a frustrating viewing experience.<br /><br />perhaps i am being too hard on faat kine. i am not the right audience for it. i felt nothing towards the characters and had no connection to any part of the story. there are people who will probably find something meaningful in the story and see strong characters. however, i was unable to do so and thus cannot recommend it.
