there seems to be a surprisingly high number of 8-10 star reviews here from people who have never written an imdb review before or since. given the very low average rating given to the film by other people, i think you may draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />this is a very bad film. i'll admit it, i thought the concept was kind of cute, and i was pleased to see the actresses who played eve and harmony on angel getting work, but it didn't take long for the sheer awfulness of this film to make itself known.<br /><br />acting: the leads seemed competent enough, but everyone else? terrible.<br /><br />plot: chock full of holes big enough to drive a truck through.<br /><br />direction: non-existent.<br /><br />humour: did they really think people were going to laugh? oh boy.<br /><br />eye candy: ok. there were some really beautiful women in this film. not just the three main female characters, but right across the board. it was as if the producers hoped the scenery would keep male viewers so distracted they wouldn't notice how terrible everything else was. if so, they failed miserably.<br /><br />in the right hands this could have been cute but darkly funny camp classic. it wasn't even close.
