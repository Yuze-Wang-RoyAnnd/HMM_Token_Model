god, what an awful thing ! oliver stone probably wanted to experiment or something (see the terrible use of music and pictures here) but what for really ? the whole thing behind "natural born killers" seems to be a "clever" look at how medias can turn into complete trash but unfortunately the movie turns into trash itself. please mr. stone, next time you want to criticize the fascism of tv shows using violence to get high rates, avoid doing the same with your movie ! michael haneke said quite cleverly about this film that it was denouncing media fascism with fascist cinematographic ways. how true... only he forgot to tell us about the massive headache you get after sitting through this overlong load of crap !
