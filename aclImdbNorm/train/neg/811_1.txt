the original was a good movie. i bought it on tape and have watched it several times. and though i know that sequels are not usually as good as the original i certainly wasn't expecting such a bomb. the romance was flat, the sight gags old, the spoken humor just wasn't. this may not have been the worst movie i've ever seen but it comes close.
