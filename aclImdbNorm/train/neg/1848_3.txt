there are bad movies, then there are the movies that are so bad, that they become almost art. this is one of those films. my partner and i are still both kind of shell shocked, you know, staring off into space and drooling! you can tell that the people involved (i hope they changed their names to protect themselves) were having a blast, and they definitely weren't shy. i give this one a three out of ten just because of the gratuitous smut and really bad gore effects. i laughed out loud during most of the movie, so i guess you could say that it showed me a good time. beware viewer, the above words in no way construe that this is a good film, because it is not. all i can say in my defense, is that it was impossible to pass up a movie with such a great title!
