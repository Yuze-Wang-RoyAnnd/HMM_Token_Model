good folks, i stumbled on this film on evening while i was grading papers. my academic specialty is anglo-saxon literature, and i can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves. the icelandic "beowulf and grendel" is the least offensive i have seen, and i did pay $3.00 for my copy. this sci-fi version ranks with the christopher lambert version. yuck.<br /><br />what didn't i like? cgi for one. amazingly bad. more importantly is the faithfulness to the storyline, not to mention the stilted acting. i am used to both with all the versions i have seen.<br /><br />delighted regardless, peter
