this ludicrous film offers the standard 1970's "hippie mentality" in a nut shell and bores us in the process. its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups. a naive young hippy played by the waif-like ( kay lenz ) hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day she meets the ridiculous (holden), already in old age, hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor, and she decides that she is in "love" with him. if you think that is superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes. she keeps saying how much she "loves" him and she only met him, it wears thin and really quick. i couldn't help but laugh throughout the film. its obvious she's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place. a disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex, i had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit. a corny offering of music from the 70's is also spread through the film. avoid this if you can. grade d.
