for those deciding whether or not to watch this movie and are reading these comments for insight, i first offer these four words: don't waste your time! "chungking express" was shoddily filmed, slapped together quickly and seems as though it were conceived in its entirety by someone standing in line at a hong kong burger king. i can't remember ever watching a film with an assortment of such one-dimensional characters trying to work their way through a script this mundane! it's an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialog (a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers the stunning revelation that "tears can be dried with a tissue, but water takes time to mop up"). the same character is also seen carrying on a deep, meaningful rapport with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. the shaky, wandering, hand-held camera-work was another annoying feature i could have done without. and if that isn't enough to make you puke in your popcorn, we hear the old 60's ode "california dreaming" by the mamas and papas blaring over the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly lengthy sequence.<br /><br />quentin tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to america through his rolling thunder productions company, though i cannot for the life of me figure out why a man with his talent would bother. he was known to have remarked, "i'm happy to love a movie this much." a lot of us, though, hope he will concentrate on making his audiences happy with more worthwhile discoveries in the future.
