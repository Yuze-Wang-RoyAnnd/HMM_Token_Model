if this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic, it might (i say might) have been a hit. have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its faults? well this is it. every one of the acting cast should be nominated for worst acting performance awards. it would be hard to find another film, with this kind of production budget, that contains so little of any value whatsoever. the whole thing, from the opening scenes defies logic. dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical. ditto for the behaviour and general storyline of the film itself. what is really mind boggling, is that some buffoons in a boardroom actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of trash. wow.
