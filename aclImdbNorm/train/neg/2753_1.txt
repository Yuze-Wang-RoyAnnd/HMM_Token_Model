first off i'd like to point out that sam niel is nowhere to be seen in this film. what's a movie without sam niel. did anyone see event horizon. d-wars did have potential a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers does sound cool but sadly isn't. nope, no sam niel, no good movie. i recommend taking the 5 dollars or so it takes to rent d-wars and adding 10 to that five and buying a sam niel film- apparently to submit this i have to have ten lines of text so heres a list of sam niel movies i recommend<br /><br />-jurassic park -dead calm -hunt for red october -event horizon -not jurassic park three<br /><br />overall d-wars is a pile
