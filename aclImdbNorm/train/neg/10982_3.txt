movie had some good acting and good moments (though obviously pretty low budget), but bad rating due to basic premise being badly developed. the main point of conflict between the two leads doesn't play out in a realistic manner at all. there are a few scenes where they disagree because of it, but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently, especially since the employment of glenn is so wound up in this part of his life (and adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money.) also, several times glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is (apologizing to adam for his past) while adam is shown to be upstanding and "traditional," which the film proclaims to be the "good" way in the end. i don't like being preached to like that. i attended a discussion session with the director after viewing ltr, and he said that he presented this conflict between them because, if he was in glenn's shoes (and he said he does in real life relate to glenn's view) that he could never date someone with adam's views. well, then, i think he should have done a much better job explaining how glenn could do it in the film. also, director said he directed this, his first movie, only after reading (directing for dummies.) directing was not that bad, but far from a top notch effort. i've seen worse, but i rarely leave films feeling this frustrated.
