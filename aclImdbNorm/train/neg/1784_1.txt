ok, i taped this off tv and missed the very start. the film was about 10 or so seconds into the titles (i assume) so if anything happened before that i missed it.<br /><br />lots of people say mark hammill is in this, i didn't see him. i did recognise clive barker, john landis and obviously stephen king doing some really awful acting as the graveyard attendant.<br /><br />alice krige looks lovely apart from the scenes where she has the cat face or is in full alien make-up.<br /><br />even with the opening titles it's never really explained very well exactly what sleepwalkers are or where they come from. from the title sequence i assume they are catlike bipeds who live by extracting life-force from humans. i assume they live a long time and these particular 2 are possibly the last of their kind.<br /><br />add to this a very large dose of incest (yes! i thought it was a bit suspect too), shapeshifting, killer cats and invisibility and you have sleepwalkers.<br /><br />it's a very bad story that has no real explanations behind the main 2 characters and far too many cameo's to try and distract from the simple fact that not enough is explained to the viewer.<br /><br />avoid.
