this was the third remake of sleeping with the eniemy after yaarana(1995) and agnisakshi(1996)<br /><br />agnisakshi was the only one which worked and was a better film<br /><br />daraar is directed by abbas mustan who sadly failed in their attempt here<br /><br />the story was good but the handling wasn't that good and the heroine was shown too regressive and the climax too was disappointing<br /><br />direction is bad music is good<br /><br />rishi reprises his role of yaarana(strangely which also was a remake of swte) and looks too fat for the lead and is okay juhi is decent while arbaaz tries too hard in his debut and does manage in many scenes to chill the audiences but his voice was terrible johny is too loud
