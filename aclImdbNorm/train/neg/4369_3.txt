***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** juggernaut is a british made "thriller" released in the us by first national. karloff is dr. sartorius who has to leave his research because his funds have dried up. karloff is forced to retreat to france and start up a medical practice. he is propositioned by a conniving woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband. she knows karloff needs the money.<br /><br />karloff agrees to the proposition and soon becomes the personal doctor of the husband. all the while, the wife is prancing about town with the local no good playboy. karloff finally injects the old geyser with poison and he kicks off. however, his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the killing and finds out the will has been changed. when he spills the beans to the wife, she goes berserk and even bites the son's hand.<br /><br />meanwhile, karloff's nurse has misplaced the hypo karloff used to kill the old man. when karloff finds out he isn't getting any money, he asks the wife to poison the son. the nurse suspects karloff and finds the missing hypo. analysis shows poison, but not quite in time as karloff kidnaps the nurse.<br /><br />to make a long story short, the nurse escapes, gets the police, and manages to save the son who is about to be injected by karloff. karloff instead injects himself and dies.<br /><br />this movie does have some good points. karloff is possessed and plays the type of mad doctor he did in the devil commands and the man who lived again. it is peculiar, however, to see him walk around stiffly and slightly hunched over. we never find out why he is walking this way. i suspect the director thought it made him more sinister.<br /><br />the actress playing the 2-timing wife overacts something terrible. she has a french accent. even though she overacts badly, you still manage to hate her (or maybe you hate her because of her acting...).<br /><br />a little below average for a karloff vehicle. if you buy the sinister cinema vhs copy, the audio is a bit choppy.
