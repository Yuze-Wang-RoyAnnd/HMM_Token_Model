yes, chunky, this is the nick-name that donna reeds' romantic lead played by tom drake tags her with! so lets get this clear right away. from her first ing'enue role in the get-away (1941) too her last, dallas (1984-1985) ms. reed could never be described as chunky. not this attractive and slim actress. whose roles at m.g.m. seldom lived up to her talents.<br /><br />ms. reed is supported by a cast of competent character actors, who unfortunately must flounder through this alleged 'screw-ball' comedy. clearly m.g.m. was out of their depth making this type of film. a type better produced over at columbia, paramount, rko and even universal. neither the 'touch' of ernst lubitsch nor the wit of preston sturges could save this film. a rather conventional romantic comedy that had all the markings of a pre-war (wwii) effort.<br /><br />if irving thalberg had still been alive the screen-play would have either gone through a significant rewrite or never seen the light of day. it did fit into louis b. mayer's 'safe-zone' of none challenging family entertainment. a form that could not stand up to the post-war challenges of the 'dehavilland decision', loss of their theater chains, television and would contribute to m.g.m.s decline. fortunetly for donna reed her best days are ahead of her culminating in from here to eternity (1953) and her oscar win as best supporting actress.
