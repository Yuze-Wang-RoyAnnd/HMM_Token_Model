there is nothing cool, hip, or clever about this film-- liking it just reveals an ignorance of true art cinema. how can you so easily forget that the central fact of this entire film is that these mean & ugly people are . . . serial killers! if they have to dismember total strangers in order to "be a family again," then we don't want them to "be a family." what part of that did you have trouble grasping? why applaud this filth?<br /><br />this silly filth is what you do if you can't do art! one's head & life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow viciousness as "interesting." this is a camera without a brain. what really makes an artwork cool is profundity, questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history (or, in this case, a knowledge of anything would be preferable!). instead, this is just randomly piling up the ugliest images available in a world in meltdown, thanks to just the sort of empty meanness glorified as "cool cause it's so far out, man!"). these same violent events actually happen, every day. they are not "just in the film." they refer to actual soul-less people who would do those same things to you. do you want those things done to you? a child could have thought this up, it required zero imagination, it is not surrealism. this lazy crap has no content, is saying nothing--it's just the worst of the evening news, & it is saying nothing new, nothing we don't already know. it's "the emperor's new clothes," the director hoping there are enough uneducated children, proud of their streak of inhumanity, for this sloppy filth to fly. i can see director miike's demented fans now: chain-smoking teens-and- twenties drunks covered in tattoos, with metal hanging from holes punched in their faces, their knowledge-base inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves .<br /><br />there is no plot to this--it is just sheer exploitation of shock-value violence. there is no "hidden meaning" anywhere in this poorly made film. it is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic, but you cannot uncover a hidden meaning if one is not there! to do that you need to view & review a real piece of cinema. there are plenty out there, directed by fellini, bergman, fassbinder, herzog, altman, bunuel, kurosawa, lynch, tarkovsky, peter greenaway, tarantino, guillermo del toro, richard linklater, eisenstein, aronofsky, gus van sant, soderbergh, shyamalan, ordet. why don't you view a real art film by the likes of these giants? this wannabe director, miike, will never make a film equal to one of the geniuses i just listed because he just doesn't have the talent! anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like "visitor q." teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon! there's no message, no meaning, no plot, nothing to it at all. there are long lists of art films to learn from--but this "visitor q" is not an art film in any respect. it has no content to it. it's just one banal horror piled onto another, and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things happen, every single day, somewhere in the world. they are not okay because they are "just in the film." they refer to actual soul-less people who would do those same things to you. do you want those things done to you? to others? why? because this world is already ugly enough, thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this. <br /><br />there are sooooo many art films out there to use your mind to deconstruct, but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap. there is no deeper meaning. there is nothing to analyze; why keep trying? i've spent nearly 40 years watching practically every film ever made, and keeping up with all the new ones, but i've never seen anything as disgustingly pointless as this. it's not imaginative or even shocking, because these types of events happen daily all over the world. to make this film, or even to favorably review it, has caused over 50 young airheads who don't know any better to think it's "cool." they may grow up thinking that, convincing others, some of whom may end up doing these things--convicted killers often reveal how they started out just this way, by being desensitized to the horror of this gruesome inhumanity. trust me on this,--i know cool, and cool this piece of crap ain't. visitor q has the feel of a genuine snuff film, and i'm still not sure it isn't, actually. <br /><br />your actions have consequences, son. the world is awful enough already. some violence like this could happen to you, or to the socially irresponsible director who cranked out this fake art film. believe me, you won't be thinking it's "cool" when someone is sawing your skull in half!
