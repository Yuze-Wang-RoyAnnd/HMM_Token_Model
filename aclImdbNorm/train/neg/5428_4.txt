another priyadarshan/vohra flick another movie that was seen for tp rather than actual desire, the only reason i did see this movie was the fact that the regulars were not there in this movie (akshay paresh and many others), but needless to say i had low expectations from this movie.<br /><br />i was happy with the casting in general except, rajpal yadav who once again annoys to no limit, he does however extract some laughs, but these were those standard slapstick non-original jokes, in fact this whole movie is like playing the dhol, i mean it takes hardly any talent to make loud noise, or even play the odd good beat on the dhol for a small time does it?? its only those who can carry different beats in a nice sequential manner, for an extended period who are considered great.<br /><br />which brings us to the other instrument, the dumroo hardly requires any talent, it has no variations, and it may be enjoyable for a while the monkey dances (hmm sounds like rajpal yadav, good analogy), but its not a instrument that will entertain you for long or even get you dancing like the dhol does.<br /><br />this movie was like the dhol and the dumroo being played, sometimes the dhol was played sometimes the dumroo, sometimes both together, but mostly the dumroo played alone and the monkey danced. and like any 24 year old sooner than later i got bored.<br /><br />the movie has some good dhol (good) moments but after a while all i heard was the annoying dumroo (entertaining initially, then tolerable then irritating), the large ordinary parts really ensure this movie is mainly good for a few funny clips on "mere bhains ko anda kyun mara" (if you haven't watched it watch it on filmy, it comes in the evenings and is really quite funny).<br /><br />this movie had its moments, the actors did a fine job, except rajpal yadav (who can act though, i've seen him in main meri patni
