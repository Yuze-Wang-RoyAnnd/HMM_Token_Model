hellborn starts as a young psychiatric doctor named james bishop (matt stasi) takes up his residency at st. andrews insane asylum, or 'mental illness facility' as they like to call it there. with nearly 600 patients bishop meets his boss dr. mccort (bruce payne) & is put to work, he gets ward 'a' where some seriously deranged & dangerous patients are held. if that wasn't bad enough during his first round of visits bishop finds a dead body & has threatening sounding graffiti messages sprayed over his room. bishop starts to hear stories from the patients about sinister goings-on at the asylum & soon finds out for himself the stories have more than a hint of truth about them...<br /><br />known as asylum of the damned in the us this supernatural horror film was directed by philip j. jones & i sort of liked it but in the end there were too many unsatisfying elements for me to totally enjoy it. the script by matt mccombs takes itself pretty seriously & i quite liked the basic idea behind & some of it's ideas but there are a few things which work against it. for a start the film is just too slow, the story is pretty good & doesn't give itself away too early but it takes an absolute age for it to get going & i was rapidly losing interest with each passing minute. i also thought the so-called twist ending was far too predictable & the ending itself far too bland & forgettable. it's a shame because i liked the story, the character's, the setting & some of the ideas but it's simply too slow & frankly dull to keep one entertained over it's 90 minute duration. it's one of those films which i would like to recommend but in all honesty i can't.<br /><br />director jones does a good job, this is actually a well lit & quite atmospheric film. i wouldn't say there's anything scary here. i'm not sure if hellborn was shot in a real insane asylum but if it wasn't they did a great job on the sets & the film looks pretty good overall. unfortunately there is a real lack of gore or action, there are two hand-print shaped wounds & a severed tongue & that's it, absolutely nothing else in terms of blood or gore which has to go down as a disappointment. depending on who you believe & which review you read the special effects are either the worst ever or very good, well as a devoted watcher of low budget horror i was very impressed with the effects especially the demon thing which looks mightily impressive & is a man in a suit type effect rather than a terrible cgi computer graphic although it's an impressive suit. it all depends on your expectations i suppose.<br /><br />technically the film is good, it looks nice enough & the lack of cgi computer effects is something i welcome. the acting isn't great though, it certainly could have been better.<br /><br />hellborn is a film that disappointed me, there were some good stuff about it but at the same time some terrible stuff which unfortunately outweighs the good. i sort of liked parts of it but as a whole 90 minute viewing experience i'd find it totally impossible to recommend to anyone.
