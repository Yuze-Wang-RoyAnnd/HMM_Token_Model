in a recent biography of alec guinness i couldn't find too much about to paris with love. i'm sure guinness did the film to get a free trip to paris out of it. the film has no other reason for existence.<br /><br />paris of course is nicely photographed with that wonderful opening of guinness and his son driving down the champs elysee with the arc de triomphe in the background. unfortunately it goes downhill from there.<br /><br />there is just no chemistry at all between guinness and the young girl who he has a brief fling with in paris. according to the recent biography of guinness by piers paul read, guinness positively disliked the girl, found her conduct unprofessional. as to what odile vernois thought of her co-star, no record is available. they have as much chemistry as two neutered cats.<br /><br />guinness does have a good moment in the film which was straight from one of his ealing comedies as he climbs a tree trying to retrieve a badminton shuttlecock. but i wouldn't wait through the film for it.<br /><br />at least alec got a trip to paris out of the deal.
