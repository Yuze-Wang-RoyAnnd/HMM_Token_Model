this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description. but to me it was a bit of a let down. very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening. it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed (definitely not in sequential order). also, nothing of any consequence was being filmed. i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer's part, which is different from the typical hollywood film. but this one befuddled me to no end. i viewed the film a second and third time and it still didn't do anything for me. i still don't really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey. if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person's life, i guess he succeeded. but i was looking for more. needless to say, i can't recommend this movie to anyone.
