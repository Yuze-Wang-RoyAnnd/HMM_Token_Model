sky captain is possibly the best awful movie i've seen in a long while. rife with amazing cg and special effects, studded with an a-list cast (jude law, gwyneth paltrow, angelina jolie and the infinitely likable giovanni ribisi) and racing along with an overused but indiana jones-esquire storyline, this should have been a great movie to watch.<br /><br />'should have' being the key term here, of course.<br /><br />jude law plays joe the sky captain with a dashing accent and plenty of over-the-shoulder, heart-melting smirks, but you can't make something out of nothing, and even his flippant deliveries and boyish good looks can't save the movie's stone dialogue. (if he had slapped giovanni ribisi on the back and said, "good boy, dex," just one more time, i might have barfed all over the guy in front of me.) gwyneth paltrow, as polly perkins, is nothing less than nerve grating. her nasal whining and not-quite-sarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie. perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical 30's comic book heroine- who knows? i expected more from her. an example of how a similar character was played (and played well) is in the late 90's flick "the phantom," starring kristy swanson and billy zane. rent the movie and you'll know what i mean.<br /><br />giovanni ribisi and angelina jolie were the saving graces in the film. (angelina jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch. i'll admit it.) in just a few short scenes, both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry, two-dimensional castmates.<br /><br />the plot and steady story progression were old, boring, and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years. the pace is rapid-fire in the first half of the movie, and a snail's pace in the second, giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film, but to figure out who the key villain is as well. the pairing is rather clich'ed, also- polly perkins and sky captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterly-ended romance, and their story isn't so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched. when they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film, nobody's surprised, and nobody really cares either.<br /><br />props to the director for appreciating bai ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film, and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout. but sky captain, despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie, falls flat on its face. not even worth the $2.75 i paid to get into the theater.
