i had to write a review of this film after reading another comment saying that this is sidney poitier's best movie. poitier had just returned from over a decade's break in film acting and he is clearly creaky here. 11 of his films are mentioned in wikipedia and they don't include this. 5 of his films are on the afi's list of top 100 inspiring movies, again, not including this. berenger and poitier, rube and city slicker set out to hunt down a dangerous psychopath before he crosses the border to canada. some of the attempts at comedy in this film clearly fail and berenger and poitier's bonding was cringeworthy and awkward (not helped by a completely bland script). kirstie alley (as the hostage) was underused, and almost entirely ignored when she was on screen. some attempt at suspense is made, for example when you're meant to try and guess which of 5 men on a fishing trip is the murderer (all of them are type-cast villains). i understand that this is the entire appeal to most fans out there. i guessed who it was and i wasn't really trying hard.<br /><br />if you're a berenger fan, watch the sniper (1993), you even get to see billy zane strutting his stuff. it's much better. all in all i'd give shoot to kill 3/10. it's not daring, and it's just too straightforward for me.
