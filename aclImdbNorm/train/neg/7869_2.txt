corridors of time. the movie you can watch if you're looking for a sophisticated way of suicide. some use guns, ropes, or gas, but you want to ruin your brains ? do not wait any longer ! corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes : thinking christian clavier is able to act and to bring you fun. i do not miss the 45 francs this poor thing cost me : sometimes, one has to reset its evaluation system looking at the absolute zero. this film deserves a 2/10, but that's only because i like jean reno. too bad for him, he also stars in ronin. i think i'm gonna dislike him...
