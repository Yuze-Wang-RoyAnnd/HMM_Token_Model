this film was bad. bad acting, bad directing, bad writing. but it wasn't bad in a funny way. it was bad in a boring way. i watched "surface to air" because i thought it might be a laugh. it wasn't. don't make the mistake i did. there are plenty of more enjoyable ways to spend an hour and a half such as watching paint dry or reading the dictionary. seriously.
