orca is not exactly bad, but it's not really richard harris's finest hour either. as a demented, ahab-like fisherman, harris gets into a game of death with a vengeful killer whale after killing the whale's "wife" and unborn child. charlotte rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with harris. she yells at him a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone. he doesn't listen and somehow ends up in the arctic battling the revenge crazed whale. there are no special effects to speak of except for what looks like a round mirror for a whale's eye --- there are endless shots of harris reflected in the eye so the audience understands that the whale knows who he is. bo derek, as one of harris's crew has a particularly unpleasant run in with the orca and most of the supporting cast, including robert carridine, will sampson and keenan wynn don't fare very well either.
