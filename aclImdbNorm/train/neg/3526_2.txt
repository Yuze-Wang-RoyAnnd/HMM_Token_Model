(spoiler included, some would say)<br /><br />this film is not possible to take seriously. at some parts it is so awfully stupid that i just can't help laughing at it all. try me for the sequence where stallone's character jumps some 20 meters with full climbing gear or (and this is really my favorite) snuffs a bad guy by sticking him onto a stalactite. yeah, what ungodly strength did he muster to accomplish such feats? i dunno, but he sure gives reality a run for the money.
