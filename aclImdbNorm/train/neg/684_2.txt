couldn't believe it! clipped sentences? good grief! know what? all true! real people ever talk like this? don't think so. good girl! stout fellow! stiffen upper lip! only reason given movie 2 instead of 0 gary cooper such a dish. movie as a whole ridiculous unless you like watching endless biplane dogfights. seemed endless, anyway. think all franchot tone's dialogue dubbed. when crawford and young make a special effort to sound british they come over as irish. handy tip - we brits clip words, not sentences. and somehow we manage to draaaaaaaawl at the same time. but that's only if we've been to a really good public (that's private to you) school.
