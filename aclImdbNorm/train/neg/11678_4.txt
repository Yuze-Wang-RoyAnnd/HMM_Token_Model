for me an unsatisfactory, unconvincing heist movie. with an a-list cast, particularly the three leads and an experienced maverick director like spike lee i was expecting far more and in the end felt that what was delivered added little to this movie sub-genre. for a start i didn't like the pacing of the film, starting off with mastermind clive owen's raison d'etre piece to camera, unnecessarily repeated at the conclusion, then finding the narrative peppered with confusing, not to say unreal-seeming witness interviews, then finding yourself jumped into scenes you sense had begun earlier. of course the camera work is fluid throughout, constantly on the move and incorporating hand-camera shots a-plenty, but director lee fails to deliver thrills or suspense, falling down fundamentally by not making anything of the key protagonists in the film. denzel washington is weighed down with the clothes and bad-ass jive talk of a "shaft" movie thirty - five years earlier (he even has that "no-one understands him but his woman" thing going on, replete with his "hot" girlfriend, baiting her with some downright crude and inappropriate "dirty-talk") and his mild "in the heat of the night" riff with willem defoe (in almost a bit-part) raises barely a ripple. clive owens plays his character with a resolutely english accent even as we're given to believe the gang is arab-based, also hindered by having to play 90% of the film with a mask over his face. jodie foster delivers another of her patented tight-lipped, ice maiden, sub-clarice starling turns as a well connected financial bounty-hunter, if you will, to little effect. overall it's a real mish-mash of a film, with a light but obvious twist at the end, in fact the title gives it away from the start, spoiler fans. worst scene (of many) is undoubtedly washington's witness-interview, unbelievably, with an 8 year old street-kid, although owen's dialogue with the same child minutes earlier runs it close in the embarrassment stakes. during the film in-joke references are made by characters to classic heist films like "serpico" and "dog day afternoon" - but there's no honour in self-praise. more like "the hot rock" instead...and even that was good for a few laughs.
