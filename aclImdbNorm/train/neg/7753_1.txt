everything about this film is hog wash. pitiful acting, awful dialog, ugly native girls. this movie sinks into oblivion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the director must have been a weekend bender. robert c. is totally lost and has not got a clue on what is going on . the college kids are worst. no acting talent at all, very stupid reasoning, and just down right dumbbells. special effects are for the birds. the so called security force around this park belongs in toy land: with stupid looking guns, walkie talkies that are useless; and a computer system that ranks with a roll of toilet paper. if the park is under construction and nothing works; why bother inviting potential clients until everything is complete. the writers should be the first victims of the mess along with the producers and the crew. the whole film belongs in a septic tank shot to another planet for viewing. what a gem. convicts should have to watch this, so they can commit suicide.
