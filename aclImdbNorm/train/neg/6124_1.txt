it is a great tragedy that both richard harris and john derek are no longer with us. but that shouldn't blind anybody to the fact that in 1981, a pretty ugly blotch appears on both men's cvs. no doubt john derek conceived this movie doing for his wife what 'some like it hot' and 'one million years bc' did for maryln monroe and raquel welsh respectively, creating an iconic sex symbol for the new decade. having run to embrace dudley moore on the beach in '10' bo's reputation, an all-star cast and location filming in sri lanka meant that nothing could go wrong. alas, as they say, mortals plan and god laughs. it is said that when this film premiered in 1981, the edgar rice burrows estate tried to take legal action against it. bo derek plays jane parker who sets off into turn-of-the century africa to be reunited with her boozy, abusive dad, richard harris. daddy parker is an explorer who has set out to find 'the great inland sea' the stuff of local legend, whose existence has been poo-pooed by conventional wisdom. harris is worth watching for a wonderfully hammy, tanked -up performance which includes singing an irish ditty at an indian elephant that somehow found its way into africa (did it arrive at the same time as the orang-utan from sumatra???) furthermore, although jane professes to despise parker, bo and rich's relationship is creepily incestuous, testimony perhaps to the effects of the tropical heat. before long, however, local legends start to circulate about a 'great white ape' and jane hears the famous yodel. this is the movie's cue for miles o'keefe, a future b-movie star, making a rather odd debut as the loin-clothed lord of the jungle. unlike johnny weismuller with his pidgin english or ron ely who speaks the language fluently, the o'keefe tarzan is mute. given some of bo and richie's dialog, though, this is probably not a bad thing. harris and his caravan eventually reaches the great inland sea, located atop a gigantic plateau that seems to run halfway across africa....hang on, aren't seas, lakes and other watery places generally located in low-lying areas?? nevermind, it is just one of many anomalies in the john derek universe. the crew attempt to mount the cliffs and when the ropes snap, harris roars echoing abuse at the hapless men who have plummeted to their deaths. on another occasion, jane decides to take a nude swim by the inland sea, giving another occasion to see some gratuitous nudity. out of nowhere a single male lion appears. now lions usually travel in prides and never go near beaches but later on, tarzan will be wrestling with a (venomous) boa constrictor. zoology doesn't seem to have been one of john derek's strong points..... this being a tarzan movie, jane becomes enchanted with the lord of the jungle and resolves to take his virginity. but having seen his closeness to some of those chimps, you do have to wonder...speaking of which, it's not only the edgar rice burroughs estate could have sued. it is highly probable that certain primates were on the phone to their lawyers: the chimps here make you miss cheeta badly. especially when they do ridiculous things like ride on the backs of elephants and clap their hands when tarzan and jane finally get it on! the climax of this film has bo and harris captured by some rather stereotypical cannibals who paint our heroine and prepare to sacrifice/eat/execute her. suffice is to say that the great wooden ape gets his girl and *spoiler* harris gets himself impaled on a huge elephant tusk! this doesn't stop the dying parker from delivering a rambling monologue to jane. as far as i am aware, the law suit from the rice burrows estate never materialized but 'tarzan the ape man' was crucified at the box office (no kidding?) a pity. john derek could have directed 'tarzan the ape man 2' with bo derek and miles o'keefe living in domestic bliss and dudley moore as 'boy.'
