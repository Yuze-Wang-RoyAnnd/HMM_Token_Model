awful movie. it's a shame that a few of flanders's top actors and actresses made such a lamentably poor film.<br /><br />there is barely something changed since the first movie and the tv series: same actors, same prototype characters, same scenario (emotional complications, the team under emotional pressure but everything turn out tip-top after a predictable grand finale). another constant fact in the work of jan verheyen is the exaggerated product placement (company logo's on the team's shirt and along side the pitch ok but two times a commercial (by one of the characters) about an internet provider is just over the top.<br /><br />meanwhile, rumour has it about the making of a second series for flanders commercial tv station 'vtm' (coincidental or not, the station where jan verheyen is programmation manager since a few months)<br /><br />to conclude ... and the golden raspberry award for worst foreign movie goes to ... team spirit 2
