john carpenter's career is over if this sad excuse for a movie is any indication. his excuse is that he only produced it. jon bon jovi looks like a girl. in fact, bon jovi and the two vampire girls, natasha wagner and arly jover probably all fit in the same clothes. in short, it was hard to tell which one was cuter in an anorexic ramp-model sort of way. bon jovi has the most charisma. at least he looks happy when he is smiling. the two vampire girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints. at one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss, but stop. amazing how each vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires. at one point, arly jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb vampire hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act. it would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof, and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched arly jover move her head to mimic something that was very obviously not happening. as far as gore is concerned, a few heads are ripped off, and the blood spurts profusely. these scenes have so little suspense or build-up that when they happen it is almost funny, and there is no "horror" pay-off from the scene. all you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of "wow, that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the walls. i wonder who has to clean it up." throughout the movie, these vampire hunters who are obviously trying to kill arly jover (the top vampire in the world??) keep reaching out to her. at one point, bon jovi goes into the abandoned church and after he just shot her with an arrow (and has done so on other occasions), he says "i am not trying to hurt you. i just want to talk to you. i want to get to know you." huh?? of course, the dumb vampire arly jumps out to say hello and bon jovi sticks her again with another impaling device. "why can't we be friends" the 1970s hit song by war should have been the theme song for this movie. aside from all of the other silly moments, there is a transfusion sequence when natasha wagner has all her vampire blood removed, and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion. i guess blood type is not important? anyhow, all her vampire blood is removed. bon jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him, he can beat arly by becoming a vampire also. of course, as the vampire blood is transfused into him, none of his healthy blood is removed. so apparently bon jovi is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body. and just like the first vampires, this one also has the vampires-bursting-into-flames special effect.
