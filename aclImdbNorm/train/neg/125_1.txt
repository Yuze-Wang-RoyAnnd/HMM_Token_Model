if only to avoid making this type of film in the future. this film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.<br /><br />one might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many important issues but it does so without any discernable motive. the viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this pointless film).<br /><br />one might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.<br /><br />
