i watched the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 lbs and house, m.d.. tucci's character is brilliant but socially inept out of choice, similar to laurie's character house, but without the acerbic wit that laurie brings to house. meanwhile, tucci's 'straight guy', the emphatic doctor seger, is not developed into a more interesting character, like the fallible 'straight guys' cuddy and wilson. indira varma's character adrienne holland is too similar to jennifer morrison's doctor cameron to be a co-incidence.<br /><br />someone at cbs obviously noticed the success of house, m.d. and told his staff to get him (her) a similar show, hoping that mimicry would prove successful. however, copying a show like house demands the same high level balance of wit and suspense and tucci and company are just not up to the challenge.<br /><br />i didn't know the show was canceled until i read the comments on imdb, but it doesn't come as a surprise to me.
