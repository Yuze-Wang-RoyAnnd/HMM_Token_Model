written by the excellent mcgovern and directed by frears this film was a slight disappointment. it seemed too short. it spent far too long creating the hovis atmosphere, and laughing at the catholic demands. then very quickly you have the fascist and socialists vying for the family's attention, and the terrible conclusion.<br /><br />still my wife thought liam was cute.
