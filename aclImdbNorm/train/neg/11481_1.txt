if they could get ed asner why didn't they get other actors instead of people who go to the same church as the producers? and why did the protagonist throw the wise old sage character to the ground when he was never in danger. it forced the old guy to mask the injury out of pride and so the young guy would feel guilty leaving him with a life long disability. i guess thats why the main character refuses money though and why the old guy works him like a dog even when he volunteers for extra work. if the d-bag boyfriend is a bad guy because he is long-distance boyfriend then why is a soldier any better. he has good reason to be jealous, good reason to get her away from her hometown and over protective, controlling manipulative father. all the characters that are meant to be likable aren't and everyone else is the 'bad' boyfriend. how did they meet anyway, a wine broker and a saw mill worker?
