i'm glad that i saw this film after mr.sandler became famous.<br /><br />it is bad....bad,bad,bad. there is no plot. it's like watching a painfully dull home movie.<br /><br />i really enjoy his other films......but if you're a fan like me....stay away from this one. it may change your thoughts on adam. you may never recover from the horror that is this film....i've had a better time watching old folks play scrabble in a home.......
