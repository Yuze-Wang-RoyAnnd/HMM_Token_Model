i rarely comment on films but i've read the other comments and i cannot believe that there are people applauding this celluloid rubbish. i know there are certain people who have their own agenda but lets take it on merit; poorly acted, badly shot and the story felt as the director was making it up as he was going along. i am not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving little kids as the makers of the film obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience would want. all i can say is it is a terrible film, the content is poor and offensive, the production is amateurish and i am glad they could not make a film like this legally today
