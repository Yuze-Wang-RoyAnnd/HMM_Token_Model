i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the 1988 blockbuster movie "far north", and even though i loved her in her one other film "slow" (2004) where she plays "francis", this is by far and away her strongest role.<br /><br />lynn, as i'm sure you all know (or should), plays the critical role of "driver".<br /><br />unfortunately, other than lynn's amazing performance, i'm afraid this movie doesn't really have much going for it.<br /><br />oh wait - there was one other thing - the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers. memorable lines like: "you son-of-a-gun!", "you son-of-a-witch!", "shoot!", and "well, forget you!"<br /><br />o.k. bye.<br /><br />p.s.: does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster?
