i saw the movie as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became the makings of a family joke. if the ranking had a zero, this movie would get it. the dinosaurs were awful. the storyline was ridiculous. the acting really doesn't qualify to be called acting. the only reason i even remember the name of the movie so well is because my family still talks about how bad it really was.
