i didn't think it could be done, but something has come along and replaced open house- a low budget horror about someone killing over the high price of real estate- as the worst film i've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet life.<br /><br />it was touted as the best film in montreal's most recent film festival, which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of blank-wall shots accompanied by people reading gloomy poetry.<br /><br />watching this movie was like a little slice of hell. it's from austria, and it attempts to stumble along in the footsteps of short cuts and blue velvet- scenes about various characters living in a suburban area with a dark underbelly. there's the fat dog owner and his fat maid wife who stripteases for him, the skinny divorcee whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the untouched room of his dead child, the "uber-annoying woman hitchhiker who recites top ten lists... the list goes on. forever. much like the two hours plus i spent in that theatre.<br /><br />yes, the characters interact, but not in a clever or interesting or even relevant way. i couldn't say if they were any good as actors, as, according to the subtitles, they were given lines that were the austrian equivalent of "you are so lame!" they certainly didn't have to learn many, as each repeated his or her same lines at least three times in a scene.<br /><br />this is no gummo, or any of the aforementioned movies. there is no art to discover, and nothing to dwell on afterwards except maybe whether or not you should change your "never walk out during a movie" policy (which quite a few older couples did during a random orgy scene- and if that sounds appetizing, it's not, unless you're one of few who doesn't find the idea of your parents having sex- and with a few local middle-aged couples, to boot- revolting).<br /><br />this movie was offensive to me. not the flabby nudity, not the cringe-inducing soundtrack, not the shockless scenes involving guns. i was offended that someone actually spent money to make this when there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding. i was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see dog days and come out wondering if that was the best us montrealers could find. most of all, i was offended that, somehow, the people involved with the festival duped everyone into believing that the emperor had a gorgeous and mesmerising new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat maid wife doing a striptease.<br /><br />
