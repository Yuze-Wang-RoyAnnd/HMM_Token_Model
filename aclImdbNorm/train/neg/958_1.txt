how did this become a blockbuster? dear god i don't know where to start why this movie sucked too much. the movie was predictable & there was no originality. the only thing i can admire is the acting of some characters. the movie was too bright, they should have done something with the lighting, eg. making the environment more darker. the make up on certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror flick. this is 2006! people don't get scared by other people wearing heavy make up. most of the horror scenes we're taken from other hollywood or asian horror movies. total rip off! this is why i don't watch tagalog movies. the only reason why so many people "screamed" while watching this movie is because of conformity. how many times do we have to copy scenes from the ring and improvise it that instead of the girl coming out of the tv, its now coming from the window next door? no matter how you put it, its still a rip off. if you want a good horror movie, go watch the 50 best horror movie listed on this website.
