this movie was based on actual fact? i sincerely hope not!<br /><br />we get to see what appears to be numerous armed cops empty an equal amount of guns at 2 guys who only got armored torso's. that's a great idea; aim for the armor!...excuse me, but how about those big fat unmissable heads or their legs for crying out loud. or were there invisible tanks protecting them? were they from crypton?did i miss something here?<br /><br />this movie started out decent enough but after 20 minutes of shoot-out it really takes a turn to boringlane.<br /><br />and that documentary style didn't work for me either, but thats just something one finds likable or not.<br /><br />highly unbelievable stuff which makes it hard to see it through 'til the end.<br /><br />3/10 for the fine editing.
