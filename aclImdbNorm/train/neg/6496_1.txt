this movie was a disappointment. i was looking forward to seeing a good movie. i am the type of person who starts a movie and doesn't turn it off until the end, but i was forcing myself not to turn it off. <br /><br />theonly reason why i didn't turn it off was because i am a huge christian slater fan and i wanted to see him act in it. i was really speechless after i finished watching the movie. <br /><br />this movie was one of the worst movies that i have seen in my life. thank you christian slater for putting some humor into it. if you hadn't been in this movie i would of been bored out of my mind.<br /><br />i also agree that anthony hopkins needs to stick to acting. by the time the movie was over i didn't even get the plot. i was both confused and annoyed.
