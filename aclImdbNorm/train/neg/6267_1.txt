the acting in this movie stinks. the plot makes very little sense, but from what i gathered it's supposed to be about this scientist who develops the ability to turn people's personal items into tiny steel balls that then fly into their mouths and turn them into zombies (or blow their heads up, whichever). and the effects are lousy, too. most of the movie consists of bad music, with the actors dancing equally as badly to the bad music, interspersed with multiple boring sex scenes. this should be one of the worst things ever made, but for one thing. one element of shear brilliance that makes "nightmare weekend" stand above all others. and that special quality is the presence of george.<br /><br />george is the lovable interface device between the scientist's daughter, jessica, and the home computer security system. with his green hair and nose, balding scalp, and heart-shaped mouth, george is the guardian angel/confidant to jessica, who asks him for advice on how to meet guys in one of the most dramatic pieces of dialogue ever captured on celluloid. with his monotone synthesized voice, george tells jessica what percentages of males prefer women in white dresses, and also that hitch-hiking is the third best way to meet guys after discos and bars. of course, little jessica just can't seem to stay out of trouble, causing george to execute "emergency program code: protection jessica", which results in the violent death of jessica's would-be assailant via one of the aforementioned steel balls.<br /><br />kubrick was an utter fool for thinking he could give a computer personality using closeups of a red light. hal should have been represented by our friend george in order to better translate compassion for his eventual demise. the light and sound show at the end of "close encounters"? not bad, but how much better would that movie had been if the means of first communication with the aliens had been george the hand puppet. bishop, data, r2
