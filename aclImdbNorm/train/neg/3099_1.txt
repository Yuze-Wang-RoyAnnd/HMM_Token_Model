this movie is not just bad, not just corny, it is repulsive. something about daphne, about the creepy call-girl, about the whole damn (and i use the word literally) film radiates a grotesquery that would offend a brothel mistress. this film makes my skin crawl, makes me regret having reproductive organs, and makes me feel unclean.<br /><br />one of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept. a creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results, rather than the clich'e worst nightmare and the overdone twisted wish, is a truly fascinating film idea.<br /><br />thought: the reason why hobgoblins need to be killed before day is that they are attracted to bright lights. during the day, bright lights don't show up well, so they could go anywhere.<br /><br />count the hobgoblins: four hobgoblins drive out of the film studio, and yet at least nine of the pernicious plush-toys are killed throughout the course of the movie.<br /><br />discussion question: if you had a frigid, demanding, unappreciative girlfriend, would you enter garden-tool-combat with a military chunkhead? explain.
