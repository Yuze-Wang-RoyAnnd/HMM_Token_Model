one of the worst movies i've ever seen. acting was terrible, both for the kids and the adults. most to all characters showed no, little or not enough emotion. the lighting was terrible, and there were too many mess ups about the time of the day the film was shot (in the river scene where they just get their boat destroyed, there's 4 shots; the sheriff and dad in the evening on their boat, jillian and molly in the evening swimming, the rest of the kids in the daytime *when it's supposed to in the evening* at the river bank, and the doctor, beatrice, and simonton at night but not in the evening getting off their boat.) the best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff, cappy (although, there's a slip of character when the pulse detector *whatever that thing is when people die, it beeps* shows cappy has died, he still moves while it can still be heard beeping, and while the nurse extra checks his pulse manually, then it shows the pulse again, and then he finally dies.) i guess it's not going to be perfect, since it's an independent movie, but it still could be better. not worth watching, honestly, even for kids. might as well watch something good, like the lion king or toy story if you're going to see anything you'll remember.
