what i found so curious about this film--i saw the full 4 hour roadshow version, is how oddly dispassionate it is. for a film about 2 very charismatic men--castro and che, engaged in a gargantuan political struggle, it's almost totally devoid of emotional fire. the scenes between benicio del toro and demian bichir (who is at best a second level actor,with a slightly high pitched voice) have no drama or depth and basically come down to castro telling che: go here, go there, do this and that, with no explanation as to what effect or use this action will result in. odder still is there is an actor in the cast who has the requisite power to play castro--joaquim de almeida, but he's shunted aside in a minor part in the second half. without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers, the film becomes a dullish epic-length film about hairy, bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose or end. several of the reviews i've read showered praise on the work of director steven soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely. (one in fact spent more time talking about soderbergh's new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it's entirely in spanish with english subtitles.)this is an odd, odd thing to do since a) soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and b) it's no more than a competent job of work, with an unremarked upon nod to oliver stone's jfk in the black and white cut up camera-work when che visits new york. if you can imagine reds directed by andrew mclaglen instead of warren beatty, you'd get an idea of the dull competency of this movie.
