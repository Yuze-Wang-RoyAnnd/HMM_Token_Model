i wholeheartedly disagree with the other viewers of this wretched film. the only reason why i didn't rate it 1 for awful was due to the great talent of carmen miranda. the beginning and end are the best parents due to her gifted singing and dancing.<br /><br />the problem is with the rest of the picture. alice faye comes off quite hollow. don ameche has a great singing voice but with the wretched writing material, he comes off so terribly corny.<br /><br />the plot is a real stiff here with ameche assuming two parts as a song and dance man and a baron not happily married to faye.<br /><br />it seems that by playing the song and dance man, ameche's marriage gets a second change to reignite. some silly nonsense about the baron having to clear up business and being away allows him to play both parts.<br /><br />s.z. sakal is given little to do here and so his comedic gifts are not given the opportunity to shine. ditto for j. carrol naish who actually appears uncomfortable in his role.<br /><br />this is a chica chica boom bomb of a film.
