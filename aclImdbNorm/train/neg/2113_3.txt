brides are dying at the altar and their corpses are vanishing. no one knows why or who, but an investigative reporter (luana walters) notes that each bride was wearing a strange orchid and she goes to interview its creator, dr. lorenz (bela lugosi). now dr. lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping in coffins and injecting his elderly wife (elizabeth russell) with the fluid of young brides to keep her young.<br /><br />the corpse vanishes has an interesting premise and a short enough run time that it shouldn't be able to get boring. unfortunately, while it starts off quite well, it does start to drag before the halfway point and gets rather boring with its clich'es and predictable plot.<br /><br />there are some good things about it-bela lugosi is charming and evil and performs brilliantly; elizabeth russell is also a beautiful, suave, aloof and very creepy countess; and i'm always a fan of angelo rossitto. luana walters is also convincing as the reporter here.<br /><br />it maintains a bit of a gothic atmosphere and the sets are decent.<br /><br />but overall, it just didn't manage to hold my interest through the whole picture, and for that, i have to rate it poorly.
