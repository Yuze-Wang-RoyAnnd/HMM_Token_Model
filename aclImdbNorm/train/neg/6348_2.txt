utterly pretentious nonsense. the material is dull, dull, dull, and most of the cast wouldn't even have made understudies in allen's earlier films. and to have to listen to the unfunny will ferrell do his woody allen imitation makes me loathe the second-rate (though mysteriously popular) ferrell even more. it appears that the morose 70-year old allen should have knocked off work when the clock rang in a new century.<br /><br />i truly tried to get involved in the film, but it was just impossible; my snyapses couldn't fire that slowly. so, rather than doze off and kill the afternoon sleeping in an upright position i got up, left my wife and daughter in the theater, and went out to the car where i had a really good book to re-read (george bailey's great tome of 30 years ago, "germans.") the day turned out pretty well after all, no thanks to woody.
