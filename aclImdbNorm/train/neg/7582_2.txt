high heels are tricksy things. they can elevate women (or cross-dressing men) to newfound heights, put forward a sharp statement of style and bring a touch of fragile elegance. alternatively, they can be a perilous foot pain that will inevitably lead to trips, falls and ultimate tragedy. tacones lejanos is more of a disappointment trip than a stylish high riser.<br /><br />almod'ovar's mother-daughter drama is stylish for sure, but in terms of plot it's a tongue-tied and tedious affair full of confusing, complex characters that never fully engage or make sense. a few moments of comedy aside, tacones lejanos just isn't interesting. the best bit comes at the beginning in a marvellously macabre case of manslaughter orchestrated by a child. from this brilliant bit of black comedy things are looking up, but then the film comes to a heel.<br /><br />there's solid enough acting performances and there's some stylish, arty direction that you'd expect from almod'ovar, but otherwise tacones lejanos isn't an impressive piece of spanish cinema. with a story of murder, showbiz, femininity, fractured mother-daughter relationship and a character who is alternately a judge, a transvestite and a police informer this could have been a melodramatic powerhouse. instead it's poor. high heels stumbles for sure.
