ok. so it's a low-budget "film" (i used the quotes because it was shot in hi-8 video). the acting is universally horrid, the makeup is laughable (the blood looks like it came from sherwin-williams and i've seen more convincing bruises made from halloween ghoul kits), and the lighting generally looks like they used someone's borrowed toyota pickup to shine headlights on the actors.<br /><br />i might be able to forgive these low-budget traits if there were some actual content, if a movie made an attempt to tell a story. but this collection of video footage can boast of no plot, no real characters, and no momentum. it's a self-indulgent mess.<br /><br />and don't worry -- no spoilers here, 'cause there's absolutely nothing to spoil.
