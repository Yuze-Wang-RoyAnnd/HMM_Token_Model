born again is a sub-standard episode from season one. it deals with the subject of reincarnation and just doesn't fly. i've never been big on reincarnation and that could be part of my apathy toward this episode. it does reference the tooms case which is some nice continuation from the previous episode. but the positives end there. which is unfortunate because that takes place at the beginning of the episode. i think it's ludicrous that a dead guy would chose to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl. and he waits until the girl turns eight to start exacting revenge. there's even a serious lack of witty mulder & scully dialogue to keep the episode afloat. if you're into reincarnation, maybe this episode is up your alley. if you're not, then at least you can learn what bradycardia is.
