today, i visited an athenean cinema with my two kids (6 & 8 years old), payed 3 x 12 euros (about 45 us $ total) not to mention gas, popcorn & soda, was asked to return my 3d special glasses after leaving the theater and was "forced" to watch what could have been a great 3d movie masterpiece but only proved to be a sick "cold war like" propaganda movie, like none i have seen during the last 20 years... and this is supposed to be a movie for children... in heaven's name! <br /><br />ps 1: the average working greek makes no more than 850 euros a month (approxiamtely 1050 us $) <br /><br />ps 2 my kids liked it... but then again they are no more than babies >in greek: mora, morons > like the one who wrote the script & the others who made this "3d disgrace" happen.<br /><br />ps 3 3d animation is fantastic but who gives a ....!
