i think i agree that a lot of the comments here must be fake. even if the movie is not necessarily bad its definitely below average. "dark remains" is basically a ghost movie with a premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions haunting you. the movie starts off already with 2 stories loosely inter-webbed which even later are not tied together. a couple loses its child which is found slashed in its bed. they move to a country house to flee their past and guess what... the house is haunted, kind of. from here on dark remains starts off very slow with some scary moments indeed (the first ghost appearances are nice and the flashlight sequence also worked very good). ok, then... woman sees ghost of daughter, other ghosts of people died in accidents or suicides appear, man tries to solve secret of houses past, woman gets depressed, strange neighbors appear. its pretty much all been there, but the premise of it being their own emotions is nice, so you wait for the twist. there is no twist, you are just confused by a haunted house history story, the strange neighbor, a totally pointless creepy prison and the dead daughter thrown together with a photo-idea reminding me a lot of "the shutter". the end is ridiculous because when you start and end a movie this slow and with piano music its pretty lame to include some hoards of ghosts at once which look like a zombie flick, of course just to return to slow pacing and piano music. <br /><br />to make it short... dark remains could have been a nice scary ghost story if the script was not trying to go everywhere and arriving nowhere.too many stories mushed together which just don't make any sense and contradict in the basic atmosphere of the movie. and beside... please never use abandoned prisons again. its so worn off and in this case it even makes no sense at all. "hey, there is this creepy prison uphill, lets shoot there". i guess a lot of ingredients in dark remains were thrown in the mix like this.
