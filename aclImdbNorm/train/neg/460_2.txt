i was required to watch the movie for my work, so i didn't pay for it (on the contrary, i got paid), but i still found the movie to suck far more than average. the jokes were lame, the two lead actresses... well, to use the "first wives club" division of women's ages in hollywood, they are no longer in their "hot chick" age but more in their "district attorney" age. what angered me most about the movie was the main plot line, which pretty much completely plagiarized "beavis & butthead do america" (in which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to "do his wife", not realizing they're expected to assassinate her). all in all, a bland piece of crap.
