i'm going to go on the record as the second person who has, after years of using the imdb to look up movies, been motivated by nacho's film, the abandoned to create an account and post a comment. this was hands down the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire life. the plot was on the verge of non-existence, and none of the "puzzle-pieces" added up in any way whatsoever. the acting was laughable and the writing was embarrassing. how this film got backed and came to be is completely beyond me. the only saving grace i could find was anastasia hille's cunning and repetitive use of the f word. (and brilliant sound design) if i were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores i would be up against a difficult decision. i'm disappointed that i am unable to give it 0 stars.
