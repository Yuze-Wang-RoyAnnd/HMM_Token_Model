not that he'd care, but i'm not one of simon pegg's friends. if i was, there's a good chance we'd fallout if he continued to make dross like this. the trouble is, he found a successful formula as the bumbling, ordinary guy-next-door type in shawn of the dead, run fat boy run etc, but it's starting to wear thin. here his character has no discernible qualities, he's rude and obnoxious, and thinks he's funny when he frankly isn't. when transferred to new york from london (and i presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the atlantic), he proves equally out of place with his new colleagues. still, is it any wonder when amongst his jolly japes he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting an act of revenge for his boss. yet somehow, kirsten dunst starts to warm to him, even though he's done nothing nice. oh, and because he's a superficial male he falls for megan fox at first sight, possibly because her character is as shallow as his. it all makes for a predictable film conclusion, although i can't see any viewer expressing how this mirrored their life. the shame is that on paper this is a cast supposedly worth watching. pegg, though, plays himself, kirsten dunst seems to just go though the motions, creating no on screen chemistry, and megan fox isn't stretched at all. the one huge plus is miriam margolyes, as pegg's new york landlady - now if she had been on screen longer.....
