oh, come on people give this film a break. the one thing i liked about it was......... sorry, still thinking. oh yeah!!!! when john wayne came and shot up the the bad guys. oh, sorry, wrong movie, i was thinking of a better quality film. let me see now, i'm still trying to defend it. oh yeah, the chick that was from clueless was in it. don't put down stacy dash. i mean, we all make mistakes. but boy, stacy, you made a dooooosie.<br /><br />hey, one thing that has never been done in a western, even an all female cast, they actually hung a woman from the gallows. that might be a western first. even though her neck should have been broken and she survived the ordeal, still, you've got to give the director some effort for trying a western first. also, i've never seen a woman lynched from a horse in any western, although that didn't happen in this movie, i just thought i would give the director another idea for gang of roses#2, which should be made right after ed wood's bride of the monster #2. maybe that was what the makers of this film were going for. orginality, especially with an all african woman cast and an oriental cowgirl.<br /><br />heeey, if the makers of gang of roses want to make a sequel to this mess, you could have such slang like, "hey, don't you be takin about my homegirls" and "talk to the hand, baby, talk to the hand." you could also have a surfer dude type deputy marshal that says things like, "that gunfight was totally rad man, totally." you know things like that.
