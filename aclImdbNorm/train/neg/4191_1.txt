i have seen many a horror flick in my time, all of them absurdly bad, but none reach the depths that this piece of trash lowers itself to. this movie made me angrier and angrier as i watched it as i tried to wrap my head around exactly what this movie was about. now, after i've seen it, i understand - sort of - what was going on and why, but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable when you're watching it. yes, there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence, one-liners that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its characters ("the highway belongs to me...me!"), and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the "plot", but still you'll leave this movie feeling alone and taken advantage of, like a puppy who isn't wanted anymore and is left in a box by the side of the road. blech.
