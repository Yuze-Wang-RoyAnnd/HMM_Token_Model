i am partly a fan of miyazaki's work. i say "partly" because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant, and boring. sadly this film falls into the later category.<br /><br />this film suffers from the same fundamental problems as miyazaki's recent film "howl's moving castle". an intriguing premise is set up, but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it.<br /><br />the first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world the story is set in, and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold. from then on things go down hill. the middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinly-veiled eco-propaganda, and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of japanese animated films.<br /><br />overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators. what is left is something which is visually stunning (although sadly the version i saw was an nth-generation copy, with poor colour - which gives rise to the common myth that nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying), but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused.
