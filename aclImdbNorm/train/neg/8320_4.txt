after watching awake,i led to a conclusion:director and screenwriter joby harold made awake with the intention of laughing at the spectator,for the simple fact the movie is full of ridiculous elements.awake has a lot of plot holes and it is full of absurd and ridiculous elements(for example,the hospital uniform the spirit of the main character uses...did the ghost of a doctor leave it in the floor ?).the concept behind this movie is slightly ingenious but all the plot holes and the absurd things make of this a stupid and crappy film.with the exception of the great lena olin,all the actors bring bad performances.hayden christensen has zero expressions and the same applies for jessica alba.the extraordinary actor terrence howard is enormously wasted on his role.awake makes a laugh of the spectator.it's so ridiculous and full of absurd things that it's impossible to take it seriously.my recommendation is:skip this crappy movie.
