i blind bought this movie and am pretty upset that i paid as much as i did but i would say that it's at least worth a rent for some cool deaths and laughable acting. it is not a good movie in any way but i must say that i was pretty darn entertained. i guess it could be called so-bad-it's-good.<br /><br />as i said, the acting is awful, i feel like i could have done a better job showing, at least, any emotion. the story is nothing new and has been done better. i guess i just have a soft spot for any carnival-esquire type film. i would say rent this or download it but definitely don't buy it. it is not worth more than one watch.
