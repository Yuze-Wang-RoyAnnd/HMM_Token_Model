there are some elements that save this movie from being a total catastrophe, but are overshadowed with bad acting, plot holes, deus ex machina thrown ins, stupid dialogs, weak script, and predictable clich'es...<br /><br />what we have here is a horror movie with a storyline that goes nowhere for most of the time. a group of unlikely heroes including a black guy that gets it first (yeah, that clich'e seems to be still very much alive even in finland), seem to have trouble trying to exit a mysteriously empty hospital. there are shrieking ghosts (very imaginative), zombies (at one point i thought at least they didn't use zombies, but they came), and finnish glam-rock band with demonic make-up on, getting in their way. there is also some time-shift doodle present, but it adds up nothing to the storyline. autistic girl and a hobo seem to have some deeper understanding of a situation, but they never spell it out to the viewer, or their confused friends. their lines consist only of profound life lesson thoughts like: "what happens will happen..." or "light can't live in the darkness..." or the ominous "i need a red crayon... red crayon." so all this characters (including worried father and sweet doctor in distress types) end up doing is running around them dark floors, and from or mistakenly to the demons. occasionally a ghost or a group of zombies show up, and if it seems a demon keyboardist can't spot a group of six people coming towards it, waving a flashlight and conversing, it was just pretending. and apparently this demon can break through walls without much hassle, but opening elevator door is beyond its capabilities.<br /><br />in the end we even get a "it was all a dream" sequence twist. or maybe it wasn't. oh, boy i wish this movie was, and that kind that makes time seem to move faster so it all plays out in just 10 minutes or so...
