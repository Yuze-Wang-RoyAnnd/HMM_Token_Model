from the beginning of the movie i had a feeling like its a movie about another jason's from friday the 13th. and it is... dispute that the movie starts interesting. but as the times goes by its just a pointless movie about muted, supernatural, silent serial killer. i mean he goes under the guy's bed without making any sound, not seen by anyone. he was supposed to be blind after failed execution but he walks and kills people like he used to. i'm tired of it. for me it's all over the same thing.<br /><br />in another words - unreal. too many mistakes and confusing information.<br /><br />well scene with tide up woman looked impressive but just at first time :} for that and for intriguing intro 2 stars.
