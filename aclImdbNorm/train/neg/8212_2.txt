i've read all the comments on this film. i am a great admirer<br /><br />of the dalai lama. as such, i read the book upon which this<br /><br />film was based. the movie is an ugly and demeaning fictionalization of the truth. i do not criticize it for<br /><br />altering small details or events for dramatic purposes; it is<br /><br />not a documentary. but the script changes the impact, reaction,<br /><br />realities, and changes in every main character. it vastly alters<br /><br />the real relationship between harrar and the young dalai lama. <br /><br />from the ridiculous rivalry for a tibetan woman (which demeans<br /><br />the culture of tibet) to harra's music box gift, to harrar's<br /><br />change of heart, everything about this movie is false - except<br /><br />for the amazing photography. i understand that the shots of the<br /><br />potala (the palace) were smuggled out of tibet. however,<br /><br />changing a real story about the relationship between two people,<br /><br />one of them very important to this world, in order to build up a<br /><br />movie star is sad
