this "film" is a travesty. no, wait--an abomination. no, wait--this is without a doubt the absolute worst film ever made featuring beloved characters created and established by other actors.<br /><br />i thought "inspector clouseau" with alan arkin (!) instead of peter sellers was ludicrous and sacrilegious, but even daring to "remake" stan laurel and oliver hardy is asinine and money grubbing.<br /><br />mr. laurel and mr. hardy have been dead, respectively, since 1957 and 1965. why anyone would even begin to imagine that suitable updates for l & h would be in the persona of bronson pinchot and gailard sartain is beyond me. i tuned in fully expecting to be horrified and embarrassed and i certainly wasn't disappointed. everyone involved in this pathetic, moronic, disgrace should be blackballed from anything and everything associated with hollywood and film-making. avoid this movie at all costs--you have been duly warned.
