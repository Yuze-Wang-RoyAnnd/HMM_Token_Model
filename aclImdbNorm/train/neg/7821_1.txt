did the movie-makers even preview this before they released it? the script jumps from place to place without giving much explanation. the beginning doesn't clarify if its a prequel or not. it starts with superman's beginnings on earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie - but doesn't really alert the viewer of this. very confusing! superman himself is weak and in need of prozac. he is portrayed as a potential home-wrecker, a stalker, and someone who is clearly depressed and confused. this type of character rarely makes for an interesting hero. the ending is absolutely ridiculous. superman ending up in a hospital just made me want to kill him off myself. i'm seriously waiting for a snl skit where superman appears on maury povich and maury says, "the results are in - in the case of the child, superman, you are the father." to sum up - ok acting by this superman and kevin spacey, but horrible script. the movie is basically unwatchable.
