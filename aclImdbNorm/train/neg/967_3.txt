in 1988, paperhouse was hailed as a "thinking man's horror film." wow, you might say, sign me up. this thing is a mess. it features a one time young actress who has a range of like 1 to 2. g. headley with a bad british (dubbed) accent, and a story with no chills, thrills or spills.<br /><br />it isn't even interesting psycho-babble. one will only laugh at its cheap effects and long for a showing of leprechaun 5.<br /><br />the story involves a girl with glandular fever who escapes in her dreams. what you get isn't good horror, art house or even a decent after-school special. i found myself after the two hour point saying..where did my two hours go.<br /><br />the direction is uninspired and i wished it could even be pretentious...something interesting..it seems like the producers were on lithium.<br /><br />even in the dream world things are boring.<br /><br />a short no on this one.
