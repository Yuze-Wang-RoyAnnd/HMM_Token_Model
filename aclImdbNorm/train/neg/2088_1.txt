what an awful show. science fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality. it shocks me that something exceptional like firefly lasts one season, while garbage like the battlestar galactica remake spawns a spin off. this spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show. the acting is juvenile and uninspired. the characters are cardboard clich'es of everything that has ever been in a bad sci-fi series. the story is bad. the dialog is worse than a prime time soap opera. the direction is shoddy and the sets are awful. caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and a waste of effort. this is one spin off that should have never been made.
