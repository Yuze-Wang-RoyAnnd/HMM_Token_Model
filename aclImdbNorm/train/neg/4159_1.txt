in this strangely-lackadaisical apocalypse, the world suffers from a dual plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be too worried about it in this grade-z film which bares less resemblance to sheridan le fanu's famous short novel than my mother's lasagna recipe. bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it. the plot, and i use that term loosely, involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with "the general," whose daughter is missing, at a church to kill a vampire who, very conveniently, happens to be traveling with the father and daughter. i must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor. the film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested. anyone older beware.
