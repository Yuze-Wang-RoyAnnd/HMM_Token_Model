this movie was a long build-up with no climax. people whom refer to the swordfight in the end as great must either be out of their minds, or have none. way too often this movie got soft. i am not saying that soft movies are bad. but no matter how fond you are of sugar it should have no space on a t-bone steak. this movie was supposed to be about vengeance for crimes committed against a culture, but it ended up being a petty bar-brawl. and there was only one of them who actually knew what a sword was; tim roth's character (and yes, he plays him well). rob roy was a weak "hero" with no knowledge of how to use a sword, and the way he "won" was a disgrace. as a drama this movie had it's periods, but the best performance in it has to go the nature of scotland. this is one tad breath short of being termed as "soap" in my book.
