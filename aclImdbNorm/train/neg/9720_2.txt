this movie is just boring.<br /><br />it tries to copy some effects borrowed to a creative director like jeunet in "am'elie poulain", but it is too much. the dialogs are pretty bad, some of the worst i have ever heard, guillaume canet is not convincing (i have almost never found him very convincing), his father in the movie plays very badly, the story is dumb, the ending is... stupid.<br /><br />i think i have not dislike a movie so much since "le pacte des loups" (brotherhood of the wolf) from christophe gans (and i watch / see about 80-100 movies a year), but at least that movie had some action and lots of good actors.<br /><br />i had never commented here (only rated), and when i saw the rating and the comments, i thought i had to write something down.<br /><br />i guess we won't have problems to sell the dvd we were offered : not such a bad movie in our (large) collection !!!<br /><br />i am open minded (i watch sf, westerns, drama, comedies, silents, horror, fantasy... movies !), but this movie was so boring that i felt like i had lost one hour and a half.
