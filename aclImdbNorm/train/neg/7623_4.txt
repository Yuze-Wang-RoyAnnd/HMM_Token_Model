this little show is obviously some stupid little prequel/spin off of the original series.<br /><br />compared to the live action series this show is utter crap. the live action show had intelligent jokes and story lines. while the animated series is basically a toned down bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest but i think maybe kids deteste this crap.<br /><br />the storyline in every episode is basically just sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it. thats basiclly the idea every episode. the most bizarre episode was when sabrina uses magic to become gem and gem to become sabrina. so then gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvery to become her slave. this then leads to a bizarre yet rather interesting scene were gem says "just adore me for now" and harvey get down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like shes a god. (which is quite right since he's her mind control slave) but this stupid spin-off is not worth the time or the effort.
