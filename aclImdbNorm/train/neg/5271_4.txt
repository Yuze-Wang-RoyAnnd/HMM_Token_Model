a bickering, american family, vacationing in the west, discover a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. little do they know that this ghost town was once a test site for nuclear bombs, and a deadly presence is stalking them. i generally love mystery-horror films like this. "cube", spielberg's "duel" and "the birds" are all great examples of movies that give no answers but nonetheless leave us intrigued and wanting more. apparently, "disappearance" writer/director walter klenhard was trying to make just that kind of film, and whether or not he succeeded is up to the viewer. i personally think he got about half way there, then the film just sunk.<br /><br />the actors are all kind of just "ho-hum". their not especially bad but we as an audience never really feel their fear and they react to situations in unrealistic ways. is anyone else absolutely sick of characters just walking out off to investigate strange sounds?!?!? at least give them some kind of justification for doing so!?!?!?<br /><br />as far as made-for-tv films go it's an above average fair for sure. director klenhard should be commended for really milking the desert environment for everything it offered and some of the setting were striking. there's a really cool scene where two characters find an old nuclear test ground were the sand had been completely melted to glass for as far as the eye could see. i wonder if that was real
