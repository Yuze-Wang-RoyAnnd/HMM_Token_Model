how do i begin? this movie is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen .it has no redeemable qualities .i just sat through this movie and it was a struggle.it failed to get even a single smile on my face.i find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film. i felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor. the only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack, i'm pretty sure thats the reason i wanted to see this movie in the first place.i will wrap this up as i am going to try and forget the time i just wasted with this piece of crap. i will leave you with this warning. do not watch this film ,it sucks.
