woody harrelson and wesley snipes team up as hustlers on the basketball court. okay, that sounds all right there. it leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story. but no such event took place in the many following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt of a film. this movie became redundant, retarded, and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had gone by. woody harrelson played one of my favorite t.v. characters, woody from cheers, and i was looking forward to seeing him in this movie. but after seeing his " acting performance " i have come to the conclusion that he should stay playing dumb country hicks who bartend. his acting was as dull and poor as the movie. another actor in this unreal film was rosie perez. i have liked movies with perez before, but i have decided that the reason i have enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and didn't have that many speaking lines ( do the right thing ). but now in white men can't jump she was made a central character with many lines, thus meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and whining voice. so after seeing this film ( term used loosely ) and hearing rosie perez for much more than appreciated i can now say that i'm a white man and i'm getting ready to jump . . . off a twenty story apartment building.
