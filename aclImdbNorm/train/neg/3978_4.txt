when in rome is a definite improvement on getting there. getting there i found too predictable, contrived and slow, and to this day i still consider it as the olsen twins' worst. however, while when in rome isn't a terrible movie, it's not a great one either. if i had to sum it up in one word, i would say passable. it is good fun for teenagers, but i think adults won't find much to go on.<br /><br />when in rome does have its good points. mary kate and ashley olsen are actually quite decent actresses, certainly very pretty as well. i will admit when i was 10 or so, i really liked them, and in general i kind of like them still. and i have enjoyed some of their movies like passport to paris and new york minute. back on target, both girls don't do that bad a job, in fact they are very appealing. plus their outfits are to die for, and the scenery of rome is absolutely breathtaking. the soundtrack ain't half bad either.<br /><br />however, where the film is brought down is in the plot and the script. the script is on the most part clich'ed and has hints of deja vu. the plot, like most of the mary kate and ashley movies, is very predictable, and anyone familiar with any other of the olsen twins' work, will find some rather unoriginal elements to it. most of the characters are cardboard thin, and you don't learn very much about them, and sometimes the pace is uneven. sadly, the breathtaking scenery is spoilt by rather slapdash camera work, that looked rushed constantly.<br /><br />all in all, does have its good points, and certainly watchable. however, for my taste, it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff. 4/10 bethany cox
