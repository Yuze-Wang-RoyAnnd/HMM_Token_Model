anyone who is a sucker for 1920s jazz, 1920s dress, the charleston, and ultra-swanky yachts (e.g. me, on all counts) will want to like this movie. but the sad fact is that that's all there is. the plot is banal and obvious, the acting mostly either awful or playing to the farcical side of the goings-on, and when the whole thing's over there is not much left but the impression of mirrors and smoke. this is a beautifully made bad movie.
