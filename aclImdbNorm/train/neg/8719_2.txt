well here i go with another b industry movie. it's sad enough to see some badly made films but i don't care if a b industry or c industry produces the film. show some effort in your work. the characters are really bad. the acting isn't in question in this one (surprise), but plot is. how can a tight-knit squad witness two of their fellow soldiers butchered, and then go on as if nothing happened. what sickened me was how the writer even threw in the remaining members a scene where they joke about how nice the doctor's ass was. give me a break.
