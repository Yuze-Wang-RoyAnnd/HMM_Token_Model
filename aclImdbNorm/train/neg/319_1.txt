a friend of mine bought this film for lb1, and even then it was grossly overpriced. despite featuring big names such as adam sandler, billy bob thornton and the incredibly talented burt young, this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole. it uses tired, bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as sandler talks to the audience, and seemingly pointless montages of 'hot girls'.<br /><br />adam sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women. when the ship's resident comedian - the shamelessly named 'dickie' due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender - is presumed lost at sea, sandler's character shecker gets his big break. dickie is not dead, he's rather locked in the bathroom, presumably sea sick.<br /><br />perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time.
