the writing of the journalists and the required over eager reckless press officer and sobbing grandma was ham-fisted and clich'e ridden.<br /><br />i cant blame the actors, but surely someone must have said "are you joking i cant say this!"<br /><br />this episode had a press perspective and police perspective, while the police perspective was standard enough, the press perspective and characterization was overdrawn exaggerated and at points insultingly unbelievable.<br /><br />i notice that this was an hbo co production, if so then perhaps the sledgehammer stereotypes can be explained in that light,<br /><br />i was completely cringing during the press conference scene. it lacked any credibility and did not remotely ring true. 40 minutes into the first episode and i am still waiting for the suspense.<br /><br />skip five daysthis. the 2008/9 production with these characters is far better and more suspenseful even if the crime is over the top.<br /><br />this story had unforgivable moments which can only be described as staggeringly unbelievable.<br /><br />for a press officer to start a press conference without an investigating officer present to take press questions.<br /><br />so unbelievable it felt like amateur hour.<br /><br />i then began looking for journalists called "scoop" and for perry white to make an appearance.<br /><br />i saw the 2009 hunter before "five days"made it to australia, not realizing it was a prequel and was looking forward to bonneville and mcteer going around again.<br /><br />head shakingly awful.
