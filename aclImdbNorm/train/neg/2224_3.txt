i first saw this when i was around 7. i remembered what i believed to be a vague outline of what took place. turns out now, 15 years later, that i remembered everything with great accuracy because it seems the writers never got beyond making an outline to the story. there is no plot to this movie/cartoon. there is no character development, no back story, no character arcs, nothing. the good guys do things because they are good, while the bad guys do things solely because they are bad. one unintentionally hilarious part is when someone who you would think to be important dies and nobody cares in the least. they just shrug their shoulders and move on. there's barely any dialogue either. if you cut out the fight scenes and the running scenes, you lose 70% of the movie.<br /><br />watch this because you want to see some good animation and for no other reason. or if you like to look at scantily clad hot cartoon chicks (or scantily clad hot cartoon dudes).
