the plot it's not so original. if someone saw "l'ultimo bacio" there's nothing new. a wealthy family in rome living everyday life that's is boring and false, with everyone asking to others what they think about them. really boring after an half of hour because it's simple to understand where the story is going to finish. this because it's simple to see the moralistic view of muccino in this movie, so even the hardest parts seem normal. to summarise in the first 2 minutes of the movie it would be enough and the aim of the movie were already said. the family saw from a 30 years old, i don't like to see movie that want to show the reality but for be coherent to his thoughts has to push more than the normal the situations. really good how muccino put the camera in the right place moving with the carathers and it's the only reason that bring me not sleeping in the cinema though always in the movie scream from the begining. perhaps it could be good to see the family how they are in reality and not put the blame to something out of it. morante was intense and great as usual but unfortunatly on a bad movie!
