too much of something borrowed grade b-<br /><br />super bowl sunday is one of the slowest days at movie theaters every year. because of this, movie studios tend to avoid releasing bigger budgeted films that weekend. every few years a studio releases a counter-programming female skewing movie (2001's "the wedding planner") to compete with the big game. this super bowl weekend similarly titled "the wedding date" will try to find success and attract viewers not watching the game. <br /><br />sick of people feeling sorry for her, single-woman, kat ellis (debra messing, tv's "will and grace") hires male escort nick ( dermot mulrony, "about schmidt") to pose as her boyfriend for her sister's wedding in london. her family has been giving her a hard time about her not being married, and her ex- fianc'e of seven years, who dumped her without a reason, is the best man. to make him jealous kat parades nick around her ex to make him see what he is missing. but ultimately nick helps kat realize that she can open up, and let someone love her.<br /><br />the film borrows too much from similar wedding movies. it is almost a carbon copy of 1999's "picture perfect" and mixes in scenes similar to "the wedding planner" and "my best friends wedding". the movie also has a reverse "pretty women" theme going for it, and knowing her audience, the director makes clever references to that and other films.<br /><br />"the wedding date" has all the clich'ed elements of a typical wedding movie, there is the stereotypical overbearing mother (holland taylor, "legally blonde"), and practically plagiarized wedding speeches by the family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal dinner. the twist at the ending has been done before, but it was something that wasn't completely expected. the real reason why kat was dumped comes as a surprise and changes the direction of the film for the last half hour.<br /><br />even though "the wedding date" is predictable, it is able to stand on its own. debra messing, in her first lead role, proves she can be charming and funny. dermot mulrony has great chemistry with debra messing, but most of his dialogue was too corny and unrealistic. he is able to make best of what he is given, and be able to salvage the character. <br /><br />by the use of many clever puns (often sexual), the film is actually funny. although primarily a chick-flick the film has components everyone can enjoy. the feel good story, and humor make it the best date movie released in a long time.
