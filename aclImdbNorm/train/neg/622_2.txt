this movie is so aggrivating. the main character looks like he's 35 and i've seen scrawny beanpoles with more balls than this guy. the plot twists are so predictable its not even worth watching for the humor factor.<br /><br />also some of the worst dialogue i've heard in 3 years, "lets go find a small animal to torture".<br /><br />ugh.....i can't even continue, don't watch this pile of garbage, it was made in 8 days.<br /><br />the one highlight is the drunk dude calling the main character a faggot for drawing pictures.<br /><br />2 out of 10, unwatchable
