i should preface this by stating that i am a dolph lundgren fan. the man turns out some of the funniest action clich'es imaginable and detention is probably my personal favorite. *spoiler* even though there is no such thing as a dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with: a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a harley with a sub-machine gun, through a high school hallway and the kid wins? good game, the oscar goes to detention. dolph, if you're reading this, thanks for the laughs, old friend.<br /><br />in summary: terrific movie that is a guaranteed laugh. i recommend inviting some friends over for this and forcing them to sit through it. hilarious.
