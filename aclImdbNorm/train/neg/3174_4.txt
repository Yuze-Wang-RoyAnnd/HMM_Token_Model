jeff lowell has written & directed 'over her dead body' poorly. the idea is first of all, is as stale as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cake.<br /><br />minus eva longoria parker there is hardly anything appealing in this film. eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance.<br /><br />paul rudd looks jaded and least interested. lake bell is a complete miscast. she looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance. jason biggs is wasted, so is lindsay sloane.<br /><br />i expected entertainment more from this film. sadly, i didn't get entertained.
