...for one of the worst swedish movies ever...forgive me for being dull.<br /><br />first of all i haven't seen the first one (i was bored that's my reason for watching the 2nd before the 1st one), well i hope the first one is better than this, it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange plot changes, for the people that have seen this and think 4/10 is high (belive me so do i), but it made me laugh a few times, because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea, what's next "det sjunde inseglet ii". sequels not based on novel or book doesn't turning out great to often, and this is a perfect example of one.<br /><br />ok i'm gonna be honest with you: i did laugh a bit, it got a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor. but don't buy it, rent it. just let some other idiot do it or download it.<br /><br />4/10 this movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughed out already...
