just finished this movie... saw it on the video shelf and being a nick stahl fan i just had to rent it. in all honesty, it probably should have stayed on the shelf. the concept was an interesting one and there were several fairly smart twists and turns but somehow i guessed almost all of them before they came along. and the movie just went a little too far in the end in my opinion... if you have to suffer through a viewing of it you'll see what i mean!<br /><br />on a positive note, nick stahl's acting was great (especially considering what he had to work with). eddie kaye thomas was also good but he always plays the same type of character... too much paul finch from "american pie" coming through for my liking.<br /><br />and finally, the worst part of this movie has to be january jones' emotionless performance... i guess a pretty face really is all that matters in hollywood.
