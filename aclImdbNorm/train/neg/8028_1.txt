please! do not waste any money on this movie. it really is nothing more than a boring german blair witch ripoff made by some high school kids. i couldn't finish watching it, and usually i like watching all kinds of b-movies. how on earth could they find a distributor for it?!!! funny however: check out wikipedia for "dark area". the guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind. maybe he got loads of money from the producers. money that should have been spend on actors, camera and editing. even that wouldn't have helped, since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film. unfortunately "dark area" has already gotten too much attention. please, director, producer and author of this movie, stop making movies like that...you are not doing yourself a favor. the world would be a better place without this film.
