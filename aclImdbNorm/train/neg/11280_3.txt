this film is about a man's life going wrong. his business is failing, and he cannot impregnate his wife despite multiple attempts.<br /><br />the plot is complete chaos. it simply does not make sense. in fact, nothing in the film makes sense. the story is so poorly told that i simply could not understand it. it is a shame, because the sets and costumes are done well, and are visually stimulating enough. the shots are well composed throughout the film. however, these redeeming features still cannot make up for the bad plot and poor story telling. i am amazed by the big names who agreed to star in this film. it is such a waste of their talents. this film is very bad. avoid it!!
