i've seen many of guy maddin's films, and liked most of them, but this one literally gave me a headache. john gurdebeke's editing is way too frenetic, and, apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object, does nothing but interfere with the actors' ability to communicate with the audience.<br /><br />another thing i disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than maddin's earlier works--though his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity. this one seemed more like harshness for harshness' sake.<br /><br />as i'm required to add more lines of text before imdb will accept my review, i will mention that the actor playing "guy maddin" does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well.
