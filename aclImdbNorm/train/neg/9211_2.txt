this film reminds me a lot of the anti-drug films of the 50's and 60's due to the fact that it was made by people that have obviously never experienced the social evil that they are warning us about. tom hanks and his buddies are "role playing", but there are no dice, lots of candles, and then you are just swept away in a bad montage showing hanks falling for the lady in the group. quite funny but misguided. i wonder how many poor kids had their d&d stuff destroyed, and were told that the use of their imagination was the road to destruction. as a film it's basically an after school special, bad acting (although hanks does show some of his talent) and relationship talks, and no one seems to be having any fun. it seems these films have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the road to adultism, which is more serious, apparently, and requires you to buckle down and do the things everyone else does. despite my vote of 2, this is worth watching due to its unique genre, scare films, which i personally find quite funny.
