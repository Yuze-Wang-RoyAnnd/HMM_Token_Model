... and in *no way* as clean, logical, and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired hollywood cliches.<br /><br />i'm 27, and i've spent 16 years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. like the main character in the film, i was successful mainly because of logic : because i kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality, and to know what was really going on and what wasn't. in the end, i was really successful because of medication, by the way, but i certainly escaped madness because i knew before i took medication the difference between what was real and what wasn't.<br /><br />so, i feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud. not only does it cheat with the main character's story (who wasn't faithful to his wife, who was bisexual - something really important here), but mostly, it shows a comforting, tamed view of schizophrenia - which is entirely missing the point.<br /><br />schizophrenia is a mind structure, not a disease. a schizophrenic *isn't* a "normal man with a disease", it's someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people : for him, things like time, space, and people's personalities aren't solid things. he feels it can be bent, it can change, it can mutate, and maybe even disappear. to cope with this, a schizophrenic has a rich, very imaginative inner world which "normal" people don't expect - but he's trapped in it because he can't relate with most people, and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank, delusive dead end.<br /><br />this is very different to what's depicted in this ridiculous "cure", tear-jerking movie. it should be violently frightening. people other than the main character should appear strange, weird and absurd, like in lynch's "eraserhead", for example. there should be *really* impressive, weird, gross hallucinations, because that's what schizophrenia is all about. it's not about *details*.<br /><br />i mean, watch "naked lunch", "lost highway", read p.k. dick's "martian time-split" or "ubik", do watch "the cell", "perfect blue", "dark city", or play "american mcgee's alice" on pc, and you may have a vague idea of what it's like. don't watch the "feel good" movie of the month, with banal situations, cleaned characters and visuals, and stupid plot tricks. "the cell" is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic's mind, his visions and his inner consistency - it's violent, weird, confusing, and very, very scary.<br /><br />once again, schizophrenia isn't about details, it's not a neat, tame trick played to you. it jumps in your face and won't let you go : walls fall apart, people turn into strange hostile creatures, you feel like you go backward in time, you're not sure you're who you think you are, everything feels... strange, unnatural. believe me, this is much much more than what's depicted in this soap-like melodrama
