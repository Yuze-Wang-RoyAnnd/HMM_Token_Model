i can't understand why so many peoples praised this show. twin peaks is one of the most boring titles i have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />now i have seen all season 1 episodes, and seeing season 2 episode 1. simply i can't take this show anymore.<br /><br />1) where is the proper induction in criminal investigation?<br /><br />in season 1, there was a scene that agent cooper throws stones to a bottle. can you guess why he did that? he just want to identify murderer by doing this 'joke' while mentioning supernatural ability given by tibet dream. wow!!!<br /><br />2) there are too many unnecessary scenes in this show.<br /><br />for example, season 2 started with a 'funny' scene that a dumb old man serves agent cooper with a cup of milk while cooper are laying down on the floor.( he got the gun shoots in his belly already. ) this old man is doing nothing but saying some dumb comments. that's all.<br /><br />this scene is really boring and even long ( 3 min 30 sec.... it's like hell. )<br /><br />i would read some comic books rather than see this show anymore.
