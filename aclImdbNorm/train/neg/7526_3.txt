this is high grade cheese fare of b movie kung fu flicks. bruce "wannabe" lee is played by bruce li...i think. of course, let's show quick clips of bruce and do closeups of his eyes and if you quint at the right angle during a certain time of the day during the winter solstice, it kind of looks like bruce. you'll laugh in awe at how the film splicing isn't very good, but some cool deleted scenes from enter the dragon are thrown in the mix. according to the movie, bruce lee was killed by a dart while hanging from a helicopter. of course, they think this can excuse bruce li for trying to be bruce even though his character is supposed to be bruce's brother (who for some reason still mimes bruce's gestures and fighting style - very poorly). see bruce go one-on-one with the cowardly lion. the props department stopped by kay-bee, you see. bruce also finds nothing wrong with savagely beating up a crippled man. towards the end, the director decided "let's throw a flashback" for a scene just shown 3 minutes ago!! they must've thought that only one-celled organisms with attention deficit disorder could fully understand this film.<br /><br />
