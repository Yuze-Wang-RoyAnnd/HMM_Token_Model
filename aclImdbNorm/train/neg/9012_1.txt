yesterday i saw the movie flyboys and my girlfriend told me it was the worst movie she's ever seen... since i thought it was pretty awful as well it got me thinking - which film was the worst film i had ever seen and this was the only film that came to mind.<br /><br />unfortunately it was a couple of years since i've seen it but i remember the horribly miscast dean cain as cocky military man (pretty boy cain doesn't do cocky very well). the strange deal with the cgi-helicopter when it would probably be cheaper to rent a chopper than to hire some cgi-guys to make it, but my guess is that they found the chopper as a free sample for some cgi program or the producer's son liked to play with his new computer. and how did it look?? awful. and when the dragon charges through the corridors of the complex then reuse the same shots over and over - looks very cheap.<br /><br />avoid this movie - it is truly awful...
