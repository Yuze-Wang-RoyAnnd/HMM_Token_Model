stephen king adaptation (scripted by king himself) in which a young family, newcomers to rural maine, find out about the pet cemetery close to their home. the father (dale midkiff) then finds out about the micmac burial ground beyond the pet cemetery that has powers of resurrection - only of course anything buried there comes back not quite right.<br /><br />below average "horror" picture starts out clumsy, insulting, and inept, and continues that way for a while, with the absolute worst element being midkiff's worthless performance. it gets a little better toward the end, with genuinely disturbing finale. in point of fact, the whole movie is really disturbing, which is why i can't completely dismiss it - at least it has something to make it memorable. decent supporting performances by fred gwynne, as the wise old aged neighbor, and brad greenquist, as the disfigured spirit victor pascow are not enough to really redeem film.<br /><br />king has his usual cameo as the minister.<br /><br />followed by a sequel also directed by mary lambert (is it any wonder that she's had no mainstream film work since?).<br /><br />4/10
