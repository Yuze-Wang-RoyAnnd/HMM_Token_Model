this warning against anti-semitism is well-meant and may have had its purpose at the time, but it is made without the slightest notion of how to make a film. the director has no idea about mise-en-scene; the cast varies from bad till even worse.<br /><br />the great austrian comic hans moser is wasted. in his part he ends in an asylum for the crazy, that is designed as a set from das kabinett des dr. caligari; one wonders whether the makers had all their mental capabilities.<br /><br />the restored copy i saw (dutch filmmuseum) gives the impression that some scenes were not put into the right place, but may be the original editing was bad as well.
