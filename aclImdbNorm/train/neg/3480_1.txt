this movie is terrible. terrible. one of the worst movies ever. i cannot even imagine gigli being worse that this. previews made us say "no", but then looking for something amid the dreck out there right now, we decided to go ahead and give it a shot.<br /><br />stupid us.<br /><br />affleck is not an actor. he's an image and can look good with explosions, but not even the kind bruce willis got in "die hard". if he stripped his shirt and ran around fighting bad guys, it would be a comedy.<br /><br />the best part was catherine o'hara -- she's always good. gandolfini flops again (if it weren't for the sopranos, he'd be washed up) like he did in "the mexican".<br /><br />affleck hogs every scene and as others have said -- no character has any motivation whatsoever for their actions. <br /><br />avoid this movie at all costs.
