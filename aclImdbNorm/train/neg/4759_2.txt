at the name of pinter, every knee shall bow - especially after his nobel literature prize acceptance speech which did little more than regurgitate canned, by-the-numbers, sixth-form anti-americanism. but this is even worse; not only is it a tour-de-force of talentlessness, a superb example of how to get away with coasting on your decades-old reputation, but it also represents the butchery of a superb piece. the original sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind. yes, it was a theatrical confection, and it is easy to see how it's central plot device would work better on the stage than the screen, but it still worked terrifically well. this is a michael caine vanity piece, but let's face it, caine is no olivier. not only can he not fill larry's shoes, he couldn't even fill his bathroom slippers. the appropriately-named caine is, after all, a distinctly average actor, whose only real recommendation, like so many british actors, is their longevity in the business. he was a good harry palmer, excellent in get carter, but that's yer lot, mate! give this a very wide berth and stick to the superb original. this is more of a half-pinter.
