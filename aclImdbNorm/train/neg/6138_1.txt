this movie was god-awful, from conception to execution. the us needs to set up a "star wars" site in this remote country? this is their premise? the way to gain access, the us concludes, is to win an obstacle course like cross-country race, where the winner can ask anything of the leader. and who better to win this race known as the "game" than a gymnast? of course! a gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission. and don't forget that his father was an operative. lucky for our hero, there happen to be gymnastic equipment in fortunate spots, like the stone pommel horse in the middle of a square (for no reason) amidst crazy town. perfect.<br /><br />but above and beyond the horrible, horibble premise, is the awkward fumblings of the romantic scenes, the obviously highly depressed ninjas whose only job seems to be holding a flag to point out the race path, and the worst climax ever. after winning the race, our hero puts forth the wishes of the us government. and lo and behold, all the effort was worth it, because the us gets its "star wars" site! huzzah! this is your triumphant ending?! wow.<br /><br />but still, being such a bad movie, it can be great fun to watch. the cover alone, depicting ninjas with machine guns, was enough to get me to rent this film.<br /><br />but if i were ever to meet kurt thomas (the gymnast-star) in real life, i would probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 1/2 twists in the layout position.
