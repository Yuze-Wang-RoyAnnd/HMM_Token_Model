don't see this movie. bad acting and stupid gore effects. a complete waste of time. i was hoping to see a lot of cool murders and hot chicks,instead the director depended on animal slaughter videos to shock you, the watcher. disgusting. the murders are pretty lame, basically strangulation. one woman he stuffs worms in her mouth, one he puts raw hamburgers on her face and strangles her. btk = btk broiler, burger king's "killer" new sandwich....ha ha. i don't think this movie relied too much on actual facts. i mean, he real btk killer didn't carry around a bunch of rodents, scorpions and worms..and oh yeah...a slaughtered cow head too. go figure.
