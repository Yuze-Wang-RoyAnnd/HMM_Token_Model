if you haven't seen the gong show tv series then you won't like this movie much at all, not that knowing the series makes this a great movie. <br /><br />i give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things make it kind of amusing that help make up for its obvious problems.<br /><br />1) it's a funny snapshot of the era it was made in, the late 1970's and early 1980's. 2) you get a lot of funny cameos of people you've seen on the show. 3) it's interesting to see chuck (the host) when he isn't doing his on air tv personality. 4) you get to see a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of weirdness just like you see on the tv show.<br /><br />i won't list all the bad things because there's a lot of them, but here's a few of the most prominent.<br /><br />1) the gong show movie has a lot of the actual tv show clips which gets tired at movie length. 2) the movie's story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is made up of just one plot point. 3) chuck is actually halfway decent as an actor, but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top 1970's flatness.<br /><br />it's a good movie to watch when you don't have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once. watch 20 minutes at a time and it's not so bad. but even then it's not so good either. ;)
