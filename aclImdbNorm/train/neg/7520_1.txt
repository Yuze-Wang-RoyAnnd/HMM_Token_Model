this movie proves that you can't judge a movie by the awesome artwork on the dvd cover. it also goes to show that you should learn more about a movie before you buy it (or get it for someone at christmas). the beginning of this movie actually looks somewhat promising. well, until you meet the characters. pumpkin jack (the old guy from down the street) brings the college co-eds a book full of witch's spells that he leaves at their annual haunted house (where the movie takes place). after that there is some drinking, fighting, and soft core porn. then the action of the movie finally takes place after over an hour.<br /><br />overall, hallow's end was predictable, unsuspensful, and reminiscent of a soft-core porn. this movie is probably best viewed with a group of friends who have nothing better to do, as it is a good movie to make fun of. and for first-time viewers, it is really fun making predictions of the order of people who die.
