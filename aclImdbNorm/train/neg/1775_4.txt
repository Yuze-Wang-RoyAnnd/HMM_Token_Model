based on the average short story by horror writer stephen king about so called 'sleepwalkers' ancient and immortal cat-like creatures that suck the life out of virgins in order that this energy may sustain them they have supernatural abilities- they can make themselves 'dim' which means they become invisible and can create subliminal mirages to fool people.they have been fleeing humans for century's we are told and have one by one been picked off till there are only two left.the film starts when a beautiful mother and her son arrive in a sleepy town, they are the last of the sleepwalkers and they are on the prowl for virgins to feed on. the mother sends her son out to enrol at the local high school so he can find a virgin, he does (madchen amick) and proceeds to try to get her alone so he can suck her dry. it is not made clear why the mother cannot seek out virgins herself- it would make things easier one would imagine as teenage boys are much more apt to follow a older beautiful woman to a secluded area than a teen girl follow a teen boy. however his plans are thwarted as the girl fights back, jabbing a pencil in to his ear. the police are called and the hunt is on!. the son is sick from his injuries and so the mother goes on the rampage killing cops left and right in her hunt for the girl who hurt her son and spouting some painfully unfunny one liners amidst the gore. finally the girl kills the mother- end of movie. this movie is rubbish!. the acting is variable, from the average brian krause to the excellent alice krige. the special effects are average,and showcase some early computer effects which is mildly interesting as it shows how far such things have progressed in such a short time. the direction is muddled and the film falls in to camp in places. the director seems unsure whether we are supposed to fear the sleepwalkers or sympathise with them and when in doubt allows the film to become hysterical. stephen king makes a mildly amusing cameo as an annoying gardener as does mark hamill, as a puzzled cop. alice krige seems to shoulder the film, her character is given depth and she gives an indication of what the film could have been with a better screenplay and better direction.
