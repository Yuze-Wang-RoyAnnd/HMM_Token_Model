the only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery. this movie was long and boring. the minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed. how many times can his boys take the lord's name in vain in this film being from a presbyterian background? it doesn't fit. i wished paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly, smirkish, selfish story of paul (brad pitt). so norm becomes a teacher and paul becomes a compulsive gambler who norm wants to rescue but doesn't-so what. it's very uninteresting. we see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by paul because of his native american girl. that was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real 'wild western'. what we only see is a sleepy town where the two minister's sons have nothing to do but 1. norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2.paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies. i'd rather watch a show about fishing that that film again-which will be never.
