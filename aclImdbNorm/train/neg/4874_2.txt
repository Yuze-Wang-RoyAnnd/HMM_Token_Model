too bad neither the animals or eddie murphy had anything to say worth saying. this movie is just bland.<br /><br />children's movie? well, if you're trying to get them to take a nap, then maybe. it's just 90 minutes of some eye-wrenchingly poor animal lip animation to quips that aren't funny. and the lip-sync'ing makes the old godzilla films look brilliantly done by comparison. meanwhile, eddie "pluto nash" murphy drones on with a suppressed understated delivery that is painful to experience. apparently, he's trying to modify his old manic persona, but to what? in short, all the magic and wonder of the 1967 original version is lost in this re-imagining, or whatever it is. a town wants to bully some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad stuff. no, really. and pluto nash can psycho-babble with them. things chain along with some stale jokes to a dull uninspired conclusion with no surprises.<br /><br />rent the '67 movie. or some old yogi bear cartoons.
