an executive, very successful in his professional life but very unable in his familiar life, meets a boy with down syndrome, escaped from a residence . both characters feel very alone, and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in life... with this argument, the somehow amelie-like atmosphere and the sentimental music, i didn't expect but a moralistic disgusting movie. anyway, as there were some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy), and the interpretation of both actors, daniel auteil and pasqal duquenne, was very good, i decided to go on watching the movie. the french cinema, in general, has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to life, opposed to the more stereotyped american cinema. but, because of that, it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending, with the impossible death of the boy, the charming tone, the happiness of the executive's family, the cheap moral, the unbearable laughter of the daughters, the guy waving from heaven as michael landon... really nasty, in my humble opinion.
