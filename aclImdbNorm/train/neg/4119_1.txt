i thank god i didn't go to cinema for this film. i would be very sorry for the money i gave. i saw it on tv and i couldn't beleive my eyes. i wonder if any film could be worse than this one. they spent millions of dollars to this film for nothing. awful acting and awful scenario. i think the other people who wrote comments are the man working from that film company ;) it's very big fiasco! in year 2000 can they still laugh at this kind of film? embarassing...
