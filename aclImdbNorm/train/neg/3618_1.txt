clich'e-ridden story of an impending divorce - or is it? - through the eyes of a 6 year-old child. corny dialogue, cardboard characters, stock situations, a red herring zombie sub-plot and, worst of all, absolutely no payoff, either emotionally or dramatically.<br /><br />does no-one teach creative writing any more? the true sign of a weak storyteller - when you cannot create any kind of satisfying denouement - just end the story. i'm compelled to ask, "what made you think this was a story worth telling in the first place!?" <br /><br />good, but wasted, debut by child actor anthony de marco - the rest of the cast was, at best, forgettable. and they wonder why no-one watches indie films! this is ninety minutes of my life i will never get back.
