in my opinion this movie advances no new thought. seems to me like taking a spear to a spear without looking to the side! the director seems to have an agenda! duh! i find that his rational is lacking there does not seem to be room for the alternative view. i for one am usually on the side of the naysayer but this movie lacks credibility as it relies on the fantastic observations of the man/woman on the street. really now if you wish to cr5eate a credible alternative to a creed held onto for 2000+ years you have got to make more of an effort allowing the other side to voice their beliefs. i'm not sure but at the beginning of the movie it felt like an attack on the cristian faith, i for one am a non believer, but allow for the beliefs of others, and would not wish no ridicule them but try to understand and tolerate.
