this show is one of the worst shows of all time! absolutely no original jokes and they're always a year late. like in 2009 they will finally say something about michael vick's dogfights. all of the cast members are people who wanted to be on s.n.l but had to go to the lowest of the low, mad tv.its an hour of mad magazine jokes witch aren't funny to begin with, told by terrible john stewart wanna bees. so if you have any problem tell me id love to hear the opinion of the 3 people who watch this show. family guy put it well "osama bin ladin was hiding in the one place no one would look, the cast of mad tv. there is a reason why no one watches the show.
