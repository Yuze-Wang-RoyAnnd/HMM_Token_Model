omg this was the most painful experience of my life watching this. i could even finish it what is happening to nick. their best thing on teen nick is drake and josh and thats about to go off air. the kids songs are kinda of annoying and the so are the kids. my little sister wanted to watch the show because she likes anything that comes on disney or nick usually but after finish watching this show she said " one of the worst shows that i have ever saw so boring." my little brother actually fell asleep i envy him. in short if your 3yrs old with no brain activity you'll enjoy this show otherwise change the channel now.
