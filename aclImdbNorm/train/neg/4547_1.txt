the movie was terrible!!! easily the worst movie i have seen in the past few years. one of those movies i will be able to tell people for the next three years that it was the worst movie i can think of. thank you for giving me an answer to that burning question "what is the worst movie you have seen?" answer: celestine prophecy. trust me...i read the book, enjoyed the message and was excited to see the movie, but then, they treated the audience like we are r*tarded. there is no story and the story that is there is crippled by too much magic and coincidence. it is too bad they have to spell out the nine prophecies and can't simply weave them into a story that is entertaining to follow. they didn't spend any time on character development and it was easy to not care if any character died. it was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stuck around until the end of this incredibly boring movie. the book is pretty boring too but i enjoyed the parallels that could be seen in everyday life while you read the book. the film does not offer the same opportunity and i would suggest not seeing it if you want to continue to hold the words of the book close to your heart. don't see this movie. trust me.
