well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview, else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie. i mean haven't we had enough of this yet? scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious! the plot sucks, and the acting is the worst i've seen. (only godzilla can compare, which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst i've seen in the cinema with this one.)<br /><br />there is so many plot holes in the story, and the girls are so alike, that you don't even now who has been killed, and who has not. (and you don't care.) the only of them i knew in advance was denise, and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie.<br /><br />stay as far away from this movie as possible. (2/10)
