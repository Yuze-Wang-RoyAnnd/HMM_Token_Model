as far as i am concerned this silent version of the merry widow is the worst version ever made. there is no tenderness or love or spirituality about this version, it is all macabre, germanic, sinister nonsense. it reminded me of nazis falling in love; who cares?<br /><br />this silent version by von stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story. in this one we have leering john gilbert and his gross relative the prince lusting after this silly american actress, played by mae murray, possessed with a modern permed hairstyle and implausible feminist manner that threw me off again and again. i like my romances light and beautiful, with slow build ups; not harsh and sadistic like this one. and come on, those bee stung lips, get rid of them, girl!<br /><br />go see a live performance of the show if you would like to get a real idea of the sweetness of the original operetta by franz lehar. failing that, wait till tcm shows the jeanette macdonald - maurice chevalier sound version. it's much better.
