as a south african, it's an insult to think that someone was actually paid to produce this nonsense!<br /><br />despite the fact that the director was one of the writers for the original shaka zulu mini, this "addition" to the series is appalling! the original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist, leader and warrior. a man who played a large role in shaping the history of local tribes in south africa.<br /><br />the plot of this film, however, is nothing but hogwash, scraped from the bottom of the barrel by a writer that has failed to impress since the mid-nineties.<br /><br />while omar sharif and henry cele are good actors, what is david hasselhoff doing here, rescuing drowning slaves with his red buoy and bleached smile?<br /><br />i kept expecting blond, busty women to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen in their tiny red bathing suits, for no apparent reason. not that this would've been any more bizarre than the fantastical plot line that was probably dreamed up after 10 pints of beer at a fancy dress party, where someone's caveman costume inspired the writer to return to an african theme for his next "blockbuster".
