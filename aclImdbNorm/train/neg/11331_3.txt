with all due disrespect for this george stevens sr. "epic" of miscastings and misreadings, i can only wonder that the james dean "legend" could survive this outing, i submit that then-studio obeisances to bankable box office "giants" came a cropper of its own 'gigantismoses'. nor were rock and liz that much better off. let us just say that the televised "dallas" was the authentic "heir," even if contemp(tuous) latterday "texans" like lay and delay, not to mention our putative "president" of these here yewbenighted states of amurrika, perform a one-upsmanship of dastardly global dimensions. i never read edna ferber's original, but will lay odds it is head and shoulders superior to what got on screen herein. and all those well-paid, i would imagine, "supporting" actors of note and celebrity notwithstanding, "giant" is, to me at least, a midget of scant merit, never mind the promo campaigns.
