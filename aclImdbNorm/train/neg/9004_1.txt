nothing could have saved this movie, not even superman.<br /><br />ten years ago the special effects would have been amazing. better directing might have gotten some more feeling and better performances out of the actors. but nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it. plot holes, bad lines, terrible pacing, endless replaying of the same shots of a cgi dragon stomping through hallways... ugh.<br /><br />avoid this one at all costs.<br /><br />
