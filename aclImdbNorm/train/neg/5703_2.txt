everyone in a while, disney makes one of thoes movies that surprises everyone. one that keeps you wondering until the very end. in the tradition of pirates of the caribbean, this movie is sure to turn into a ghost, and kill and rape your village. it's terrible. if you want a mindless, senseless, predictable "action" movie, go right ahead. i believe that young kids might enjoy this, as they like it when good always wins. but me, i like movies where it's a toss up who's going to win. this movie never lets the bad guys have the upper hand. by the end, when th heroes are left in an "inescapeable" pit, you just know that they can get out. everything works out perfect for cage and his friends, he never has to think over a riddle or clue for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complex it is. see this movie if you want to see some impressive set designs, not if you want to see good acting, or a good film. go watch a superman movie, it would be much shorter, and the kids would like it more. for instance, the scene where cage is fleeing from armed gunmen, and the bullets are all deflected by a the railing of a fire escape. (and i'm not talking about a fence or anything, just one little pole) this movie shows the decay of films and the film industry to cheap gags and dull, unrealistic action, which this movie provides in huge quantities.
