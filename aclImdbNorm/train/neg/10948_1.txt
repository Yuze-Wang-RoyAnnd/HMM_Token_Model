what were they thinking at "cannes"? one of the most irritating, films of all time. every detail of this film, no matter how meaningless was shown. if i had to watch her put on those boots one more time i think i would have shouted. if the point of this film was to show how pathetic a life rosetta had, then it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credits should have been running. but no, we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over. the whole thing was filled with un-likeable and unsympathetic characters. they deserved the misery that was rosetta. and to think i passed up "tumbleweeds" to see this over-hyped film of boredom. it was like watching grass grow, only that is more exciting.
