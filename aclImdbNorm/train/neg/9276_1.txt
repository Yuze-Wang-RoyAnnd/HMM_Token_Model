this is a truly wretched little film. admittedly the original (un)holy trinity was governed by the law of diminishing returns with the third, "the final conflict" degenerating into a ridiculous sub-plot about half-way through the film apparently merely to provide the requisite needlessly convoluted deaths that had by now become the whole raison d'etre for the "omen" series. but then to foist this jumped-up tv movie (beware purchasers of the omen box set on dvd - don't be fooled by the widescreen ratio of the transfer, this was and is strictly small-screen stuff) on the back of a series of generally fine demonic chillers was unforgivable, particularly, endorsed as it was, by the exec.producer and producer of the first three movies mace neufeld and harvey bernhard. i'd give-away the plot if there was any, besides the usual death scenes (hopelessly toned down for tv sensibilities) and some of the worst acting i've seen. all involved in this project down to the catering people should be ashamed this travesty ever made it to the screen, let alone masquerading under the omen name. if one person is convinced by my review to avoid this mess, i'll feel better for it.
