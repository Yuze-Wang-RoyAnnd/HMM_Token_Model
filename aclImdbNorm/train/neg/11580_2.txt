if you want to see a mystery, don't watch this. though there are elements straight out of elmore leonard territory, this comes closer to an episode of "dynasty", since the filmmaker focuses on "character development" - i.e. long, boring talks between stupid, un-involving characters. some people can make fascinating movies without real action (see "exotica"), but not this one. avoid it, especially if you like the actors involved in this one.
