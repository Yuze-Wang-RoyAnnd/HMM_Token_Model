this movie contains no humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who has a mental illness. so many scenes reminded me too graphically of my own life experiences. this movie was the man's version of "mommy dearest." it depicts both graphically and accurately the life many children of a mentally ill parent goes through. it also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act like they are god. <br /><br />someone told me it was funny. no way, i say! it is sick humor at best. <br /><br />the movie is so intense and depressing that my son and i had to leave the room. the best use for this movie is for people who don't understand mental illness or don't believe what we families actually do live through.
