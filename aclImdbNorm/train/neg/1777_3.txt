if you're the kind of movie-goer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense...then look elsewhere, kids, cause sleepwalkers really sucks. usually i'm more eloquent than that, but...wow...this was bad. i especially love it when charles offers tanya a ride home, she declines, and then he is seen walking home. where's his car?? anyway, just don't see it, folks. i really want to be more specific, but words escape me. cats jumping on people. a guy getting stabbed by corn. cheesey lines up the proverbial "wazoo". just don't see it. wait, i take that back! see it for writer stephen king's cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard. he's actually pretty good. even with guest appearances by mark hamill and ron perlman, king gives the best performance of the film. but, other than that...wow...bad.
