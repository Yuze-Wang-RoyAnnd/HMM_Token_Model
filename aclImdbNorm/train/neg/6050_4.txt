i simply cannot believe the number of people comparing this favourably with the first film. it moved me to leave this comment! this is just an obvious attempt to cash-in on the success of the first film. the dialogue is appalling and nothing like as authentic or compelling as the original film.<br /><br />the storyline is ridiculous, the portrayal of the french police laughable and the characterisation of doyle a mile away from the first film.<br /><br />how many drug bosses do you think go down to the docks in person to see a shipment come in? the ease at which doyle finds his guy is just pathetic. like all the french police were just drinking coffee until doyle turns up from america and does some real police work. what a joke. try going to a foreign city and unearthing the biggest crims in the place with a travel map and some tourist pamphlets. pathetic. <br /><br />a truly awful sequel, anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy.
