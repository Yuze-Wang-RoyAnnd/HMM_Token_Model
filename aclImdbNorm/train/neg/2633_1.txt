i saw the trailer of the film several times at theater and i excited. it looked like a classic action thriller like the ones made in 1990's. it recalled me also fugitive movies, a cat and mouse chase between douglas and sutherland. however, the sentinel is the most tasteless action thriller of all time. as i see, many people say that this is like a tv movie. not exactly. firstly, there are much more better tv movies in this genre. secondly, tv movies might be very fun sometimes, but this film is the exact opposite of having a good time. it is not stylish at all visually and the most important, the tone of the movie is unappealing. this is not an action movie, there are two action scenes consist of a chase and a clash. also they are not big action scenes, but the worse is that those action scenes are very tasteless like the whole movie. the love affair between douglas and bassinger was very unnecessary. besides, the assassination plot to the president is the most clich'e story in this genre either, but they insist on that. and this is not a cat and mouse film as it is supposed to be. although, douglas is very old now, he has still potential for acting in an action thriller. in the film, michael douglas cannot be like tommy lee jones, for example. sutherland is a wrong choice either, because you feel as if you watch jack bauer and somehow, its character is one of the reasons which make the film like a tv movie, eva longoria parker is a strange choice, of course she is too passive or straight in this movie, because she is a soap opera actress. the movie was not fun even one second to me, so i could not get over for a while.
