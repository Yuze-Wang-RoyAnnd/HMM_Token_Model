the imdb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film. it should have read 'be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your family's church at 8 years old, listening to the preacher drone on about god's will while all you can think of is getting back home to your lego'.<br /><br />it starts off well intentioned, building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as renny's 'how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast?' moment. it then slowly morphs into a christian jamboree, sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic-induced babble. i believe i counted the use of the word 'pray' about 53 times in a five minute span near the end. after the 31st, i tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym, 'prey'. sadly, this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes. plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say 'prayer' ('preyer' to me) as it became totally zany. indeed, even my catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom, almost to the point of ending up on the floor.<br /><br />for all the salivating christians who ranked this film 8-10 stars, i suggest sticking with your theology-reinforcing safety standards like circle square, the ten commandments, anything from narnia, jesus christ superstar and the like. stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as jesus camp, the god who wasn't there, what would jesus buy, or the soon-to-be released religulous.<br /><br />maybe robert whitlow's book is better.
