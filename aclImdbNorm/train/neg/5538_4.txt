this is not really a zombie film, if we're defining zombies as the dead walking around. here the protagonist, armand louque (played by an unbelievably young dean jagger), gains control of a method to create zombies, though in fact, his 'method' is to mentally project his thoughts and control other living people's minds turning them into hypnotized slaves. this is an interesting concept for a movie, and was done much more effectively by fritz lang in his series of 'dr. mabuse' films, including 'dr. mabuse the gambler' (1922) and 'the testament of dr. mabuse' (1933). here it is unfortunately subordinated to his quest to regain the love of his former fianc'ee, claire duvall (played by the anne heche look alike with a bad hairdo, dorothy stone) which is really the major theme.<br /><br />the movie has an intriguing beginning, as louque is sent on a military archaeological expedition to cambodia to end the cult of zombies that came from there. at some type of compound (where we get great 30s sets and clothes) he announces his engagement to claire, and then barely five minutes later, she gives him back his ring declaring her love for his pal, clifford greyson (robert noland). it's unintentionally funny the way they talk to each other without making eye contact. this would have been a great movie for 'mystery science theater 3000', if they hadn't already roasted it.<br /><br />it's never shown how louque actually learns the 'zombification' secret, but he then uses it to kill his enemies, create a giant army of rifle carrying soldiers and body guards. we won't see such sheer force of will until john agar in 'the brain from planet arous' (1957).<br /><br />finally claire consents to marry him if he will let greyson live and return to america. louque agrees, but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves. on their wedding night he realizes that claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his 'powers.' to gain her love, he does so, causing the 'revolt' of the title, in which all his slaves awaken and attack his compound and kill him. greyson embraces claire, and we seem to be at the end of a parable: "whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad." <br /><br />so really then, it's not that bad of a film, despite the low imdb rating it currently has. on repeated viewings (?) one can see the artistry in the well formed script! dean jagger had yet to develop into a good actor, and is almost unrecognizable in his youngness -- is that really his own hair? we remember him more for his bald, old man roles in 'white christmas' (1954), 'x the unknown' (1956) and 'king creole' (1958). the story borrows a lot of its basic themes from the halperin brothers better, earlier film 'white zombie' (1932) in which hapless robert frazier (as charles beaumont) uses 'zombification' to win the love of madge bellamy (as madeline parker).<br /><br />if you want real zombie movies (of which there are hundreds!) i'd start with 'white zombie' (1932), 'king of the zombies' (1941), 'i walked with a zombie' (1943), 'night of the living dead' (1968), 'the last man on earth' (1964) and its two remakes. in the modern era of classy films, there are 'horror express' (1972), 'the serpent and the rainbow' (1988), '28 days later' (2002) and its sequel, as well as many, many, others too numerous to mention.<br /><br />this one is not really a zombie film. judging this movie on its own terms, it's more of a semi-gothic romance. as such it ranks a little below some of universal's bottom billed b horror movies of the late 30s and early 40s. so i'll give it a 5.
