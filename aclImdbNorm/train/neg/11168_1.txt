- a mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something -<br /><br />i went to see this movie because it was about non-wwf wrestling and so i thought it might be funny. it wasn't. it is excruciating to watch. embarrassing. any and every opportunity for comedy is mercilessly squandered. <br /><br />i admit i don't like jack black anyway. after this i have been racking my brain to think of one good role that he has performed. the only thing i can come up with where he was o.k. was as a necessary foil to the john cusack character in 'high fidelity'. jack black is one of those awful relentless flat-out ham-it-up knockabout guys (like the little fat one in abbot & costello or jerry lewis) who should be told that being overbearingly idiotic is not the same thing as being funny. <br /><br />it is not even slapstick. it's just irritating. it's not even stoopid, it's just stupid.<br /><br />i heard good things about napoleon dynamite too, but if this is anything to go by i wont be rushing out to find it on dvd.
