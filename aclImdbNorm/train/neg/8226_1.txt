given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings, the girls in this film would be collecting gold, silver and bronze at a darwin awards olympic ceremony. a mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did, and would have screamed a lot less while doing so.<br /><br />if you like films with a grainy picture, deliberately amateur camera-work (my 92 year-old grandmother wields a camcorder with better results), extremely poor sound and no discernible plot/narrative, then this is your ideal film. also note that you should enjoy the following: women screaming for no reason, women whining for no reason. in fact reason and logic don't appear much in this film. for example: "we have to find stephanie" "yeah i can't believe i was speaking to her, like, last night" "she called you last night?" "yeah, she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one" "what? how come she didn't tell me"? as in, our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but i have a problem with the fact that she didn't tell me she was going on a date.<br /><br />okay, so the budget is low. that doesn't mean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget. the 'score' is interesting since all - with the exception of one - tracks have been written and performed by the writers/directors of the film itself. in fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by the duskfall, a death metal band from sweden.<br /><br />the most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel.
