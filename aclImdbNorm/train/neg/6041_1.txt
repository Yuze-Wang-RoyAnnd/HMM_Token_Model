this story about three women is a very sensitive study about: muri"el (charlotte van den eynde) the youngest, laura (els dottermans) who is about 37 and martha (frieda pittors) the oldest who is the mother of muri"el. they live together in the same building. they have different expectations of life. the vital laura wants a child. muri"el comes from a village and wants to change her life in brussels. martha dreams about her youth when she was a young girl. in fact nothing happens in this movie so you wait for something - for instances an accident - which could dramatize this story. as times goes on, you discover that the director doroth'ee van den berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more. this movie is disappointing because you expect the women to learn from their experiences which is not the case, so one is left with a feeling of emptiness.
