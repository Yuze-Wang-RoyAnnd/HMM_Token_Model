this so called remake is terrible. i went to see this tonight.. on the first day as the anticipation and hype was too much for me to handle. but within the first half an hour, we knew that this is a disaster. it not only does not match the hype created but also insults the original blockbuster. the script had loopholes, the editing was untidy quite a few times. mohanlal who is an excellent actor did an okay job. amitabh was alright.. the director wanted to portray how evil his character is but he went a bit overboard which resulted in it being forceful. ajay who is especially smooth in these kind of roles was also a disappointment. lets not even get started about the new guy prashant.. one wouldn't be proud to start off a career with something like this. rajpal yadav who was thrown in for a few laughs couldn't even get a smile out of anyone because of his forceful humor and the shrill voice. nisha kothari proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have today. all in all, rgv who i thought was one of the most talented and gifted directors india has had.. failed miserably. he took up such a huge challenge and responsibility to remake what is known as the best hindi movie ever and made a mess out of it.
