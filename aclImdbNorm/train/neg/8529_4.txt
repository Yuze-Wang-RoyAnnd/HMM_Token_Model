what boob at mgm thought it would be a good idea to place the studly clark gable in the role of a salvation army worker?? ironically enough, another handsome future star, cary grant, also played a salvation army guy just two years later in the highly overrated she done him wrong. i guess in hindsight it's pretty easy to see the folly of these roles, but i still wonder who thought that salvation army guys are "hot" and who could look at these dashing men and see them as realistic representations of the parts they played. a long time ago, i used to work for a sister organization of the salvation army (the volunteers of america) and i never saw any studly guys working there (and that includes me, unfortunately). maybe i should have gotten a job with the salvation army instead!<br /><br />so, for the extremely curious, this is a good film to look out for, but for everyone else, it's poor writing, sloppy dialog and annoying moralizing make for a very slow film.
