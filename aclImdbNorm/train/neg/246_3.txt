this is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of jules verne's "mysterious island". the sound editing is pretty bad. you hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time! this is an amateur film with actors from boston and shot around new hampshire. for those living in new engalnd and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital w. this film is full of flaws. you get to hear the director's voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress. "ok now stand up." as for the other characters. there is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. the alien guy talks with a deep voice. when he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actor's voice. as for the special effects, man! this was brett piper's early work for crying out loud! the creatures are good but the animation is jerky. really jerky. sort of like karl zeman animation in journey to beginning of time (1955). the special effects are imaginative. thge music is good. bottom line, this film makes equinox or planet of the dinosaurs look like a ray harryhausen epic. did you know mysterious planet was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget? a must watch for aspiring film makers.
