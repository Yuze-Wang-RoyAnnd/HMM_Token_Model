okay, so i get it. we're supposed to be horrified. the idea has been planted. a girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it. call me over the shock-rock genre but i call for the explicit detailing of an act before i can fall for this. but don't expect me to watch a soft-porn and become horrified that she is 'doing her father'...i mean hasn't that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with 'rape, and molestation' porn...horror isn't what your mind can fool you into believing. it is what actually exists in film. this is where miike fails in visitor q. extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure.
