okay...so i've seen a lot of really odd/unusual movies in my day. fear and loathing in las vegas comes to mind when i think of that. well not anymore...from here on out, whenever someone asks me, "hey, what's the most unusual movie you've ever seen?" slipstream is what i'll say! and i do not mean "unusual" in a good way.<br /><br />from the very beginning of the movie, it was obvious that this was going to be one of those "trippy camera effect" movies. by that i mean, little things like flashing images on the screen, rewinding and fast-forwarding people's words and scenes, messing with the color on the screen, flash forwards and flash backs constantly...then you have the actual acting itself. people randomly get violent, shoot things/people, say the weirdest things that just don't make much, if any sense.<br /><br />the movie is about a writer who starts to intermingle real life with the book he's writing and for a lack of a better way to explain it, you basically see this "trip" he goes on throughout the movie. the thing is, johnny depp went on a similar trip in fear and loathing in las vegas but the only difference is that his trip was entertaining to watch, not painful! honestly, i had a real hard time even finishing slipstream. it kind of hurt my brain a bit.<br /><br />i can see some film buff making a claim as to this movie having certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique but add to the feeling of dementia...blah, blah, blah. point is, this movie hurts your brain when you watch it....it makes very little sense, it takes all of your concentration to even remotely try and understand what is going on and even at the end, the only thing you can be happy about is that it's over...and you can say you actually sat through it! so in closing, if you want to see a movie that will have you saying "what the heck" over and over again both out loud and in your head, go ahead and waste an hour and 30 minutes and check this out.<br /><br />mr hopkins, while i applaud you as an actor and commend your choice to take a stab at directing....please, do not ever make a movie like this again. next time, try something that relies a little more on great storytelling than camera techniques that tend to leave the viewer with a headache.
