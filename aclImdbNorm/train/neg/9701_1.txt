a really bad sequel. part 1 had a lot of funny moments - part 2 is just bad (in a boring way) and obviously made to squeeze money out of the fans.<br /><br />shame on you, otto waalkes!<br /><br />the only slightly amusing moment in the film is helge schneider who apparently seems to be pis*ed about the other characters. it's quite easy to identify with him...<br /><br />the screenplay is sloppy/non-existent. the director should do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately. the acting is worse than a 2nd grade school play. <br /><br />technically the movie is awful as well, but who can blame the cinematographer/sound guys who had to work with such an untalented director?
