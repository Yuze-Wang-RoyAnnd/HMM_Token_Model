i sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations. my expectations were no where near low enough. i honestly could not tell what genre this movie was from watching it, and if it was a comedy, the humor was completely missed. the plot was nonexistent and the acting was horrendous. my friends and i managed to watch approximately 30 to 40 minutes of this film before we turned it off and promptly begged the video store to take it back. i do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are purposely trying to watch the worst movies of all time. i honestly don't know how this film lasted more than a day in theatres and moreover i can not understand why anyone would willing watch it, considering not only it's very uninteresting title but also the lack of any famous actors/actresses in it's cast. this review is not a joke and i honestly think this could possibly be the worst movie ever made. it's certainly the worst movie i've ever had to sit through.
