i love cheesy horror flicks. i don't care if the acting is sub-par or whether the monsters look corny. i liked this movie except for the bewildered feeling all the way from the beginning of the film to the very end. look, i don't need a 10 page dissertation or a sign with big letters explaining a plot to me. but dark floors takes the "what is this movie about?" thing to a whole new (annoying) level. what is this movie about?<br /><br />this isn't exceptionally scary or thrilling but if you have an hour and a half to kill and/or you want to end up feeling frustrated and confused, rent this winner.
