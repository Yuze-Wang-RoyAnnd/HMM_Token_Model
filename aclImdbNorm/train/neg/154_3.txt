watched this on dvd in original language with english subs. either the subtitling was very poor or the actual dialog doesn't make much of story and give any character development. there are quite a few hk stars in this but the movie doesn't need their presence to make it better or worse. it's just bad. the bright and colorful scenes done in cg are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long. if anything this makes me think of a child's movie with its nonstop barrage of cg, fight scenes, and crap plot. i'm certain i grasped what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy.
