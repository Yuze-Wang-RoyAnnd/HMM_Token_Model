i absolutely adore the 'toxic avenger' series, but this weak offering by the troma people didn't make any sense, and it had me yawning all the time.<br /><br />a leaking nuclear plant (and the growing weed next to it) makes the youngsters of tromaville high go nuts, which causes them to join a gang, have sex, explode, and whatever. also there's some sort of monster breeding in the high school... my god, this movie's a mess.<br /><br />the actors pretty much stopped their efforts after this one and they should. the (intended) overacting started to get on my nerves in about 5 minutes...<br /><br />disappointing. 2/10.
