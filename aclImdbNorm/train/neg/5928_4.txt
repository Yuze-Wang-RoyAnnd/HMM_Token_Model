i just don't get some of the big premises of this episode - that miranda is so remarkable, and that there's anything so ugly it would make you insane. someone here made the remark that maybe it's the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness. miranda is just a jerk. the episode is slow, inconsistent and way too talky. i also don't quite understand why kolos is an ambassador - why doesn't the federation just leave the damn medusans be? there's one part i do like, when kolos is speaking through spock about the loneliness of the human experience. overall, i love tos and even at its lamest, i'll always tune in. this episode though - mmm, i wouldn't purchase it except for a used copy under $3.
