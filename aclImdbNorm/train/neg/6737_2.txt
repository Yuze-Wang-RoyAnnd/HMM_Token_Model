if deborah messing were not already cast as "grace", this might be a tolerable film. however, it is simply another story of a frustrated spinster with issues, who hires a paid escort (dermot mulroney) she reads about in a time magazine article to travel to london for her sister's london wedding. how new is this plot?<br /><br />neither funny, nor remotely romantic, the wedding date slides over the storyline of deceptive sex by bride and best man, and paid for escorts to pass off the film as four weddings without hugh, and definitely, a dead end deal for the naive groom who is ignorant to the sexual history of his bride (amy adams). while messing has perfected the repressed princess, 30- something woman with a failed relationship history, her neurotic and drunken moves on yet another faux beau is simply the restating of her tv series. if this woman is an actress, get a role that does not rehash what is already on prime time.<br /><br />lots of drunken female bonding, cricket visual jokes, and mulroney in a towel (nice!), but the film is a bore with the obvious happy ending. expected messing sequel: divorce date.
