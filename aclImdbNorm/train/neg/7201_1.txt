luckily i did not pay to see this movie. also, i cannot even reveal any spoilers because i willingly walked out after forty minutes of the movie. it was that bad. i laughed once, when the yahoo! billboard fell on the guy, and the theme song came on. however, that was only because i thought it was making fun of it, but then i realized it was yet another product placement. <br /><br />i loved the cartoon. i used to watch it almost religiously. (although i missed the last episode. i heard that they show dr. claw and it was nothing more than a claw, somebody comment on the show's page) the cartoon had penny and brain alot more than the movie had, as to that point. i hated the setup of the whole thing, reminiscent of robocop. then broderick screws with the whole feeling of inspector gadget. he is not nearly as clumsy as the cartoon was. another fact is his gadgets actually work to the point i saw, except for the oil slick. he also screwed with the tone of "wowsers" which used to be in an excited tone. i felt so disappointed that they slaughtered the cartoon so badly. everybody else felt that way too. us 14-17 year olds remember the cartoon fondly and we loved every minute of it.<br /><br />i went into the movie with an open mind, knowing that they would have screwed with the cartoon. i was taken aback at how retarded the movie was. it relied on sight gags, and stupid dialogue for humor. disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a kids movie along. product placement is pointless in this film, and it shows. the wise-cracking car is not that good at cracking wise. the gadgets look nice, but they were almost overly glossy. the cartoon was a better look. the silly scenes were crap. in the 40-45 minutes i watched the movie, not one laugh was heard, and they laughed at the dudley-do-right preview. this movie should not be watched by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment. i highly recommend "the iron giant," which was sad, but very very good. this movie is a travesty to the whole family drama.------------1
