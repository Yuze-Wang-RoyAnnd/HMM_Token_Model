this is one of the most hateful and cruel movies i've seen in a long time. sadly i was duped into sticking with it, since donald sutherland's presence misleadingly gave it some credibility. [that's the last time that'll happen.]<br /><br />lesley ann warren's character was annoyingly whiny and as stupid as they come. there were smarter characters than hers who were killed in the film. thats just one of many things in this movie that made me ask, "where is the justice?"<br /><br />why is late-night cable so filled with sadistic garbage filled with pathological mayhem? most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women, and seem to focus on them being terrorized and murdered. this film could have been every bit as suspenseful without being sick and twisted in the process. all it ends up doing is turning the viewer's stomach with its sickness, and insulting the viewer's intelligence.<br /><br />the cast is misleadingly good. my guess is that they bagged sutherland first, and used him to lure the others like lemmings into this.<br /><br />i'm kicking myself for wasting time, giving this piece of garbage a chance.
