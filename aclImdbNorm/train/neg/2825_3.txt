this week, i just thought it would be fun to catch up with corey haim, with just having seen the two "lost boys" films last week and all. not that i'm a fan-boy - not by far - but i did like those two coreys in some films back in my early teen days.<br /><br />so, i prepared myself for three films starring him. unfortunately, i picked "dream machine" as a first (never seen it before), and it was so godawfully horrible, i just decided to lock corey back in my closet and let him sober up again first, before i pop in something else of his. but i managed to struggle my way through this film first. i had the impression it desperately wanted to play in the same league as "ferris bueller's day off" (1986) but got caught up in its own delusions. practically the whole film it wants to be a comedy and near the end it hopelessly tries to be a thriller. the only good thing about "dream machine" is the premise: a dead body in the trunk of a porsche. all the rest fails so badly, it's embarrassing. even the most for haim. i can dig him being his young, enthusiastic self, but at least when he comes with some form of directorial guidelines. this clearly wasn't the case in "dream machine". so, we have a perfect car, yes, that black porsche. haim's perfect girlfriend? just a blonde chick who hardly has any lines in the film. the perfect murder... almost? some dude that falls flat on his ass as the villain of the film, trying the whole movie to steal the body back out of the trunk, never really succeeds, and then at the end of the film thinks he's michael myers (minus the white william shatner mask) and mistakes corey haim for jamie lee curtis. don't think they could have made this flick any lamer if they tried. a stupid, unfunny film with a story that leads to nowhere directed by a director that doesn't know how to direct his cast. great accomplishment!<br /><br />one last question for mr. haim: who's idea was it to have you smile directly into the camera in that last shot of the movie? yours or the director's? so not done.
