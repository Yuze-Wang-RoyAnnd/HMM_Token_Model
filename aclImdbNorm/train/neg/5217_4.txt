meet peter houseman, rock star genetic professor at virgina university. when he's not ballin' on the court he's blowing minds and dropping panties in his classroom lectures. dr. houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells allowing humans to become immortal. i'd want to be immortal too if i looked like christian bale and got the sweet female lovin that only vu can offer. an assortment of old and ugly university professors don't care for the popular houseman and cut off funding for his project due to lack of results. this causes peter to use himself as the guinea pig for his serum. much to my amazement there are side effects and he, get this, metamorphoses! into something that is embedded into our genetic dna that has been repressed for "millions of years". he also beds dr. mike's crush sally after a whole day of knowing her. she has a son. his name is tommy. he is an angry little boy.<br /><br />metamorphosis isn't a terrible movie, just not a well produced one. the whole time i watched this i couldn't get past the fact that this was filmed in 1989. the look and feel of the movie is late seventies quality at the latest. it does not help that it's packaged along with 1970's movies as metamorphosis is part of mill creek entertainment's 50 chilling classics. there is basically no film quality difference whatsoever. the final five minutes are pure bad movie cheese that actually, for me at least, save the movie from a lower rating. pay attention to the computer terminology such as "cromosonic anomaly". no wonder peter's experiment failed. your computer can't spell! this is worthy of a view followed by a trip to your local tavern.
