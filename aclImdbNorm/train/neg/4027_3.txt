this must be one of the most overrated spanish films in history. its lack of subtlety and complexity and its total political correction make it really childish, with only good/bad characters. the world is just not like this, and good movies show complex characters with opposite impulses, dilemmas, etc. however, what i hate most about this film is bola's friend's father. the director tries to teach us a good lesson: tattoo artists with shaved heads are not always bad guys, in fact they can be better than the average looking dad (wow, this is like... philosophy, or something). thank you, achero. i'll propose you for the nobel prize of literature.
