beverly garland was born in the wrong time. she was an actress ahead of her time, bringing power and grace to even such lame flicks as the corman films she starred in. in gunslinger, she's the town sheriff's wife. he gets offed, so she takes over his job to pursue his killers. she's better than the material she's working with, by far. the movie is gray, stilted, and mostly boring. there's some(unintentional)humor with the tire tracks everywhere, people running behind one building to emerge suddenly in front of another (i've heard of false fronts, but this is ridiculous!), and the truly stupid plot line of the newly widowed sheriff falling in love with the guy hired to kill her. even if she hadn't loved her husband, it had only been something like a week or two since he'd died! and she ends up shooting the guy to death in the end, anyway. no luck with men, this one.<br /><br />the villain of the piece is another woman, the saloon owner. she's scheming to buy up a bunch of land just in case the railroad goes through and makes her rich. her plan of action if it doesn't is pretty lame-she'll just steal as much from the town as she can and skedaddle. hell, it's just her and her hired gun at the end against an entire town. are you telling me these people aren't armed? look what happened in real towns of the old west when bank robbers came in to rob the bank, then were cut down in a hail of bullets by the armed and dangerous town folk.<br /><br />there'a a lot of pointless talking and riding around, interspersed with a few lame shoot outs. the ending is as grim as usual in a corman flick, although thank goodness it lacks the moral proselytizing at the end that was in it conquered the world. the sheriff turns over her badge to sam bass and rides off into the sunset, although the movie was so gray that you never saw the sun.
