*** warning! spoilers contained herein! ***<br /><br /> this is a semi-autobiographical look at what might happen to madonna if she were ever to be stranded on a deserted island. there's absolutely no challenge to madonna in this role, and it shows. she's just madonna playing madonna, and she can't even get that right. i know what you're saying, you're saying, "how do you know this is what madonna is really like, you've never met her!" correct, i haven't, but we all remember "truth or dare", don't we? i know kevin costner does.<br /><br /> you would think, in the year 2002, that madonna might have learned something, one way or the other, from the "crossover" ladies that have also made their way across the silver screen. for goodness' sake, hasn't madonna seen "glitter"? mariah carey showed the film world how it is done!!! mariah kicks madonna's trashy butt to the curb in beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, characterization, you name it! all we see from this glimpse into madonna's world is she's the only one in it. <br /><br /> if there's one thing to be said for madonna, it is that she's consistent. when she was an mtv darling, she set the world of women's fashion back 20 years. now, in film, she has set women's roles in film and society back 20 years, by glamourizing all the most hated, horrible, reprehensible, odious qualities women have been reputed to have locked away inside them, qualities they have been so desperately trying to prove they really don't possess.<br /><br /> ***here's the spoilers!!! don't read any further if you don't want to know...***<br /><br /> here's the one good thing i will say about this film, and i really was impressed by it. they didn't go for the "hollywood ending" - madonna's character lives. in the typical, happy hollywood ending, madonna's character would have died on the island, and her long-suffering, oppressed, whipped husband would have been free to finally settle down with a good, decent woman, a woman who would be the exact opposite of his deceased wife, and they both live happily ever after. but in this extremely depressing conclusion, she is rescued, and once more, this poor victim of a husband is once again saddled with his demon of a wife, and his life will once again become a living hell.<br /><br /> *** here endeth the spoilers ***
