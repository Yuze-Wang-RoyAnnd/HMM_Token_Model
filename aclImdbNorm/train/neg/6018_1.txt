i find it sad that christians (and i am one) feel that we must make movies like "left behind." we have much better stories to tell that don't have to be so preachy. i was very disappointed with this film. as an aspiring filmmaker who believes in christ, i see this film as the perfect example for what i am not going to do with my career in film.
