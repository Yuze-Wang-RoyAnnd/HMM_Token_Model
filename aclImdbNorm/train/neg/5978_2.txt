this third pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repetitious to entertain older kids. the message of the film-- about dealing with loss-- is subverted by the return of the young girl's father during the film's credits. team rocket provide some amusement, but they're not really part of the small plot, so they don't appear very often.
