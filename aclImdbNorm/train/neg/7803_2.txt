"the secretary" is one of those cheesy, cliched, "thrillers" that one is subjected to watching on a sunday afternoon, when there is virtually nothing else on. while the plot (a demented woman becomes jealous of all who succeed over her in the office and decides to do whatever she can to stop them) may be one of a kind, i recognized countless plot twists, probably taken from other tv movies that i had been subjected to for the very same reason.<br /><br />to make matters worse, i was not wild about the cast. mel harris is one of those actresses who appears in so many tv movies as either a "mom" or some sort of "victim" of foul play or abuse, that one must wonder the kind of life she leads. in this one, she gets the joy of playing a mom and a victim of psycho secretary sheila kelly, who was not a very good choice as the villain. while sheila kelly has made some good career moves(singles, breaking in, and i guess, law and order), she is also beset by a string of pitiful tv movie roles, and this one just adds to it. as for the others, i don't have any clear memories of them, so that must say something.<br /><br />this one will play on the lifetime network(i think that's where i saw it), but don't bother watching it, unless you are too bored for words. not that it will make you any more excitied...
