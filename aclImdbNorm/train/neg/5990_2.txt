i still haven't gotten to see all of this; it's running on cable right now, and i seem to keep coming in on the middle of it. my main reason for being interested in it is that i'm a bill paxton fan; he's a pretty good actor, and has turned in consistently good work over the course of his career.<br /><br />the other thing is that, while never really a fan of the old series, i kinda liked thunderbirds for the ships and effect work. derek meddings was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies, and his designs for the international rescue craft are wonderful. the current team has done a fine job of translating his work to the big screen.<br /><br />but...<br /><br />this is one lame story. the kids are asked to drive it, and while they do an okay job, it's hard to suspend your disbelief, especially when you have brains' eight-year-old son flying t2, an enormous multi-ton transport with all the aerodynamics of a buick. everywhere you look, you see a ford logo. product placement is way over the top here, and it's annoying. ben kingsley does an good job as the hood, but he can only do so much with a one-dimensional role. if you can accept the film on its very slim merits, thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable ride. just don't look too closely at the machinery that drives it.<br /><br />addendum: i finally got to see all of this, and it's worse than i thought. the acting is fairly uniformly poor, and while the effects are fairly good, the story on multiple viewings has gotten cheesier. the overdone product placement for ford is annoying, and the kids as central characters grate on my remaining nerves. as with the avengers, if you ignore the source material, it's bearable. but not very. watch the original show, and you'll see what i mean.<br /><br />and a word of advice to jon frakes. take a refresher course at the director's guild. you can do better than this, old friend.<br /><br />another footnote...<br /><br />i saw this again. last night. on telemundo. dubbed in spanish, with cheesy comedy sound effects. and yes, i came in roughly in the middle, with ben, ron and sophia in their fight scene on tracy island. <br /><br />i didn't think it was possible for an already lame movie to be worse, but it was. it was embarrassingly bad. <br /><br />if this had been done straight, no kids-to-the-rescue, no tongue-in-cheek jokes, it might have worked. as it is, it's just another beloved childhood joy that's been ruined.
