this movie was absolutely ghastly! i cannot fathom how this movie made it to production. nothing against the cast of the movie, of course, this is all the fault of the writing team. you take the old average plot - let's dance our way out of being poor and destitute - or step in this case. but this one lacks any semblance of a true plot - or at least one that anyone would care about. with canadian speaking actors in what is supposed to be an american setting - this film falls very flat. on a positive note, the directing was pretty good and cinematography was pretty decent as well. looks like the production budget was very generous as well. my only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find actual screenwriters to help them bring words alive on film. net result - how she move is how she sucks.
