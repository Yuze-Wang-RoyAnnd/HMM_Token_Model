my first question after seeing this film was, "why is the title liam?" if the intent was to tell a story from the boy's perspective, it was not carried out well. of course there was the formulaic use of camera angles in the boy's scenes, but much of the crucial action took place outside of his field of view. having a "main" character unable to speak (obviously suggesting the mute, powerless position of a child) makes it difficult to give that character much depth.<br /><br />melodrama is defined as: "dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotyped characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplistic morality, and conflict" liam fits this definition to a t. the viewer is hit over the head with the typical stereotypes of the fire and brimstone catholic church in the stern school marm and the well-fed priest squeezing money from parishioners. (a stereotype which is becoming very tiresome.) what's more--the jewish characters are money lenders and factory owners!<br /><br />much of the film was predictable...who didn't think that we'd see theresa scrubbing the toilet after her mother had told her "no daughter of mine will scrub another woman's toilet!" i'm a fan of british realism if it's done well. in my opinion, liam is not.<br /><br />
