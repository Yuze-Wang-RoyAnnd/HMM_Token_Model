painful to watch, and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters. two of the main characters, cynthia the mother and monica the acknowledged daughter, spend the great bulk of the film pathetically mewling and bitterly bitching respectively. their characters are so firmly established that their redemption into tolerable personalities after a quick family catharsis is unbelievable. it wasn't worth the wait. i wish a worthy pitch for honesty among families was less of a headache to view.
