sorry, but aside from kim basinger doing a good job acting scared, this was one of the worst thrillers i've seen in awhile. logic is thrown out as 4 young guys terrorize this woman outside a crowded mall then shoot a security guard. yet no one seems to notice. then, instead of screaming for help or racing back to the mall, she drives off and ends up in the middle of the woods with the guys in hot pursuit. i can't even describe how silly it is seeing this woman fleeing from 4 retarded thugs, carrying a red toolbox, screaming for god to come help her, and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing the others. please trust me, this is bad and a bit tasteless as well.
