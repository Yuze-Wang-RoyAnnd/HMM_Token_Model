aka: mondays in the sun<br /><br />i have no idea what i just watched. three men wander aimlessly and drink, grousing about everything and at everyone in their path. this is supposed to be a drama, but what it is, is a total waste of film, without a single redeeming quality.<br /><br />i have read reviews touting the performances herein as "wonderful," "beautiful," and "heroic." i'm afraid i cannot agree, unless these men were supposed to come off as the dumbest most ignorant proto-humans who ever walked.<br /><br />all in all? this was not a movie. it wanders throughout and loses everyone but the audience. i've watched this three times, and cannot for the life of me see what anyone sees in this garbage. there is nothing profound here, whatsoever. it's crap.<br /><br />it rates a zero/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
