robin williams gave a fine performance in the night listener as did the other cast members. however, the movie seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends to be considered a "must see." i think the problem happens because there isn't a strong enough relationship established between the caller and the gabriel noon(i had to spell it this way, because imdb wants to auto correct the right spelling to "no one") character. the movie runs a little over 01:30 and within the first 15 minutes, or so it seems, noon begins his search for pete logande, the boy caller.<br /><br />this happens after he talks to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times. the conversations aren't too in-depth mostly consisting of how are you... i'm in the hospital...why did you boyfriend move out... etc. in the book, the kid almost becomes noon's shrink and vice versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy, once he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he might be a hoax.<br /><br />in the movie, noon becomes obsessed with finding logande, but the audience is left to wonder why? since there really isn't a strong enough bond established between noon and the caller, why bother? who cares if the caller doesn't exist? <br /><br />i know there's a difference between a book and a movie, but those calls and that relationship was critical to establish on screen, because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie. since it doesn't, the movie falls apart.<br /><br />this is surprising because of maupin's other work, tales of the city. when it was made into a mini-series, it worked beautifully.
