two old men sitting on a park bench . i don`t really have a problem with this scene - only problem is that it`s not a scene it`s the entire movie<br /><br />yup movies don`t get anymore low concept than this . they also don`t get anymore boring than this either , but there`s worse to come because these two old men are chalk and cheese . one is nat moyer who is yiddish communist while the other is midge carter a former golden gloves champion who`s also black . let me see now , a jew and a black man sitting on a park bench getting along fine . well i guess it`s possible though unlikely , but if this film has such an inoffensive scenario why play up to the jewish stereotype ? why make them loud tribilistic rabble rousers who take hebrew oaths ? slightly ironic that the jews seen at the start of the movie are exactly the type of jews seen in nazi propaganda films in the 1930s<br /><br />stereotypes aside moi dearz the problem with i`m not rappaport is that it`s written for an entirely different meduim than cinema , it`s based on a stage play and it shows . walter matthau sleepwalks through his role as nat while this commentator almost slept through the whole movie
