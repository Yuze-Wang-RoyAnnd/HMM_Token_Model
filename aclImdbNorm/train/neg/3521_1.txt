i am still shuddering at the thought of ever seeing this movie again.<br /><br />i have seen action films, i have even liked quite a few of them, but this one goes over the top.<br /><br />not only does it have the worst male actor ever (sly stallone) playing the lead role, but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning (why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground, would be hell of a lot easier) that it requires a person with iq less than his shoenumber to believe it. <br /><br />furthermore, the plot has no real twists at all, a three year old kid could guess what comes next. it is a set of cliches (of action genre), with sly performing even worse than his other movies (he was better even in rambo iii if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film). now there is an actor who can't act a) surprised b) sad c) anything else than his basic face. <br /><br />i would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it. explosions are outstanding, but then... you can see better on the 4th of july. landscapes are magnificient, but then... there are documentaries about the alps and himalayas, so you can see better sights that way, rather than waste time on this flick.<br /><br />go watch some other movie instead, there are hundreds, even thousands better action movies.
