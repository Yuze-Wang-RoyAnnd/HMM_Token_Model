well i too had heard read all the breathless reviews and comments about how this movie might deserve the best picture oscar so i went to see it today. what a major disappointment! 1) if you read the other reviews you will learn from members of the u.s. military who served in iraq how unlikely the events of this movie are. they mirrored my own thoughts; as the movie played i - a complete civilian - kept thinking to myself, "say what? there's no way that would happen like that.." 2) there's very little that actually happens in terms of plot. a new bomb disposal guy shows up to replace one who was killed (a death that isn't really clearly explained). the new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work. his attitude puts others at risk. that's it! 3) this movie is nowhere near as suspenseful as claimed. if you want suspense try one of the bourne movies. if you want to see a war movie that's emotionally powerful, try renting go tell the spartans, which is about the vietnam war, and stars burt lancaster (who told me personally in a serendipitous supermarket encounter that it was a film he was immensely proud of and one he viewed as some of his finest work, and which he was still upset had been largely ignored in the wake of the over-hyped apocalypse now), or an old wwii black and white classic sink the bismark, which, especially for an english film, is unbelievably heart-wrenching. don't waste your time on hurt locker.
