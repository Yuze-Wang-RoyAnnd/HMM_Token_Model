that song keeps humming in my head. not the greatest song, but it's the 80's. this movie is about a lead singer who "supposebly" gets killed while being accused of murders as he stalks his girlfriend who sings backup vocals in his band. the lead singer whos name is billy "eye" (yeah, right) is dead after two years and his band comes back for a concert only the backup vocalist is the lead singer this time. billy stalks her and eventually goes around killing all these people and terrifying the girl and makeing people around her think theres something wrong with her and that shes imagining things. she finally decides to go to a cemetary and dig up his grave to see if he's still there. she sees that he's dead but still see's and hears his voice. during the end of the movie we find out the reason behind all of this, billy has a brother named john (right again) and john admits that he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all those people to get back at him and place the blame on his brother and then take his girlfriend and terrorize her because she called him crazy. the ending is very cheezy and the acting is very lame and wooden. but.... i like it anyway. i watch it for the song. i wish i had it.
