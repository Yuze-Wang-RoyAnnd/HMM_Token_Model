monster - he was great; i loved the special-effects which created this monster which looked like an updated version of "the creature from the black lagoon." the scenes with this beast roaming the land and capturing people ranged from good to jaw-dropping.<br /><br />social commentary: much of the story takes place in the quarantine area as the doctors (under orders from the government) state that sars-like disease is out there. in a nutshell, we get the familiar government cover-up story. you know, i expect this liberal paranoid mindset with hollywood films always painting our government as corrupt, but it looks like the koreans are copying the format, and it's very tedious. in here, it takes away from the excitement and suspense of this "monster." it just drags the film down. the main family featured in the film has to watch from a distance while the young girl in their family, presumed dead, was hauled off by the creature.<br /><br />moral: a typical "don't pollute the water" message because this is what can happen - a horrible mutated monster. this used to be the anti-nuclear bomb message from the 1950 when radiation caused giants ants, spiders, fish or whatever in those schlocky sci-fi films. now its "environmental issues" that are the focus.<br /><br />the humor this was mostly stupid. i normally laugh at slapstick but this wasn't funny. i don't know if the korean sense of humor is that pitiful, or the film was purposely trying to be ultra-corny with a take on the old "godzilla" movies. let's hope it's the latter.<br /><br />transfer - the video transfer was good. this was a sharp-looking picture and sound was decent with a lot rear-speaker crowd noise. i watched this in korean with the english subtitles. that might have been a mistake as the korean guttural voice sounds got annoying after a half hour.<br /><br />overall - this had a promise but turned out to be a big letdown and even boring in too many spots, which is inexcusable for a modern-day monster film. two hours was way too long for this story. how this film drew record crowds in korea i don't know. they must not have much in the way of films to enjoy and support.
