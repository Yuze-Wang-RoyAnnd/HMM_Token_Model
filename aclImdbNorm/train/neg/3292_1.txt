for this review,a list of good points and bad points.i'll start with the bad.<br /><br />bad points:the casting choices(especially burt reynolds as boss hogg),the acting of said badly chosen cast,the storyline,the idea of setting the film in the modern day,the direction,the editing,the soundtrack,and above all,the whole idea of making a feature film out of a television series that wasn't that great to start with,despite it's popularity.<br /><br />good points:jessica simpson in a red bikini............that's it!<br /><br />one might make an analogy here.in the scene where jessica simpson as daisy duke struts her way up to michael weston as enos,and asks the question,"enos,where's boss hogg and roscoe?",in his clouded judgment, tells her where they are.she might just as well have asked,"enos,is this a good movie?",the red bikini would have clouded his judgment into saying yes,even though in his right mind he would have said,"no, not really."as good as she looked in the bikini,she could have been stark naked,and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of film-making.stay out of hazzard!
