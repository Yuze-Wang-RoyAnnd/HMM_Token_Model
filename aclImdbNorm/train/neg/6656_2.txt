this gets a two because i liked it as a kid, but it became so redundant that i just started to hate it... i can't give this a descriptive review because it would be restating one thing after the other, i probably wouldn't say anything that everyone else didn't say already.<br /><br />the only other thing about this show is that it's pretty nasty, with the kid with the boil to that twisted babysitter to the stupidity that runs around and about in it. i have a cousin that loves this show and he's the strangest and dumbest person i have met. this show should be pulled from the air. it's always the same thing over and over... they need to put better shows on nick. i'm getting really really tired of stuff like this.
