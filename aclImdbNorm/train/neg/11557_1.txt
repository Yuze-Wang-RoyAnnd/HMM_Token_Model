*soiler* it's fake! the whole thing is a fake! there is no ghosts or zombies, alan is a lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that wants the castle and his title for himself. so he invests this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala scooby-doo to drive alan to commit suicide. most of the movie is him picking up redheads and attacking them. he's not even killing them. he drops off to sleep and the girl vanishes and he thinks he buried them someplace. if he looked at the so-called ghost of evelyn, he could tell she was wearing gloves! my god what a waste of time. don't bother watching it, renting and if you bought it and haven't watched it yet, sell it. quickly! do yourself a favor and stay away from the night evelyn came out of the grave. i give this stinker the crap-o-lantern.
