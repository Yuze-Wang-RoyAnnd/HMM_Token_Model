didn't know anything about the film or that it was based on a best selling book.tried guessing from the opening scenes what it would be about,best guess,buried treasure and a death list.that lasted about 15 minutes when i got the sneaky suspicion that the film was crap.i'll not bore you with how bad the plot and acting were but anyone who gave it more than two stars must work for the film makers.i watched until the hero jumped into his corvette to rush to the hospital.he had his on his suit,shirt and tie arrived at the hospital in jeans and a t/shirt.couldn't even get the continuity right. i got the christian theme,hard to miss it .
