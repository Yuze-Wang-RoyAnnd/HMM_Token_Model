that might be a bit harsh for me saying that, but sadly so far in his directing career its true. just have a look at what he as done so far. they barely make it past the 3 star mark.<br /><br />why did i watch this movie? 2 reasons. lucy lawless and heroes star greg grunberg. lucy was outstanding in this movie, her performance carries the whole movie. i do hope she gets a "blockbuster" and breaks into the bigger league of actors, she clearly has the skills. greg was not so impressive, typical tv acting style.<br /><br />the movie is oddly categorized as a horror. the only "horror" is short flashbacks, and they last a max of 2-5 seconds with a little blood in them. i personally would call this more a "drama/thriller".<br /><br />but no matter how interesting the story actually is, bad directing, editing and acting (appart from lucy) destroys it. you get no real connection to the actors, something which is very important in a story like this one. you just sit there watching feeling nothing. its like watching a bad tv soap....actually i think the tv soap would be more interesting.<br /><br />my advice: stay away from this movie...or better yet just stay away from anything michael hurst is involved with.
