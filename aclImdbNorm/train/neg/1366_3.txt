** contains spoilers ** <br /><br />the truly exquisite sean young (who in some scenes, with her hair poofed up, looks something like elizabeth taylor) is striking in her opening moments in this film. sitting in the back of a police car waiting to signal a bust, her face and body are tense and distracted. unfortunately, once the bust is over young's strained demeanor never changes. this is one fatally inhibited actress.<br /><br />one has only to compare young to the performer playing her coworker and best friend, arnetia walker, to grasp what is missing in young. walker is open, emotional, and at ease at all times...in that there's no apparent barrier between what she may be feeling and her expression of it. she is an open book. young, on the other hand, acts in the skittish, self-conscious way you might expect your neighbor to act were they suddenly thrown into starring in a film. basically, she doesn't have a clue.<br /><br />with this major void looming at the center of the movie, we're left to ponder the implausiblities of the story. for instance, after miss young is kidnapped by the criminal she's trailing and locked in a closet, she breaks the door down when left alone. granted, she's dressed only in a bra and panties, but in a similar situation, with a psycho captor due to return any moment, would you head for the door...or take the time to go through his dresser, take out some clothes and get dressed? i would guess that this and other scenes are trying to suggest some sort of mixed emotions miss young's character is experiencing, but young can not convey this type of complexity.<br /><br />there are a few affecting moments in the film, such as the short police interviews with the criminal's past victims, but overall this is an aimless endeavor. it's too bad miss young was replaced while filming the pair of comic book style films that might have exploited her limitations with some humor (batman and dick tracy), because her floundering while attempting to play actual people is oddly touching. watching miss young try to act, at least in this "thriller", is a sad spectacle.
