during a sleepless night, i was switching through the channels & found this embarrassment of a movie. what were they thinking?<br /><br />if this is life after "remote control" for kari (wuhrer) salin, no wonder she's gone nowhere.<br /><br />and why did david keith take this role? it's pathetic!<br /><br />anyway, i turned on the movie near the end, so i didn't get much of the plot. but this must've been the best part. this nerdy college kid brings home this dominatrix-ish girl...this scene is straight out of the comic books -- or the cheap porn movies. she calls the mother anal retentive and kisses the father "oh, i didn't expect tongue!" great lines!<br /><br />after this, i had to see how it ended..<br /><br />well, of course, this bitch from hell has a helluva past, so the swat team is upstairs. and yes...they surround her! and yes yes! the kid blows her brains out!!!! ahahhahahaha!!<br /><br />this is must-see tv. <br /><br />
