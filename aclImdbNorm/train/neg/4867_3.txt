just what we need! another remake of vintage hollywood cinema, with eddie murphy miscast again in his second time around after the nutty professor (1996)! this shows why we're running out of special ideas in making a quality movie, ladies and gentlemen! it has some signs of hope for its likeable and delightful imagery of animals who can act and speak with humans. things can only get more worse, unfortunately. bathroom jokes and sexual references kill this piece of "family" funfare instantly. even parents and children saw the trailer ad on the family channel, which was followed by utter angst and disgust in the movie theater. sad to say this is the more progressive pre-millennium era, but enjoy it while it lasts 'cause things can only get worse with time. more went wrong with the all-new dr. dolittle. it is absolutely plotless, feeling too flat. i also hate that irritating voice of chris rock!!! we need more talented voice-overs than a bunch of overpaid celebs who don't want to declare bankruptcy. i'll have to agree on my local newspaper giving this among the top five worst movies of 1998. then again, the original version wasn't any good, either. murphy's next project could be patton if he's not careful!
