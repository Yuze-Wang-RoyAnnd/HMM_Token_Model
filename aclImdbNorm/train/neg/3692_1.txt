rajinikanth becomes born again after getting a magical power which he can use seven times.<br /><br />there are several problems with this movie that are obvious to the casual audience: the 50ish rajinikanth is still at home with his parents; the father of the girl next door thinks that he is a compelling "boy" ('vaseekaramaana paiyan'); rajinikanth suddenly interrupts the movie with his sermons, the worst being how women of yesteryears got their exercise through household work--yet we are to believe that he is not a theist; even though he was well read, he wastes six of his seven powers on a stupid kite; i can go on, but you get the picture.<br /><br />there are god-men, there are gods, and there is rajinikanth. the directory has difficulty fitting rajinikanth into one of these categories. initially, rajinikanth is just rajinikanth doing what tamil heroes do--stand up to villains and, in spite of being the oldest, getting courted by the prettiest girl in the movie. rajinikanth does this well and some of rajinikanth's trademark styles are actually enjoyable--"baba count" is a novelty. what makes this movie unbearable is that those few initial minutes are just a preface to an worst book to be ever written. even that preface is punctuated with some comedy which are forced and obvious.<br /><br />the director doesn't explain the purpose of the hero; we see that the hero is facing several hurdles (from politicians, as usual) but we can't really root for the hero because we don't know what the hero's ultimate goal is. at the end, when everyone wants him to be the leader, the hero gives another one of his sermons and walks away to become a hermit. the director offers no solution to the problem in the climax scene.<br /><br />a. r. rehman's score is really interesting. either he shows patches of brilliance or he didn't bother to invest himself fully into this movie--who can blame him. there is one scene where rajinikanth steps into the van of one of the crooks and then throws the knife and starts his baba count. the music is very apt for the moment and acts as a catalyst adding further tension. the songs are all mediocre, no one would bother with the songs from this movie after a few years.<br /><br />unfortunately, 1 is the lowest rank you can assign in imdb. this movie has all the elements that justify its rightful place at the nether of imdb's ranking.
