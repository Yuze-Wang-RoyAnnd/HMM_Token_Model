what more can i say? the acting was, almost without exception, amateurish. the directing and continuity were pitiful. the sceenplay was predictable down to the very last scene and the dialog tedious. one of the features on the dvd was labeled "gag reel" but that could have been a description of a viewer's reaction to most of the movie.<br /><br />one of the most amusing things was in the director's comments on the dvd. he said, with a straight face, that he had set out to make a movie with high production values and a name cast - and that he had succeeded. with delusions like that it's easy to understand how the movie turned out as it did.<br /><br />perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster. the darkwolf suit was a modified ape suit (per the 'making of' feature on the dvd) and rather looked it. the mask and claws were little better than off the shelf jobs from any costume store. the cgi effects were painfully obvious and of quality similar to an inexpensive video game.
