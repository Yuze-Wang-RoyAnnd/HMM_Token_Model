i wonder how the actors acted in this movie. annette bening was really herself, half in and half out, was she faking or being natural? it didn't make any difference considering that even if she had been walking on the ceiling it would not have changed the pattern of the film. brian cox acted really well. i almost thought that he had always acted this way, tricky, dishonest, in a dirty surrounding where nobody really cared about hygiene. as for gwyneth paltrow, the question is what she was doing in this film.<br /><br />this film is quite sickening and disgusting. who would pay to see such a crap?
