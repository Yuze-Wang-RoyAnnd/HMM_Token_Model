i saw this dull waste of time on hbo's comedy channel, so i quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy. but there is absolutely nothing funny here. a good cast is basically wasted on a script that i could have written with my left butt-cheek - after it had been beaten senseless by 15th-century inquisition torturers. the first half is particularly bad, as it has some of the most dull, pointless dialogue i've come across in a while, and zero comma zero plot to speak of. just the fact that stars such as ewan mcgregor and zeta-jones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell you everything. a couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold british coast, but that's about it.<br /><br />this is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and/or plenty of cash lying around.
