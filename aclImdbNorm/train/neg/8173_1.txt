one of the most boring slashers ever.. if you can even call it that. i wouldn't watch this if it even ended up being some kind of porno movie, which it completely resembles. the fact that you're watching a small group of middle-aged people in the woods is really unbearable. they made these kinds of movies for teens, so who were they really aiming for when they made this sleep-fest? my favorite part of this movie is the cover art and it's the only reason i chose to seek out this movie, which happened to be part of a suspense classics 50 movie pack.. and after seeing the other movies in this 50 pack, you'll realize that it belongs nowhere else. so if you're in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods, i recommend just before dawn and the final terror.
