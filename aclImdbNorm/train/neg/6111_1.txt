bo derek will not go down in history as a great actress. on the other hand, starting in the 1980s, actual acting talent seemed to be less and less of a required ability in hollywood, so bo could very well have gone onto bigger and better things after the big box office take of blake edwards' "10." that is if she hadn't allowed her husband, john derek, to take over her career. numerous playboy spreads and bad movies like this one (this one in particular) directed by john destroyed what momentum she had and made her the butt of many a joke. in the 1980s it was assumed that you could put a certain personality in a certain movie and it would be box office gold. john figured that putting bo in a movie wherein she was nude for much of the running time would make people flock to the theaters after the 10 hype. maybe if the movie had been any good perhaps. this version of tarzan has got to be the all time worst of the many iterpretations of burrough's lord of the jungle, a slap in the face to character's book and film legacy. tarzan is in fact an after thought as the film is primarily a vehicle for bo's breasts and richard harris' wonderful over acting (remember, the pair had worked together in orca). his scenery chewing helps you to stay awake during the boredom of it all and yes, the film is quite boring. nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by someone in a trance. bo's body can only get you so far. miles o'keeffe who played tarzan at least would go onto a long and enjoyable b movie career and richard harris can put this behind him after his recent acting triumphs, but bo and john derek never recovered from this fiasco and future collaborations between the two only served to show why his directing career and her acting career died in the first place.<br /><br />and how did the orangutan get to africa?
