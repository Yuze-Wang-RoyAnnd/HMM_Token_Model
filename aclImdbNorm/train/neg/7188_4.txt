when i caught a glimpse of the title i thought are we going to get another try-hard hip slasher, but actually i found "7eventy 5ive" to be a mildly passable, and almost 80s throwback after a tediously slow mid-section it picks up momentum for the final half-hour leading to it's outrageously tacky climax and downright cop out ending. it won't win awards for originality, because it's as systematic as you can get and steals its thunder in the way of thrills (usual cheap jump scares), location (secluded mansion) and motivation from other films. the gleaming direction is by-the-book and the material is quite hackneyed with poorly realised red herrings within its elaborate plotting and flimsy script. sometimes laughable, but nonetheless i was entertained mainly due to its brutal and grisly acts of pulpy violence towards some rather obnoxiously annoying college students by a psychotic killer with a battle axe. the performances weren't bad in the shape of a spunky young cast, however the characters they were portraying weren't particularly enticing. an always presentable rutger hauer shows up in a short supportive role as a grizzled detective. a slickly made, but a shallow and forgettable addition to the fold.
