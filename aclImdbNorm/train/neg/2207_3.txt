hammerhead is a combination between the mad scientist and killer shark movie genres. in a bit of type-casting, jeffrey combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a human/hammerhead shark creature. bizarrely, this being is in fact his son, who he has turned into this monster to prevent him dying from cancer. or something.<br /><br />a group of associates are invited to the scientist's private island. they end up being used as shark bait or shark mate. for some unknown reason the head of it has been brought along as part of this team. who knows why? luckily, he turns out to be a resourceful, if somewhat overweight, ramboesque hero. i'm working on the assumption that he learnt how to handle an assault rifle as part of his day job working in 1st line support. a normal day for this it man presumably involves fixing someone's network connection followed by a call to gun down gun-toting evil-doers. or perhaps a call to fix someone's pc has to be scheduled between physical confrontations with land-based human-shark hybrids? anyway, he's amazing and saves the day. he even get's the girl.<br /><br />the shark-man is a slightly lame creation but ok, i guess, judging by the effects in general in this film. and the movie moves on at a decent pace. it's complete hokum of course but if you buy a movie called hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turned into a land-based killer fish, then really you have no one to blame but yourself. as it is, there are guns, gore, girls and possibly even an exploding helicopter. it's rubbish but not as bad as some might say.
