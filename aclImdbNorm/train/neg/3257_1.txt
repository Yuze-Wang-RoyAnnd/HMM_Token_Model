after having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was: is this supposed to be irony or not? after reading a few comments about the character doc savage and the comic series, i knew this film was not meant to be ironic. so, the story tells us about an us-american super-doc saving a south american republic from evil. sounds like a typical story. but this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous. the mandatory end-fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts i have ever seen. the film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example.
