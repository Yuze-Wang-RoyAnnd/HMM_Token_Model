where do they get the money to make films like this? i mean, there's nothing redeeming about this film. none of the actors are known, the writing is terrible, the photography is blurry, the story wanders between being a bad version of repo man and a nicklodeon western and the acting is unbelievable. for someone who watches all kinds of film, good and bad, i must admit that this film is about the worst i've seen since attack of the eye people back in the 50's. i don't really like to trash the effort of people trying to create some entertainment or, heaven forbid, art but this film would seem to appeal to no one. the story bends on a mystical contamination of a person who's a bad version of the celtic soul eater, although he functions more like a male succubus without the sexual overtones. the bad guys have to team up with the good guys in a town where they are unable to escape from. take it from there as that, alas, is the best part. my advice is that unless you are into bad mythology, amateurish writing, unconvincing acting and tedious settings, you will best be served by leaving this one on the shelf when you're out renting videos.
