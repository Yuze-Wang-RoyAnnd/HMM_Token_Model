the dereks did seem to struggle to find rolls for bo after "10".<br /><br />i used to work for a marine park in the florida keys. one day, the script for "ghosts can't do it" was circulating among the trainers in the "fish house" where food was prepared for the dolphins. there was one scene where a -dolphin- supposedly propositions bo (or bo the dolphin), asking to "go make eggs." reading the script, we -lauuughed-...<br /><br />we did not end up doing any portion of this movie at our facility, although our dolphins -were- in "the big blue!"<br /><br />this must have been very close to the end of anthony quinn's life. i hope he had fun in this film, as it certainly didn't do anything for his legacy.
