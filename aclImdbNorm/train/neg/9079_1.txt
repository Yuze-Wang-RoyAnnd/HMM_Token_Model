what are people on here talking about? i must have seen a different movie than you guys. i was so bored that i walked out of the theater. what is up with this stuff. i only laughed once and not even that hard. whoever greenlit this movie should be taken out into the street and beaten. i usually always find something i like in a movie, but this is crazy. "slackers" makes "not another teen movie" look like a classic. it ranks up there with such trash as "body shots", "con air", and "conspiracy theory" as one of the worst of all time. avoid at all costs! i thought the studio would be handing out money to people as they left the theater as a sign of their apologies, but to my dismay that wasn't happening. looks like i will never see that money again or the two hours.
