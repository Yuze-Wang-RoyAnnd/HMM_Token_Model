the week before i saw iowa, i saw art school confidential, in which a pretentious student makes a film and can't decide whether he wants it to be art or violent exploitation. iowa could be the film that he made. i can see elements of much better movies in iowa - spun and natural born killers. however, in addition to artiness, both those movies had good character development and coherent story lines. iowa. this movie stumbles to a preposterous end. i have to admit that it had consistency. this movie is bad from beginning to end and not particularly worse or better in any part. the actors all did what they could. roseanna arquette deserves better. she demonstrates that she is very talented, very funny, and very sexy. but why does she have to demonstrate it in this turd ball.
