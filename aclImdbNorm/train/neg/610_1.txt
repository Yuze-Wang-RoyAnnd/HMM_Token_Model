i purchased this film on the cheap in a sale, having read the back of the dvd case and assuming that either way i can't lose, it if was rubbish then no loss, if it was any good then bargain...<br /><br />then i watched it...<br /><br />i am normally a fan of christopher walken, but in this film he commanded very little screen presence, seeming not to do a whole lot, even the death of his friend near the beginning which sparks off the "action" in the plot seems to affect him very little, and his eventual revenge is just boring and undramatic.<br /><br />normally a film which has themes as grand as revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and snare them into feeling something for the characters, however watching this film felt more like seeing a series of confused, and almost random events that loosely tied together towards it's eventual conclusion...<br /><br />at this point i wept...<br /><br />i thought this film was the most horribly painful piece of viewing i have ever been subjected to, the scene where the pilot sacrifices himself by refusing to jump out the explosive laden truck due to not wanting to kill any civilians is not so much tragically sad as it is unnervingly horrible and painful, although not quite as bad as the emergency surgery on the wounded girl. the acting was poor all round, the script and story was weak, the "action" was even weaker, and the "visuals" were but bluntly not all that visual. to summarise there are films which are good, films that are bad, films that are so bad they are good, films that are terrible...<br /><br />and then on a whole new level is "mcbain"
