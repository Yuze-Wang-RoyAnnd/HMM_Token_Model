is it a remake og the thing (1982/1951), i think it is, there are so many factors from det previous movies do deny it.<br /><br />so the acting is bad, james spader does a superlow stargate re-enactment of himself, with his coffy mug and his somwhat strange thinking/movements but that's about it, the other actors i did't even notise. you don't get the feeling of getting to know anyone of the main characters. and the plot evolvement is slow, boring and, yah i know what is about to happend in 30mins. score/music is ultraboring, imean there are alot of ubertallented people out there that would make scores for a coke and a credit, but this is major crap. some of the special effects are nice, if it was made in early 90's. if you like slimy aliens, chills and thrills, don't whatch this movie. its a dull combination of the thing, alien 3, outbreak and some jerry bruckheimer/michael bay production gone really really bad. now this combination would be cool if somone knew what they where doing, and the only ones on this production that knew that was, no one.<br /><br />though i have seen far worse, i would not recomend this movie to anyone, but if you are up one cold night, and just wanna glanse at something, it will pass the time, slowly.
