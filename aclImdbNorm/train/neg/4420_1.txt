"everything a great documentary could be"?? yeah, if one is deaf, dumb, and blind. everything but meaning, wit, visual style, and interesting subject matter. aside from that. . .<br /><br />seriously, volken. this is a movie that is completely inauthentic. an adventure doc with no adventure, a war doc with no feeling for war, a campy send-up with no trace of wit. it means nothing, feels like nothing, and carries the implicit message that absolutely nothing matters. no wonder it has so many imdb fans! of course, going in you know a movie starring the great skip lipman will have no culture, no intelligence, no wit (other than a corrosive adolescent jokiness), and no recognizable human emotion
