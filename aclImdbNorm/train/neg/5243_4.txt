make up your own mind. personally i found it as much fun as receiving a spinal tap from stevie wonder. no offense mr. wonder. maybe it is comedy, but i just found it stupid. not exactly the first two choices to babysit your kids; wheeler(seann william scott)and danny(paul rudd),two energy drink salesmen, to avert jail time are court ordered to mentor two kids from a development center run by gayle sweeny(jane lynch). one of the misfits is ronnie(bobb'e j. thompson), a foul-mouthed fifth grader and the other is augie(christopher mintz-plasse), a bashful young man that roll plays in a fantasy medieval world. wheeler and danny desperately try to give their charges an invaluable inside view of life, love and heavy metal. lynch is hilarious with her dry wit analogies. supporting are: elizabeth banks, ken jeongg, kerri kenney-silver, amanda righetti and david wain.
