just another example of why stepehn king's books should not be made into movies. (even carrie, one of the best, is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen.) the premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who "accidentally" kills an old gypsy woman. in court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he gets off, even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving. the father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3, with our main character, billy (the lawyer) getting thinner and thinner by the day. though the movie kept with the book, for the most part, and has your typical king ending, the acting was stilted and felt forced. we went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between, sort of like reading acts in a play. king himself made a cameo in the movie (sort of like dave barry), which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that: authors. leave the acting to actors. not that anyone in this movie was that great. i've seen the major characters in movies where they were much better.
