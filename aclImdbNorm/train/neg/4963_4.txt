turned out to be another failed attempt by the laughable sci-fi channel. i am not sure who wrote the script, and interpreted the poem, but i am sure it was by some 17 year old teen who thought it would be awesome to a have a scoped crossbow in the movie. aaaaaaah! when i saw that part, i lost all hope. then...they set off for heorot in a what looks to be the ship that christopher columbus sailed in! when they reach heorot, (which is supposed to be a norse mead hall) the sci-fi group of idiots decided to make heorot look like a big stone castle. when i saw that part.. i wanted to scream. i really wanted this movie to be good, but sci-fi has yet to produce a good movie, so i don't know why i got my hopes up. oh..and grendel and his mother, are stupid also. (this comment is off topic about "grendel")if anyone from the sci-fi channel is reading this..here is some good advice. not every movie you make has to be about a big monster that can rip people in half, thats not what science fiction is about! and also, stop casting low-grade actors like stephen baldwin to be in your films! its not helping the movie, but making it worse!!!
