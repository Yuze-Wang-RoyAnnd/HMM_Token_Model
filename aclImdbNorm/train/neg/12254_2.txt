some might scoff, but there is actually a real art with making particularly bad films. this misses out on all fronts.<br /><br />a bunch of young people -- women with heaving breasts and continuously wet t-shirts, naturally -- go to film "blood surfing" and end up running into a 31 foot crocodile.<br /><br />not only was the croc obviously fake, but some of the props [notice the boat hitting the reef in particular] look like they've come out of thunderbirds!<br /><br />no good, from start to finish. don't see it!
