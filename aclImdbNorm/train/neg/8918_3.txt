...thankfully he hasn't, yet! this is crude, simplistic student politics made into drama. it needs the viewer to buy into a series of conceits. conceit 1: that a british electorate could be swung from being basically right of centre to being overwhelmingly far left. conceit 2: that all debate in the media and the general public is unanimously ended and that the new prime minister's only critics are sinister civil servants, mi5, big business and the americans (naturally). conceit 3: that this radical socialist pm can solve all union, economic and social problems with consummate ease in a way that unites the nation. conceit 4: that severing all ties with the us and nato is a good thing. conceit 5: that the soviet union isn't a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have had closer times with them back in the 80's. and finally, conceit 6: that the reactionary forces of the us would actively seek to launch a coup d'etat against britain.<br /><br />it's ludicrous and the show only gained the reputation that it did by trying to cash in on some anti-thatcher feeling in the country and having left wing tv critics singing its praises. when it was made, television was still a hugely popular and influential medium with shows getting huge ratings so a widely talked about drama with a hint of controversy had a good chance of getting a big audience. ray mcinally's performance was great, which is one of the few plus points. history and time has shown the huge weakness in the premise and plot of this show.
