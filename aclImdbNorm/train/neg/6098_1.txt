scotty (grant cramer, who would go on to star in the great b-movie "killer klowns from outer space") agrees to help three middle-aged guys learn how to 'dialog' the ladies in this bad '80's comedy. not bad as in '80's lingo, which meant good. bad as in bad. with no likable characters, including, but not limited to, a kid who's the freakiest looking guy since "friday the 13th part 2"' a girl who leads men on and then goes into hissy fits when they want to touch her, and the token fat slob, because after all what would an '80's sex comedy be without a fat slob?? well this one has two. this movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel of '80's sex comedies. and then came the sequel thus deepening said proverbial barrel.<br /><br />my grade:d- <br /><br />eye candy: too numerous to count, you even see the freaky looking kid imagined with boobs at on point, think "bachlor party" but not as funny, and very disturbing.<br /><br />where i saw it: comcast moviepass
