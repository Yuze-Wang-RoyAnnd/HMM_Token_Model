yuck! and again i say...yuck! the original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. the original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. and, it had a naked chick on a motorcycle.<br /><br />this version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest. it looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute. the movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. it is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife.<br /><br />there was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry...
