in 1979 lucio fulci released his film zombi. however, due to the earlier import of george romero's dawn of the dead, which had gone by that name for its italian release, it was retitled to zombi 2. (which also had the bonus of letting the audience think this was a sequel to the second romero movie). continuing this theme, the second zombi film, which would have been called zombi 2, was then consequently titled zombi 3. in the uk, the original zombi film (that is, zombi 2) was titled "zombie flesh eaters". to continue this theme, the second zombi film (zombi 3) was then titled "zombie flesh eaters 2" for its uk release. (are you following all this?) so if zombie flesh eaters was fulci's dawn, then is 2 his day of the dead? while this is only a flippant observation, this tale of military compounds, helicopters and a plodding narrative certainly does bear a vague thematic resemblance.<br /><br />some of fulci's european direction compels in a film like this, but the acting, dubbing and exposition-heavy script are absolutely horrendous. its ecological message is so forced and overstated it can no longer be considered a subtext, while there's an (unintentionally) hilarious birds homage. combining this last element with mor 80s rock is not a good idea. for some reason i couldn't stop thinking of time of the apes (q.v.) the whole time i was watching this. this is obviously not a good thing.<br /><br />while there's nothing here to rival topless scuba-diving, shark wrestling zombies and eyeballs on a splinter, fulci's misogynistic leanings do get a work out with a hotel cleaner's mouth being ground into a mirror until it gushes blood. his fannish gore predilections also see a hand severing. both themes are combined when a woman's face is ripped off, first by one zombie, then a zombie foetus that tears out of a pregnant woman's stomach.<br /><br />production-wise, this is obviously a step up from zombi, coming five years later. (nine years in worldwide release terms). but without the original's low-key charm it struggles, while stefano mainetti's music is inappropriate and uninspired. fabio frizzi's score was one of the best things about the '79 movie. here zombie attacks are played out to what sounds unnervingly like bonnie tyler's "holding out for a hero". in the middle of this carnage we get an irksome love interest, and roger and kenny, two bland macho types who do everything with acrobatic urgency and constantly state the obvious. ("we're out of ammunition" to a stalling gun is a particular standout). but where it also falls down is in the zombies themselves. low key or not, fulci's original had truly magnificent, rotting zombies. skull faces, worms in eye sockets... they really were something to behold. by contrast, this dull follow-up opts for the more traditional "men with a bit of paint on their faces" option. <br /><br />the climax rips off too many romero movies to even be funny, while the use of the dj is a crass and cheap narrative device. not containing the same elements of outrage and gratuitous nudity of the first, this is unlikely to have the same cult appeal. <br /><br />it turns out that fulci actually walked out on the project after reportedly directing just fifteen minutes, the rest filmed by bruno mattei. i'm fairly sure that even fulci would have balked at the ludicrous "flying zombie head" scene, and so credit to the director for having the good sense to leave. unfortunately, however, it's his name that's above the film title on releases, so the majority of people will be left with the impression that this is a fulci film through and through. on that scale then it's a major setback for him, for this movie commits what you imagine fulci would regard as the worst crime of all: that of being boring.
