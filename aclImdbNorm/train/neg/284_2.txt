i only today, picked this up at the 99 cents only store today, and i still think i got ripped off. "dream to believe" is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and $1 is just too freakin' expensive for this. this film is probably only notable for 2 things: 1. it has a young keanu reeves. and 2. it's directed by paul lynch, the man who also did promo night. now onto the movie. <br /><br />it's about a girl named robin (played by olivia d'abo) who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her father's life. so the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments, she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named tommy (played by keanu.) robin, when not in training, works part-time, along with her mother and stepsister, at a laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather. eventually she is chosen to compete. <br /><br />overall, keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star, and it's also not one of the worst movies ever, but still far from good. the dvd itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old vhs and towards the end, the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over, it fades to black, even though sound can still be heard. so this can probably be passed as a bootleg. the dvd artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of keanu and olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie, as it's also not in the movie itself, so the cover's obviously photoshopped. in any case, avoid at all costs, unless you're a keanu fanatic. i probably won't be hanging to it any longer. i'm probably gonna give it to the cinema snob, who's a great yt critic btw. hey, if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight, feel free to donate to him to keep his show running.
