i went into a video store and looked around to find some horror movies, after about 30 minutes i just rushed and picked out a few. i stumbled upon "masters of horror" which contained "pro-life" and "right to die". they seemed ok, same-old cheesy horror crap, but i was interested for some reason. it said about pro-life on the case about being a classic, a return to form for john carpenter (i loved his "the thing", so i thought this would be good) and all that. so i turned it on thinking it would be something great and interesting, i was very wrong... it started off casual, just a girl running through a forest, scared of something. a car stops and picks her up (just so being the people she needed to see, amazing?) they take her back to some clinic and examine her, at the sametime all this is happening her father appears at the gates and they don't allow him in, he isn't aloud near the area. most likely from something he would of done in the past, but you don't know of any of this at the moment. he really does not want his daughter in this place, an abortion center. he is very strongly against such acts, believing it's sickening and not what "god" would want. he "supports" what i heard is called "pro-life". acting against abortions and going to extremes to allow the babies to be born, they are sick. they don't like the life of an unborn being taken, yet they've killed humans in the past to allow the birth? justice is only a figment of the mind. anyway, back on track, after the girl is examined they find out shes pregnant, but far ahead than what she should be. she is only a few weeks pregnant, but is months ahead. she keeps telling them they wont understand her, and that she wants an abortion and all, but finally tells the truth that she was raped by a demon from hell, and that her father wants this baby (but believes "god" wants this baby, not who truly does). he gets his 3 sons (they arm themselves with pistols and shotguns), and begin to make they're way into the clinic (shooting down anyone who won't co-operate). the head of the clinic, who must of had trouble with them in the past, is well prepared this time. ends up killing one the fathers sons, but in the end gets shot a few times (wearing a bullet proof jacket). the father then performs what he believes is done to the women. he cuts a hole, where the vagina would be if he we're a female, and sticks some sort of sucking thing up there and sucks out all this blood. whilst all this is happening, the girl gives birth to some demonic baby with many legs, and some demon raises from beneath the earth (not in the same room) and starts looking for its child. the father sees this later on, and starts questioning why this happened, he did what he was told to do, and doesn't understand why it's like this. the demon had killed both of his sons earlier, and now goes for father... whilst the girl kills the baby, and the demon carries it away (not in the same scene).<br /><br />yeah, it probably sounds pretty cool, and a thrilling horror movie, but it isn't. the acting is horrible and lacks enthusiasm, the script is boring and not even creative, they choose the wrong characters and don't even build on them; just everything put together, all the small parts, don't even add up to something great, a waste of time. i wouldn't classify this as a horror, though it has elements of horror, they ultimately fail at what they try to succeed. it felt more like a "beginners" short-movie, than by john carpenter.<br /><br />sorry for my lack of information, and detailed review, i just didn't have the time to waste to write something exciting. also sorry if my spelling and details are incorrect, i couldn't really be bothered to research anything.
