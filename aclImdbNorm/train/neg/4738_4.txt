i loved watching the original azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, cool soundtrack, directing (kitamura rocks!), editing, and not to mention the beautiful aya ueto who filled the part perfectly. so i was really looking forward to seeing azumi 2, but after finally seeing it i felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket:( azumi 2 picks up where azumi left off, however these are completely 2 different movies. the pace is a lot slower, the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development. this was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the toho monster franchise (if that is possible!). i agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity. if only ryuhei kitamura continued with this installment. there is however some beautiful japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off. even the real bad guys, get killed off too easily without too much of a fight. the fight with the spider guy (straight out of an episode of monkey!) in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene. wheras in azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects, azumi 2 brought us the azumi cape cam!! azumi's rampage at the end was unconvincing, but aya still does an okay job. she looks great in the cape...but where did she get it from? i don't think i will be watching this one over and over again! ...what a pity.
