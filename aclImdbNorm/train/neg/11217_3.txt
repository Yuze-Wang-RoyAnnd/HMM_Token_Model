so the wife and i just finished it despite several threats from both of us to turn it off. for the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie, there was just very little excitement. the acting was atrocious, to the point where we actually chuckled several times during some of the worse scenes (the church lady for example). the dead sister was using paranormal means to contact her living twin, although rather then send useful information she focused on trying to scare the hell out of her instead which looked a lot like the ring. rather then get the police involved -- which i'm sure those earplugs she found would have dna all over them -- she instead devises a horrible plan to 'get' the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister. i call it a horrible plan because in the end she allows him to kill her too, which the movie then fades to black. bad dialog, bad acting, bad ending.
