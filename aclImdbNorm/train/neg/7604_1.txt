sure it takes place in the west, but the title makes it seem like it is a conventional western. instead, it is a movie of a woman sheriff. make no mistake though this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff. she becomes sheriff when her husband is gunned down; she is only a tad bit upset by this. her main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman, but the villain hires a guy to kill her. so this is what happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. utterly stupid, as anyone killed in this movie has the new sheriff to thank. she had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars, but i guess because she liked him she wouldn't do it. the killer is also after the mayor of the town for personal reasons that are also rather dumb. this movie is very boring and not really worth watching...it is not one of the better episodes of mst3000 they made. i can not imagine anyone seeing this without them because that would make it that much more painful. corman is a low budget director, but even he should know better than to have people go into one place and coming out another.
