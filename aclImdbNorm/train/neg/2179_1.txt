i just loved watching it though and having fun with it's total badness of a film. i saw this film through the helpful sarcasm of mystery science theater 3000 and i have the dvd. if you flip the to the other side of the dvd, they show the actual movie, so i gave it a chance. seriously, folks this is grilled cheese.<br /><br />the acting, special effects, and plot in general is very cheesy and unrealistic. "doesn't she need lungs" said crow noticing how the head can still talk while it doesn't have a body, and tom servo just wistfully remarks "no, she's got neck juice!". the ending is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with k-porn! i loved the "cat fight" between the two strippers. that "meow" after the fight or scene, whatever, was classic. so, in some ways this was a fun movie. i think for horror fans, you'll probably enjoy it. for a good time, watch the mstk3 version, you'll get a great laugh.<br /><br />mst3k version: 10/10 the brain that would die: 1/10
