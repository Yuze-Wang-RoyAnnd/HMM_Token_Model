there is simply no use in trying to glorify any part of this film.<br /><br />it was straight up trash. at the very beginning you might think that you are in for a visually stunning piece of cinematography... and then shortly thereafter you are hit with a large sack (burlap) of fail! the fighting is barely martial, the acting is teetering on the edge of par, and the music is not worth describing. there is only enough of a story to have created an excuse for this film to have been made. the decisions that the characters make and the way that they deal with the situations is weak, and did nothing but frustrate me. i think that the only reason this film came about was to act as a bit of fan service by using yumiko shaku.
