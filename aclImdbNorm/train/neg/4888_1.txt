nick millard aka nick phillips should have left well-enough alone when he made "criminally insane" 10 years before the release of this god-awful waste of time and effort. the fact that the original "criminally insane" was less than an hour in length should have clued him into the fact that he had probably milked this storyline for all he was going to get out of it...but instead he opts to use tons of footage from the original in this one as well, even to the point of recycling the original opening credit sequence! unfortunately, bringing back the rapidly aging priscilla alden did not save this one. what little bit of original footage there was in this flick looks as if it were filmed with a rented hand-held camcorder! if this film cost more than $100 to make i would be very surprised and i would be equally surprised if it made anything close to that amount! avoid this one and watch the original instead!
