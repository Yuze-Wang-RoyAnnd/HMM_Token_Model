bollywood fans pretty much hold amitabh bachan's mard in high regard but i think it is very overrated. manmohan desai collaborated before on movies like suhaag,parvarish,amar akbar anthony,naseeb,desh premee and coolie and i have seen all of them i liked so i had very high expectations before i watched mard and was bitterly disappointed. my main gripe about mard is that it feels like amar akbar anthony part 2,maybe mr desai ran out of ideas, after all he had been using that formula for years and years. 1. first of all some members of the cast is repeated from aaa, for instance the police inspector who brings up amar, the muslim who brings up akbar, nirupa roy and a few more. 2. in aaa nirupa roy loses her eyesight, in mard she loses her voice 3. in aaa there is the famous song (shirdi wale sai baba)well in mard we have amitabh singing maa sherawali. having seen aaa for over 1000 times i noticed that straight away.<br /><br />my other gripes are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous, true manmohan desai made leave your brain at the door kind of movies but with mard i thought he went too far. my last gripe is that compared to songs in previous manmohan desai movies i found the songs rather disappointing. i know it has many fans that swear by it but i didn't like it one bit. it actually pains me to write this review because i am such a huge fan and have loved his movies since i was a child.
