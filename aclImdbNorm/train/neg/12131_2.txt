kevin spacey is very talented, but unfortunately directing is not his forte. i had high expectations about the film before i rented it and maybe that is why i disliked it so much. i admire spacey's attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting, but it's not the attempt that counts. i found the film dull, boring, and stretched out. the acting was nothing spectacular. gary sinise has done much better, especially since he is conscious in most of his other films. skeet ulrich was disappointing, but this was one of his first films (i did get a kick out of how young and chubby this scream star looked). the only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above. the center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck. however, that shot was very "usual suspects"ish and my guess is spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his (which is very good mind you). if you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting, watch hitchcock's lifeboat. maybe spacey should have watched it before filming this.
