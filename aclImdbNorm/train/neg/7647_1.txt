bridges of madison county is a better made version of this story. i felt the ending of this movie was not handled sensitively as they did in the original english movie. this movie is very indianised, if you are a very sensitive person who cries in a movie when hero dies in the end you'll love this movie, on the other hand if you are a fighter in life and think crying is for wimps you may not like the ending.but on the whole it's pretty good subject is well handled for indian conditions. tabu was good as a caring wife and mother. everybody acted well.
