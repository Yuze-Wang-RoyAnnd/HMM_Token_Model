seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with ronnie o`sullivan defeating greame dott by 18 frames to 8 bbc 2 found a gap in their schedule and so decided to broadcast a walk on the moon a movie i had absolutely no knowledge off<br /><br />i missed a few seconds of the title credits so had no idea viggo mortensen starred in it and thought possibly it might be a cheap tvm , certainly the opening with the mawkish pearl and marty taking their kids to a summer camp has that sort of made for tv feel though the brightly lit ( too brightly lit ) cinematography seemed to suggest this was a cinematic film and it wasn`t until the appearence of viggo mortensen as hippy guy walker that i realised this was a cinema release , after all someone of mortensen`s stature wouldn`t star in a tvm , i mean that`s like a legend like robert deniro appearing in a straight to video film . wait a minute , didn`t bob .... ?<br /><br />some people on this site have mentioned that pearl and marty are an unconvincing on-screen couple and i agree . i can understand why pearl would be attracted to exciting hippy guy but have no idea why walker would be attracted to plain house wife pearl . the sixties was before my time but surely if you`ve got the choice between hippy chicks and bored house wives it`s not really a choice at all . mind you a lot of people took lsd in those days so i guess that explains it<br /><br />i feel the major problem of a walk on the moon comes down to the fact it`s a romantic drama at heart ( just like you`d expect in a tvm ) with several cloying coming of age scenes so why include a fairly explicit sex scene ? it jars with the rest of the movie and is possibly off putting to the menopuasal women who were 20 something in 1969 . i say possibly because the movie also seems to aim at a teeenage market with the coming of age scenes and those teenagers will probably be bored with the historical and social context of man walking on the moon and woodstock . in other words a walk on the moon tries to attract many types of audience but will probably appeal to none of them
