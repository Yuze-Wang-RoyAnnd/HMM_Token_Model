there are some extremely talented black directors spike lee,carl franklin,billy dukes,denzel and a host of others who bring well deserved credit to the film industry . then there are the wayans brothers who at one time(15,years ago) had an extremely funny television show'in living colour' that launched the career of jim carrey amongst others . now we have stupidity substituting for humour and gross out gags(toilet humour) as the standard operating procedure . people are not as stupid as those portrayed in 'little man' they couldn't possibly be . a baby with a full set of teeth and a tattoo is accepted as being only months old ? baby comes with a five o'clock shadow that he shaves off . it is intimated that the baby has sex with his foster mother behind her husbands,darryl's, back .oh, yea that is just hilarious . as a master criminal 'little man' is the stupidest on planet earth . he stashes a stolen rock that is just huge in a woman's purse and then has to pursue her . co-star chazz palminteri,why chazz, offers the best line: "i'm surrounded by morons." based, without credit, on a chuck jones cartoon, baby buggy bunny . this is far too stupid to be even remotely funny . a clue as to how bad this film is damon wayans appeared on jay leno the other night,prior to the bat awards and he did not,even mention this dreadful movie . when will hollywood stop green lighting trash from the wayans brothers . when they get over their white mans guilt in all likelihood .
