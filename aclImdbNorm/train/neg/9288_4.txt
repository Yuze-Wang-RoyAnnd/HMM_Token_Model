half past dead, starring steven seagal in the main role was a major b-hit. half past dead 2 is just a direct-to-video sequel, an action movie with nothing lose but with no capacity to win something. it's less entertaining than the first one: in all aspects. but it's although worthy a look. if you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; if you also like to watch former wwe stars on screen or even if you love to watch sequels, even if they are direct or not.<br /><br />kurupt did a good job, bill goldberg was below the average, i think he isn't made to the job. kurupt is a good comedian, i say. the rest did the job, but nothing amazing, nothing far from alright.<br /><br />technical details, well, a production made by sony can't be great. cinematography was a disaster but overall direction was acceptable. whatever, just watch it if you want. if you watch, you won't lose anything. but if you don't... well, you won't lose either.
