for such a great classic tale, the setting (location), grendel was disappointing. as a writer, i blame the script which completely lacked dramatic tension. the rubric of the club story is useful and would have provided a new take on the literary classic. for some weird reason that rubric was dropped early on. to know this was shot in 21 days says to me, "rushed" and it unfortunately shows. now we'll have to wait for the hollywood version on the big screen. i word on fx, i can tolerate really crappy cgi but the script has to rock and this one was just too slow, spartan and lacking in drama. i'd blame it on the actors but... since i know writing more than acting, i'll pick on my colleague.
