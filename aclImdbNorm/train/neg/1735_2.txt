i get the feeling that the producers of this mess were out to make the most painful, ridiculous western ever made. "painful" is the best word i can think of to describe it.<br /><br />on the plus side you have nice color photography and beautiful and well-spoken rhonda fleming. my sympathy goes to jacques aubuchon (who played the cripple), who acted well enough in an annoying role, written so atrociously that no actor could give an enjoyable performance. the production values were quite good, which only served to highlight the terrible story and screenplay.<br /><br />things i hated: stewart granger looked so little like a western figure, what with his british accent, neat tailored outfit, and silly immaculate always-white kerchief tied around his neck. it got tiresome the way the townspeople and his son were constantly haranguing and insulting granger, and he never spoke up or replied back. i know we are supposed to suspend disbelief and appreciate westerns as symbolic morality plays, but this one broke the spell with it laughably unrealistic and predictable scenes, the worst being at the end where granger miraculously, speedily and single-handedly plants dynamite around a canyon pass that the bad guy's cattle will pass through, and then granger plants himself in the perfect spot so he can shoot the dynamite from a very far distance to create rock slides to bury and spook the cattle and bad guys, seemingly destroying them all, save the two main bad guys. next worst is everything about the plot, which is loaded with soap opera scenes. nothing in the movie seemed believable: i couldn't believe what all the conflict was about. the bad guy was driving his herd through to market and wanted the cows to chew some grass along the way; i don't see why something couldn't have been worked out. you need a land ownership dispute for that? don't bother to see it.
