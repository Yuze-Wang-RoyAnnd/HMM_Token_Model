this is a terrible production of bartleby, though not, as the other reviewer put it because it is "unfilmable," but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book. it tells the story, almost painfully so. watching it, i could turn the pages in my book and follow along, which is not as much fun when dealing with an adaptation. rather, see the 2001 version of bartleby featuring crispin glover. that version, while humorous, brings new details to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel. what's important is the spirit, not the minutiae of things like setting, character names, and costumes. the difference between these film versions is like night and day, tedious and hilarious. this version is a lesson as to what can go wrong if an adaptation is handled poorly, painful, mind-numbing schlock.
