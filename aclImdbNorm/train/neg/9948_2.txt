ice-t stars as mason a homeless african-american who finds himself hunted by wealthy hunters (rutger hauer,gary busey,charles s. dutton, f.murray abraham,william mcnamara and john c. mcginley) however mason proves to be much harder prey then the usual targets in this ridiculous and slow paced actioner which takes too long setting up actionscenes and then totally botching them.
