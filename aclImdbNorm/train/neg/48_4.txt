there are some nice shots in this film, it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset.<br /><br />but it's basically more of a made for tv movie, and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot, which keeps it quite interesting viewing, there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in spanish, so non spanish speakers will be left a little lost.<br /><br />i had it as a xmas gift, as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented, and matthew mconaughey was just awesome in "a time to kill" , and the "the newton boys " so i expressed i wanted to see more of his work.<br /><br />however although it says on the dvd box it is a matthew mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy, he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film, he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on, so die hard fans, really not worth it from that point of view.<br /><br />the films star though, patrick mcgaw is great though and very easy on the eye, and his character is just so nice and kind and caring, a true saint of a guy, he'd be well written into a rom com.<br /><br />so for true mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones i've seen, i'd recommend, "a time to kill" , "the newton boys " "frailty", "how to lose a guy in 10 days", "edtv" and "amistad" and avoid too "larger than life" and "angels in the outfield" unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent, but are quite amusing films for children, again mm is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines.<br /><br />as for scorpion springit's not a bad film but it also isn't screen stealing either.
