**possible spoilers**<br /><br />this straight-to-video mess combines a gun-toting heroine, grade-z effects, nazis, a mummy and endless lesbian footage and it's still boring; the video's 45 minute running time only seems like eternity.the only good part is one of the blooper outtakes, wherein the bad guys force a 400-pound egyptologist into a chair--and one villain's foot almost gets crushed under a chair leg. take this snoozer back to the video store and watch televised golf, bowling or tennis instead.
