i understand the jokes quite well, they just aren't good. the show is horrible. i understand it, and that's another horrible thing about it. the only cool character there ever was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode, but then i see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible. it's not funny, not funny! i don't want people to say "only smart people get it" because if they're so smart why do they judge people they don't even know and say that they're not smart or intellectual enough to understand it? it's like saying "the sky is red" but never looking outside. but anyways, this is absolutely the worst show i have ever seen in my life, the jokes are terrible, i mean, you can understand them, they're just horrible, her controversy is very lame, her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting. i'm not sure what these "smart" people see in this show, but judging others when they don't even know anything about any of us isn't exactly a smart comment.
