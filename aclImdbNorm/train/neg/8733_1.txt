***possible plot spoilers***<br /><br />i adore dennis hopper. i question why he accepted the role of a police detective in 2000's the spreading ground. this movie flat out sucks and i'm about to tell you why.<br /><br />this is about a small town which is about to get a contract for a sports arena. one hitch: there's a killer on the loose and that is bad for business. the mayor makes a deal with the irish mob to find the killer and make sure he never makes it to court. det. ed delongpre has other plans. he wants this guy caught too, but he's on the level and believes in the system. he wants to see the system do it's job.<br /><br />that could have been pretty good. it could have been riveting. it was horrible. first, they label this guy a serial killer. err no. there are specific criteria and none of it fits here. the bad guy has killed 5 kids the first day, and i think it was 2 the second day. this entire movie spans like a 48 hour time period.... hardly serial killer action. i don't care what warped motives they give him in the end, serial killers do their deed over a long time span. they do not just all of a sudden kill 7 kids in two days. that's a spree.<br /><br />ok that irritant aside, the acting was atrocious. the only name here was hopper, and he's the only one who came even close to pulling off his part. unfortunately, he's kinda type-cast to me and i think he does psycho parts much, much better. this just wasn't a good vehicle for hopper. it didn't allow him to do what he does best, which is to act all creepy. it's not that he did bad, it's that i've seen him do so much better.<br /><br />the irish mob guy, johnny gault (tom mccamus - long day's journey into night), who is in charge of their investigation is just over the top stiff. contradiction? not really. he is trying to play the cold, hard kinda guy and he does that to the point that the character is just wooden. boring to the max. he didn't scare me. he didn't inspire any emotion at all except boredom. i cannot tell you how many times i checked to see how much longer it was til the end of this movie.<br /><br />the other thing about this is that it had the feel of a made-for-tv movie. you know what i mean. the poor production values, low budget, re-use of scenes to save costs. just eh. yanno? but, i feel like comparing this to those is an insult to those.<br /><br />derek vanlint was both the director and cinematographer on this project. he bit off more than he could chew. i can't help feeling that hopper must have took this role as a personal favor to a friend. that's the only rational i can come up with. this was vanlint's first job as director, third as cinematographer. hopefully this was a learning experience for him.<br /><br />i won't ruin the ending in case you do decide to torture yourself with this one, but i do want to say that they all dropped the ball here...even hopper. in a scene that should have been emotionally gut-wrenching for the detective, it was just..well.. blah. i didn't see any of the angst at all that would accompany the total gear-change this guy made. very disappointing.<br /><br />this 100 grueling minutes long and rated r for violence and language. no kid under 13 is going to have any interest whatsoever in watching this, so no worries there. it's not suitable for anyone anyway. heh.<br /><br />skip this one. you'll thank me later.
