i don't understand the positive comments made about this film. it is cheap and nasty on all levels and i cannot understand how it ever got made.<br /><br />cartoon characters abound - sue's foul-mouthed, alcoholic, layabout, irish father being a prime example. none of the characters are remotely sympathetic - except, briefly, for sue's asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence! as desperately unattractive as they both are, i've no idea why either rita and/or sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like bob - but given that they do, why should i be expected to care what happens to them? so many reviews keep carping on about how "realistic" it is. if that is true, it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film.<br /><br />i didn't like the film at all.
