i had the (mis)fortune to see this film at a showing in the us. having reluctantly sat through the entire abysmal thing, i am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on imdb. <br /><br />the original film was a turkey, but an interesting one. it fitted into that early seventies, post 1969 revolution thing; this film just stinks of....... , well, nothing really. it's that bad.<br /><br />imagine a badly done perfume commercial - see what i mean ?<br /><br />madonna never could act, and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years. she looks worse and worse with every one of those years, increasingly coming to resemble a skinned meerkat.<br /><br />guy ritchie, who has built his "reputation" on lock stock, could never direct either - his movies are shallow, badly cut, fashion shows. he doesn't disappoint here either; he wisely cast his wife as the star of this debacle.<br /><br />please people, take little heed of the good reviews this movie has received from other posters below. they are quite obviously business plants.<br /><br />don't encourage ritchie to humiliate himself further by giving him money.<br /><br />
