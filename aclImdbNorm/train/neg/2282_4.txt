"when a small bavarian village is beset with a string of mysterious deaths, the local (magistrate) demands answers into (sic) the attacks. while the police detective refuses to believe the nonsense about vampires returning to the village, the local doctor treating the victims begins to suspect the truth about the crimes," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />an inappropriately titled, dramatically unsatisfying, vampire mystery.<br /><br />curiously, the film's second tier easily out-perform the film's lackluster stars: stoic lionel atwill (as otto von niemann), skeptical melvyn douglas (as karl brettschneider), and pretty fay wray (as ruth bertin). the much more enjoyable supporting cast includes bat-crazy dwight frye (as herman), hypochondriac maude eburne (as aunt gussie schnappmann), and suspicious george e. stone (as kringen). mr. frye, ms. eburne, and mr. stone outperform admirably. is there another movie ending with a mad rush to the bathroom? <br /><br />magnesium sulfate
