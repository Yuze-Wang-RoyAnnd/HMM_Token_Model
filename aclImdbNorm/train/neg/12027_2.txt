i saw this movie in the middle of the night, when i was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch. it's one of those films where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment! - but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can't turn it off, no matter how bad it is. one of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it's good and so bad it's, well, just plain bad, it's worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it's both! great middle-of-the-night fare, if only for the fabulous tennis drag. don't even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that chad lowe is so obviously male, because logic does not apply.
