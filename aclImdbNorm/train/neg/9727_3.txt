another of my delves into the bargain bin, this movie gave me exactly what i expected - a load of trashy horror complete with screaming ladies.<br /><br />it all started so well - i liked the little intro with the "newsreel" about the young couple being exposed to a nuclear blast, and was totally absorbed right up until the first person caught fire...<br /><br />from then onwards the film descended into outright silliness, and at times became almost embarrassing to watch. when the heroine turned out to have been afflicted with the same condition as the main character (the ability to light one's own farts without the aid of a match) it seemed almost as if someone had thrown the idea in at the last moment ("that'll be good!" you can almost hear them say...) as for the almost psychic link between the main character and the nuclear power plant, well...<br /><br />the movie came across as cheap tat - if you pay more than lb1.50 for it you've been done.
