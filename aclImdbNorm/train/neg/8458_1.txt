i bought this movie last weekend at my local movie gallery. it was buy 2 get 2 free and i needed one more so i chose this one. horrible mistake. the box reads like it would be a really good movie. well, it starts out like it is going to be this great movie. for about 5 minutes, that is. the movie is about a young woman, laila, who gets killed trying to save her beau, jack, from a bull. laila's dad, cordobes, is a rancher that the townspeople are afraid of. he assumes that jack killed laila because she was supposedly afraid of this bull, and goes on this hunt to find him. that was the first 5 minutes that is good. what follows after that is only gonna get 100 times worse. whoever wrote the script, in my opinion, had to of been on some kind acid trip or something because nothing else made any sense what so ever. jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio dj named mary who gives him a ride. i think mary is supposed to be a virgin mary type character. you know, jesus' mother. but, who knows, i couldn't make heads or tails of it. as they're running... we get to see bad guys, magical visions, ghostly encounters, flashbacks, etc... and all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts from trying to figure out what's going on. needless to say, i took the movie back and exchanged it for something else. it's horrible i tell ya, horrible. and, there is absolutely no bull-fighting in this movie. unless you count the first minute of the movie. hope i helped some other people keep from wasting their time on this movie.
