really awful... lead actor did ok... the film, plot etc was completely crap and inaccurate it may as well have been a sequel to well... anything it had little or no relevance to carlitos way... and should be avoided like the plague by any carlito's ways fans... no mention of gail in fact he ends up with some other bird, no mention of klienfelt, no mention of how he got caught, no mention of how he ended up in jail... they attempted to make it like the original with flash backs at the beginning... but to be honest when rating it i was looking for a zero mark... unfortunately i had to rate it higher...<br /><br />its a terrible attempt to cash in on what was one of the best films of the 90's... overall it was approximately lb6 and 2 hours of my life wasted... for all the "action" in it, it was truly boring slow and predictable... again to any carltio's way fans avoid this fiasco...
