the great ecstasy of robert carmichael is bad film in every way. the script, the dreary pace, the lack of depth in any character, the pointless sub-plots, the dreadful acting, the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film i've ever seen. i found nothing likable, enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way.<br /><br />i imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark, with its moody lighting, long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack. if so, they failed utterly. it just bored me, and i wish i had never watched it.<br /><br />avoid at all costs.
