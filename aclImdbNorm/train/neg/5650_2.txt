william shatner in small doses is tolerable. unfortunately, instead of leaving his character as a minor irritation, and in that moderately amusing, it has been seen fit to enlarge his role and overdo it. just as occurred in the original star trek series. i guess i will never understand american humour, which frequently goes 'over the top' to get the message through. i vote with my feet. i no longer watch the show, which is a shame, because the rest of the cast were good. it is pity that shatner's overdone role also, affects james spader's performance. but the majority demonstrate the way society is going, i guess. i don't travel the same routes. frank
