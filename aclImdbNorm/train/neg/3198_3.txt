in short, the movie had a little bit of a weak 1st act with some forced acting and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and pacing, somewhat of a decent 2nd act that managed to build some tension and intrigue despite some inconsistent pacing and some inferior performances by the cast, and the 3rd act ... there virtually wasn't any 3rd act!<br /><br />regarding the 3rd act, the movie just abruptly ends. there is no resolution and no path down from the climax of the 2nd act, so there wasn't much of a 3rd act. the bad guys die and that's that; the end credits roll. there is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and the supporting characters and so on. the audience would've likely left the theater after the movie, asking "that's it?" a real letdown.<br /><br />music was composed by david bell which worked adequately enough to serve the film most of the time, but it's certainly nothing outstanding. it's just functional, but achieves this by being merely generic and derivative. it is also apparent that the score is very dated with the use of synthesized timpani for some of the percussion. what least impressed me about the score is that some moments of tension heralds music cues sounding like they were ripped off of james horner from "48 hrs." and "commando," particularly the brass.<br /><br />in all, the film had potential as the basic story itself is good, but the execution was lackluster with mediocre direction, weak acting, and somewhat inconsistent pacing.<br /><br />there was virtually no 3rd act to properly finish the story, and this omission is major and unforgivable as it doesn't allow the movie to end satisfactorily. this could either be the screenplay or, possibly, the production had to cut out filming or editing the 3rd act into the finished movie due to budget constraints (but i'm speculating as to why there isn't a 3rd act). whatever the reason, the abrupt ending really hurts the movie overall. <br /><br />this is good for a view if you're curious and you can get the movie for very cheap as well as to learn the reason why you need to have the 3 acts (beginning, middle, end) if you write screenplays and make movies.<br /><br />otherwise, you might not want to waste your time unless you can get the mst3k version to at least get some laughs out of it.
