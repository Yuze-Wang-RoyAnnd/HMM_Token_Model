after i got done watching this movie i was so upset that i had wasted 2 hours of my life. that's 2 hours i'll never get back. ugh. when you start this you might think "wow this is really good!" but rest assured that first impressions mean nothing. i was so excited about this movie until the dumbest ending i have ever seen. this movie is simply pathetic. the acting is bland, the story line is anything but original and there's nothing especially unique about this except that it's the worst movie ever!!! do not watch this movie!!! warning!! dumbest movie ever you will be sorry if you waste 2 hours of your life on this!!! 1/10
