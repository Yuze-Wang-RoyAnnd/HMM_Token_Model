linda lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater, chuck traynor. i don't understand how having sex with a dog (which is animal abuse, as well) can be found to be entertaining or funny. linda lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films. i know some people will criticize this comment but i feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. this society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. we call ourselves "civilized" however i feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized.
