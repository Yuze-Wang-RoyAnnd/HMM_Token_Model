*can anybody tell me where is the comedy ??!! <br /><br />*(charlie sheen) is a very weak comedian, (thomas haden church) is looking so feeble (with him !), and the whole thing is so thickheaded ! <br /><br />*they tried to make a live comic book which turned out to be super bloody comic nightmare and it wasn't even funny? like the plan's scene in the bathroom; it was so good with its cinematic imagination but there is nothing more.. except pain ! <br /><br />*donald sutherland ??! his relationship with his daughter ??!<br /><br />*this is actually a kind of work which they made it just to made it and earn some money from it , but it became such a crime when this money would be robbed from the very us whom got deceived by so low art work and an entertainment had absolutely no entertainment at all !<br /><br />*well, it would've been uglier if it was big production and starring brando in his golden years with a real star.<br /><br />*the sheen's family in here. just be aware of that !<br /><br />*anyone who found themselves admiring this movie or -god forbid- loving it ! then you must go directly to therapy before you become more dangerous and hurt anybody else !<br /><br />*(brando) undoubtedly is a genius but the movie isn't ! and he wasn't intending to be one in here after reading this for sure !! but the main big problem is that no one else ever worked in this thing trying, or wanting, to be a small time smart or even good !!! (sorry i'm crying now ! the movie's torturing is unbelievable !). <br /><br />*there is a scene where (brando) hitting (mira sorvino) by her shoes ! that was so realistic !? maybe he was seeing himself in her so he was punishing himself for being in such a crap ! <br /><br />*for the milliard time : this one could've been better (or less worse !). the script, till the train's heist, was nice and i just imagined that they'd escape to have some chase like it's another (smokey and the bandit) but with (brando) as the sheriff. in fact any of those chimeras was much merciful than what i've watched !<br /><br />*why this masterpiece didn't receive any razzie award ?! you want to make me believe that there was lower movie than this ? i do not think so ! it's a situation where the razzie's supervisor must himself win one for his negligence !!<br /><br />*martin sheen is here also as a guest star maybe for supporting his failure son but ironically the father was as failure as his son ! and why is that ?! well ! because i hate martin sheen maybe more than i hate comic movies weren't as good as its ambition ! <br /><br />*it's not a comedy movie, no.. it's a horror one !, and i just hate horror movies especially those which have been propagandized as comic ones ! <br /><br />*name good thing about it? hmmm ! well, this one compared to another marlon brando's monster movie (the island of dr. moreau - 1996) would be close to (casablanca) !! <br /><br />p.s : if you still want to know what are or who are precisely the bad, the ugly and the very ugly in this movie.. just pray your last prayers and go watch it.. may god help you !
