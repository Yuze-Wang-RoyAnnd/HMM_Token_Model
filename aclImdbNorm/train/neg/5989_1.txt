wow i payed lb3.50 to go see this movie at the cinema. cant believe i wasted my time. the acting is cringe worthy at best and the special effects are crude. probarly the worst script in history some extremely embarrassing quotes i have ever heard in my life. i swear to god 'swept away' is better than this. madonna should of won and oscar compared to these guys. an hour and a half of my life i want back. honestly people don't see this, even toddler would find this movie an insult to their intelligence. i found this movie very strange in the fact that it was hard to tell who is more wooden, theses guys here of the actual puppets. pleas guys don't waste your time on this movie you will live to regret it.
