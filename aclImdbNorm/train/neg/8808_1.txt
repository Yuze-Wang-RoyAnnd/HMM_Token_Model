"astonishing" screams the la times from the front of the dvd box. they must have been referring to the fact that such a sorry piece of crap was ever released. the film revolves around a bunch of girls who have a disease which forces them to become cannibals, and murder innocent people just to stay alive. their skin peels off throughout the film, we also see severed legs, heads etc that are about as convincing as a halloween fuzzy felt set. there is an awful lot of talking b*ll**ks, a bit of human cuisine and some weird zombie hunter chap who imprisons the sufferers of said skin illness in his closet strapped to a chair, before stabbing them in the head, chopping them into bits...<br /><br />you get the picture. considering there is no acting talent on display at all, and the gore is laughably unrealistic, what is the point of this whole farrago? again looking at the video box, the guy responsible for it is an "underground cult director". would that be like those weird religious cults where they brainwash you into thinking one way when clearly the opposite is true? because that's the only possible reason i can think of for anyone to derive pleasure by watching this tax write-off. then, on the same paragraph he compares himself to mike leigh, ken loach and george romero. hahahahaha oh stop it. now you're just being silly.<br /><br />do you enjoy this film? are you offended by the above opinion? if so, you must be a member of said cult. do they pocket your wages? do they let you see other family members? do they force you to watch andrew parkinson films till you think he's the best director since a.hitchcock? do tell... this sounds like a panorama special brewing to me. and say hello to the critic of the la times when you return to your colony, will you? 0/10
