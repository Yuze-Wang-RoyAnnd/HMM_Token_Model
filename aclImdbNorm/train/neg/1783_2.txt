there are no spoilers here... because there is no plot to spoil. madchen amick is living proof a face can make a living acting-- no talent required. the only bright spot are a few really good one-liners delivered very nicely by alice krige, but then again, she is alice krige. her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be. she is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot. how they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery. the screenplay writers must have been medicated when they submitted this script. it has major continuity problems, superficial stereotypical characters, horror formula writing, and simply falls short of making any sense what-so-ever. the creatures, while they have neat skills like going "dim", the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored. <br /><br />don't waste any time on this one.
