this by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life. i gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot. the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot. my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it. borrowing some ideas from movies like resident evil and aliens doesn't result in a movie like them. if this going to be a top korean movie, i'd rather won't bother to see even a korean movie trailer...<br /><br />by the way, this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising. i think every korean who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over the 8, even though has no clue what it is about.
