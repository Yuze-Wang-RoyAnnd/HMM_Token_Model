this kid is rather bad, but in no way do they make him the type that outsmarts adults and can foil experienced thieves at every turn. no, he is not so much a brat, as he is a kid with severe emotional problems. a nice couple looking to adopt get rather suckered into adopting him and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mother is not. through in a bizarre michael richards character and the always annoying gilbert gottfried and you have yourself a rather bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there. i actually prefer the sequel to this film as i like the fact they brought amy yasbeck back as a different more likable character as there are one to many characters in this film that are thoroughly unlikable as it is. even the kid is rather annoying at first in this one, and they kind of chill him out in the sequel too. the plot is simple enough though as the prospective parents go to adopt this kid that they think is great by the way the orphanage is throwing a party as they depart, they soon realize they have themselves a little hellion. add to that this little hellion getting into contact with a convict of some sort. not sure about this character, at first i thought it was supposed to be his real father or something. not all that good, but i will pick this ahead of that culkin kid any day of the week.
