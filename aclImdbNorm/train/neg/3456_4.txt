everyone in this movie tells raffy carruthers how talented she is, what a great director she'll one day turn out to be, etc. i think they're just being nice. even kimble rendall, who directed this film, shows more talent than she does. "the next jane campion", they call her; and, even apart from the fact that they're both over-rated, the two have so much in common. they both direct movies. they're both women. they're both australian. (well, give or take.)<br /><br />yep: it's one of those films in which a character is deemed to be brilliant, and we just have to swallow hard and accept it. but i'll say this for carruthers: she's cute. -and fascinating. no, really. here are some thoughts on her lack of talent:<br /><br />(1) part of a director's talent lies in dealing with people. why is carruthers so phenomenally bad at getting her crew to even take notice of her? so as to make it easier for everyone to wander off the set and get killed, i expect.<br /><br />(2) why is this one of the most unconvincing depictions of a movie set i have ever seen? after all, it must have been filmed on a real movie set. how could they get it wrong? if rendall's set was half as much of an under-staffed shambles it's a wonder he completed his film at all.<br /><br />(3) carruthers - the fictional director - has set herself the task of creating a brand new 1980s horror flick. fat chance. i doubt it can be done these days. i suspect that rendall - the actual, and more talented, director - set himself the same task, realised it couldn't be done, and settled for (sigh) knowing parody instead. of course, it's not enough of a parody to work as a parody. as soon as the cast and crew set foot in the isolated mansion the film just spends most of its time doing badly what 1980s horror films did ... well, less badly.<br /><br />(4) and yet, and yet ... the film opens with not a parody but an honest-to-goodness pastiche of 80s horror, starring (this is too good to be true) molly ringwald. this pastiche is much better than anything that follows. (it's a bad sign when you find yourself wishing you were watching the movie-within-the-movie, rather than the movie.) yet it, too, was filmed in the late 1990s. perhaps it is still possible to make 1980s horror. you just have to drop the knowing parody stuff and mean it.<br /><br />(5) i'd never once wondered what 1980s teen horror would be like if all the characters had australian accents, but now i know. and strangely, i'm glad i know. a need i never knew i had has been fulfilled.
