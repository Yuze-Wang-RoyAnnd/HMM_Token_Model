felt mine was while watching this...but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film. not that makes a lot of sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of karloff's last films and it's only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all. it's sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this. marginally, boris did get off slightly better than poor old bela lugosi but not by much. <br /><br />boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together. the strident background music doesn't help and distracts from any lucid moment. apart from boris, the rest of the mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, clipped, english monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies. <br /><br />at a guess i think it's edgar allen poe's 'house of usher' that this is taken from but you'd be hard pressed to find a great deal of poe in the finished article.<br /><br />still, there are far better films out there with boris karloff at his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too!
