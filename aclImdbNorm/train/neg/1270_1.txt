herculis puaro is, in general, a well established 'hero' we know well from books and movies. this movie or this story don't work and i felt its not agatha's mistake. the cast isn't good, the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even arab clothes) look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama. the actor playing herculis puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic. the scenes are, as said before, perfect and looking fake. the story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45+ woman in the iraqi desert?! the 'victim' is not likable.
