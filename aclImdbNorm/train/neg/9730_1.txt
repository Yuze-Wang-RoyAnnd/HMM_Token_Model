now, i hired this movie because brad dourif was in it. he is an excellent actor, brilliant in everything...except this movie. and i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was, and didn't bother with a good performance. this movie is a unintentional-comedy. some of the lines just crack me up. and them there are some lines that make no sense, and it seems like tobe hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot. oh! btw the plot is bad! but it one of those films that is taht bad that its actually painful to watch. i recommend this only for big brad dourif fans, or fans of any of the other actors, because the plot is pathetic.
