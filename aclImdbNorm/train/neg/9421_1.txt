if you liked watching mel gibson in million dollar hotel then you might enjoy watching burt reynolds in yet another film so bad it could never be distributed. i can only attest to the dvd version so maybe the vhs version is better quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so poorly done that everythings seems red. i first thought my dvd players was messed up. it wasn't. if you insist on watching it i recommend you adjust the color on your tv until it is black and white. if you don't you will never be able to get through the film. if you do it will simply remind you of a poor film students attempt to revist the style of pulp fiction.
