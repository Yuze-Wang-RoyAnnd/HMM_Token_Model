this centers on unironic notions of coming to grips with guilt. <br /><br />merrill berates the distraught boy to stop his 'whining' about rennie's death. old-style real men in action, here.<br /><br />the crashing model plane and car crash must have been impressive on the big screen.<br /><br />the storytelling itself, despite the flashback sequences, plays it straight -- all the narrators are trusted by us (regardless of the 'truth' or 'untruth' of the dialogue), so there's no game with the viewer about narrative structure. this would become a rough template for future retellings, such as "fearless".<br /><br />so all we're left with is individual performance, and at that level, it's best for wynn's bantering, a virtual one-man show.
