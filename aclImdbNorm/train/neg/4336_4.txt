i watched this movie and the original carlitos way back to back. the difference between the two is disgusting. now i know that people are going to say that the prequel was made on a small budget but that never had anything to do with a bad script. now maybe it's just me, but i always thought that a prequel was made to go set up the other movie, starring key characters and maybe filling in a bit about life that we didn't know. rise to power is just a movie that has carlito's name. there should have been at least a few characters from the original movie, the ending makes no sense in relation to the original. in the end of this movie he retires with his sweet heart but how the hell do we get him coming out of prison in the next movie? and his woman isn't even the same woman that he talks about as his only love in the original. i would say the movie is mildly entertaining in its self, with a few decent bits but it pales when held up to it's big brother. don't lay awake at night waiting to see this, watch the original one more time if you really need a hit.
