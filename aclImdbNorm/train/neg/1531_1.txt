this film is so bad, it made me want to vomit. poorly produced, a complete laugh free zone. why in the name of god would you spoof a movie which to a degree is a spoof (and a damn funny one at that) as it stands? the sets are laughable, the effects so bad that they aren't even laughable, and the acting farcical. it is a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this lump of garbage. national lampoon once made animal house, which people still consider to be completely and utterly hilarious. now they've been relegated to making tv movies like this lump of ****. name your expletive, and it could be accurately used to describe this film.
