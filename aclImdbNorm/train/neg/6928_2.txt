all the other comments already said what i was going to say, here goes anyway. i thought this was italian at first, sorry about that, italy. i wasn't bored because i kept waiting for something to happen. who did that song about dr. tarr and professor feather way back when? was it alan parsons? saw this on a brentwood 10 pack and the quality was as expected, terrible. full of streaks and stuff. the movie was an incoherent mess. goofy music and clueless characters. the main guy should have known in the first minute that the doctor was nuttier than the patients. i thought the "doctor" directing the "battle" scene was never going to end. had some good looking babes though. it seems these dumb ass movies always throw in a naked chick or two and that gets you hooked. i gave it a 2 for the nekkid women. that bird people dance made me want to pull out my own eyeballs. poe probably did about 3,000 rpms in his grave when this thing came out because it was loosely based on a story of his.
