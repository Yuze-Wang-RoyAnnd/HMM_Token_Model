this film was horrible. the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the real-world, the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film school.<br /><br />i do not recommend this film to anyone who: a) knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations. b) knows any detail about film making or appreciation.<br /><br />i do recommend this film to the average or below-average mind, i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber. if you must watch this film on a full mind, i highly recommend some kind of inebriation<br /><br />it is a total waste of what little production value it has.
