it seems to me, as a recent film school graduate, that in these times of new zealand film reaching new heights, the general public seems to think every new zealand film made is great. sione's wedding proves this is dead wrong.<br /><br />it's completely overrated and not funny, and far from the 'hilarious' film other users of imdb have commented. the only really funny thing i found in this film was derek the wannabe black guy, but other than that the jokes were recycled crap that we'd all heard before.<br /><br />being of half-samoan decent, i wanted to see how the film was going to deal with polynesian representation. it was a complete balls-up - i know it's a supposed comedy, but i didn't feel like the characters had anything new to say about polynesian identity, even if it was in a tongue-in-cheek manner. i was most disappointed with the ending of the film and the resolution of the character's relationships - mikaele was the player who only messed around with white women, comes to slightly turn his ways when the 'dusky maiden' comes to town, has an epiphany that maybe he should start looking for a stable relationship, then at the very last minute rejects it and accepts his position as a polynesian playboy for palagi women. i didn't understand why they did this.<br /><br />all in all, it was very disappointing. my whole family went to see it expecting to have a good laugh, but ended up being really bitter about paying to see it at the cinema. the jokes are lame at best, the acting, particularly of sefa's girlfriend, appalling, and honestly i would've been happy if i had got my hands on one of those pirated copies of the film to save myself the $15 ticket price.<br /><br />i think the only good thing to come from the movie is that it's the second step (behind no. 2, of course, a far superior film to this one) in the birth of polynesian cinema. i hope pacific filmmakers in the future can learn from sione's wedding in how to not reflect polynesia and have something more meaningful and sensible to say. even if it is done in a comedic fashion.
