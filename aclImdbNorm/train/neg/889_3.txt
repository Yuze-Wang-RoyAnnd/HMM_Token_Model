i've never been to paris, but after seeing "paris, je t'aime" i'm crazy to visit this city! i've been to ny several times and i love the city and its boroughs. i kinda expected to be touched by this film, to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away, but, lo and behold, i regret the time and money i spent with it. there are no love stories between people or a person and the city. there's a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just doesn't work out fine. maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city, where it's said to have thousands of people living on their own. can't you find love in new york?
