the premise was intriguing, but sadly this film just doesn't do any justice to it. the casting was quite good, and it was shot beautifully - but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent (overstylized fast editing been there done that to no effect.... i was waiting for steven bochco to run in the credits followed by a commercial), characters were identified exclusively by on-screen coke usage (and pretty much everything else left to boogie nights for character development), and no personable characters to draw the viewer into the story. a very forgettable film.
