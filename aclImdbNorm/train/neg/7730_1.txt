despite much style, flash, and glitter, this french musical fails to speak. the tunes are repetitive, predictable, and tedious. the story is uninteresting, as are the many characters. <br /><br />people break into song and dance, without motivation or reason. most of the cast wears phony looking wigs and hairpieces, and the sets look hopelessly studio bound.<br /><br />to be honest, this video of the restored version was stopped before the end, so negative an effect it had on me. certainly a shame, to have such a multi-talented cast in so feeble a final effort. <br /><br />goes to show, i guess, where followups (in this case, to the great classic, "umbrellas") often do go awry. one cannot recapture, only recreate.
