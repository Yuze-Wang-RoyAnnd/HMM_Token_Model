james bond in the wilderness? well, that's the way it looks: pierce brosnan is after all best known as bond in "tommorrow never dies" (1997) and "golden eye" (1995) - both shot prior to this release. frankly, the film's two leads are both badly miscast, with brosnan turning in the marginally more convincing performance, and with annie galipeau (as pony, grey owl's love interest) having to battle with carelessly-written dialogue.<br /><br />the two aunts, on the other hand are perfect. but the film is not about aunts. it is about the wilds of the canadian wilderness. and while the photography may be pretty, there is no grit to the harsh reality of living in the wilds. annie galipeau, as pony, just fails to be convincing, unfortunately, because i really wanted to believe in her. she was a relatively inexperienced twenty-year-old on this film, and it could have worked, but richard attenborough was maybe just not tough enough on her. he makes her look vulnerable, which of course she is.. but in the wrong sort of way.<br /><br />but one thing for sure, she appears picture-perfect throughout. but mascara and eyebrow thickener in the wilderness? it just doesn't fit, especially as she only ever seems to walk forest trials with bond (sorry, grey owl), and use photo-ops for kissing close-ups.<br /><br />i've lived with forest people in the pacific north west, and they simply don't look this pretty and stay so sweet while fighting for survival. which brings me to another point: the film fails to evoke the period in which it is set: the 1930s. i put the blame here largely on a lack-lustre script that is keen on preaching at the expense of dramatic arc, plot points and those small details that can evoke period through action.<br /><br />william nicholson wrote the screenplay, and his latest offering, "elizabeth, the golden age" opened three days ago, so i do hope there is an improvement.<br /><br />yes, i've read the comments others have posted, but i'm not convinced. a lot of potential, but mishandled and even maybe ill-conceived. if it had had a religious film, it would have been panned, but because it preaches environmentalism, the film remains somewhat above criticism, since it is "politically correct." sorry, for all that, i don't buy it. amen.
