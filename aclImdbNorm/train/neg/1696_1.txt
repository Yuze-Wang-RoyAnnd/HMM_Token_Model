i hate to throw out lines like this, but in this case i feel like i have to: the american remake of the grudge is by far the worst film i have seen in theaters in the last 5 years. there, i said it. and now that i have gotten that out of my system, please let me explain why.<br /><br />"when someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born. the curse gathers in that place of death. those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury." that is the premise of the grudge and i will admit it sounds intriguing. unfortunately, the filmmakers take it no further. those who encounter the "curse" are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get. you want more? well too bad. some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of the grudge is to scare you. the problem is that when there is no plot to speak of, creepy images and sounds can only go so far. director takashi shimizu, pulling a george sluizer and remaking his own original film(s), valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour
