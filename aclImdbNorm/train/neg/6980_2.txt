historically accurate? hmm... perhaps... if you squint, and light falls upon the subject just-so. but core accuracy is no compensation for a dismal, patchy and inconsistent plot, reams of cardboard dialogue and an unsatisfying conclusion. the principal characters are merely characterizations; embarrassing stereotypes that range from the 'enigmatic and noble' american indians through to the 'stuffy but sadistic' british officers. a wretched and unworthy rendition of a fascinating period in american history. i want my money back.
