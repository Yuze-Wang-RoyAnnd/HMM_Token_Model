i opted to see the film at the recent dubai film festival because it had been selected to the cannes film festival's prestigious competition section. i was surprised that cannes could be so off the mark in judging quality.<br /><br />the film, some reviewers, have noted does not have too much of gunfire--but the inherent violence is repulsive. imagine killing your enemy/competitor in front of your young son..or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. there are some hints of the contrasting corleone sons in copolla's "godfather" that seem to resurface here in this chinese/hong kong film but the quality of the two are as distinctly different as chalk and cheese.<br /><br />this film is only recommended for violence junkies..there is no great cinema here. at best it might be considered to be better than the usual run run shaw production for production values.
