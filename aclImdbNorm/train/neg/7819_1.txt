...this would be the worst film i'd ever seen. hmmm, ok maybe tied with boogeyman then. awful, truly awful.<br /><br />i had low expectations and it failed to meet them! i honestly cant think of one good thing. so here are the worst points...<br /><br />1. the acting 2. the plot 3. the cgi (xbox 360 has better graphics....seriously) 4. the plot 5. the dialogue and finally.... 6. the plot <br /><br />there are so many unanswered questions, did they make a 2:32 hour long movie then realize they hadn't put lex luthor and superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think no-one would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than superman's son and the henchman he kills?!!<br /><br />was half the budget spent on persuading kevin spacey to do it?<br /><br />when superman goes to hospital, why don't the doctors ask "what the f*** do you want us to do?! he's a f***ing alien! we don't know jack about his anatomy!"? <br /><br />what happened in the 5 years superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years? <br /><br />where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie?<br /><br />and finally, why? just, why? <br /><br />btw, for those of you wondering how come superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite, i think i've figured it out...<br /><br />...since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks, it is clearly all in his head. therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rock....<br /><br />either that or the writers are slack-jawed half-wits who didn't think that was a fairly obvious mistake.
