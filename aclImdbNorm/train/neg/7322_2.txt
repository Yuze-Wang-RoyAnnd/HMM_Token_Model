i'll give credit where credit is due, and say that linda fiorentino gives a good performance as a hard-drinking actress who does what she wants. she's brash, sassy, hard-edged, and very sexy; she is much better than this film deserves.<br /><br />but that is it. this dull suspense film is a fragmented mess, attempting at once to be a stalker thriller, a murder thriller, a tale of loyalty and betrayal, and a steamy erotic thriller. the film, my friends, isn't thrilling in the slightest.<br /><br />for instance, who thought of casting c. thomas howell as a desirable leading man? he is not ugly, but for crying out loud, it looks as though fiorentino's tough-cookie goddess is getting it on with a kindergarten teacher. howell has neither the authority or screen presence to fill the leading man role.<br /><br />the script is by far the worst aspect of the film. there is no tension as fiorentino's character gets eerie phone calls, there is no mystery concerning her guilt in the murders that are the focus of the film, there is no sense of liberation as fiorentino gets wimpy howell to lose his inhibitions.<br /><br />look for interesting but poorly-done cameos by adam ant and issac hayes, and one really, really good sex scene between howell and fiorentino. besides that, my first impulse would be to put this sorry piece of trash down and go rent something else.
