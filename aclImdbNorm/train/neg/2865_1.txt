generally i don't do minus's and if this site could i would give this movie -3 out of 10 meaning i really hated this movie. i thought uwe boll's alone in the dark was the worst i've seen yet but at least i gave it a 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion(stephen dorff shooting at nothing made me laugh so i boosted the ratings a bit). hell if it was if compared to bloodrayne, bloodrayne would win a oscar for best movie if they were competing.<br /><br />now to the plot, this movie is about the btk killer which is fine but they've could have done better. the start looked ok but that's it i had to fast forward most of it because the death's where boring. i like killer movies and even if they suck they could still get some cool deaths. i'm not a fancy movie expert but believe me he would have shot himself if did see this. sorry for rambling but there's nothing good to say about it, because it looks like someone took a camcorder and film this.. this.. thing of disaster. uwe boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever this took the cake.<br /><br />well sorry i couldn't explain the plot(if there was one) but that was the best i could. now if you don't mind i'm going to crawl into a corner and move back and forth and reminding me of how bad this movie scared me for life.... ok not for life
