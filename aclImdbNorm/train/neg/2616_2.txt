remember the name kevin lime - and please, please never let<br /><br />him direct again. timing, pacing, editing: all hopelessly wrong.<br /><br />three or four decent professionals (next time, guys, walk off the<br /><br />set) can do nothing to save this film from amateurs like alice<br /><br />evans, and the kind of production standards you'd expect from<br /><br />teen-produced children's shows on british tv.<br /><br />greatest mystery: the music. a score so inept, inappropriate and<br /><br />ill-matched to the tone of the film that one seriously wonders if it is<br /><br />a case of sabotage. add an acoustic that booms apparently<br /><br />unengineered from a single mike, and a director who only<br /><br />intermittently remembers to add auditory action offscreen, and we<br /><br />have what must be on of the greatest ratio of money to result of<br /><br />recent years.
