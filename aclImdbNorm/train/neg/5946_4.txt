there is absolutely no plot in this movie ...no character development...no climax...nothing. but has a few good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good. so there you go...as a movie overall is pretty bad, but if you like a brainless flick that offer nothing but just good action scene then watch this movie. do not expect nothing more that just that.decent acting and a not so bad direction..a couple of cameos from kimbo and carano...i was looking to see carano a little bit more in this movie..she is a good fighter and a really hot girl.... white is a great martial artist and a decent actor. i really hope he can land a better movie in the future so we can really enjoy his art..imagine a film with white and jaa together...that would be awesome
