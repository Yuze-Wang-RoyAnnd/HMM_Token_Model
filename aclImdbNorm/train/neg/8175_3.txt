the mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the 80's well with some good performances.<br /><br />however..... <br /><br />the script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where i expect it was intended to be edgy. the characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clich'es that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front. the biggest problem is this movie has no real story. it ticks all the right "arty" boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point was.<br /><br />very disappointing
