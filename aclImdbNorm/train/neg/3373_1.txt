i was lucky enough to see a chorus line when it came to my city.. i was younger then.. but it was an excellent play.. so would someone please tell me why in heavens name did they have to make a movie out of it.. and why michael douglas ??? he didnt suit the role.. this movie really sucked big time !!!<br /><br />my advise is not to rent this movie.. save your money for something better like "cats" ....
