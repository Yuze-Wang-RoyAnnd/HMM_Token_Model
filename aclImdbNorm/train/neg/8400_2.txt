not even the most ardent stooge fan could possibly like the movie, (i one of them) the stooges just aren't given any material to work with. it is really a shame too because this is the only feature length movie the stooges did with curly, and this one effort by them is painfully unfunny, when it could have had great potential. awful musical numbers don't help any either. the short they did with the same title has more laughs.
