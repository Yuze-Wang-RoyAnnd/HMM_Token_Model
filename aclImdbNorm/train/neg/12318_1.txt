i absolutely hate this programme, what kind of people sit and watch this garbage?? ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure i'm well out of the room before it comes on. its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless. what happened to detective programmes with real mystery??? i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago??? i wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this.
