the story of a woman (ann) on her death bed, her two daughters (nina and constance) and her thoughts about her past. the flashbacks are concerning a weekend where young ann is in the wedding of her friend lila. at the wedding she meets harris who will impact her for the rest of her life. through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love. her daughter constance is older, more "responsible," a mother of two and has things together. nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life.<br /><br />first of all the good. the period detail in the movie is great. the dresses, hair, cars, houses, etc. really put you in another time and place. and there is some very quality acting in the movie. vanessa redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end. claire danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young (and she is an outstanding singer). hugh dancy brought a lot of life to the character of lila's brother buddy.<br /><br />now for the bad, which unfortunately is everything else. things constantly disrupt the story as it is being unfolded for us. the chemistry between young ann and buddy is great. they have fun and dance. then... you are supposed to believe that she doesn't really like him more than a friend and that his pining only annoys her. and i thought the whole, "he might be gay" thing was out of the blue and didn't serve a purpose.<br /><br />then we have harris. the character acts wooden and creepy. had this been another genre, you would have known that harris was the serial killer from the get go. it is an unbelievable stretch to think that all these girls loved him so (but they do portray the other guys as pretty lame to try and help him out).<br /><br />and the grandest problem of all. why don't ann and harris get together? they fall for each other. they have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardener's shack, come home to find out about buddy's tragic end and then...<br /><br />nothing.<br /><br />they meet up a few years later and get all misty eyed about each other and i couldn't help but wondering why. why? the movie doesn't let you know why they were forced to marry other people and so i had a hard time feeling sorry for them.<br /><br />the part of the story in the present is fairly boring. the clich'e good daughter and the clich'e bad daughter. nina changes over the course of the movie but i am not sure why. i'm not sure what convinces her to change her life. there is a "touching" scene where the daughters are connecting that coincides with old ann dreaming she's chasing a butterfly. it is really lame and embarrassing.<br /><br />"there are no mistakes", ann advises at us. the statement doesn't ring true with the story. and it doesn't ring true after seeing the movie and wishing they hadn't wasted the talent of such good actors.
