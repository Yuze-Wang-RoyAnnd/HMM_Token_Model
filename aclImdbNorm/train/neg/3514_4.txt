philip. k. dickian movie. and a decent one for that matter. better than the paycheck (woo) and that abomination called minority report (spielberg). but lets face it, the twisting and cheesing ending was a bit too much for me. half way through the movie i already started to fear about such kind of ending, and i was regrettably right. but that does not mean that the film is not worth its time. no, not at all. first half (as already many here have commented) is awesome. there are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that showmanship is highly important thing in the future (we will do such kind on corny sf things because we can) or is it simply over combining. but the paranoia is there and feeling "out of joint" also. good one.
