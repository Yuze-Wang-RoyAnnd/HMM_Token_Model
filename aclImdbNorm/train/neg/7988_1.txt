anita and me seems to be little more than an excuse for meera syal, the author of the novel and screenplay, to air her prejudices, grievances and general antipathy towards the english. the general sentiment of indian superiority over the english in this film is foul.<br /><br />the english people in this film are portrayed as overweight, violent, foul-mouthed, promiscuous, engaging in child neglect, stupid, uneducated, racist, ugly, eating poor food, and dim-witted -- tellingly, only by turning to indian culture can the local priest be "redeemed" at the end of the film.<br /><br />by contrast, the indian family are beautiful, clever, educated, can speak many languages, are caring and loving parents, and grammar-school fodder. the film is so insidiously prejudicial that i am astonished the bbc funded it at all. had it been the other way round, an english family in an indian community depicted this way, the film would have been seen as racist.<br /><br />there were a few moments where my eyebrow shot so far up my forehead, i thought it would lodge in my hairline. first, the gossip scene between the women at the divali celebration -- undertext: the english are dirty and promiscuous -- and the men -- undertext: english women are prostitutes. second, the meal with anita where neema's family lie to her about cutlery -- undertext: the english are so stupid, you can make them do anything.<br /><br />but the underlying contempt towards anything english -- even english weddings are an object of scorn -- is evident all the way through the film. the character of anita was drawn so appallingly -- almost the fallen woman trope -- that i finished the film feeling angry.<br /><br />this is not a "bend it like beckham" where the humour is focused on loving exaggerations of a community's behaviour and customs from somebody within that community, and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together. instead, anita and me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable, as the english are almost an version of the indian untouchable caste, and this is underscored by a thinly-veiled series of attacks upon the film's "other" community: the english.<br /><br />i felt anita and me is a hate-filled, grievance-based piece of work. on that basis, the bbc should not have funded its production.
