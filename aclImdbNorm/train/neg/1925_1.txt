ron howard directed this? the 1966 cartoon is charming, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot. in this movie, howard gives us a whoville filled with greedy, manipulative, self-centered whos. jim carrey is terrible, but i'm sure it's not his fault; i imagine the script called for the nastiest person imaginable, so carrey channeled tom green and the result is movie magic. much like danny devito's penguin in batman returns, carrey's grinch is so thoroughly unlikeable that any degree of comedy that might be mined from his character simply evaporates. where the 1966 cartoon featured a grinch that we could all identify with, carrey's grinch is that angry, soulless old man that we've all seen at one time or another, sitting in a parked car muttering to himself or tripping toddlers at the supermarket with his cane. this grinch is thoroughly bereft of any degree of humanity, humor, or insight whatsoever, and his redemption at the end of the movie rings false. the whole movie rings false: there is some stupid christmas lighting competition, a failed attempt at explaining why the grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood, and an indecipherable mystery as to why some of the whos have that weird lip extension and some of them don't. contrary to the 1966 cartoon, i would imagine children would find this movie tiresome, irritating, and filled with contradictory messages. did we really need to see slutty smurf, aka christine baranski as martha may whovier? in addition, ron howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives. throw in the requisite butt jokes, fart jokes, sex jokes, and other obligatory carreyesque low-brow humor, and you have a movie that is about as far from the 1966 cartoon (or book that inspired it) as george w. bush is from rational, lucid thought. thumbs down on this big fat turkey.
