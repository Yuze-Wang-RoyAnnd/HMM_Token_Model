chilly, alienating adaptation of rebecca west's book about an army captain returning from duty in wwii with his memory impaired (now there's an original idea!). it seems he remembers old flame glenda jackson but not current wife julie christie, which should be enough to set off some emotional sparks. this extremely well-cast soaper brings together leading man alan bates with director alan bridges and co-stars jackson, christie, ann-margret, and ian holm, but the burners are all on low. there are a handful of good scenes (particularly whenever jackson is on-screen), but bridges' pacing is unrelievedly sluggish and the film's dulled-out color is enervating. long on the shelf, this "soldier" is best left forgotten. *1/2 from ****
