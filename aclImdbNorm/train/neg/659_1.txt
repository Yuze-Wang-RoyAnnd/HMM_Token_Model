this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood. the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business. the idea that audiences paid to see this movie (and like an idiot i rented the film) is discouraging also.<br /><br />obsessed teacher (3 years prior) kills teenager's family because he wants her. for no reason he kills the mother, father and brother. from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction. years later, obsessed teacher breaks out of prison. hmm--usual bad writing--no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute. obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around, sniff out people and with a knife is super killer. sure!!! now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason, knifes bellhop for the fun of it, and starts to hunt down the teenager's friends. now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you. obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel---again it is stupid, ever cop would know his face--but he walks right by them. now he kills two cops outside teenager's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend.<br /><br />there is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage. if any other profession put out work of this low quality, they would be fired. yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash.
