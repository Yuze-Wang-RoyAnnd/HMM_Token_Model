very unnecessary movie with characters that are acting so unsympathetically that i really didn't care who would fare the best (or was that the purpose of the film, to portray some smooth talking cold-hearted new york city folks?) no romance here, no comedy either. acting is very flat and a very predictable plot. what annoyed me the most was this constant joking with quotes from classic movies. man, can't you see that the more you quote, the less significant your own movie becomes? try to be original yourself! a small budget is no excuse at all, first-time director neither. crappy, crappy, crappy. no wonder it only cost me one buck...
