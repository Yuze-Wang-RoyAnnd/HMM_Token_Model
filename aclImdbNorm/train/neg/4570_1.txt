ridiculous. this movie is actually a vehicle for the ramtha school of enlightenment. if you are wondering who the *bleep* ramtha is: "ramtha is a 35,000 year-old spirit-warrior who appeared in j.z. knight's kitchen in tacoma, washington in 1977. knight claims that she is ramtha's channel. she also owns the copyright to ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks hollywood's version of elizabethan english in a guttural, husky voice. she has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as ramtha at seminars ($1,000 a crack) and at her ramtha school of enlightenment, and from the sales of tapes, books, and accessories (clark and gallo 1993). she must have hypnotic powers. searching for self-fulfillment, otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold, muddy, doorless maze." john wheeler, one of america's finest theoretical physicists, would roll his eyes about this movie. he has in the recent past criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretations of quantum theory. this movie does the same thing as those fools.<br /><br />there is a great review of this movie at skeptico. i recommend anyone considering watching this movie read it first before contributing to a cult's coffers.<br /><br />http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html i noticed one reviewer here at imdb say to take this movie with a grain of salt. it will take enough salt to kill a horse to wade through the garbage-thinking of this movie.
