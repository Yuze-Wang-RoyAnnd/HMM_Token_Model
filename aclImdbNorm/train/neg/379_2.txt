the tv guide calls this movie a mystery. what is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents. this is bollywood at its best/worst, i honestly cannot tell the difference. nauseatingly sweet, kitschy clich'es on every level, story-line, situations, dialog, music and choreography. to put it bluntly, you must be a retard to enjoy it. i watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when i had to walk away from it, because i could not take it any more. the only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses. <br /><br />
