whale-hunters pick on the wrong freaking whale.<br /><br />a group of yahoo whale exploitists capture a female and string her up by her tail-fin. the whale's mate sees the whole thing including the moment the female's unborn baby slips out and slops onto the deck. 'captain nolan' (richard harris) could tell that the big male is really mad by the way it stared him down as if to say, "get out of town before high-tide." <br /><br />this story of revenge has harris' presence and bo's beauty, but not much else. this was bo's first 'released' film, though her first acting job was four years previous in 'and once upon a love' released in 1981 as 'fantasies' (directed by john derek).<br /><br />p.s. today, the date of this review (november 20), is bo derek's birthday. i hope bo has a 'whale' of a good time..... get it?..... whale?..... hee-hee.
