'home alone 3' is the first of the home alone movies not to feature culkin in the main role and the same villains. however, the plot is very similar to the original 'home alone' film. instead of two comical villains, we get three or four of them. this film involves some traps, but it also has a long scene with a remote-control car. the slapstick humour is consistent as well, but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film. (no pun intended.) this film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did, and there really is not the warm, holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had. it's more of a pure comedy, but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me. i would not recommend this film; it's pretty boring. if you are seeking a good holiday family film with comedy, then watch the original 'home alone' movie.
