while flipping through the channels on a late saturday night, my friends and i stumbled across this film. first of all, irish actor pierce brosnan as a native american? seriously?! his accent was breaking through so much, although his character was apparently scottish. next, i was stunned to find that this film was made after he had already played james bond/agent 007 at least twice. this movie plays up the stereotypes, with the inspiring professor figure. the girl who played pony should be paid to keep her mouth shut. and, this film won an award? i cannot believe it. brosnan is an attractive man, but we seriously wanted to gauge our eyes out after watching this for just 10 seconds. we switched from "kicking and screaming" to this, and we wanted to switch back. we watched the 1995 children's classic "the indian in the cupboard" earlier in the night, which also discussed the iroquois. the following line represents our desire to run away: "take me outside, earth grasper." from "grey owl": "if you don't like it, you don't have to watch."
