while i certainly consider the exorcist to be a horror classic, i have to admit that i don't hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do. as a consequence of that, i haven't seen many of the exorcist rip-offs, and if exorcismo is anything to go by, i'll have to say that's a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it! in fairness to the other exorcist rip-offs, this is often considered one of the worst, and so maybe it wasn't the best place for me to start. it's not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically it's the same as the one in the exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit (which happens to be the spirit of her dead father). the village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism. like many spanish horror films, this one stars paul naschy, who is pretty much the best thing about the film. exorcismo was directed by juan bosch, who previously directed the derivative spanish giallo 'the killer wore gloves'. i haven't seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: i believe that originality wasn't one of his strong points. there's not a lot of good things i can say about the film itself; it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scene isn't worth waiting for. i certainly don't recommend it!
