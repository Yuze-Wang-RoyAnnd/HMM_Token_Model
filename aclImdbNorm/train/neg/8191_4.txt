"fred claus" somehow avoids becoming this year's "the santa clause" by at least having a bit more amusing moments than that tim allen starrer, but it doesn't mean that it's got enough going for it that's worth a trip to the theater.<br /><br />as holiday movies go, it's contrived and sentimental. but actually, that could be the least of one's concern as "fred claus," boasting of having david dobkin ("shanghai knights," "the wedding crashers") at the helm, contains virtually nary a genuinely funny moment as it clumsily treads the line between a boorish vince vaughn vehicle and a fuzzy christmas film. in the end, it amounts to not much of both. and with a cast that comprises of paul giamatti, kevin spacey, rachel weisz, and kathy bates, all the more it leaves one disappointed.<br /><br />vaughn plays fred, nick's (giamatti) older and estranged brother, who once upon a time, left him and their parents (bates and trevor peacock) after having had enough of enduring his parents' favoritism of his younger sibling. nick grows up to be santa claus (and as the voice-over tells us, time freezes on you and your family when you become a saint), while fred becomes a yuletide-jaded repo man in chicago who's having a hard time remembering his girlfriend wanda's (weisz) birthday.<br /><br />he runs in trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother (who eerily looks at least a decade older than him) to bail him out of jail. nick agrees but only if fred agrees to help out on the toy-wrapping business up in the north pole. fred reluctantly agrees but his cynicism clashes with santa and the elves' perpetually cheery nature, even as an efficiency expert (spacey) is checking on the toy factory operations, only too happy to have the whole arctic operations shut down if things fail.<br /><br />the film, as said, does have its moments, but the padded running length stretches them thin across its duration. in between are piles of christmas film clich'es that were handled better in, say, "elf" and the attempts at sentimentality are as endearing as last year's fruitcake.<br /><br />vaugn, as usual, brings on his coarse charm to the table, but the neutered script of dan fogelman keeps him from really doing his thing. giamatti, underneath the bad fat suit, brings a jolly old charm to his iconic character, but unfortunately, has to play second fiddle to fred. spacey brings his game face, but his turns usually end as unfunnily vapid.<br /><br />ultimately, "fred claus" becomes a forgettable film that falls below what those involved in it deserve. sure, there are worse ways to start the season at the cinema, but there are certainly far better ways.
