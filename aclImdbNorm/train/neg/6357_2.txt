i am so disappointed. this movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy. here was the quintessential woody allen film all over again: the neurotic upper-class manhattanites debating whether or not they will cheat on their spouses. woody, i've seen these characters already, i've seen the storyline from you ten times already. where did your creativity go??? you need to open your eyes and look around you. the world has changed dramatically since annie hall - and you need to change along with it.<br /><br />there are far more interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your brand of angst and neuroticism - why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over again.<br /><br />when i hear that woody allen has a new project coming out, it does nothing for me - because now i've come to expect his old standby: the couple who are growing tired of each other and end up cheating. depressing and same old, same old.<br /><br />if woody wants to win his fans back, then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be stimulated - not insulted.
