this film is about a japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on skin.<br /><br />the plot is absolutely bizarre. i fail to see any "sensual" or "erotic" undertones. the plot turns an ancient art form into a fetishistic pornography. in addition, the scenes that are filmed in hong kong are certainly portraying bad parts of hong kong, such as the airport in the middle of the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. throughout the whole film, i keep thinking that "the pillow book" is insulting the japanese culture and the hong kong environment.<br /><br />"the pillow book" is a perverted, yet boring film. seriously stay away from it.
