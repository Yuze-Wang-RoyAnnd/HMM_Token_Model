what a snore-fest.<br /><br />of all the bits of nostalgia that hollywood has decided to remake and update, this is by far one of the most pointless. this was a totally pointless show in the first place, and we really don't need a 'modern' update.<br /><br />never mind the bigotry and sexism inherent in the system from the beginning, so many advances have been made, socially, since the show ran that the entire point of the show (if it ever had one) has been lost.<br /><br />also, what is the point of having a character named boss hogg if he's not overweight?
