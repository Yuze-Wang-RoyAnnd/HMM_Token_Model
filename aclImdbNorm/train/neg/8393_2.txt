john carradine, john ireland, and faith domergue who as players all saw better days in better films got together for this grade g horror film about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion.<br /><br />for carradine it was in those last two decades of his career that he appeared in anything on the theory it was better to keep working no matter what you did and get those paychecks coming in. with that magnificent sonorous voice of his, carradine was always in great demand for horror pictures and the man did not discriminate in the least in what he appeared in.<br /><br />he plays the caretaker of an old gothic mansion who movie director john ireland has rented for his latest low budget slasher film. it's even got a graveyard, but with a missing occupant. faith domergue is ireland's aging star and carole wells is the young ingenue.<br /><br />in the last twenty minutes or so most of the cast winds up dead that aren't dead already. the script is so incoherent i'm still trying to figure out the point. i won't waste any more gray matter on it.
