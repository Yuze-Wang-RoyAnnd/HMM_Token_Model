ok the director remakes love actually the director nikhil advani after debuting with khnh does his second half and wait<br /><br />he makes a 3:30 hours + film which loses on patience, time.etc the viewer seems like a 3 hrs sleep watching this film<br /><br />ok they had 6 stories so it was necessary but why? 6 stories?<br /><br />we have the anil- juhi story convincing but boring don't tv serials show such stories?<br /><br />we have govinda- shannon story which is funny and works well <br /><br />we have akshaye-ayesha story again believable but gets boring soon and the focus is on comedy more and that too slapstick boring comedy<br /><br />we have salman- priyanka story which is the worst, not just acting terms, it makes no sense at all<br /><br />we have sohail- isha story to make you laugh and the trick works at times thanks to the boredom set by most of other stories<br /><br />we have john- vidya story a good story in all respects<br /><br />but then by the time all stories come in bits n pieces the viewer gets bored and sleepy the climax isn't appealing though especially the climax of salman- priyanka story nikhil advani's handling is alright at places, some stories are well handled but weak at places music(sel)is good, but too many songs cinematography is nice, every story is given a different look, texture and it works<br /><br />actors govinda rocks, after a dismissal comeback with bb he actually makes you laugh and love him in this film despite his age and weight anil kapoor acts his part well, though he looks out of shape and tired john excels in his part, akshaye khanna overacts for a change<br /><br />sohail khan is too over- the - top and isha has nothing to do anjana suknani is dismissal<br /><br />priyanka and salman deserve an award for this film you are shocked?<br /><br />salman khan doesn't act only, just talks like he is in his sleep and that fake accent oh god priyanka overacts to such a standard you feel like throwing something on her, she does get better towards the end vidya balan is good, juhi chawla is okay shannon is okay
