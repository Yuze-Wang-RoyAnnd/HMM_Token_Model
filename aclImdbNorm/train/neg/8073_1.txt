if the writer/director is reading this (and i imagine you are since you should now be out of work) then i must tell you - i have seen some bad movies in my time but this one gets the distinction of having the worst premise i've ever heard.<br /><br />spoilers - nothing happens! <br /><br />a total waste of time. i laughed out loud at the end. <br /><br />side note - (if the whole movie was her in a coma then does the scene where she sleeps with that guy mean someone raped her while she was knocked out?)<br /><br />utter rubbish.
