well, i have to say, this movie was so bad that i would have walked out if i didn't have to review it for work. and the worst part is, i wanted to see it so badly that i drove all over the city, paid $10 parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong. vince vaughn plays the guy he always does -- the only time i've seen him play someone else was in that movie with john travolta. anyways, the plot has potential -- it sounded great in the preview, but it is filled with totally ridiculous, predictable, weak plot turn points. and i was hoping that this would be one christmas movie where christmas didn"t have to be saved, and that santa didn't need a replacdmetn, but nope. the only cool part was the sleigh rides, and the little bladck kid was the best character. i'm sure this movie would be great for young kids, but for adults it's so lame that it's chore to sit through.
