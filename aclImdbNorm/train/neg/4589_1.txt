remember the chain-smoking channeler exposed on 60 minutes a few years ago? this is her. lots of folks reviewed this movie without checking the bona fides of the filmmakers. the producers have been using phony "word of mouth" promotions very successfully without disclosing the financial and philosophical underpinnings for this piece of marketing tripe. if you believe in channeling, reincarnation, new age dreck and day-old baloney, this film is for you. if you want a discussion of quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. the purpose of this movie is to convince you that ramtha isn't a wacko, so you'll give her a bunch of your money. if you can tiptoe through the ramtha website without howling in disbelief, then maybe you'll think the bucks you dropped on this infomercial for insanity was well spent. <http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=answerman>
