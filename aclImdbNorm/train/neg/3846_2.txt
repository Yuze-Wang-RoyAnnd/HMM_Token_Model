w. somerset maugham's of human bondage is supposed to be a english language classic. if so, much must have been missing from the film version here. phillip's (leslie howard) attraction to mildred (bette davis) is so utterly inexplicable as to make the scenario seem like the post-breakup retelling of a relationship from the man's point of view. being a family lawyer i've heard many such accounts; the man depicts himself as noble and always correct, and the woman is a hellion who has had no other objective than to exploit the man.<br /><br />indeed, unless one is willing to laugh at the social assumptions of the film maker, this is an uncomfortable movie to watch. phillip even indulges mildred when she brings over a baby of indeterminate paternity, but the real high point comes when phillip allows mildred - enraged and now of dubious sanity - the free run of his flat, with predictable results. bette davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but that period didn't occur here. in fact, by the end of the movie she looks a lot like the baby jane character she would play thirty years later.<br /><br />i note how howard's character is always impeccably dressed and groomed. it tells me that phillip craves middle class respectability. someone like that could not run from a woman with a course cockney accent fast enough. phillip is, for most of the movie, a student; such a person would have been more believable if he had been younger, and had the disheveled looks that bespeak the low income and the low self esteem that often accompanies student status - an english raskolnikov, as it will. and balanced that by allowing mildred a modicum of charm.
