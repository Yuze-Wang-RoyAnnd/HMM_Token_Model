this was allocated to the fans as the "winner takes all" match occurred between two separate "companies" (the world wrestling federation and the "alliance": an amalgamation of former wcw and ecw superstars. because the final match to duduce the superior company was a tag-team match, the wrestlers were confined to tossing opponents from each side of the ring to another; each wrestler concludes that in order to debiliate their opponents and to intensify the match, interfernce is necessary. each wrestler merely pummels an opponent with punches, executes a special move, and tags in a partner. the storyline had previously been tarnished by the subterfuge of vince that a member of the allance would be fradulent and join the wwf. it was obvious, with that statement, that the wwf would prevail. overall: very innovative storyline but poor execution, which is not the scarcity of the wrestlers because the match format is tag-team. the remaining matches are just revolting:<br /><br />edge versus test: potent "big boot" by test, but this did not display the true talents of both stars<br /><br />al snow versus christian: good match but superflous to the pay-per-view<br /><br />taji versus william regal: the worst match of the night<br /><br />immunity battle royal: this was an outstandingly fun match to watch, but because the main stars of both companies were involved in the main event, only a wrestler who characteristically appears on "heat" and is probably a wcw light-heavyweight reject (i.e. the hurricane who is merely hired as an entertainer)<br /><br />hardy boyz versus dudley boyz: the best match of the night: jeff hardy executed a "swanton bomb" from the summit of a cage and through a wooden table and matt was wedged into the cage, which appeared to be extremely painful.<br /><br />because stone cold was the wwf champion, rob van dam was the hardcore champion, and kurt angle was a "mole" in the alliance, all fundamental stars in the main event on the faction of "the alliance" were granted work after the match's outcome, except for booker t., who recently attacked a wrestler on "raw" and will inevitably be given work. shane mcmahon will return to television somehow, and everyone desired to witness the downfall and demise of "the alliance" to see stone cold out of work. the wwf has done much better. a match in which all tiltes were brought to one faction would have been better, and what ever became of casket and iron man matches?
