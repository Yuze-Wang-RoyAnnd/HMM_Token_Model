did francis ford coppola have a brain aneurysm some time after directing "apocalypse now" that made him absolutely incapable of making a good movie? <br /><br />you have to wonder what the director of "the godfather" and "the conversation" was thinking when he made this flabby film. it gives kathleen turner a starring vehicle, playing a woman who travels back in time and gets to redo her adolescence knowing all of the things that life as an adult has taught her, and turner, the trooper that she is, does what she can with it, but this movie couldn't be saved by anyone.<br /><br />it doesn't even have any style to it, and, given its director, one would expect that even if it had nothing else, it would have that.<br /><br />grade: c-
