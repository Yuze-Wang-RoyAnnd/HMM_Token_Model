my brother is an avid dvd collector. he took one look at the cover (two models on toilets) and had to add it to his collection. i stayed up with him to watch what turned out to be likely the most cringeable movie (i use that term loosely) i've felt obligated to sit through. i dared not make eye contact with my brother, quite certain he must have been cursing the receipt in his clenched fist. the biggest name in the whole movie is michael clark duncan who appears in one scene, which the "filmmaker" decided to show every take of (about four total) throughout the movie. in fact, the whole movie pretty much follows this suit. the fact that the dvd contained deleted footage was a shock. (i went to bed without viewing it, however). to no surprise at all, i found this disc without its case behind the tv about a week later.
