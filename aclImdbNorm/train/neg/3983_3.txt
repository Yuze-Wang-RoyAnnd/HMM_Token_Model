irene dunne finished her illustrious career with this so-so movie. she should have gone out with a bang, being the classy actress she was, not in this unmemorable, almost unknown film. <br /><br />this lightweight comedy is okay, but nothing special. the first half of it is far better as it gets pretty stupid in the second half. maybe irene could see the handwriting on the wall and quit. even her high-pitched voice got a bit annoying in here. rumor has it she was not happy with this film. one can see why.<br /><br />the story reminded me of a 1950s television sitcom. speaking of that, i thought david nelson from the ozzie & harriet tv show was in this movie but it turned out to be a very young richard crenna. he looked and sounded just like nelson.<br /><br />overall, so-so at best and a sub-par ending for a great actress.
