went to see this movie hoping to see some flashes of the jet li we were amazed by in lethal weapon 4. unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly fake that it took even that enjoyment out of it. the flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you couldn't see the wires holding him up as he flies through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks.<br /><br />too cartoonish and very disappointing.
