the good: i liked this movie because it was the first horror movie i've seen in a long time that actually scared me. the acting wasn't too bad, and the "cupid" killer was believable and disturbing.<br /><br />the bad: the story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak. there just wasn't much to it. the ways the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting. i do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore.<br /><br />overall: a good scare, but a bad story.<br /><br />** out of *****
