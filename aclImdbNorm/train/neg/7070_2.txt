boy oh boy oh golly gee,<br /><br />the most interesting thing in the movie was the hilarity of the bluescreen effects used to create mom's "invisibility." they looked like they were shot on cheap video, and it looks totally unreal, and not even in a good way where its so funny that you end up loving the movie...<br /><br />i did not end up loving this movie. the attempted "steadicam" shots were really pathetic as well. i mean, hey, if they had a low budget flick, that's fine. you can still make a great movie with a low budget. but, a bad movie and a low budget and effects. that makes for a bad combination. in this case, such a doomed combo created the craptastic film, "invisible mom." if you have kids, and your kids have no taste, perhaps they will stay awake through all of this one.
