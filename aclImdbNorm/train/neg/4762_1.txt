i saw this movie not knowing anything about it before hand. the plot was terrible with large gaps of information missing. the movie didn't have the "battle of wits" feel to me. the actors just spewed out mouthful's of nonsense, at times causing me to gnash my teeth in agony as they droned on and on. the plot was predictable except for the stomach sickening homo erotic scene at the end (i'm not homophobic but made me physically sick to my stomach), even the ending was predictable. and you could tell the detective was jude law in a costume, everything from the fake accent, terrible dental work, costume shop facial hair, everything pointed to it being a disguise. the whole movie just felt like wasted time out of my life. this movie had the feel of a puppet show with jude law and michael caine as puppets and the house as the window to view the show, really boooring in my opinion.
