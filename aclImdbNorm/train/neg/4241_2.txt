yeah, madsen's character - whilst talking to the woman from the tv station - is right: the lapd is a corrupt, violent and racist police. and this movie changes nothing about it. okay, here are the good cops, the moral cops, even a black one, whow, a christian, a martyr. but this is a fairy tale, admit it. reality is not like that. and most important for the action fans: the shoot out is boring. it's just shooting and shooting and shooting. nothing more. play counter strike, then you will at least have something to do. the only moral of this film is: the lapd is good now. no more bad cops in it. if you like uncritical, euphemistic commercials for police and military service, watch this movie. it's the longest commercial i've ever seen. (2 points for camera and editing).
