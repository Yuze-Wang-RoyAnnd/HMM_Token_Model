the story is about the life of common people from antwerp, living their lives. so i said it, and there is nothing more actually to tell about the story. the movie is fast, like an mtv-flick, and well photographed and we feel that the director is talented and should do more films. so let's forget about this one and hope for the best with the next deus-barman picture.
