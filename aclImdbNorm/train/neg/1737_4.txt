the final film for ernst lubitsch, completed by otto preminger after lubitsch's untimely death during production, is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness, romance and music, fantasy and costume dramatics. in a 19th century castle in southeastern europe, a countess falls for her sworn enemy, the leader of the hungarian revolt; she's aided by her ancestor, whose painted image magically comes to life. betty grable, in a long blonde wig adorned with flowers, has never been more beautiful, and her songs are very pleasant. unfortunately, this script (by samson raphaelson, taken from an operetta by rudolf schanzer and e. welisch) is awash with different ideas that fail to mesh--or entertain. the results are good-looking, but unabsorbing. *1/2 from ****
