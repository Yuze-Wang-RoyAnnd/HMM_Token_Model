this film was on late at night when i saw it. it was interesting at start but it didn't convince me as a whole. i am no tyson fan. in fact i don't like boxing at all. it's barbaric, obscene and double faced (by society) that some get money for beating each other up.<br /><br />nevertheless, i felt the start of the film was ok. actors alright, especially george c. scott (as cus d'amato). i don't know how reliable the flick is. i haven't read books and books about boxing or tyson. i don't know anything about the man, but it was quite entertaining.<br /><br />as the movie went on i felt it lost a little of it's charm and i also lost interest. i managed to stay awake though but the last hour was just not good enough.
