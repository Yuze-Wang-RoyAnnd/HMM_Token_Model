there was something here with the female lead having this perfect life she's always wanted after the worst life possible, beginning as a child prostitute and winding up with eric roberts. but her background makes it impossible for her to trust dean cain and this utterly destroys it in the end. it sounds weird, but i like the position dean cain was in at the end and the choice he made. he can't hurt her because he loves her and she's the mother of his child (i think the time frame makes it clear it's his child and not his brother's), but at the same he can't forgive her for all she's done, sleeping with his brother (which shows the love and obligation he felt was pretty much one way) and then being part of his death. in better hands this would have been a better movie, but for something i caught on late night cable, it's not bad.
