this review may contain some spoilers.<br /><br />the remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie gone in 60 seconds begins well. actually it is well acted and the plot moves quite well. but even a big hollywood budget doesn't change the fact that the original plot was more believable. for those who don't know, the original plot had the thieves working as insurance inspectors. who would suspect them. but even with a change to nearly every aspect of h.b. halicki's original, the remake is a very good movie, until we get to the final chase scene, the part of the 74 version that made it great. the one in this version is watered down, only 10 minutes, and it culminates in a monster special effect that takes all believability out of the chase. where the original chase was very believable, the star was a stunt driver who did all his own stunt, the remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes. my advice, if you want to watch a classic car chase film, fine the original in the bargain bin at your local rental joint and stay clear of the new remake.
