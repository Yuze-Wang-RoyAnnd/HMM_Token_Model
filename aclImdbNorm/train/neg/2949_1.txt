wow... what would you do with $33m? let me give you a choice; you can either a) shred it and flush it down the toilet or b)make a film based on the premise of whoopi goldberg as a hard nut futuristic cop partnered with a rubber dinosaur who uses terms like "i didn't butt trumpet" and blows raspberries on the basis that this is funny. that's right, you would choose the option that has more merit - flushing down the toilet.<br /><br />this has to be seen to be believed. i cannot even find the words to describe how bad this film is. it doesn't even fit into the "so bad - it's good" category. i actually have it on the television as i write - and whilst watching i felt the need to come onto imdb and register my disgust.<br /><br />considering jurassic park was made a couple of years before, how on earth did they think that audiences would any longer tolerate a man dressed in a rubber suit? wg should have simply walked and damn the consequences. everyone concerned will go to hell for this criminal waste of money.<br /><br />i have to stop writing - i am about to implode.
