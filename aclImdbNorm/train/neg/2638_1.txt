there is good. there is bad. and then their is the sentinel, a bottom-barrel political "thriller" that ranks among the worst movies i have ever seen. the plot of a mole in the secret service is a good one, but never has a movie with so much potential been so utterly butchered. directed with ham-handed "edginess" by clark johnson, every actor in this film seems to be working on autopilot. even the great michael douglas looks bored here. i can honestly say i have never, in all my life, viewed another film with so many glaring plot holes. the twist is predictable from square one, and the character's motives are so utterly ridiculous that they inspired laughter from the audience. avoid this at all costs. this is a catastrophe of a movie with no redeeming value.
