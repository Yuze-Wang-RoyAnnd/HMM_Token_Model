i think i watched this movie, but don't quote me, as i may have fallen asleep during watching it as it didn't exactly "grip my excitement and imagination." at least i know i watched enough of it to know i won't be watching it again soon. or ever.<br /><br />jeez, talk about lame... really lame. totally lame. it wouldn't even appeal to a six year old. it basically had no worthwhile dramatic impact. zilch. nada. just shlock turned into dreck. comedy? that was supposed to be comedy? ya coulda fooled me-ee-ee...!<br /><br />now, if the aliens had been insatiably carnivorous like in the movie "critters", we could have had the human characters do something a little more profound than be overly smugly cutesy... like yelling and screaming and running for their lives so they wouldn't be eaten so the story could be something more exciting than watching paint dry.<br /><br />don't bother watching this. it's not worth the effort. you can find something more interesting to do. like watching paint dry. or falling asleep.
