for romantic comedies, i often judge the quality of the film based upon the mistiness of my eyes by the end of the experience. unfortunately for "the wedding date," i can only rate the film with 4 out of 10 possible tears.<br /><br />my apologies to fans of debra messing and dermot mulroney, but i did not see much chemistry between their two characters. the premise of the film is a reverse "pretty woman," with dermot playing the role of nick, a high-priced male escort hired by debra's character kat to accompany her to england for her sister's wedding. a romantic relationship presumably develops between patron and client. but the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. and there weren't enough romantic sparks flying in the relationship of nick and kat.<br /><br />in a supporting role, amy adams was a standout as kat's sister. whenever amy came on screen, she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the film's energy. perhaps if amy adams had been cast in the role of kat, the film might have had more dynamism. but as it turned out, instead of reaching for kleenex, i was looking for the visine in attempt to at least pretend that this film had some genuine sentiment and romance.
