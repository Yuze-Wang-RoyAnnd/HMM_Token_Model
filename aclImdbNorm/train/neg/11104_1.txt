i am not one of those people who just go online after i see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made. if you doubt me, please look at my other reviews. however, for the first time ever, i have seen a movie so horrible that i wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over.<br /><br />i love bad movies. to me, ed wood is a genius, i thought bloody murder, jeepers creepers and most horrible horror movies were good. however, there is not a single good thing i can say about this film.<br /><br />the plot is basically non existent. if someone reading my review wastes their money to see it, they can discern for themselves what the plot might be, but i advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie.<br /><br />the special effects are bad.<br /><br />the acting is bad.<br /><br />the two leads are attractive, but that's all there is.<br /><br />i am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone, but i invite anyone to email me at foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it. i will tell you anything.<br /><br />i love bad movies, and i love horror and i love new inventive movies. i even love horror porn stuff like hostel (which some reviewers claimed this was like, but obviously they only thought so cause roger bart was in this and hostel 2). but this may be the number 1 most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie ever made.<br /><br />and before you disregard this review, this is coming from someone who not only sat through the entire premiere of house of the dead, but actually bought a copy of it.
