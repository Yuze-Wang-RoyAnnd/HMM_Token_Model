christ. a sequel to one of the most cloying films of all time, this at least has the decency to leave out the songs (bar a reprise of the unbearable "tomorrow") but does continue the tradition of being nauseating and unfunny. this time, annie and her friends head off to london and get caught up in joan collins's plot to blow up buckingham palace or some such shite. the movie has a bizarrely sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how irritating she is: every time the little bugger squeals "leapin' lizards!" i could feel my teeth grinding themselves down into powder. drearily photographed, slushy and plodding, the movie has only one memorable line ("unhand me, you stupid genius!") and the fact that it's not the original to recommend it.
