three story lines and not enough tying them together, "inside man" was very jumpy and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. though having its moments, the movie started off looking like a fast thriller which quickly grounded to a slow crawl, jumped quickly between highs and lows, and only barely picked up steam again near the last 20 minutes. i will give credit to denzel washington, he played his part extremely well with a full grasp of his human side and not just the typical "super-detective" with all the answers. clive owen also did quite well with his duality part as "evil genius" and "criminal mastermind" (both not the same in retrospect). overall though, each person individually created a great sub-section. yet, when the parts finally came together and everything counted, there was no sudden "ah-ha!" or summation of everything. it all ended up with very little of the energy it began with, with a lot of plot-holes, tons of questions, and as i said earlier, no where near spike lee's normal level. i have to completely disagree with the so-called "professional critics"... this is not the movie they play it up to be.
