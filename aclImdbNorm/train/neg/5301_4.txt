i bought this movie because this was shah rukh khans debut.and i also liked to see how would he do.i must say he is excellent in his role.divya bharathi is superb in this movie.rishi does a wonderful job.susham seth supported well.alok nath was good in his role.amrish and mohnish did their parts well too.dalip also was good in his small role.actors shine in a mediocre movie.the direction is average.the editing is poor.the story is boring.it tells us about ravi a famous pop singer.he has a lot of female fans.one of them is kaajal.ravi and kaajal fall in love and get married.ravi gets killed by his cousins.kaajal becoems a widow..to escape from ravis cousins.they go to bombay.she comes across raja.she falls in love with him and gets married.ravi returns.the story is predictable.the climax is predictable.the first half bores.it also drags a lot.but it is saved by the actors and music.the second half entertains.the music is catchy with some nice songs.the cinematography looks outdated in the first half but it looks unimaginative.the song picturisations are dull except for "sochenge tumhe pyar" and one rain song.the costumes are outdated.any way watch this just for the actors and music rating-4/10
