after watching this thing, then reading the summary on the back of the dvd, then thinking back to actual movie....i became a bit dizzy. i thought, maybe i fell asleep and dreamed i was a down syndrome baby waltzing through a never ending forest where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop for no purpose other then occasional tasteless lesbianism. where (zombies?) come out of nowhere and (vampires?) who (seduce?) pure hearted citizens on their way to save the world. neither zombie nor vampire notably encounter each other. the only fighting i remember was getting that walrus bonny giroux's panties off. coo coo ca fat! all of them! maybe that was because we were watching it widescreen stretched and were too lazy to change it to its native resolution, but that actually made it more entertaining... in conclusion my trailing thought thesis had more continuity, plot, character development, antagonism, subject matter, and acting then the entirety of this film. it made bloodrayne look like citizen f***ing kane
