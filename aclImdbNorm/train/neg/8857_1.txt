this film is really bad,so bad that even christopher lee cannot save it.a poor story an even poorer script and just plain bad direction makes this a truly outstanding horror film,the outstanding part being that it is the only horror film that i can honestly say i would never ever watch again.this garbage make plan nine from outerspace look like oscar material.
