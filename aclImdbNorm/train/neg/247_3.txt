it was 9:30 pm last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park (a new episode). the thing is, in my country, south park airs at 10:30 pm and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing, father of the pride. i'll start by saying that i have only watched to episodes. the first time i watched it, i found it unfunny and crude for nothing, so i thought ''holy sh*t, i have a football game early tomorrow, so i have to stop watching stupid cartoons''. but yesterday, i tried to give father of the pride a second chance. i find that it's a complete rip-off of the simpsons, only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead.<br /><br />the second thing is i wonder why it got it's tv-14 rating. i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual (unfunny) jokes. the simpsons is also a lot more violent (halloween specials) and crude. i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek 2, well i've got news for him: shrek 2 was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family thematic. however, i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile (even burst out laughing once) three or four times.<br /><br />all in all, i don't mind father of the pride. i don't hate it, but i don't like either. i've seen way better from ''the simpsons''.<br /><br />3.5/10
