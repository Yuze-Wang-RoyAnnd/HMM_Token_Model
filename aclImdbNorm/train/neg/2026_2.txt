there was such a hype about a game show with bill shatner...and especially right in the wake of deal or no deal and 1 vs 100. so, of course everyone had to tune in to see what all the fuss was about on the new game show. what a disappointment! as ben stein so stoically and nasally says, "wooww".<br /><br />the only thing likable about this show was the fact that you knew it would eventually be over. sitting through a full hour of it was like going to the dentist...you find yourself looking at the clock in what you think are 10 minute intervals, only to find out that only a minute has passed (but seemed like an eternity) since you last glanced at the clock. so, why didn't i just switch the channel? well, probably for the same reason most other people didn't...out of sheer optimism. i mean, no one really *wants* to think that a show with bill shatner could actually be so bad.<br /><br />personally, from the first 15 minutes, i never thought this was the kind of vehicle that would showcase the talents of william shatner. my chief complaint was that the set was so dark. watching it left me feeling depressed. you kept on wanting to get ahold of a little excitement, but there was just none to be had. there was not even enough light on the set to get a feel of energy from the audience (who you couldn't even see).<br /><br />dear network: people do not watch game shows to cure their insomnia...they watch game shows to be excited and have a good time. please do us all a favor and lose this in the vault.
