it was all over with the slashers around 88 so it was time for the cheesy rip offs of those older movies. the brain is well done, the script reminded me of videodrome but then in a more cheesy way as said before. the acting can go through with it. but it's the effects that makes you laugh, the so called brain is really a turkey and the blood is never shown. the opening sequence is what makes this movie worth watching, the hallucinations are really nicely done and reminded me of nightmare on elm street, remember the telephone coming alive.... some how you keep watching this flick, waiting what is happening next. it's viewable for all freaks out there cause there isn't any gore in it and as said the blood isn't there neither but there is nudity for the perverts. i have seen worser movies than this one, only wished they had made it bloodier...
