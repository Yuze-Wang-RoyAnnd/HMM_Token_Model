cornel wilde and three dumbbells search for sunken treasure in the south atlantic.<br /><br />the treasure-hunters led by wilde fight a group of territorial sharks with cute little sneers on their hungry faces. wilde and his merry men must find a way to take themselves off the menu so they can begin excavating an old spanish galleon filled with gold bullion.<br /><br />after the crew engages in a small eternity of pushing, shoving, arguing, and listening to wilde's annoying health tips, 5 crazy convicts board the boat and complicate things. now it is a battle of wits as to who gets the treasure and who gets to see what the inside of a shark's stomach looks like.<br /><br />at least wilde is in shape wearing exactly the same thing he wore in 'the naked prey' 10 years earlier and he has remained in excellent condition.<br /><br />made on a budget of 75 cents.
