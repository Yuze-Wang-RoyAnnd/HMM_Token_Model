how do i begin to review a film that will soon be recognized as the `worst film of all time' by the `worst director of all time?' a film that could develop a cult following because it's `so bad it's good?'<br /><br />an analytical approach criticizing the film seems both pointless and part of band-wagon syndrome--let's bash freely without worry of backlash because every other human on earth is doing it, and the people who like the film like it for those flaws we'd cite.<br /><br />the film's universal poor quality goes without saying-- 'sixteen years of alcohol' is not without competition for title of worst film so it has to sink pretty low to acquire the title and keep a hold of it, but i believe this film could go the distance. imdb doesn't allow enough words to cite all the films failures, and it be much easier to site the elements 'sixteen years of alcohol' does right. unfortunately, those moments of glory are so far buried in the shadows of this film's poorness that that's a task not worth pursuing.<br /><br />my impressions? i thought i knew what i was getting into, i had been warned to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this one (wish that suggestion had been cups of vodka). despite my low expectations, 'sixteen years of alcohol' failed to entertain me even on a `make fun of the bad movie' level. not just bad, but obnoxiously bad as though jobson intentionally tried to make this film a poetical yawn but went into overkill and shoved the poetry down our throats making it not profound but funny . .. and supposedly jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie? even after viewing the 'sixteen years of alcohol' promotional literature, i have trouble believing jobson's sincerity. pointless and obnoxious till the end with a several grin/chuckle moments (all i'm sure none intentional)spiced the film, and those few elements prevented me from turning the dvd off. so bad it's good? no. it had just enough 'i can't believe this is a serious movie moments' to keep me from turning it off, and nothing more.<br /><br />definitely a film to watch with a group of bad-movie connoisseurs. get your own running commentary going. that would've significantly improved the experience for me. so bad it's mike myers commentating in his cod scottish accent on it as it runs, to turn this whole piece of sludge into a comic farce "ok dare ma man, pass me annuder gliss of dat wiskey".
