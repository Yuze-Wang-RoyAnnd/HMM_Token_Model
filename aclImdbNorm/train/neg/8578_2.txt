one of the silliest movies of the 1940s, an unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring kay kyser. kyer, orchestra leader and radio-star (and eternal college fraternity goof-off), was sort of the precursor to spike jones, hamming it up for his guests and backed up willingly by his merry troupe of musicians. he's hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion, the kind where poison darts imported from africa are framed and hung on the wall. the shindig is beset with a creepy judge, a scary professor, an ominous swami, lots of giggly females, and enough bad jokes to fill three bob hope pictures. the songs (by jimmy mchugh and johnny mercer) are nothing to brag out, and neither is over-confident kyser, yukking it up with elbow-in-the-ribs material that turns 1940 back ten years. * from ****
