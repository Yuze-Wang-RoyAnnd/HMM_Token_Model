i've finally seen the incubus after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well, it surely wasn't worth waiting all this time to see it. the incubus is strictly by-the-number horror film: unseen killer/monster is raping and murdering women in a small town. <br /><br />the film goes like this: movie opens with killing; then blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; then another killing; even more blah blah blah; continuing with blah blah blah; yet another killing (surprising, huh?); blah blah blah, etc...<br /><br />the film is totally predictable from beginning to end. even the stupid "big" red-herring used throughout the movie wouldn't convince a 5 year old. and i figured out the secret identity of the incubus the moment i saw the character, so when the "shocking" surprise ending arrived, i wasn't shocked or surprised. in fact, it was so funny that i kept on chuckling days after i saw the movie. it's so silly!<br /><br />anyway, the film is so by-the-number that the "rock band" sequence is one of the few stand-out moments in this dreary flick. it's a stand-out scene not necessarily because it's good but because it's so funny and pointless: the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video-like moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously fake long hair cut, all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theater's washroom by the incubus. the best thing i could say about this film is the cinematography, which i actually liked. but aside from that, there's almost nothing worth mentioning about the incubus, except that it's unintentionally hilarious.
