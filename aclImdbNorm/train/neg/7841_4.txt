i thoroughly enjoyed a man called horse when it was released in 1970, but return played like a typical sequel. everything about it -- budget, script, plot, casting, and acting -- was inferior to the original. gale sondergaard as elk woman, an elder of the yellow hand tribe, looks nothing like an indian, and neither do half of the other "indians," who were played by italians, mexicans, and latinos with cheap wigs. and the old guy who played the chief acted more like a fat old squaw than a fierce leader of warriors. he even used the bow like a woman! finally, richard harris, who did such a superb job in the original, seems to be coasting this time around. i guess he couldn't resist the easy paycheck he got for reprising his role as horse.<br /><br />to be fair, there are some interesting moments in the movie, such as horse's undergoing a painful purification ritual to "find his vision" and rally the yellow hands against their indian enemies and white oppressors, but on the whole, return is uneven, boring, corny, and predictable -- just like most sequels.
