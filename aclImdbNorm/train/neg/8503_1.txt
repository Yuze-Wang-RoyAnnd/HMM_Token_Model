with all the european studios involved in this one, you would think you'd at least get some pretty photography; but the local color is kept to a minimum.<br /><br />irritation #1 is mira sorvino using a russian accent in order to play a spanish cop - wtf? the story is hopelessly confused. there's a supposed romantic back story that is intentionally confused - is she or isn't she a lesbian? - serving no purpose whatsoever. the cops in the movie are the most stupid to have graced a serial killer film in a long time. there seems to be some message about the mid-'30s spanish civil war but since pretty much everybody involved in that is dead, one doesn't see the point in it.<br /><br />despite the bull-fighting backdrop of part of the narrative (which part? who can tell), you never even get a good look at a bull fight. earnest hemingway would have punched the director in the nose - with my blessings.
