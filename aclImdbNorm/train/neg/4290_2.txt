i'll give this movie two stars because it teems with beautiful photography. otherwise, it teems mainly with clich'es and stereotypes: mountain people are either dumb white trash of the fanatically religious or ragged racist kind, or wise white indians. indians are magical people who move around without a sound, can disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals, and read minds over large distances. and so on and so forth.<br /><br />throughout the movie i kept wondering what the point of the film was (other than showing me pretty pictures of mountains, log cabins, woods, an assortment of animals, free-spirited mountain-dwellers and freaky people in church).<br /><br />the plot touched a whole range of issues but explored none of them in depth. this was neither a story about growing up during the depression, nor about about being an orphan, nor about a struggle for identity. it tried to be all of those things and more, which made it superficial and unsatisfactory.<br /><br />although the movie was supposed to be about little tree's education, we learn almost nothing about it. he was given a brief summary of the history of his people (who were brave and stoic) and a distillery demonstration; tried his hand at chopping wood (at which he failed) and whiskey running (literally); learned how to read (and maybe to write) with the help of grandma and her dictionary - and that was it. apparently he didn't learn much during his stint in boarding school because he was locked up in the attic.<br /><br />however, grandma and grandpa and graham greene's character made sure that in the end little tree became a very spiritual person whose main goal as an adult - after, and i'm paraphrasing here, "riding with the navajos" and "getting caught up in a couple of wars" - was to "catch up" with grandma and grandpa and graham greene's character in heaven (instead of, say, dating girls, getting married, having children or other such nonsense).<br /><br />last but not least i must say that i found grandpa's trade offensive. why of all things did it have to be a whiskey still? to counteract the stereotype of the "drunken indian"?
