a slick romanticizing of the sexual exploitation of neworleans black women by white men of power and privilege. ooh. does that whet your appetite? well, then, belly up to a vhs or dvd and gorge on this gratuitous trolling through a seamy segment of history. for good measure, it's adapted from the book by celebrated hack anne rice. the directing is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheesy dialog. most of acting is amateurish. the production's sole worthwhile note is that it employed practically a dozen black actors, all of whom have scarcely been in employed in today's market (jasmine guy, ben vereen, pam grier, eartha kitt), including some faces that have barely been seen at all (bianca lawson, rachel cuttrell). it also is, despite itself, a sterling showcase for nicole lyn. the pompous and ponderous james earl jones is on-hand as well. so, is the late ossie davis, a minimal talent who owes his success to having been affiliated with the legendary negro ensemble company. this film should be rated "t" for tripe.
