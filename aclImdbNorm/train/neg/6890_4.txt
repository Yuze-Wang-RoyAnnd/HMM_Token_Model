...except for jon heder. this guy tanked the entire movie.<br /><br />the plot sounded entertaining. a 29 year old slacker son(heder)still lives with widowed mom (keaton)who happens to meet a new love (daniels). slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. he also meets a girl(faris).<br /><br />i really liked the performance of daniels and especially faris but whoever casted hader would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach. heders performance is annoying, which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy, problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale. at the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you're upset about the end. in the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me!
