thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey, john carpenter and tommy lee wallace. this movie sucks on so many levels it's pathetic. the first vampires was fun, but this low budget retread makes me yawn.<br /><br />jon bon jovi (the poor man's kevin bacon) drives around mexico with a surfboard housing a hidden compartment holding his vampire killing gear ala antonio banderas's guitar case in desperado. he picks up some lame "hunters" along the way (including an annoyingly feminist infected girl who takes pills to keep from turning into a vampire), and they set out to stop some female master vampire who is given no backstory and so we could care less about her or her quest (to walk in the sunlight by stealing the black cross and performing a ritual to allow her to do so). if you've seen the first vampires, you've already seen this, and done much better.<br /><br />john carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately. frankly, i think he's past his prime and incapable of making another horror classic. the only decent film he's done since they live (1987) is vampires. everything else is complete crap, right up until the unbelievably cheap looking and retarded ghosts of mars... and now this waste of celluloid. where are more greats like assault on precinct 13, halloween (1), escape from new york and the thing?<br /><br />carpenter crony wallace proves he can't write his way out of a paper bag with his paper-thin script packed with yawns, groans and recycled gags from the original. did i mention i hated every character in the movie? there was not a single memorable character in the whole film. how does that happen? this film has nothing to recommend it. not even the dvd presentation is good; the menu looks awful.<br /><br />by comparison, jason x: "friday the 13th in space" was a masterpiece. now that is how you make a sequel and (re)energize a franchise, ladies and germs, as well as create an exciting dvd menu.
