this is kind of a weird movie, given that santa claus lives on a cloud in outer space and fights against satan and his minions...but it's still kinda fun.<br /><br />it has some genuine laughs...whether all of them were intentional is certainly debatable, though. this movie is not good, but i can say i really enjoyed watching it.<br /><br />i would recommend this movie over "santa claus conquers the martians", "santa claus" with dudley moore and john lithgow, or "the santa clause" with tim allen.
