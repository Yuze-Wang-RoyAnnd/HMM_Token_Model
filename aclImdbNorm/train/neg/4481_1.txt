i was skeptical when i first saw the calvin kline-esque commercials, but thought i'd give it a chance. so i've watched it, and all i can say is bleh. this movie was so bad. it's rare that i hate a movie this much. watching this flick reminded me of those funny scenes in altman's "the player," when the writers pitch their bizarre ideas to producers. i'd like to know which mtv producer decided that an hour and a half long music video adaptation of bronte (but this time heathcliff's name is heath and he's a rock star, and hindley's name is hendrix) would be a good idea.<br /><br />even that might not have been so bad, had they not gotten every other aspect of the film so horrible wrong as well. the direction must have been "you're lonely, pout for me." i laughed out loud during all the "serious" scenes and was bored throughout the rest. the camera work was jagged and repeatedly reminded me that i was watching a bad movie trying to be edgy. my theory is that the sound guy got bored and went down to the beach for a few beers with his boom -- all i could hear in half the scenes were the waves. and in the other scenes, i wish that's all i could hear. and speaking of sound, what they did to the sisters of mercy song "more" is absolutely inexcusable, then again, it's inexcusable what they did to bronte.<br /><br />on the bright side, there was one entertaining scene -- specifically the moment when johnny whitworth licked katherine heigl's face -- and if you can tell me what that scene had to do with all the rest of the story more power to you.
