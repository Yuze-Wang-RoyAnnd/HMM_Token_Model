when you have two tower house of performers pitched against each other, the least you can expect is the superb camaraderie and that is the case in this film where we have a 64 yrs old amitabh bachchan romances a 34-yr old tabu. wait! in fact that is all there in the name of plot therefore instead of "cheeni" it is the content that is "kum" in this adman turned writer-director r. balki's maiden effort..<br /><br />trust the two senior actors to bring the house down with their wise-cracks and bitter-sweet moments when love happened in this unconventional pair, and that is all you find in slow but refreshing first half. the locales of london as captured in rainy season are captivating. by the end of first half, romance completed and mission accomplished. there is not much left to be said. therefore in the second half a strange opposition comes in the form of girl's father to the extent that he goes for a satyagrah is really a test of patience. there is an equally strange climax about how he gives in. the result, second half is dry, flat with no energy. there is a subplot with a girl child dying of cancer, not making much impact. nonetheless, the film is recommended for its fresh approach and the performances.
