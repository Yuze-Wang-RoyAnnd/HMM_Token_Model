another fine effort by america's most underrated filmmaker. his knowledge on the subject of racism is staggering, and impresses me on more than one level. accusations that lee is really just a devious little racist, a poisonous dwarf who opportunistically exploits hollywood's affirmative action system to make movies of inferior quality is utter nonsense, mere right-wing propaganda. the very notion that lee would resort to misusing the current climate of political correctness in america in order to produce hate-filled anti-white movies is simply false and malicious.<br /><br />some of lee's detractors even go so far as to suggest that gotb glorifies african-americans, while putting down other races: obviously, another falsehood disseminated by people who are against peaceful co-existence between different races in america and elsewhere.<br /><br />my favourite scene in the movie is a lengthy dialogue early on between the rich black republican and the others in the bus. the views presented by that man are simply wrong - all across the board. 100% untrue. he lacks education, unlike the brilliantly informed guys who quite deservedly throw him off the bus.<br /><br />terrific performances, and an intelligent script make for a viewing experience that has been rarely rivaled by any political movies made since.<br /><br />i also want to point out the incessant lies that the million-man march had only 80,000 people taking part in it!<br /><br />(and now all you have to do is take the antonyms of all the words written in capital letters...)<br /><br />so what message does lee send here? if someone doesn't agree with your political views, you simply apply violence and throw him off the bus. i thought the movie said "get on the bus"...?<br /><br />apparently, mr.lee is for bus-segregation after all, i.e. is no different than those kkk lunatics before him: the bus is only for those blacks who are in line with the democratic party's line of thinking. so much for "freeing the slaves"...<br /><br />the end-credits: "this movie was entirely financed by black people." and distributed and marketed by a major hollywood studio run by jews and whites whom farrakhan despises...
