i can't believe i've just spent one and a half hours watching such a weak film. if there is only one film you have to miss, this is the one.<br /><br />robert is a teenager whose father's died recently so he starts hanging out with some local anti-social teenagers and using drugs. all these make him subconsciously more violent and at last such subconsciousness explodes...<br /><br />the first thing is that i don't think i can find any sense or trace of great ecstasy in this film, not in any single character. if the director considers what i saw in the last couple of minutes as great ecstasy, i have to say that that's not even close.<br /><br />the use of cinematography is also not mature. most of the time i couldn't see any facial expressions from the actors and i didn't feel the body language was sufficient enough to make an impact. maybe the crew was just so tired that they fixed the camera there to include everything in the settings. everybody happy except the audience.<br /><br />the plot is particularly weak. there are a lot of unrelated scenes and talking which might be supposed to be related but they are really so random that you can never pull them all together, perhaps unless you're the one who wrote them.<br /><br />in the one and a half hour you may find less than 5 minutes of real acting and all other time there are just people walking, talking and moving. so i really can't comment on acting here.<br /><br />nice choice of music in the last couple of minutes though. maybe this is the only good thing.<br /><br />i have never given a film a 1 but this film certainly deserves it (at least you laugh when you watch scary movies). this is a film about when a failed attempt to portray troubled teenagers meets extremely disturbed audience. hope you fall into neither group.
