plot: an amorous couple decide to engage in some extra-marital hijinks in a flashy car. they then become stuck (literally) in a compromising position, while said car wanders aimlessly about the countryside until the hapless couple are rescued by the authorities.<br /><br />that's it. that's the entire movie. there may have been some dialogue here and there, but nothing comes to mind. it should be obvious by now that this movie is not just pointless, but actually physically painful to watch. the fact that it starred two of the uks best up-and-coming actors (one of whom is now sadly deceased) only adds to the horror.<br /><br />ian charleson was outstanding in the very much deserved oscar-winning 'chariots of fire'. let's remember him for that role, and try hard to pretend that this particular celluloidal abomination never happened.
