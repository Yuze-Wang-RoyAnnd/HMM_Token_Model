ever wanted to eat worms? here's a 'documentary' to show you how! yeah...the kid eats live worms! and that's about the most interesting part of the movie.<br /><br />this movie has been pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as rather boring. i'm totally in agreement here. the movie just doesn't go anywhere....unless you're fond of worm eating! this is one movie it's almost impossible to write a spoiler for....because nothing much happens.<br /><br />now on the technical side: they should have given that kid a haircut. who's he trying to look like anyway...bozo the clown. it was almost comical...i almost expected him to turn into the shaggy dog or something.<br /><br />and on top of that; the kid was way too chunky to ever look hungry! should have kept him off the junk food for a couple of weeks before filming.<br /><br />all in all, this movie nearly put me to sleep. and my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before they left the scene for something more interesting.<br /><br />i will admit that the scenery was very impressive. and had there been a decent story to go with it, it might have made a hit.<br /><br />it did seem safe enough for kids to watch: the bear scenes and the 'oddball' eyeball were too weak to frighten most kids, and the brief 'skinny-dipping' scene didn't show anything.<br /><br />i gave this one a very generous 3.
