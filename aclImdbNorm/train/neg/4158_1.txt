this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen!!!! <br /><br />i can honestly say i have never seen a movie worse than this one!!!<br /><br />and i mean never!!!!<br /><br />i'm a big fan of "b" horror movies. as you may imagine.... i've been exposed to some of worst that the movie industry has to offer.<br /><br />i was lured to this movie by it's title. i mean c'mon... what true fan of horror wouldn't be intrigued by a title like "vampires vs. zombies"??? images of the "undead" battling each other to the "undeath" danced in my head. i thought to myself... "this i've got to see"!!!!<br /><br />well.... sorry to say.... "this i wish i hadn't seen"!!!!!<br /><br />this movies title is very misleading to say the least. there was no vampires fighting zombies. in fact, there is no plot!!!! if you were to ask me what this movie is all about i could honestly tell you i have no idea!!!<br /><br />there was no plot!!!! <br /><br />there was no story!!!! <br /><br />this movie absolutely makes no sense at all!!!!<br /><br />at the end of this debacle... i found myself feeling sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money into this project for they surely have no business sense!!!
