i loved the original. it was brilliant and always will be. strangely though, i actually looked forward to seeing the re-make. i'm usually a little bit against re-makes because there's far too many of them, but somehow this intrigued me. i was really enjoying it to begin with. caine brilliant, as usual, and jude law managing to hold is own next to him. it was quite clever how it was modernised and it was working. what stops this from being really good is the last seven minutes. it goes completely away from the original, so far in fact that is ceases to be clever and just gets annoying. the end in the original was fantastic! so much tension was built up and it was unbelievably clever! this? it grows not in tension but in frustration as it seemed they decided to make caine's character a homosexual. it was if they were trying far to hard to be different. and then... bang! law's dead. roll credits. this film is worth the watch simply for the performances, but those last seven minutes really do drag it down. what a pity....
