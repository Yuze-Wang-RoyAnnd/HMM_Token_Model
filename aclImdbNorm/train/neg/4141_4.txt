well...the movie was a fun watch. the main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by. like vampires that walk in the sunlight. though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies. a scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams "ow this hurts...it's really stuck." then there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while. and there are random dream sequenes' that really don't help with the plot. come to think of it, nothing really made sense, but i just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect. come to think of it the fight scenes were aweful, and the zombies were just fun to watch. slowly as i write more of this i like this movie more. but you know, all in all you can't expect schindlers list but its a fun watch.
