i have to finish watching a movie once i start, regardless of how bad it is. this movie was agonizing to sit through. the "sparkling" bullets, the reporter with "ninja" like moves, the way the bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and only seem to hit innocent bystanders, the predictable outcome and all the bad acting was just horrible. like the girl who finds the reporter in her friends apartment and goes from "what the heck are you doing in here (holding a bat)" to "hey, you're cute, wanna @#$%!???" in like 1.2 seconds.... just bad.... save yourself an hour and forty minutes and go play with your kids (or dog)!
