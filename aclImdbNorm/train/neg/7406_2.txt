well how was i suppose to know this was "the" dumb ass promotional "lordi motion picture"? i mean, i realized this when that "dinosaur" costume showed up and by the time the lead singer made his appearance i was humming "hard rock hallelujah" to myself... even though i hate that song. "dark floors" is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of being sneaked out of the hospital by her over protective father when they, and the rest of the people in that particular elevator, become momentarily trapped... when they arrive at their floor it comes as quite a surprise to find that there is nobody else around. the hospital is empty... except for a variety of monsters that seem to be stalking them for no apparent reason... they run through the hallways and stairwells, encountering all of the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish, shock-rock costumes... nothing really memorable here, except the lousy acting, lack of gore/nudity, and the utterly shameless promotional edge, reminding me very much of "kiss meet the phantom of the park". yeah, remember that dud? wish i didn't... i would just recommend avoiding all of these ghost house films like a fungus and not listen to lordi since they are a gwar ripoff band!
