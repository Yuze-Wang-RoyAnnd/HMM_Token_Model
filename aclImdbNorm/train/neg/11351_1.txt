with the massive advertising this is getting on nickelodeon and nick jr. and that ilk, my son was bugging us to see it. between dvd and the theaters, i've seen pretty much everything by now from the outstanding (incredibles, shrek) to the really bad (wall-e, brother bear). but this was easily the worst movie i've ever seen, kids or no kids. it was a "when it this stupid thing going to end?" kind of experience? ok, it's aimed at toddlers (or it better be - it's insulting to the intelligence of anyone over 3), but i've never seen something so predictable, repetitive, and slow-moving. then once you're finally fed up but relieved that the movie is over, there is this bizarre thing at the end that you think is the setup for a joke, but there isn't one - it's serious, though it's hard to tell what they're trying to accomplish. the 3-d effects... yeah, if you've never seen a viewmaster they're a big deal, otherwise no (if you look at the screen without glasses, it appears to be the same process). even my son was bored by the end. both my wife and i looked at each other and said "wow" at the end. bad in every respect.
