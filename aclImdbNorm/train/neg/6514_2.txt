the film attempts to be a mockumentary--shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts--but fails in not providing the audience with any characters with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary. also, the film purports to be about finding real love in los angeles, but is nothing more than an uninteresting look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first "big movie."
