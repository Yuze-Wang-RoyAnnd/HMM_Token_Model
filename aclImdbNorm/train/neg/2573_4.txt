if you have plenty of time to waste ... it's ok. it moves at a good pace but to pull this movie off it would need to be a little longer with a little more background on the sitter. <br /><br />the acting is ok. mariana klaveno as the sitter does the best job and is the most believable.<br /><br />william r. moses played a pretty good part as the husband.<br /><br />gail o'grady, as the wife, had a weak part and the reasons for her going back to work were not developed.<br /><br />the ending is sort of silly. like most of these sitter movies ... there are parts that are interesting ... but overall it leaves you wondering why you spent the time.
