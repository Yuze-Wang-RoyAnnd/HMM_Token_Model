the final pairing of nelson eddy and jeanette macdonald is basically a complete misfire.the script is weak and has been presented badly.the film just has no life in it.eddy and macdonald would have been better off just making a filmed concert for their final pairing.there's nothing wrong with their singing,its just everything else in this turkey thats overcooked.
