i missed the first 10 or so minutes of the movie but don't think watching it from the beginning would've made any difference. i found the film extremely boring and was disappointed with the acting. i remember patrick swayze and some of the other actors (roy marsden, for instance) in outstanding roles but they all disappointed here due to a very weak script. "kind solomon's mines"...the very short part of the movie inside the "mines" was about as exciting as watching paint dry and i doubt that even a pre-school kid would've been spell-bound by watching the fight of the "warriors". the entire movie was reminiscent of a cheaply produced american tv series. give me indiana jones any day!
