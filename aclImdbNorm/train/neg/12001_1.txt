my sincere advice to all: don't watch the movie.<br /><br />don't even go near to the theater where this movie is being played!! even a glimpse of it is bad for health. serious. no jokes. it's 3.30 am in the morning. and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe. four hours damn!!! i am proud that i survived after all of it! if this is called survival.<br /><br />i am highly frustrated. annoyed. disappointed. it was sheer waste of time! money went in drain! no plot. hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night!! rubbish movie.<br /><br />happy republic day to one and all :)
