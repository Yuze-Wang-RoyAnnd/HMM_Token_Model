one of the worst movies i ever saw. my only thought was: "how can i get my money back from hollywood video". this is no way worth four dollars, or any dollars. i think it was an attempt to rip off the mexican, or vin diesel's movies, but it failed miserably to do this.<br /><br />the acting was terrible, i felt sorry for the actors that they couldn't find something better to do with their time. the story was ridiculous. we were calling out the lines ahead of the actors, it was so predictable. the mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated, worse than a cartoon. <br /><br />skip it.
