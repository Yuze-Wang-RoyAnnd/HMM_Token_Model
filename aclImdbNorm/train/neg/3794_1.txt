the recent boom of dating show on u. s. television screens has reached a fevered pitch since the first episode of "the bachelor." unsuspecting audiences have since been subjected to countless clones and variations, including "the bachelorette", "joe millionaire", "for love or money", and the execrable "married by america." hoping to cash in on this trend, and simultaneously tap and exploit a new demographic, bravo has unleashed the disastrous "boy meets boy" upon the world. and may they have mercy on us all.<br /><br />the premise is simple and is designed to be light-hearted: an eligible gay man is courted by a number of suitors, eliminated show by show until one is left, but there's a twist. half of the men are actually straight. this is not much of a big deal, but the inherent viciousness of the scenario kicks in after hearing the pay-off: if, at the end of the show, the gay man picks a straight man in disguise, the straight man wins a cash prize. the gay man gets nothing, or at least nothing more than a few parting gifts, a pat on the back, and a hearty round of "aren't you embarrassed? well, thanks for playing!"<br /><br />just the like the equally painful "queer eye for the straight guy" (another bravo program), this show is another example of stereotypes run amok. what makes it even worse, though, is the fact that straight men are playing up these stereotypes for cash. the producers of this show believe that all you have to do is put enough hair gel in a man's hair, dress up in abercrombie & fitch with a pair of designer sandals, strip him of all body hair and fat and voila! it's the gay equivalent to putting a white performer in blackface, and just as offensive to those of us -- like myself -- who are genuinely gay and don't dress/act like that. it implies that gays have no variance or chance for individuality, that they can't behave like real people, only like stereotypes. never mind the fact that the bank of suitors is sorely lacking in any kind of diversity. all are gym-toned, most are white, and all look far too scrubbed and cleaned.<br /><br />this is another example of how, instead of fostering acceptance of gays as dynamic individuals capable of variance and change, hollywood has again taken a stereotype and run with it all the way to the bank. i feel genuinely dirty watching this show, as show any gay man who sees this unabashed parade of soft-core pornography masquerading as legitimate television. 1 out of 10.
