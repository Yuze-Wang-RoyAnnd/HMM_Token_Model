not one of the better pokemon movies.<br /><br />two legendary pokemon come into the story. you do get to see how strong celebi can be, though he turns evil first.<br /><br />suicune also makes an appearance, he didn't seem that powerful.<br /><br />the marauder didn't have many strong pokemon at all, except for that taranitar? some fight scenes with his pokemon may have made it better.<br /><br />ash and pikachu meet the much younger professor oak, though they don't realise it. misty i was thinking had it at the end but she didn't get close. i saw this in the credits.<br /><br />don't expect much here, the worst of the series so far.
