this movie is just plain bad. weak story , weak directing and below average acting. the thing that really irritated me was the blatant advertising - constantly - for a well known internet provider. it is obvious some scenes are written to do just that , advertising. this movie is a slap in the face to anyone who payed money for this.<br /><br />do not watch this, it not worth your time.
