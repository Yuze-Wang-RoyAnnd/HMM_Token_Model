when i first heard about "down to earth," i was pretty excited. i'm a pretty big fan a chris rock, he was especially hilarious in dogma. but this film proved to be a disappointment. chris rock's performance was not nearly as good as his past performances, and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole.<br /><br />first off, chris rock. he plays the entire movie as a standup comedy routine. obviously, this works fine in the scenes where he's supposed to be doing standup, but in the rest of the movie, it doesn't. even when he's talking to one other character, he seems to think he's trying to make a roomful of people laugh. he has a few funny moments, but they mostly come during the standup scenes (no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian). as for the rest of the cast, they're pretty much there just to give rock someone to talk to, none of them stand out.<br /><br />also, the movie was poorly directed. the movie has basically a one-joke plot: old white guy acting like a young black comedian. while i prefer movies with more than one joke, this still could have worked, and been quite funny. the problem was, we saw too much of rock and not enough of the old white guy. it's supposed to be funny because it's this white guy telling chris rock's jokes, but for most of the time, we just see chris rock, so it's not nearly as funny. the few scenes where they decide to show us the white guy talking like rock are, in fact, hilarious. if he had been shown more, the movie would have been a lot funnier.<br /><br />overall, a few moments of laughter can't make up for the fact that "down to earth" is poorly acted, and poorly directed. this one was a pretty big disappointment.<br /><br />rating: 4/10
