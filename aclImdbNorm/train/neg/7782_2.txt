monster is a mind numbingly awful movie about an evil american concrete factory (are there any else in hollywood?) polluting the waters of the small colombian town of chimayo somehow creating a catfish-like beast with a predilection for lamb and loose women. james mitchum is bill travis the man who is sent down to chimayo by his foul-mouthed boss barnes who himself can't keep his hands off of his secretary's rear to get to the bottom (pun intended) of the story. while in chimayo bill must contend with an annoying reporter who apparently broadcasts all of her stories in perfect english directly back to america. i guess in the seventies there was a market for news from small south american towns. there is also a radical named sanchez that wishes to sabotage the factory for polluting the water which, by the way, also supplies the town with jobs for the locals, but why let cold hearted economics get in the way of touchy-feely enviro-marxism. pete the factory boss is unwittingly aided by the monster when he has sex with his ex-girlfriend on the beach, tells her that he is seeing the mayor's daughter juanita and it's over between them, then she is promptly eaten that night. a little side action without the evidence. my hat is off to you sir. john carradine rounds out the cast as a priest that believes the monster is sent by god to punish sinners. you can see the contempt he has for being in this movie in his face. might as well filmed him running to the local currency exchange to see if his check didn't bounce.<br /><br />supposedly based on a true story, so much so they say it twice in the opening credits, this film is awful on all fronts. filming began in 1971 and was abandoned until eight years later when kenneth hartford put his foot on the throat of monster by adding his two annoying children as new characters, even putting his daughter, andrea in top billing with mitchum and carradine. the sound quality is nonexistent and most of the scenes seem as if someone smeared tar over the camera before filming. this is made even more tedious during the many scenes done at night. the monster itself is laughable as it rears its ugly rubbery head for the anticlimactic ending. james mitchum along with his brother chris are proof that nepotism in the acting industry needs to be curtailed. utterly unwatchable dreck. shame on you john carradine.
