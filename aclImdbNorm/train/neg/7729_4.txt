a wonderful television mini-series completely ruined by a 45-year old woman trying desperately to pass herself off as a 16-year old ingenue! no exaggeration - that's the actual age of the character played by ali macgraw when the film opens just prior to the surprise attack at pearl harbor. this tv mini-series really is the most classic example of the title of this post and one i refer to whenever the topic comes up.<br /><br />that alone makes this completely unwatchable, despite the fact it's one of the best filmed wwii 'global' dramas tv has ever produced. if you have the stomach - or a decent fast-forward ability - you might be able to enjoy the late robert mitchum in a very strong performance. <br /><br />i'm stunned at some of the comments referring to the love story (pun intended). did they watch the film with their eyes closed? or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their "selective memories" and "selective vision". i'm a boomer myself so don't think for a second i'm some hubristic young punk. 45 will always look 45. get used to it. deal with it. age gracefully damnit.<br /><br />the winds of war could have been... so good. how much more would we be talking about this mini-series today, some 25 years later, had an actual ingenue been cast in such an important & critical role? right now, with the constant haggard old biddy distraction, that alone cancels out most of the wonderful aspects of the winds of war.
