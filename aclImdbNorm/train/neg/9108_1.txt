this so-called prequel is just a badly made remake to to a better version of dangerous liasons. the plots are identical as is most of the script. i loved the book its based off of, and i loved the first movie, but i'm not even going to bother with the 3rd movie. the pointless banter between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal, and...i just can't stress how bad the movie was. if you don't want to take my word for it, just watch it, and you'll see what i mean. if you've read a review that says that 'if you likes the first one, you'll like the second one' the only reason that is is because it is the exact same movie! although the plot is not even as good. they took so many lines from the first movie, its hard to tell which movie you're watching.
