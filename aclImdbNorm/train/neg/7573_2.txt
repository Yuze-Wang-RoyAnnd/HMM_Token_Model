this movie is a vehicle for schwarzenegger-clone alexander nevsky. his charisma however is insufficient to lift this movie above the level of its poor script. he has little to add to his arnie-act.<br /><br />michael york is quite pathetic as the begging diplomat. watching him revisit his d'artagnan-act from the time that he was a better actor made me feel uneasy. come on, you can do better than that!<br /><br />the story is full of holes and unexplained relations; top of this bill is the informer of vlad, who sounds like an american woman, but from the context appears to be working for a russian government-department.<br /><br />although the story takes place well after the end of the communist-regime, all the russian characters are still very communist-like. in contradiction to that, vlad is allowed to drive a pimped up all utility vehicle as police-car. the action scenes are poorly shot and therefore lack dynamics.<br /><br />not a must see movie...
