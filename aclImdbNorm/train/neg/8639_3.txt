routine suspense yarn about a sociopath (dillon) who gives his sperm to a clinic of human reproduction and starts to harrass the lives of the woman (antony) and his husband (mancuso). extremely predictable, far-fetched and with undecided tone all the way. don't lose your time with this one...make a baby instead!
