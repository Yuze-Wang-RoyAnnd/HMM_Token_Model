belmondo is a tough cop. he goes after a big-time drug dealer (played by henry silva, normally a great villain - see "sharky's machine"; but here he is clearly dubbed, and because of that he lacks his usual charisma). he goes to the scuzziest places of paris and marseilles, asks for some names, beats up some people, gets the names, goes to more scuzzy places, asks for more names, beats up more people, etc. the whole movie is punch after punch after punch. it seems that the people who made it had no other ambition than to create the french equivalent of "dirty harry". belmondo, who was 50 here, does perform some good stunts at the beginning; apart from those, "le marginal" is a violent, episodic, trite, shallow and forgettable cop movie.
