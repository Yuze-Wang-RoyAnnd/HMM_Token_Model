gee, what a heck of a movie!... i said i wanted to become a specialist in bad movies from all decades, so i decided to start by this one. it was a pretty adequate choice. i entered this adventure to find some lost gems and uncomprehended masterpieces, but i didn't see anything of the sort in this pastel-coloured mess. i haven't really watched many bad films before, but i've got the feeling this is what's called "so bad that's good", probably because it is so unintentionally damn funny! first of all, there are the inaccuracies. there are plot-related inaccuracies, physical inaccuracies, and also psychological inaccuracies. the latter in particular are as insane as van damme's ass cheeks inside that blue spandex. extremely tacky lines exist too and i won't even start to talk about some of the hilarious action moves. there isn't exactly bad acting from everyone involved in that hot mess of a movie, except in one particular case. geoffrey lewis looks completely pathetic as frank, which is an utterly stupid character. and, to tell the truth, i was actually very surprised to see that van damme did a decent job playing the twins. he succeeded in achieving a different tone and mood in the two roles that was convincing to me. but the movie was mostly very bad and the sad part is that it was produced by a major motion picture studio... which is now bankrupt.
