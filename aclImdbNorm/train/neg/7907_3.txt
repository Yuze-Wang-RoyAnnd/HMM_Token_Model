an excellent performance by alix elias highlights an otherwise mis-directed and confused pile of dreck. i have seen this movie, perhaps 12 times, and with each run through, i find less and less pleasure. why are munchies so lustful? is that ever explained? are they a reflection of our wanton, boorish 'animal selves?' if they are, why not make it more obvious? why not peal back just a touch of the subtlety that plagues this movie, and make that connection explicit? another part of this movie that bothers me to no end - motorcycles. the jacket the little monster wears on the front cover seems to suggest 'street-wise' traveler. the sun glasses say 'pretty cool dude.' with all this i'm ready for easy rider meets the muppets. all i get is munchies (1987). what gives? stick to the gremlins series if you're a fan of diminutive, wise-cracking, reptile puppets - it'll give you the treatment you deserve.
