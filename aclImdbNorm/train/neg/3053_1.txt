wow. who ever said that edward d. wood jr. never influenced anybody? this steaming pile of donkey excrement is a perfect case in point; it makes "the violent years" look like "casablanca"! "santa claus" also makes keith richards' worst flashbacks look like my first nocturnal emission. i've had nightmares, you know, waking up and sweating bullets, that will never come close to the visceral terror that santa claus unearthed from the seemingly pure soil of my very being. however, i can think of some parties where this film might actually go over well. also, if you're looking for the perfect example of a santa-satan dichotomy on vhs tape, look no further. don't check out this movie, as i've been notified the mst3k version is now available. move over satan, here's "santa claus".
