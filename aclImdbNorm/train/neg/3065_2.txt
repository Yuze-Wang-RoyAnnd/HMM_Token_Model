this movie represents the times it was made in as much as the original, i suppose. which is really sad, because at a deeper level, the title 'vanishing point' the original, is so ironic. i'm sure it wasn't intended that way, but the original was filmed in 1970, and released in 1971. the real 'vanishing point' was the end of an era, which pretty much ended in the early 1970s. <br /><br />in this remake, all the counter-cultural elements have been stripped away, and been rendered more pc in an attempt to reach a broader audience, presumably. "sanitized for your protection" <br /><br />inserting the american indian scenes was gratuitous, and the idea of a 'noble purpose' to the trip was subtraction by addition. i'm glad i watched it however, it made me appreciate the original that much more. the original is a cult classic and golden. this remake is dreadful.
