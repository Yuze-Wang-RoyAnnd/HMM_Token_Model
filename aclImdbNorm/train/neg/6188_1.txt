this is by far the worst adaptation of jane eyre i have seen. it is uncertain whether or not the writer of the screenplay ever read the book by bronte. george c scott is ridiculous and bumbling as rochester -- when not just plain old acting angry. susannah york has the most dated 1970's hairstyle i have ever seen in a victorian movie. the characters hardly speak to each other, so the rich banter enjoyed in the book that is the basis for their deep intellectual and abiding love, is gone. the ending is ludicrous.<br /><br />please, rent the timothy dalton version instead. it is so true to the book, it's like having the novel read aloud to you. dalton is superb as rochester. g. c. scott is laughable.
