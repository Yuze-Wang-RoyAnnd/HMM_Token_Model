sholay: considered to be one of the greatest films. i always wondered if they would ever remake being the classic it is. that was the time rgv announced this movie and i was somewhat excited to see it. i always thought that maybe this will be a good movie, but every week we would here rgv change something. and the movie is a very b-grade movie, something that i had not hoped.<br /><br />i really tried looking for positives, but i promised to keep sholay out of my mind. the cinematography is awesome. the movie tries to be its own. but that is the up side. the action sequences are weak. the screenplay had potential. the biggest flaw is editing. none of the scenes excite you. for example, the comedy sequences felt very out of place and forced. ironic because comedy was just as entertaining in the original. and none of the characters are developed. and no scenes will linger until the end. and the ending was very disappointing.<br /><br />the biggest question is acting. amitabh bachchan was good as gabbar singh, nothing great. it seemed as if they concentrated too much on his look, that the character only looks menacing, but you don't get creeped out. mohanlal is barely in the movie, but he impresses in his few scenes. ajay devgan was decent. it wasn't so much the performance, he gave it his all, it was the weak script. prashant raj is very confident, and has potential to make it far with better movies.<br /><br />i had most expectations for sushmita sen, who was probably the best of the lot. she was expressive, but this still was not enough. nisha kothari surprised me. she seemed disinterested for the most part, but her emotional scene after her friend's death was quite good. seems as if she needs to find a director who will help her talent, not her cute looks. but what disappointed me most was chemistry. ajay devgan and prashant raj didn't look like friends. ajay-nisha were not a strong couple. no passion was to be found between sushmita and prashant. and amitabh and mohanlal did not the hateful passion they needed.<br /><br />as for songs, they pretty much suck. urmila's mehbooba was too overblown and i pretty much slept through it. it was however nicely danced. the holi number was enjoyable, but not memorable. same went for the other songs. for someone who looked forward to this movie, i was heavily disappointed. i had high hopes for rgv because of his jungle, but seems as if he lost his talent during the shooting of this movie. but hopefully he regains his talent for sarkar raj. but this movie is best forgotten. all the positives still do not make up for the boring movie it is.
