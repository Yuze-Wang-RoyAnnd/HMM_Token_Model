this film is quite boring. there are snippets of naked flesh tossed around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake but they don't succeed.<br /><br />the best thing about the movie is lena olin--she does a masterful job handling her character, but day-lewis garbles most of his lines.<br /><br />kaufman clearly had no idea how to film this. the incongruities in bouncing between domestic household/marriage issues and political crises are badly matched. character attitudes change without explanation throughout. badly disjointed.
