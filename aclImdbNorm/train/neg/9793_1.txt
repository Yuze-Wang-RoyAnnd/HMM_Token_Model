mighty morphin power rangers has got to be the worst television show ever made. there is no plot, just a bunch of silly costumed kids using martial arts while dressed up in second class spandex outfits.<br /><br />the special effects look like they are from the '70's, the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy, and the show is just plain awful.<br /><br />the only thing worse than the television show are the toys, just second rate plastic garbage fed to our kids.<br /><br />there are far better shows for your kids to watch!<br /><br />try giving your kids something like nickelodean, those shows actually have some intelligence behind them, unlike power rangers.
