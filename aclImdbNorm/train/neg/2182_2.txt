i bought this dvd for $1 at walmart. after seeing it, i might just return to the store and try to get my money back! the only reason i gave the movie a 2 and not a 1 is that the story has a few novel story elements, though it really never rises to the level of being interesting. this film has all the earmarks of being a made for the drive-in theaters market--ultra-low budget, amateurish acting and a liberal dose of sex (for an early 60s film). in fact, i wonder if perhaps the only reason the film was made was to make a fast buck and because someone knew some strippers they could use as extras. the film is about a wacko doctor who wants to transplant his girlfriend's severed head onto the body of an unsuspecting donor. most of the potential donors are skanky strippers or a model--whose only real purpose in the film is to titillate as they remove most of their clothes. however, they keep too much on to make the movie even worth watching for the naughty bits and the film isn't quite awful enough to merit watching by bad film buffs.
