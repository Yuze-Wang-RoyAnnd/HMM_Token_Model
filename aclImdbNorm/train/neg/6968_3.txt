an older man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse that seems to be wilting. he gets pricked by it, or bitten by something on it. he quickly becomes ill, and at the hospital spits out a large writhing white larva of some kind. a later attempt to resuscitate him with paddles results in a splatter of blood.<br /><br />a cop is at the hospital because his partner got badly hurt in a shoot-out. somehow the cop gets paired up with one of the female doctors, as well as an entomologist who is brought in. there are several young kids wandering around the hospital, who i suppose we're supposed to find adorable, but who are extremely annoying little brats. they happen to wander into the room where the specimen is being kept, and happen to dump a growth hormone on it. horror movie logic would say they deserve to die for this, but they're never even in any danger.<br /><br />the critter grows and starts breeding. people run away from it, and sometimes towards it for some reason. the hospital gets surrounded by military who are prepared to destroy everything if need be.<br /><br />there are no really compelling characters in the movie, and most of the time it seems like people are searching around for the monster. it was fairly boring. clearly it owes something to the alien movies, with the monster being born inside a human and having several stages of its growth. there's also a character named bishop, and the lead actress has sigourney weaver's hair.
