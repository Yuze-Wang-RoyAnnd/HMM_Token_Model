the best that i can say about this film is that it was mildly amusing at times, and that it was an adequate time killer. unfortunately, this film is also so annoying that i wanted to slap these characters around. this is the kind of film that is so sweet, it hurts your teeth. the intentions were good, i suppose, but things get awfully tiresome when the dialogue is so nauseating. when the two leads aren't together on-screen, this really isn't bad at all, but be afraid during those frequent moments when the loving couple starts talking to one another.
