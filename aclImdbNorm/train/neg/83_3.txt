jill dunne (played by mitzi kapture), is an attractive, nice woman, over-whelmed by a smart-mouthed teenage daughter, liv (martha macisaac) and a petty, two-timing husband, sean (rick roberts), both of which were tediously self-centered, and obnoxious.<br /><br />this was advertised as a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a relentless storm.<br /><br />the storm doesn't even happen until about the last 5 minutes of the film, and then it isn't anything to send anybody running to the storm cellar.<br /><br />the stalking, likewise doesn't get intense until almost the end of the film.<br /><br />most of the film we spend listening to jill and her insufferable daughter, liv, argue until i just wanted to back slap the daughter into next week.<br /><br />jill's problem with liv is that she has taken up with zack, a boy of questionable character, and they are constantly making out--in fact jill comes home to find the two of them on liv's bed.<br /><br />the rest of the time we spend listening to jill's husband sean either whine at jill or criticize her.<br /><br />sean was not at all appealing--since his face is so covered in freckles you could play connect the dots.<br /><br />the story begins with jill being notified of an out-standing bill on their credit card for a hotel she has never been to, and that she thought sean had never been to either.<br /><br />jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner & manager, richard grant (nick mancuso), a very nice, older, divorced man, who is sympathetic to her. in fact, when he spots her husband there again, he phones jill and tips her off.<br /><br />jill returns to the hotel, sees sean with another woman. she is upset, leaves without sean seeing her, and does absolutely nothing. in fact, she doesn't even say anything to sean when he arrives home. this made no sense to me.<br /><br />jill has given richard her business card, and so he calls her and she is apparently in real estate. she shows him a condo. afterwards they have a drink, and things get cozy between them.<br /><br />richard and jill are getting it on, hot and heavy. in fact, he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary, when jill suddenly decides to cut out.<br /><br />jill and sean have a confrontation about his cheating. sean whines about how jill has been letting him down since her father died. apparently his lack of any morals is all her fault. eventually jill confesses her own lack of morals and near adultery to sean--and of course that's all her fault too, as far as sean is concerned.<br /><br />the little family decides to go on a camping trip--which means more whining and grousing among them, especially from the spoiled daughter.<br /><br />i was so rooting for the stalker to get everybody, but jill.<br /><br />3 stars
