the book is fantastic, this film is not. there is no reason this film could not have embraced a futuristic technological vision of the book. hell, total recall was released a few years later and that did a good job of it, even a clockwork orange released in the 70s did a good job of trying to make a futuristic world. the bleak german expressionistic colours, the black and white footage from the vision screens, there is no reason for this approach for when the film was made in 1984. the main character is in a white collar writing job yet he dresses like he works with oil and grease in a garage. this film decides to take a mock-communistic approach to set design, atmosphere and theme, yet the novel did not necessarily dictate a communist, worship-the-humble-worker theme itself. this book seriously needs to be adapted in a modern context as this book is more relevant today than ever before. i could not watch more than 20 minutes of this crap. the soundtrack is annoying, the lack of foresight is annoying, this film seems to have been made to deny a sense of realism or believability when that is exactly what is required to hammer the novel's messages to the viewer.
