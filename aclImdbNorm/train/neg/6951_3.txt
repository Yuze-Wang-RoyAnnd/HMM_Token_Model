don't you just hate it when you order steak but the restaurant gives you chicken?<br /><br />such is how i felt watching this so-called "battlestar galactica". arguments can be made over its quality but the fact remains, it's not what the fans ordered.<br /><br />imagine if you were sitting down at that proverbial restaurant i mentioned. you have waited years for them to bring back their famous new york strip steak which you loved. when your meal arrives, you find they've applied the name "new york strip" to a chicken dish. you complain but the waiter merely states "but ze cheeken, ees really good zir"! do you really care if the chicken is good? you wanted new york strip - a steak! the waiter then explains, "you zee zir, ze chef wanted to to do, as you zay, zomezing new. we felt ze cheeken would be more popular zo we gave it the name of our previous delicious deesh". you ask if you will ever find the original new york strip on the menu in the future but are informed that because the restaurant has a dish called "new york strip" now on the menu, you'll never see the original new york strip - ever again.<br /><br />such is the case with creating something new and slapping the "battlestar galactica" namesake on it.<br /><br />* this mini series is an affront to all fans of the original show! *<br /><br />it's a shame the production team put in charge of this new version obviously held contempt for the original. the team put in charge of resurrecting bg should have loved the original series - seeking to improve what the fans loved, not try to shamelessly sell this new series by exploiting the battlestar galactica name.<br /><br />if scifi channel wanted to give us a new show, then do so! give it a new name! don't use the name we fondly remember in an attempt to lure in viewers. that effectively robs us of the chance to see any semblance of the original in the future.<br /><br />we have been waiting for 25 years to see what we knew as bg because we liked something about the original! we didn't simply want the name and remnants of the basic concept. there are things we loved about the original series!<br /><br />sadly, probably the best elements of the original were those which were omitted. sure, the original bg was imperfect and could have used some updating. this mini series, however, was not an improvement in any regards but the special effects (which were good but not anything unusual by today's standards).<br /><br />many viewers will debate back and forth about the quality of this new show but we will not forgive scifi and ron moore for destroying our dream.<br /><br />that being said... i shall offer some comments about the merits of this new mini by itself (not in comparison to the original):<br /><br />the battle sequences were the best part. effort was obviously put into making the effects more "real" in appearance and less "wow - look at that effect". i would not say these sequences were exceptional by today's standards yet they were in keeping with made-for-cable original movies. what was the deal with this "pseudo-live-cam"? some views tried to fake the effect of a "real" camera with lagging tracking and jerky zooms. however, it was over-used considering there was no apparent source of these cameras. the infinitely more intelligent series, babylon 5, is the only instance i've seen such "live cams" used effectively, when we were supposedly witnessing action from security cams.<br /><br />the script, you ask? the script felt like it was written by a teenager, for other teenagers. the characters felt cardboard and stereotypical. indeed, the whole story felt pieced together from other well-known stereotypes. the only good features of the entire story were those few elements which were preserved from the original series. it was obviously "dumbed down" for digestion of your average tv audience.<br /><br />the human interaction was pitiful. rather than drama based on subtle looks, expressions and fine timing, every moment of human tension was exaggerated to the point of being so obvious they lost all ability to move any refined viewer. such was obvious in any interaction between adama and son. the director must have been trying to make sure the most dense and unfeeling viewer wouldn't miss it even if not paying attention. sorry, but real humans don't behave like the continually.<br /><br />i wouldn't have considered this a bad show had it stood on its own. nothing great; it will never be revered by true scifi fans or artisans, but it would be watchable by the masses. i personally could have lived without it, though. i only watched it to see how it really did capture the spirit of the original. <br /><br />how this mini series will always be remembered is as a symbol of how quality in storytelling has been cast aside to appeal to greater numbers. how even scifi channel has "dumbed down" its productions to cater to the masses as opposed to its true niche market, the science fiction fans. it will be the time we asked for steak and they insisted on giving us chicken, despite our complaints.<br /><br />i leave you with only one thought - <br /><br />no "moore".<br /><br />
