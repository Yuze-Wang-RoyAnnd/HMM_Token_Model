what? is jamie foxx supposed to be funny?does he really believe he is funny?well, it's funny watching his confidence in being funny.the man has no identity whatsoever...i mean you can immediately see who his idols are, denzel washington and martin lawrence, because he tries really hard to imitate them in most of his movies.the only problem is that he does it bad, uneven, and what comes out are some parts where he somewhat looks like denzel, with that macho-s**t attitude and then abruptly goes to being martin lawrence, the funny and clumsy-silly comic. there's no personal touch to all that, i mean he contributes nothing to the personality he tries to sell, and i'm sure he has nothing to say personally. he really is mr. dull-boy in person.<br /><br />i was really hoping hollywood, and the black community in america would find somebody better to launch into super stardom, like don cheadle for example, but perhaps the pathetic jamie better represents the generation that remixes the old.
