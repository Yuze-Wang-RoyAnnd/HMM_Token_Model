...this verson doesn't mangle the bard that badly. it's still a horrible minimalist production, hamlet's dutch uncle is inexplicably dubbed by a spaniard (whether it's ricardo montalban or not is subject to debate), and maximilian schell overacts like never before. most of the dialogue makes it through unscathed, and the fact that the mst3k version feels obliged to point out repeatedly that the speeches are long *duh* doesn't strike me as incredibly humorous. mostly it's just bad acting, though.
