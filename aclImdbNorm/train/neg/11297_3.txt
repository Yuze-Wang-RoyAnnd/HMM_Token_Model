jenny neumann (from the sexploitation flick mistress of the apes, the american slasher hell night and others) is helen selleck, an american actress who gets a lead role in an australian stage production. she's a virgin because as a little girl she saw her mom having sex and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her. meanwhile, a black-gloved killer prowls around the theater slashing up people with shards of glass.<br /><br />***major spoiler***<br /><br />the killer is obviously helen (she speaks in her dead mother's voice, washes blood off her hands after the murders and is seen killing a child molester with a broken bottle as a little girl!), but this has gratuitous heavy-breathing pov camera-work and conceals the identity of the murderer until the very end like it's supposed to be some big surprise.<br /><br />the entire cast seems obsessed with talking about, having or trying to have sex, and, in one case, even blackmailing their way into getting laid. there's quite a bit of nudity and blood, but there's no sense of continuity, the photography is murky and the editing (by colin eggleston, who also scripted and produced) is terrible. the theater setting for a slasher film predates soavi's film of the same name and argento's opera (both of which are better than this one ) by five years though, and neumann is pretty hot.
