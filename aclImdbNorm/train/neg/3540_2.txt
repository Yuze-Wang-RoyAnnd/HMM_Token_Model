guy richie's third proper film (not counting the god-awful "swept away" is a complex action thriller concerned with gambling, gangsters and chess. fans of richie's previous efforts will probably hate revolver as much as i did, with its twists and turns. richie stalwart jason statham plays jake, a newly-released ex-con, out to wreak revenge on the ridiculously named dorothy macha (a superbly ott ray liotta) but instead gets embroiled with a couple of other cons, (one of which is andre 3000 from rap outfit outkast) who throw him and us the audience, a number of red herrings throughout the film, all of which becomes extremely tedious. the high point of this mess of a movie is the bit in the restaurant, where the dialogue gets turned down in favour of a superbly shot, slow-mo shootout set to beethoven's moonlight sonata. all in all, revolver is a flawed work, not truly awful but far from richie's best. that would still be lock, stock. if this film was a school homework assignment it would be graded 'must try harder!'
