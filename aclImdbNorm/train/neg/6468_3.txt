it's a good thing the score came along for marlon brando as a farewell performance because i'd hate to think of him going out on free money. not what his fans ought to remember him by.<br /><br />brando in his last years is looking more like orson welles and free money is the kind of film welles would have done looking for financing of his own work. brando is the warden of a local prison which in america, when it's located in a small rural setting is usually the largest employer in the area. that gives one who is in charge a lot of clout. <br /><br />unfortunately he has one weakness he indulges, his two twin bimbos otherwise known as daughters. even when they get simultaneously pregnant by a pair of losers, charlie sheen and thomas haden church, their hearts still belong to daddy.<br /><br />not to fear because brando's willing to give them jobs in the prison where they work under conditions not much better than the convicts have. what to do, but commit a robbery of a train which goes through the locality every so often carrying used money to be burned by the treasury. <br /><br />although free money has some moments of humor, for most of the time it's quite beneath the talents of all those involved. some of them would include donald sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and mira sorvino as his stepdaughter, but also straight arrow fbi agent.<br /><br />of course these people and the rest of the cast got to work with someone who many rate as the greatest american actor of the last century. were it not for brando's presence and were it some 40 years earlier, free money would be playing the drive-in circuit in red state america where the populace could see how they're being satirized.<br /><br />or a feeble attempt is made to satirize them.
