once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent. reuniting with some former co-stars to clean up the town.<br /><br />low key, often to the point of blandness, "action" comedy mostly just doesn't work. part of the problem is the casting chris klien as a former action hero. he's not bad, but he's really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy. as i said he's not bad, he's just just miscast for what his back story is. the real problem here is the combination of the script, which really isn't funny and seems artificial at times, and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness. there is no life in the way things are set up. its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list. it makes for an un-engaging film. and yet the film occasionally springs to life, such as the in the final show down that ends the film. that sequence works, but because the earlier parts of the film floundered its drained of much of its power.<br /><br />i can't really recommend the film. its worth a shot if you're a fan of the actors or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms, but otherwise this is just a disappointment.
