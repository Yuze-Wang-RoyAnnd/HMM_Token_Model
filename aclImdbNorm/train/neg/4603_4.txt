i was p***ed when i couldn't see this one when it was screening at the philly film fest last year, so when i saw that it was going to be on cable tonight, i put it on remind as soon as i could. so was it worth the wait? well let's backtrack a tad as i have yet to give you the plot. sean crawley is a young man who doesn't know what his path in life is. enter duke (george wendt) who introduces him to his boss ray (danny baldwin). one night ray totally hammered asks sean to off the guy that they had sean following around. and it goes on from there. which leads me back to the question posed. was it worth the wait? yes and no, the buildup was pretty good and george wendt stole the movie for me. he just took the ball and ran with it. but it's nowhere near as violent as i was led to believe and somewhere along the movies running time the ball is not only dropped, but fumbled and taken in the other direction. i know where this point happened exactly, but can't say without spoiling the film. but needless to say it happened. the ending doesn't save the film either. poor stuart gordon nothing can be good like "re-animator" or "castle freak".<br /><br />my grade: c<br /><br />where i saw it: showtime extreme<br /><br />eye candy: kari wuhrer shows her ta-tas in one fantasy and then in the next more ta-tas and it pans down and...oh my god my eyes my eyes!!!!!
