any movie that has nude scenes of karen allen and i'm still so bored i walk out, that is a stinker! <br /><br />karen gets stuck in paris, and befriends a sissily-handsome french man with whom she is having sex soon. of course he's married, ("but, cheri, why should that be a problem?") what could be an interesting clash of cultures is (believe it or not) just dull. i walked out. <br /><br />maybe the movie got a lot better after i left; but it would have had to have gotten a lot better to make up for a rotten beginning.<br /><br />my advice, if you find yourself in this, run, do not walk, for the exit. save your time and your energy. most assuredly save your money. it's a shame the production company didn't save its money.
