if this movie should be renamed, it should be "the jackasses of hazzard." to sum it up, this movie is nothing but 88 minutes of two immature country punks joyriding the famed 1968 dodge charger around town and in the country, chasing the girls and eluding the law.<br /><br />i have been a fan of the "dukes" and what tarnishes the movie is the characters are out of key. the overindulgence of profanity, sexual references, and drug use, has made the good name of the "dukes" into trailer trash.<br /><br />side from comparing it to the television show, the acting was horrible. the only actor that got it right was the famed 1969 dodge charger named general lee. the others have exaggerated the character's role which tarnished the movie.<br /><br />the "dukes" have been another casualty of the 21-st century hollywood television-to-big screen transition tragedy. skip this movie and just buy the television series on dvd.<br /><br />my grade: f
