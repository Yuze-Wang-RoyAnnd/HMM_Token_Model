from the critical acclaim, i expected more from this movie and from tamara jenkins. the story just meandered along and didn't seem to have a point or a plot. and i find it hard to believe that a 14 year old girl (mature for her age or no) would be so blase about getting the loss of her virginity "over with." maybe i am too young to relate (i was four years old in 1976), but i didn't have any problems connecting with the stories of shakespeare in love or life is beautiful and i wasn't alive for either of those settings. the cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not alow them to engage the audience. overall, slums had its moments but unless you are yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks, i would say skip this one.
