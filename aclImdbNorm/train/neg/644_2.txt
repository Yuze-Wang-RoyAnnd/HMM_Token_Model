we have all been asking ourselves "why don't they remake the slasher films that were only ok instead of remaking the ones that were great already, that way they can only make it better?" well with prom night they have remade the average but trashy fun 80s jamie lee curtis film and made it even worse. its a paint by numbers slasher film which is clearly trying to attract the young teens (hence no violence etc), the knife in this slasher flick is blunt.the director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the rather attractive killer look somewhat creepy that anything else goes out of the window.the cast who include britney snow (who was superb in hairspray) try their hardest but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scared.more annoying is how the death scenes are handled (we will hear the attack but wont see it). it also looks like the only place the knife in this film worked was in the editing suite since the film looks like it has been butchered (im guessing anything remotely scary ended up on the cutting room floor so as not to scare the kids) yet in pours the money from americans sending this film to number 1 at the box office!!! slasher movies are a lot of fun but in prom nights case it made me want to download the original.i've seen scarier oc and dawsons creek episodes
