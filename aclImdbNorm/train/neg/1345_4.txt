to be clear from the get go, 'the bagman' is very, very, very bad. it suffers terribly in almost every aspect except for one: the finished product is such an awful film that it's actually hysterically funny to watch. this is a very low-grade film. budget constraints for the film should be obvious to anyone who watches even just the opening title sequence. i'm not sure if much of the humour in the film was intended or not. for example, the movie takes place in 'doomsville.' note to all prospective home buyers: if the town you're moving to is called 'doomsville,' keep moving. stephanie beaton is quick to pull off her top for a pretty enthusiastic sex scene in the kitchen. i couldn't help but laugh because it has intentional humour (she turns on the gas stove ... get it? the sex is that hot? get it?) and unintentional humour. the unintentional in this case is the music. it's like the theme music for 'chariots of fire' goes electronica. break out the computer and the synthesizers! i realize that coming up with music for a small production like this is cost prohibitive. i really feel for them because the work here is so well-intentioned. the problem is that cheap music isn't necessarily good music. i haven't laughed so hard at sex on screen since 'alone in the dark' with that 'seven seconds' song (i guess they were implying that poor old mr. slater was a bit ... quick on the draw?). even the end credits are hilarious. intentional or not? you be the judge: a pet dog and cat are part of the credited cast -- and an animal wrangler was on set for them! -- the boom is credited to 'mr b. stick,' and the 3rd unit's wardrobe (yep, they had a third unit) is credited to k-mart. maybe it's just me, but i think the hilarity of this more than saves the film. the movie is very, very bad, but the goals of stephanie beaton, her friends and family are so well-intentioned in 'the bagman' that you can't help but like the movie they've produced. 'the bagman' is bad but not dreadful. in its own sweet way, it even manages to be a bit endearing. it wears its flaws so honestly that you can't help but forgive them. "better" films that try to hide the flaws are almost worse in a way. i guess this is just a film that knew who its audience was and was produced accordingly.<br /><br />watch any number of movies and most of them will probably be a lot better than this. some of them might look cheaper, or have worse acting, or sillier production value. they may not suffer terribly as 'the bagman' does from awful editing, sound, and foley effects. mr b. stick didn't do a very good job. the special effects look to be where most of the money went. they tend to be more funny than gruesome, although when the 'bagman' is finally unmasked at the end, the make-up job there is surprisingly well done.<br /><br />my 4 out of 10 is a little high but the humour helped a lot. this is an ideal movie to track down some night with a few friends and a few beers in hand. great entertainment is to be had by anyone who seriously considers themselves b-movie or low budget film aficionados. all others should probably avoid with great prejudice.
