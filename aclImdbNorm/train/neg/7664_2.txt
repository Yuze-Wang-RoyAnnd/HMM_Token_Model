spoilers ahead, but does it really matter? have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions? could this be it? why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world? why is this question never answered? why was the opening text crawl incoherent? why would a nun (she sure seemed nice!) hand over 20 orphans to a madman? has there always been a gold mine in downtown vancouver? why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage? why does tara reid's character suddenly show up at christian slater's apartment for sex? (or did i just answer my own question?) why would even a non-archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer? why would modern computers still display green pre-tron-era grid outlines of objects, complete with little "bleeps"? and must all movie explosive timers have digital displays? why doesn't anything in this movie make any sense?
