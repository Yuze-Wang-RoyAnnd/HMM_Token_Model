this movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never had made a movie before nor had they considered that a script should be edited or even funny. when i saw this film, i saw it for john candy and assumed, incorrectly, that it would be hilarious. instead, there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat, unfunny moments. and, to top it off, candy delivered some of the crudest lines i had ever heard up to that time. so, despite a potentially funny cast and story idea, we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult, though teens will probably find a few laughs. it's really a shame--it could have been so much better. i mean, with eugene levy, joe flaherty and john candy it should have been wonderful.
