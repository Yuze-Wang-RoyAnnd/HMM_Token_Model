i thought that zombie flesh eaters 2 was quite a good horror film when a terrorist's body, infected with a stolen chemical, is recovered by the us military, the corpse is then cremated, releasing the virus into the atmosphere over a small island. soon the infected locals turn into flesh-hungry zombies, and a group of soldiers on leave must team up with a group of tourists and board themselves up in a abandoned hotel as they try to fight off the aggressive living dead. i did not find this film to be as good as the original film, zombie flesh eaters. but it was still an ok horror film with some good action. i did not think that it was one of the best in the series. 4/10
