it doesn't take long to see why code name: diamond head didn't make it onto the network schedules. the tv pilot movie doesn't get past the credits before it's obvious just how bad it's going to be. maybe i missed something, because the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense. based on what i got out of the muddled mess, a terrorist or thief or something named "tree" (ian mcshane) goes to hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon. the world's dullest secret agent, johnny paul (roy thinnes), is out to stop him. there might have been more, but trust me
