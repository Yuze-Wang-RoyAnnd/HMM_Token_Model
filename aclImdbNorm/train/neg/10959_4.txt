i'm a fan of the series and have read all 7 books. i wanted to see this just to see how it was done. all i can say, is that the only people who should watch this are ones who have already read the series and are curious about it. its pretty bad, and will turn you off reading them. not to be mean, but lucy is so ugly it detracts from the movie. was she the directors daughter? seriously, i'm sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth. she had an overbite that would put any beaver to shame. the movie just loses so much in translation. cs books don't translate as easily as the tolkein lotr books, or even harry potter.<br /><br />one thing they did right! aslan! very well done. although the other human actors with painted faces ( beavers, wolf) look silly, aslan was really well done since it was not just a human actor walking around. ( i guess its like that old horse custume? 2 people inside? ) also, i would be curious what kids think of this movie. maybe they would enjoy it? but as for adults, safe bet they wont, even if a cs fan.
