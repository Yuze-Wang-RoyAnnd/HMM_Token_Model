well, i was excited at first to download an animated open source movie, only to be ruined by a demo reel. the animation is excellent, the lip syncing is awful, and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand what's going on, only to realize nothing is going on. you feel no emotion for the characters, only pity for the creators for wasting their time. i have seen short films with twice the emotion in half the time! this could of been an excellent short film, if they had just taken the time to hire a real director. i'm sure everyone over at blender is excited to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities, but sorry guys-story telling is what makes a movie.
