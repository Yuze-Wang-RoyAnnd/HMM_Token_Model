for loyal duran duran fans who want to watch a good music video, skip this one. the producers decided to get creative and make this 80's video something of a sci-fi story, involving the evil barbarella villain from which the band got its name. <br /><br />what makes this idea fail is that right in the middle of some great 80's duran duran songs, confusing and annoying cut scenes take place showing the fictional antagonist trying to stop the band at one of their concerts. not only is the good music repeatedly interrupted, but we have to suffer through some cheap spin-off story hosted by an evil dr. mario. it's almost too much to bear. 2/10
