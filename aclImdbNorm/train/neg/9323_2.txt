what did i just watch? i spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen. the concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite scary seeing is there are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns....but having it be a 300 pound nursery rhyme reciting killer clown makes a mockery of the genre. i still am wondering how the character mark wasn't able to run away from the clown...he's 300 pounds, he's gotta get tired eventually. the whole ending made me get up and literally say aloud "what did i just watch?" apparently brandon is denise's cousin.... and they had got it on near the middle of the movie meaning he had sex with his cousin.....yeah that's something people want so see *shudders*.<br /><br />another thing i found hilariously stupid was the opening scene where the clown stabs a woman and she says "what did you do?" well bytch, what do you think he just did? the last thing that was stupidly funny was one second the main character was slapping the hitch-hiker and calling her a c*nt and then 5 minutes later saying violence isn't helping anything....did the writer of the script give the line to the wrong guy? none of this movie makes sense anyway.<br /><br />the movie was more or less a dumb low budget porno which i got sucked into buying (all 3.99)and got no entertainment out of it besides the sex scenes. i'm surprised the fat clown didn't join the orgy, would have fit right in. i hoped the movie would have some entertainment value like other b movies might have, but i was wrong. this is a moronic piece of garbage that's not even worth watching.<br /><br />1 out of 10
