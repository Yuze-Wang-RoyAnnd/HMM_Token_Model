after sitting through this pile of dung, my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie. it was that listless and formulaic. but the u.s. propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves--disappointingly--that it's the work of humans. call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, "we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq, etc. the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like, "i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip" with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene. the "reasoning" behind each plot turn and new "clue" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. and there's also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with dr. whatever-her-name-was being chided by all involved for "never shutting up." she's clearly in the movie only for looks, but they felt the need to slap a "dr." title on her character to give her some gravity. at one point, cage's character says, "don't you ever shut up?" and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like she's a child. truly grotesque. the only benefit to this movie was that it's so astonishingly bad, you do get a few laughs out of it. the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. creepy....
