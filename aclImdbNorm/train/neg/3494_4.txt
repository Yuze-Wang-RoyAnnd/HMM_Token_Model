considering its popularity, i found this movie a huge disappointment. maybe i was expecting too much from this film. after all, it is one of the most well known martial arts films of the 1970s, but i could never figure out why. the story is uninteresting. it is also a very talky movie with sporadic action sequences. my biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that i could root for, since the intended hero is an idiot. director chang has no sense of style, and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative. i know this is not supposed to be high art, but i found the movie boring. definitely not the best example of this much-beloved genre. its cult status escapes me. i recommend you to skip it.
