note to george litman, and others: the mystery science theater 3000 riff is "i don't think so, *breeder*".<br /><br />my favorite riff is "why were you looking at his 'like'?", simply for the complete absurdity. that, and "right well did not!" over all, i would say we must give credit to the mst3k crew for trying to ridicule this tv movie. you really can't make much fun of the dialog; bill s was a good playwright. on the other hand, this production is so bad that even he would disown it. a junior high school drama club could do better.<br /><br />i would recommend that you buy a book and read 'hamlet'.
