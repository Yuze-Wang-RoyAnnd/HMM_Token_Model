yes, even as a fan of shows like survivor and the apprentice, this show is pretty bad. i didn't mind the first couple of shows, but then realizing how pathetic everyone was to actually go on the show in the first place.the antics of alex and aaron giving men a bad name at the way they cheated on or dumped their choice at the first opportunity really was not a good look for the show.<br /><br />ryan, you can have trista. she had the most annoying voice i've ever heard on television, and she definitely wasn't the smartest girl around (very media savvy, but i doubt there's much more there).<br /><br />i haven't really watched any of the shows since, apart from the occastional re-run on daytime tv. i think the point of reality tv is to treat it as "entertaining trash". view it as something you can laugh over, and don't have to think too hard about ( i don't watch csi its like reality tv-tired and clich'ed, but you have to think too much anyway while watching).<br /><br />a couple of thoughts on some reasons fro going on the show. at the very first 'the woman tell all" woman such as amy ( who had a lot of class about her) commented that she had tried every scene aka the bar and club scene to meet a guy and it wasn't happening for her. hey amy, how about joining a club? getting a hobby? doing charity work? changing your job to one where you meet more guys? gees, all i know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner.<br /><br />amy and many of the other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of meeting "the perfect man'. clue to ladies: he doesn't exist. there are, however, many great guys out there that would make great husbands, some who may be right for you! they may not earn six figures a year or be a jfk junior look alike, but they are great guys all the same. the shallowness of woman on this show is quite unbelievable. im still a youngster, at was lead to believe that woman gradually grew out of their shallowness as they got older and more realistic about their future partner. this show is proving otherwise.<br /><br />overall this show does a lot to confirm many stereotypes of how woman view men in society. it really is a terrible show and i think all of these types of shows should just stop being made. the best dating shows by a country mile are blind date and the fifth wheel because they are fun. nothing is manned more between the "couples" than a simple night out. the bachelor, sadly takes itself way too seriously.
