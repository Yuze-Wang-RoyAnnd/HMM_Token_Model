i watched this film alone, in the dark, and it was full moon outside! i didn't do it in purpose, it just happened in this way. so all the elements were there for this film to scare the hell out of me!! well, it didn't, in fact i wanted to shut off the dvd player after only 8 minutes, but i thought come on give it a chance, unfortunately i did. the acting was awful, the only one with some decent acting was samaire armstrong. the plot is not original, if you are a horror fan then it is just the same stuff you have seen many times before. some scenes didn't make sense at all, and you just get the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer! the monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie. the (scary) scenes looked like they belong to a horror movie from the 80s when there was not enough technology, yet some good movies were made back then! i was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the movie, i thought couldn't they put some money in this and make it decent?!! i couldn't agree more with the ratings that the movie got, it is also my rating for it, 3 out of 10.
