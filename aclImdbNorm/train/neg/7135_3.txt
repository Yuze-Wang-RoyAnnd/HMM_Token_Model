i'm sorry to say that there isn't really any way, in my opinion, that an enzo would really be able to keep up with a saleen s7 twin turbo. the power to weight advantage possessed by the s7 would just be too great. the s7 has a power:weight ratio of 3.93 lbs/hp while the enzo has 4.61 lbs/hp. the s7s low end is much better too. sorry ferrari fans but the saleen just gets it done so much better.<br /><br />as for other parts of this film, i just have to say it's so substandard as to be pathetic. the story is way too weak. the acting in this lemon is worse than daytime soaps.<br /><br />i can say that as far as it being a treatise on negative psychology its kind of a gem. this film is nothing if not a glaring definition as to what narcissism and sociopathy are all about. its all about these rich punks getting their rocks off while showing only traces of feigned remorse for all the innocent road users they cause injury or death too.<br /><br />i can't give the film a "1 star" rating because it didn't compel me to actually walk out of the theater. i also think that having an amazingly beautiful brunette with killer blue eyes as the leading female saves it from being completely abysmal....although there is no way her singing would put her on the cover of 'variety'.<br /><br />ps: the guy who plays jason is sooooo the skid row version of james vanderbeek.
