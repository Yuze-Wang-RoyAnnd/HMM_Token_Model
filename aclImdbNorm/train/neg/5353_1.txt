i had the "privilege" of attending a special screening of 'the absence of light' at a horror convention in ohio.<br /><br />first off, you know you're in trouble when the director introduces a film, saying: "now keep in mind, we didn't have much money..." not that no-budget films are bad, but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse, the results are always poor. and there is no better example than this unwatchable sleep-fest. <br /><br />actually, 'absence of light' marks a first in the world of underground cinema: it's the only time i've seen a dream-cast of talented genre vets actually bore me. charismatic actors like david hess, tony todd and reggie banister randomly enter and exit the movie and prove to be every bit as uninteresting as the amateurish no-names. who are their characters? what are they talking about? who cares? it's all so dull, you'll cease to care about anything or anyone.<br /><br />after thirty minutes of this endurance test, i gave up and walked out of the theater. not surprisingly, so did most of the cast members in attendance. <br /><br />any curious genre fans would do well to stay away from this. with a little luck, this movie won't ever see the "light" of day.
