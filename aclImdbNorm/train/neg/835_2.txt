having watched both the lion king and lion king ii and enjoyed both thoroughly. i thought lion king 1.5 might be worth watching. what a disappointment ! disney must be getting desperate for revenues.<br /><br />especially now that they lost the deal with pixar.<br /><br />basically, they just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the editor's floor (or garbage can) and glued them together to make a<br /><br />quick buck. unlike lk i & ii, both of which had strong story lines.<br /><br />this movie hardly has a story at all. while the characters and animation are always fun to look at, there is simply not enough material here for a movie. some of the bits could have been good 2nd disk fillers on the original offerings.<br /><br />disney - shame on you for putting this trash out to make a quick buck!<br /><br />next time take the time and effort and put our an enduring work.
