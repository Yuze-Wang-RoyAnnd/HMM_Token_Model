i can't believe the likes of guillermo del toro and kim bassinger got involved ins this piece of garbage! the script is so poorly written and the directing so weak (both by the same person) that its hard to find more one-dimension characters in a film. the dialogs are so lame that this so called thriller got laughs out of the few fools that got into the theatre. the setup it's tricky, inviting you to believe you are going to watch a chilling thriller and suddenly it turns out into the most stupid persecution film. bassinger's character is so dumb, that she actually stops to scream to god "where are you!" so the people after her can follow, and then takes a leak!!!! and then she apparently got into the smallest wood in the world, i mean, she runs all over the place and the killers never loose track of her, and this happens in the middle of the night. it really makes me wonder, is that really the best writing people in hollywood can find that they spend millions producing it.
