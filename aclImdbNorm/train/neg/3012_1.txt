the movie opens up with a long single shot of aisles in factory crammed with workers. my, what we've done to the planet you might think. i hope we get to see other things like this.<br /><br />that's very rare. when you're not looking at a horribly filmed angle of the narrator at a lecture hall, you're watching him set up his camera to take pictures in different locations. it'd be nice if chose areas that were more fitting with his topic but he doesn't. so, then you'll hear some more narration, watch a few pictures go by and watch him set up his camera. why not use the filming camera to show more of the landscapes instead? it really kills any sense of pacing and paints the guy as more of vain jerk.<br /><br />i could read tips on how someone set up their camera, fast forward through this whole movie and waste a lot less time.
