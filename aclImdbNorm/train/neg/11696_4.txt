i began watching this movie with low expectations, as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a s.k. novel ( a novel i never read).<br /><br />i'm glad my expectations were low because the movie wasn't nothing close to good, but it manages to keep you interested. what really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the actors. the movie is overlong, hasn't no "nice" shots and no scares, the dialogs are dumb and the special effects are crap.<br /><br />the only things good are that, as i said, it keeps you interested ( i guess the book must be good) without using much horror cliches.<br /><br />my vote 4/10.
