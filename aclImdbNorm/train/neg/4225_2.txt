this movie is another christian propaganda film in the line of the omega code. not that that is necessarily bad but for the fact that most propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message they wish to deliver. if you enjoy a styrofoam portrayal of life on the streets and the way the gospel can change a life, than perhaps you may enjoy this movie. i say, save your money and rent the cross and the switchblade or the mission. when will christian directors learn that sometimes people say bad words? it was frustrating to see criminals depicted who are not allowed to swear (huh? criminals say bad words?) and flat characters i really could not relate to. also, it would've been great if the movie had shown some t&a. now that would be something i'd like to pay to see. who was the blockhead who compared this communion wafer-thin story of a movie with the boondock saints and the sting?
