my wife and i just finished watching b^usu aka the booth. she fell asleep during some parts of the movie. i really wish i had taken a snooze with her, but the unfortunate fact is that the main character's voice is so loud and grating that it was impossible for me to sleep. when our protagonist speaks, it makes me want to hear regis philbin and william shatner sing karaoke. he also has no redeeming qualities. i was hoping he'd get hit by a bus five minutes into the film.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, i love asian horror cinema, but the booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really make no damned sense at all. if you want some good asian cinema, check out a tale of two sisters or into the mirror. avoid the booth like the plague, especially if you suffer from frequent migraines.
