sadly, it's true. "legiunea str"ain"a" exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of daneliuc's irreversible failure.<br /><br />as it was already said, the author lost the faculty to coalesce his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form. maniacally concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any legitimacy, he only gathers a disordered pile of events, unable to follow the least story-line. the script's level is similar to a "c^antarea rom^aniei" amateur play about the glorious feats of socialist realism - only, turned upside down: while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugary festivism, now daneliuc is as perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting scatology. the ideas content is zero, and the "message", infantile and didactic, at a kindergarten level.<br /><br />unfortunately, he also forgot the most elementary professional tenets. he isn't able anymore to organize a dramatic situation, to order it in a correct movie scene, to frame it right and to edit it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar. his level of story-telling in film-images is similar to phrasing something like: "holy sheet man it ain't nuthin right 'ere, and all da people is asses!" what a huge distance from the impressive artist of 1976-1984, who had created unique works as "cursa", "proba de microfon", "v^an"atoarea de vulpi" - and even "croaziera" and "glissando"... sic transit gloria mundi...
