"while traveling in the mountains, a man is attached by a mysterious creature that promptly departs, leaving no trace of its presence. unbeknownst to the man, he has been attacked by a werewolf and now he's inherited the curse associated with such creatures. now our hero must race against time to rid himself of this dreadful affliction before the next full moon," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />horrifically re-produced from the original spanish, "the fury of the wolf man" loses whatever charms it may have possessed in its original form. lycanthropic paul naschy's werewolf characterization is uneven and ineffectual. dominatrix scientist perla cristal and sexy assistant ver'onica luj'an never get close enough to truly titillate. the often incoherent storyline isn't even ghoulishly amusing.
