deep shock plays out like a tv movie: a whole cast of commercial-quality actors, a poorly designed creature to be the "bad guy," and a script that is more full of technical, political jargon and importances than it knows what to do with.<br /><br />i checked out the movie because of the creature (i love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos), and right off the bat, i got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie. the actors i expected because of the type of film it is (really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point). the music was typical, not-thought-out action symphonic music.<br /><br />i liked the design of the computers and technical equipment, along with the mini-sub design. the movie even flowed really well, with guiding screens letting you know which set you're watching the story unfold in. but there isn't much of a story here anyways.<br /><br />this movie gets a 3/10 stars imo. the boring search and destroy mission to blow up the north pole and these creatures protecting it...kinda lame. even lamer is the tagged-on love relationship between two of the characters that you don't see coming. chalk this one up to being a movie which tries to get actors' careers off the bench and into a video. don't bother.
