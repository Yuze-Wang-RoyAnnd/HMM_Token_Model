the plot certainly seemed interesting enough. how can a real-life brutal murder be turned into a truly boring movie? well, you can watch "wonderland" and find out.<br /><br />i had heard of the wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an interesting true story of some genuinely sadistic people. unfortunately, there is zero character development, so we never get a chance to understand why any of this was done or get a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters. the pace of the direction was very tedious. this all leads to an extraordinarily boring movie.<br /><br />given that dawn schiller - a central character as holmes's girlfriend - was an associate producer and that holmes's wife was a consultant on the film, we should have had the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters.
