this movie has no plot and no focus. yes, it's supposed to be a slap-stick, stupid comedy, but the screen-writers have no idea what the movie was about. even the title doesn't go along with the movie. it should have been called "cool ethan" or "cheaters never win" or something like that. the characters are not developed and no one cares what happens to them! the girl roommate character (from that 70's show) was the only person worth watching. she was hilarious and stole every scene she was in. the others need to make sure that their own college diplomas are in the works since they'll need a career other than acting.
