i really did like this show, once upon a time. that is, until i realized all the faults in it. it's so unrealistic. i know it's fiction, but it isn't even the slightest bit believable. here's why. **spoilers ahead folks...** are we really supposed to believe that a kid like yugi would be descended from a pharaoh of ancient egypt? c'mon! he's the biggest nerd on the face of the earth. and what's up with the pharaoh (a.k.a. atem and/or yami's) hair? last i checked, pharaohs were shaved (except for a small bit of hair atop the head) and wore fancy hats.<br /><br />and, are we supposed to be convinced that an evil wealthy boy genius, named seto kaiba, can legally run a successful business while still having time to go to a shoddy little school like 'domino high'? puh-leeze! first off, he'd have to legally be an adult to run a company. and that would make him not really all too much of a boy genius, since he'd be the only adult in his class. and second off, why would he attend a school like 'domino high', when his business is clearly successful enough for him to attend a fancy snobbish academy? plus, the side plots with his little brother are so sappy and lame. every time you turn around, that kid's been kidnapped by goons for the baddie. *yawn* nothing new, nothing new.<br /><br />joey is the poor kid, who lives with a good-for-nothing father. it says that joey earns all the money to attend his school, because his father's an alcoholic, but you never once see joey do anything that resembles work. he doesn't even mention work. and his sister serenity is a complete moron. why would she choose a snob like duke (who dressed her brother in a dog costume and publicly humiliated him on television) over a nice guy like tristan? is she really that clueless? various characters throughout the show, get possessed by demonic forces, get their souls stolen by demonic forces, and fall prey to mental illness. (oh, that's child-safe, not.) tea is the typical girl-next-door type, whose only purpose is to be yugi/yami's girlfriend. and while she has some cool points to her, she just doesn't have enough time to shine as a main character.<br /><br />the animation is simply awful. all the characters look sickly and anorexic. the perspectives are terrible (especially when they do close-ups of somebody's hand) and the colors look good, but not stellar.<br /><br />but the worst plot hole to the series was the fact that yami says that his millennium puzzle can send souls back to their bodies. if this was so, how come he didn't save yugi's grandpa in the first place, when pegasus stole his soul, and save himself the trouble of getting it back?<br /><br />all it really is, is a commercial for itself. the only plus side to it is "yu-gi-oh: the abridged series" by littlekuriboh.<br /><br />please. do something more worthwhile. like, watch the abridged version.<br /><br />1/10
