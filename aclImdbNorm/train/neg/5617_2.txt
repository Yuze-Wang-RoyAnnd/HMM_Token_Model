this documentary film is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence, in which brian flemming, perhaps purposely, fails to mention important evidence to the contrary. perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest: his claims concerning the invalidity of paul's testimony about jesus christ disregard key facts, like: **the existence of some formulated creeds within paul's letters. these creeds suggest that most of the central claims about jesus were already formulated into statements of faith possibly within a few years of christ's death and resurrection. **the testimonies of the early christians can't just be tossed out as mere fantasy. there were indeed many people claiming to be the messiah during that period, but only one of them has remained: jesus. why? because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed christ was the messiah, and go on to die for those beliefs, if they knew that he had not been resurrected. **even if the gospels are dated more liberally, we are still talking about accounts of jesus written within the lifetimes of other eyewitnesses that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these gospels. and there is evidence that the gospels were written much earlier. <br /><br />what i am saying is that flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-serving piece of work that hodge podges different arguments and evidence to serve his anti-christian view. don't be fooled by poor investigation.
