one of those, "why was this made?" movies. the romance is very hard to swallow. it is one of those romances, that, suddenly, "click" - they are in love. the movie is filled with long pauses and uncomfortable moments - the drive-in restaurant being the most notable. charles grodin does a credible job but for most of the movie it's just him and louise lasser. ask yourself, do you want to watch grodin with his neurosis and lasser with her neurosis together for a hour and half?
