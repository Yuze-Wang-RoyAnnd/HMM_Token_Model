this movie was bad to say the least!!! the plethora of superb cars are disgraced to have have been showcased in this lame movie. it starts off with a race from l.a. to las vegas to be completed in 1hr 45min...in a ferrari f430. i did that in 1hr 50min in a tiny 4cylinder 140hp 1993 honda accord. seriously...this movie does not do justice to these cars. obviously these writers are just that and probably drive under the speed limit with their hands @ 10 & 2 o'clock. i remember seeing on the news how eddie griffin crashed a 1.5 million dollar ferrari enzo going 30-40mph>>> youtube.com/watch?v=cnvrmzx2kms <br /><br />and...the director andy cheng is the biggest sellout!!! he brings shame to his own race. i wonder just how many people he orally pleased just to break into hollywood. he partook in a movie that portrays asian americans in such a negative and false way. asian women>>cheap money grubbing whores. asian men>>losing compulsive gamblers & thugs that get beat all the time . what the heck is all the fear about asians?? why the need to always portray them in such a negative connotation?? i am so sick of the way hollywood always portrays asians in such a negative and false pretext.
