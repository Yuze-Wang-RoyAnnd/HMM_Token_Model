this film was positively the worst film i have ever watched. i couldn't sit through the whole thing. i also think writer must have some weird fetish for women peeing puking and crapping... i mean what was that all about! i cant believe this was even made and am disgusted at have #ingwasted a lb4 rental fee. the quality both picture and sound are terrible, the acting... well doesn't exist . it was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee, crap and puke were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup. urghh....... avoid at all cost! the girls looked like they had been picked off the street and only got the part cos they'd be willing to take their tops off... while these girls have nice bodies it certainly didn't make up for the fact their shrieking was awful unconvincing and a pain to my ears.<br /><br />this was like (possibly worse) than an ammateur school production without any proper direction and hey there is no need for a set as it all seems to revolve around a car?! <br /><br />definatey not one to buy folks. sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but i could not find anything positive to say and i would like to think i may save someone else wasting their money like i have.
