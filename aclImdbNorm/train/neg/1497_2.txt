understand i'm reviewing the film i have seen. i realize virtually all the nudity and gore was cut from this film, thus neutering it completely. when seeing names like ginger lynn and jenna jameson attached, i knew i wasn't going to get a horror classic, but at the very least i expected gratuitous boobies and bloodshed. but no, this has got to be the most butchered modern horror film, i mean it's easy to tell there is much more to certain scenes', but they suddenly cut away, or the scene just totally ends right as it begins. how does one screw up cannibals' and porn stars? i mean thats a winning formula, it makes me wonder if the director slept with some executive's wife or something, because it is literally amazing how much got cut from this. reading about it a few years back in fangoria, i was excited, it looked like a fun film, but unfortunately the true film is locked in a vault somewhere, and we must endure this piece of excrement retitled evil breed. hopefully an unrated cut will be released someday, as i think a good movie exists in this mess, but until then best grab a twelve pack of bud, cause thats the only way you'll make it through this movie.
