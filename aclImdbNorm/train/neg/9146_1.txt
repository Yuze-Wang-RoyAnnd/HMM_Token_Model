sam mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again. if he does he should be arrested on the spot...at the very least for petty larceny. anybody who pays even a dime to rent any of his garbage should file a claim and be compensated. this was innocently my first viewing of his "work"...and it will my last. ed wood looks awfully good to me right now.<br /><br />when i return this piece of crap to the video store, i will personally ask that it be taken off the shelf. an active supporter of gay cinema, i am incensed and angered that this warped, exceedingly untalented man-child be allowed to distribute and package something like this, with a coltish pretty boy on the cover (jamie brett gabel, who, thankfully, has no other acting credits in imdb) and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait, and then market it as a "movie" rental. trust me, this has no place being on any rack anywhere; it is simply not a movie in any sense of the word. offensive, irresponsible junk such as this can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema (hell, gay rights in general!) for those tempting to rent this out because of the cover, you will be disappointed. gabel is not as flattering to look at on film as he is on the cover, and he appears once or twice without a shirt -- that's it. instead, the homely mroavich inflicts on us his own disgusting, sorry-looking dough-boy nakedness.<br /><br />this "thing" he "assembled" is a reverse vanity project for mraovich. both he and his friend michael habousch (who, i understand, puts out similar sleazy garbage) are terrible in this. mraovich is purposely posing as a complete no-talent (in all fields), desperate to grab onto any "loser" attention he can for himself. he is to be pitied.
