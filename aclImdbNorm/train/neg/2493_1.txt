a truly dreadful film. i did not know initially that this was a kiwi effort - but very soon i started to realize that all the characters were speaking with hardly disguised kiwi accents under the fake american ones. why did it need to be set n america anyway? - it could have been set in nz and then the actors could have used their normal voices. surely someone in the production team could hear the dreadful attempts at speaking with american accents? a bad bad film. i am surprised it has lasted this long - how did it make it out of the can? it just seemed like a very poor attempt at a segal/willis type action man flick.a total waste of money! if there was any taxpayer money in this piece of trash, i would be leading a revolution to have all the money put back into the treasury. i am still reeling (get it? pun, reeling!) at the absolute garbage i have just seen. why did i continue to watch? well, i am a movie fanatic and cant help ,myself!
