i have been searching for the right words to describe this film. at first i was inclined to simply skip to more significant matters, as the film does not rise to a level deserving comment.<br /><br />yet, i stopped, puzzled as to how to describe such stuff and somewhat intrigued by the challenge presented by the question: "what can one say about such a film?" rubbish? no, its not rubbish, rubbish can be recycled into something useful. greenhouse gas? no, its not greenhouse gas, greenhouse gases help plants grow large and healthy.<br /><br />finally, i struck on "not even bad," a rework of the phrase "not even wrong" used sometimes in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed and not even worthy of correction. that's it then, georgia rule: not even bad.
