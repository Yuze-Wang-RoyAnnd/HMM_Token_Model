my friends usually can put up with a lot of hopeless movies but this one was too poor for us to even watch it to the end. it was just so boring and unoriginal. not even the "hot" girls that starred in this movie could keep me watching. everything was just predicable and annoying.<br /><br />the acting was at times good.....but more times bad. the most annoying character in the whole movie that you just wanted to die would have to be the main characters best friend. the more i saw him the more i wanted to smash my screen. (you know what fat ugly kid i'm talking about)<br /><br />the plot has been done so many times before i think they should be sued by other movie companies. ok, it is a good idea but thats all this movie had.<br /><br />overall this movie can only be watched if by your self, to save any abuse from your friends. or, if you have absolutely nothing better to do.
