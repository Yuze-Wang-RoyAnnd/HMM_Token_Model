i have done quite a few reviews on imdb and this film is unique in that i never saw the entire movie. it was so terribly stupid and unfunny that i just couldn't sit through it--though i tried.<br /><br />the biggest problem with this and any mel brooks movie i call "the mel quotient". in other words, the better his movie, the less of him you see in the film. think about it--the producers and young frankenstein were great films and he was barely in them at all. but, films like life stinks and space balls are chock full of mel and are pretty dopey movies (yes, i did not like space balls--but this isn't the place to talk about that).<br /><br />second, apart from cancer, rectal itch and mental retardation, i can't think of a less funny topic than homelessness. this is just a comedy breaker. think about it, folks. the funniest(?) scene in the movie has mel making whoopee with leslie ann warren in a dumpster!! and this is funny in what way?
