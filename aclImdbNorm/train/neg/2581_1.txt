first off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that i hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as being so stupid that you wounder if they're all the result of inbreeding.<br /><br />now i will say this i did see the first three american pie movies and while they weren't the most amazing movies that i'd ever seen they were all right (and outright masterpieces compared to the three "american pie presents" films), i still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie?<br /><br />i also have a few other questions too.<br /><br />who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources? <br /><br />who approved the final script (and what was that person smoking when they approved it)? <br /><br />and lastly why did anyone think that it deserved to be released into theaters where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you live when it should have gone straight to the discount bin at blockbuster or wal mart?<br /><br />there is so much wrong with this movie that i can't write a really comprehensive review of it because it would exceed the maximum allowed words on this forum so i'll just touch on the biggest things wrong with it.<br /><br />the plot is generic uninspired and stupid and characters are all about as interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minutes but the biggest thing that i can see wrong with this movie is the acting.<br /><br />while most of the cast are talentless no namers who will probably be forgotten in a few years,<br /><br />the one and only big name in this movie is eugene levy who spends almost all of the time he is on screen with this knowing smirk on his face that says to the viewer "i know this isn't funny and i'm wasting my talents but hey i'm getting payed for it so who cares" he doesn't even try to make any of his jokes funny (he really deserves better than this garbage). <br /><br />as i mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are horrible even though some of them have been in some really great tv shows, tyrone savage (from the classic canadian series wind at my back) plays a character who is so unbearable unlikeable and irritating (there are things that he could teach to tropical skin diseases)that you almost wish he'd die a slow and painful death on screen, christopher mcdonald (ncis, law & order) just hangs around on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this film.<br /><br />maybe the next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line so they can get around the mpaa and get an r rating this movie goes all out with pointless nudity vulgarity and pointlessly offencive sexual content that it should have gotten the x rating (the ratings board must have been drunk or on drugs when they reviewed this film for its rating). <br /><br />it's interesting that twenty five years ago when wes craven submitted a nightmare on elm street to the mpaa for a rating review they forced him to cut twenty five seconds of footage (i believe that it was part of a death scene that had a silicone casting of a breast in it) to avoid getting an x rating and he had no other choice but to do it or the film wouldn't have been released, <br /><br />but this kind of needlessly offensive trash can get the r rating today because it's all done in the name of comedy, if this movie was a drama or horror film with this kind of content there would have been a huge stink over the content and it would havegotten the dreaded x rating.<br /><br />the last thing that really annoys me is the writing, this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old kid with an extremely overactive sexual imagination its quite juvenile and extraordinarily crass, nearly every expository situation that is supposed to move the corpse that this movie calls a plot along is so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and and the so called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes, never mind the often repulsive sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior it feels like this film was written by some incompetent first year hack in a low rent film school script writing class.<br /><br />the long and short of it is its time to kill this series before it gets any stupider more crass and offensive, this pie is filled with road apples.
