bruce lee was a great martial artist, but this film still is probably one of the worst films ever made. it has bruce lee die as the result of falling off a helicopter after being hit by some kind of a ninja knife to the back of the neck but it doesn't explain how he came to be on a helicopter since the prior scene has him near but not on the helicopter which is already 200 feet in the air. it just gets downright absurd from then, like something out of a cheap comic book. maybe the idea isn't so rotten but it isn't done with any degree of artistry from a film making point of view. there are dozens of such martial arts bombers out there, usually all made in hong kong. i think that jean claude van dam improved the genre with adding plausible stories in his films and having film makers who know how to use the camera. even steven seagal's films are way better than 90 percent of the martial arts junk movies made during the 1970s and early 1980s in hong kong. 'game of death ii' falls into the category of junk cinema in my opinion, despite bruce lee being in it.
