three russian aristocrats soak up the decadence of monte carlo, despite the fact they are down to their last franc. in order to support their lavish lifestyle, the three use the services of a counterfeiter, and use the notes at the casinos, hoping to exchange the bogus currency for a jackpot. andrew hughes, a us envoy, arrives at monaco with his wife helen, and the three decide to make pals with the visitors, hoping for financial assistance. one of the three russians, count sergius karamzin, plans to go further, with continuous advance towards helen, while disappointing the count's maid, who loves sergius. eventually, circumstances play their hand against the three aristocrats. its obvious that von stroheim was trying to convey a message (with the foolishness of american women and the improper behaviors of the aristocrats), rather than tell a story, and the film really can bore modern audiences, like me, easily by doing that. even the acting, which is great in later evs like greed and the wedding march, is just run of the mill here. the film could have used improvements on various levels. rating, 3.
