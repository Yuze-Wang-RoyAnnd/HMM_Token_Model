some unrealistic movie spoilers included.<br /><br />from real life experiences, this movie continued to disappoint from the very beginning. i'm currently deployed on my second tour to iraq as an infantry man. this film has nothing near what would happen in real life occurrences. from the very start to name a few: the bomb cart, the eod elements rolling out solo with no escorts, the eod staff sergeant sneaking of vbc, having sleeves rolled the entire time in acus, to where i had to call it quits on my 2 dollar haji copy, the sniper scene. the list would continue, however, it is unnecessary to list things wrong happening with a time span of 2 minutes before more things were incorrect; and the point was made.<br /><br />this movie is for people and critics to watch that have no understanding or experience with deployments or the military.<br /><br />people with military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed with the inaccuracy.
