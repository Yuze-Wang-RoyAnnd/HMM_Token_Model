prom night (2008)<br /><br />directed by: nelson mccormick<br /><br />starring: brittany snow, scott porter, jessica stroup, and dana davis<br /><br />plot: three years ago, donna (brittany snow) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (jonathan schaech) who has a bit of a crush on her. now, she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends. once there, they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt. <br /><br />pros: i got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves.<br /><br />an example:<br /><br />everyone decides not to tell donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her (she doesn't seem that great) has escaped from prison. their reason: they don't want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. lol<br /><br />cons: let me start off by saying i'm a huge slasher fan. usually i can have fun with even the bad ones. i even like some pg-13 horror films. tourist trap (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated pg. i also enjoy poltergeist (1982) and the grudge (2004). so the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated pg-13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie.<br /><br />first of all, i had a big problem with the story. i like slasher films that don't even have stories. at least they can be entertaining. this is about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills her entire family. a few years later, he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends ...? then there were subplots that i doubt anyone cared about. claire (jessica stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and i couldn't care less. this should have been a lifetime feature, not a remake of prom night. <br /><br />and then ... this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes. i don't even care that it's not that gory, some of my favorite slashers (halloween, curtains, the original prom night) were not that gory but they still had effective murders. here, we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen, a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds, and a closeup on a bad actor's face as he screams in agony. i'm sure that 10 year-old girls were terrified, but not me.<br /><br />i also hated the characters. there was donna's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend bobby (scott porter) and i can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life, unless you are a gay male. then we had donna's annoying friends claire (stroup) and lisa (dana davis), and the token mean girl chrissy (brianne davis). if you thought the characters in death proof were annoying, try watching this movie. and don't get me started on ronnie (collins pennie) and the dj (jay phillips) who gave me flashbacks to usher's performance in she's all that.<br /><br />add to all that predictable plot turns, a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material, and you have quite a stinker.
