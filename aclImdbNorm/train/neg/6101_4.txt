almost a two-person play, and as such the dialog and the performances of the leads will be important. neither are particularly good. this might have been stronger, in fact, if it had first been crafted as a two-person play, and then worked into a film.<br /><br />anyway, a twitchy vampire who seems slightly autistic becomes infatuated with a stripper (as a result of watching too much porn in his crappy home). he wants to have her tell him about the daylight. he would have been better off finding someone with a day job, or someone who excels at painting a picture with words like a poet, but then they might not have a hot bod.<br /><br />after he gets her to do whatever he wants (and he's not terribly good at it), he intends to feed on her at 6 am, at which point the sun rises. much is made of that deadline, despite the fact that he also says that he can go without feeding, it will just make him hungrier. additionally, he claims he can't let the stripper go, since she knows about him, but he lets a number of other people go who learn what he is. there are a lot of inconsistencies.<br /><br />why this vampire chooses to live in a house so poorly boarded up that light from streetlamps and neighboring buildings pours in as if it were daytime, i'm not sure. with all the time in the world, you'd think he'd have done a better job, or fixed the place up a bit. he's clearly not a wealthy vampire.<br /><br />this is supposedly a remake, and i'm curious to see the original version of this, dance of the damned. although, that was directed by katt shea, and the other films she directed for corman (stripped to kill, stk ii) were pretty bad.
