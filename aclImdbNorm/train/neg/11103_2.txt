ok, so i just saw the movie, although it appeared last year... i thought that it was generally a decent movie, except for the storyline, which was stupid and horrible... first of all, we never get to know anything about the creatures, why they appeared, wtf are they doing in our world, and really, have they been on earth before we were or did they just come from space? secondly, the role of the butcher to maintain order is just so obviously created... really, how large could the underground for a sub station could have been? there were only so many of those creatures, so i think instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could have just planted some tactical bombs, or maybe clear the are and a nuke would have done the job. i know it sounds funny and it is, but i do not see the killing of people as being necessary... thirdly, leon acts like superman jumping on the train and fighting vinnie jones, who was way taller and bigger in stature. then again, when he faces the conductor he does nothing and acts as a wimp, watching all the abominations. i mean ok, the conductor had creepy help(lol), but if leon was so brave he would have gone all the way... i mean he risks his life first, then does nothing exactly when he should have. he could have died as a hero but lives as a coward... this might be the case, but not after showing so much braveness earlier on... then, the cop thing... come on! this was a city having a subway, i bet there must have been other cops except that lady, other police stations,this was really kind of silly... all in all, great acting by vinnie jones, interesting idea up to the reason behind it which is not really built at all... by the way, what did the signs on the chest mean? vinnie jones cannot make up for the rest...
