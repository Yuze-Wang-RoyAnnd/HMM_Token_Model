oh, brother...after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all i can think of is that old peggy lee song..<br /><br />"is that all there is??" ...i was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the u.s. i was too young to get in the theater (although i did manage to sneak into "goodbye columbus"). then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - finally i could see this film, except now i was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!!<br /><br />the only reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its u.s. release. millions of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors.<br /><br />cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box!<br /><br />elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..but if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten.<br /><br />instead, the "i am blank, blank" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (i am curious, lavender - for gay films, i am curious, black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that "naughty sex film" that "revolutionized the film industry"...<br /><br />yeesh, avoid like the plague..or if you must see it - rent the video and fast forward to the "dirty" parts, just to get it over with.<br /><br />
