can i do it 'till i need glasses? at the very least proves the point that anyone can make a movie. talent is not a consideration. the folks who unleashed this wretched pile of spewing vomit upon the world, lack any semblance of talent, taste or intelligence. the target audience must consist of the recently labotimized, and infants who play with their own feces. anyone else would be far too world wise to get even a snicker out of this film. it consists of a series of sophmoric skits in which the punchline does not even extend to the obvious. it ends at the ludicrous. the jokes told are the types of jokes that elementary school children tell (usually potty or sexually related) where they don't know the meaning of all of the terms they use. you know, like the one about daddy's car and mommy's garage. to apply any sterner method of criticism would be pointless, since the usual standards of acting, writing, direction and such have never even been heard of by the creative "minds." behind this mess. not to be judgemental, but anyone who enjoyed this film should seriously reflect upon their purpose on this earth.<br /><br />
