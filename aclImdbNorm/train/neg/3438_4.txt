haunted boat sells itself as 'the fog' meets 'open water'. in many ways this is accurate. there are scares and weird looking people to keep you interested.<br /><br />however the acting ability is poor at best. showing clear signs that this is merely a bunch of friends making a horror film. which in all credit they do to the best of their ability. when you accept the low budget makes it very difficult for special effects, with the ghosts looking pretty much like men with rubber masks on.<br /><br />many aspects of the film are creepy and strange. but it suffers for using too many twists and turns in a short space of time which just leaves you bored and confused. in terms of keeping you awake the film does it very well. ignoring the irrelevant twisting every 5 seconds near the end, you actually want to know what is going on. and are willing to wait the 1hr 35 minutes for the climax.<br /><br />this is no ghost ship but it'll definitely do for an evening in front of the t.v.
