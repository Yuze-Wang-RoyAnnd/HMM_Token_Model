the tooth fairy is about the ghost of an old deformed witch that lures children to her house to get a prize for their loose tooth and then takes their lives. the first few minutes introduce you to the 1949 beginning of the legend of the tooth fairy and then switches to present day. the worn out horror plot is pretty much saved by the solid acting. they could have done without the hammond brothers and a few other scenes, but overall the gore scenes were bloody but quick which had a minimizing effect. the eye candy is pretty good for both genders. camera work is good. dialog is fair but cheesy. i expected the film to be a bare bones, low budget, slasher with very few redeeming factors. i was surprised by the quality of the film.
