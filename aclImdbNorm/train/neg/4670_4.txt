this adaptation, like 1949's *the heiress*, is based on the henry james novel. *the heiress*, starring olivia de havilland, remains as a well-respected piece of work, though less true to james' original story than this new remake, which retains james' original title. it is the story of a awkward, yet loving daughter (leigh), devoted to her father (finney) after her mother dies during childbirth. the arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever, and considers her, as well as all women, simpleminded. when a young man (chaplin) of good family and little fortune comes courting, the father is naturally suspicious, but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man, is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him. leigh is a controversial actress
