i went to see the omega code with a group of other christians totaling about 15 people. we all expected a good piece of christian film-making. what we got was an excruciatingly painful, drawn-out, and pretty boring attempt at a film. it has good looking production values but also has poor acting, a weak script with lousy dialogue, and no real sense of direction. from the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night. we all hated it, and some people in our group placed this movie as reeking of more cheese than "anaconda." none of us could believe that the movie lasted less than 2 hours. flashy effects and crisp looking cinematography can't save this bad, bad movie. i'd give it a 3 out of 10, and the rating is only that high because i rented the abominable "movie" werewolf (1996) the night before i saw this movie.
