normally i would never rent a movie like this, because you know it's going to be bad just by looking at the box. i rented seven movies at the same time, including nightmare on elm street 5, 6 and wes craven's new nightmare. unfortunately, when i got home i found out the videostore-guy gave me the wrong tape. in the box of wes craven's new nightmare i found this lame movie.<br /><br />this movie is incredibly boring, the acting is bad and the plot doesn't make any sense. it's hard to write a good review, because i have no idea what the movie was really about. at the end of the movie you have more questions then answers.<br /><br />on 'max power's scale of 1 to 10' i rate this movie: 1<br /><br />ps i would like to correct corinthian's review (right below mine). he says robert englund is ripping off lingerie, riding horses naked, etc. the guy that did those things was mahmoud, played by juliano mer, not by robert englund.
