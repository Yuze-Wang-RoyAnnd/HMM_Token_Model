i will admit that i have seen maybe five minutes of "jerry springer". i don't consider myself a snob, but i really think that i am above watching what's on his show. you should try to elevate yourself above that too.<br /><br />i saw this movie as part of a social studies event i was conducting. i was told that this movie really had little to do with springer himself, rather it centered on the lives of those who would appear on "springer." handled better, this movie might have actually been a fascinating look at how pathetic these people's lives actually are. i will admit, i felt a twinge of empathy for connie (molly hagan). this is all she has in life. how sad that she feels she must go on jerry's show in order to resolve this.<br /><br />i really feel sorry for molly hagan appearing in this. have you noticed that after this movie, she has mainly been relegated to "b" roles on tv? i will say this about hagan. she is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman. i have no doubt that she is very earnest in her acting and she tries to play her roles with a lot of empathy. the problem is that hagan can't carry a scene on her own. she just doesn't have what it takes to do a lead role. her best work will always be angel on "herman's head" (a show that was not great, but its heart was in the right place) and when she guested on "seinfeld" as sister roberta.
