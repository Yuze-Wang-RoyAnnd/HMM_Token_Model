i like jane austin novels. i love pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility books and movies, and i'm half way through mansfield park. but i couldn't stand emma. i gave up on the book after 2 chapters, and by the end of the movie i couldn't care less about emma. she didn't seem to change at all. maybe it was paltrows acting (which as excellent in se7en) or my lack of interest for the movie. dunno. <br /><br />the costumes are nice, but the dancing was clumsy compared to pride and prejudice dancing by colin firth and jennifer ehle.<br /><br />i gave it a 2 basically for the fact knightly is bloody gorgeous, and although it as a rather patchy performance for ewan mcgregor, i liked his singing.
