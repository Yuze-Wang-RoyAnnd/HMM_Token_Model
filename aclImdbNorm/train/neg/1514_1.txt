i just saw this film yesterday.<br /><br />my girlfriend wanted to see it only because of richard gere.<br /><br />i feel i wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend it's the last time we go to see a film just because a certain actor/actress is in it. i hope she learned the lesson because i had trouble keeping her in her seat. as of me, since i paid already, i wanted to see the end at least, just in the hope something good would turn up, but i didn't hold my breath, and luckily so cause i would have been a victim of the film just the same.<br /><br />this is not a black and white film, it's a black and black one. the main character (richard gere) is almost as bad as his registrants, and all sex offenders are portrayed as unredeemable hard core criminals and the bad ones among them were really very very bad. speak of a clich'e and the exploitation of a typical us phobia.<br /><br />richard gere's acting was good as usual but the blond girl that's supposed to replace him was wishy washy at best. totally unconvincing for the job.<br /><br />the film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a cheap, dramatic, and sensational turn that just is unreal. they just use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap violent acts of murders, vigilante beating, rape and torture - something that almost seems gratuitous. they even have a wolf attacking people in the film - how low can you get.<br /><br />i gather the film won't come out in the usa and will go straight to dvd. that's were it should have stayed in other countries too, but because it's hollywood and richard gere they just had to show it. believe me, without gere, the film is not even worth a b-series movie.
