wow-this one sucks. i'm gonna sum it up as quickly as possible. <br /><br />a count invites 4 naive sluts back to his castle. a bunch of nothing happens for a long time. some lame and un-erotic soft-core sex scenes happen. some girls get their heads cut off (off-screen)-the end.<br /><br />the only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes, some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue, and a few brief nudie shots. and believe me-those things are not enough to redeem the 90-minutes of tedium that this film is. in fact-the best part is the tacked on beginning from the distributor that features some slutty goth chicks covered in blood and showing their tits-and again-this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this garbage. as everyone else has noted- the title of the film is completely nonsensical-as there's absolutely no bloodsucking, nor dancing of any sort in the film at all. it may as well have been called 'the goat-raper leads the circle-jerk'-and at least then it would have had a better title that also pertains to nothing in the film. an accurate title would have been '90 minutes of torture'-another alluring title that would have at least been truthful...for the viewer. honestly-the trailer that's on the disc shows all the best parts (and i use the term 'best' extremely loosely...) so i highly suggest watching that instead if you're still curious.  i can't imagine anyone liking this wreck of a film-please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf. 2/10
