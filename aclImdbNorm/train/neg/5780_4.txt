i really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get better. don't get me wrong, it's not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to it's potential. the premise is good, the cast is great (i was especially pumped to witness the return of david naughton) and, god love 'em, you can tell everyone tried their best. it just falls short over and over again. "brutal massacre" should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only christopher guest can do christopher guest movies and, despite the fact he makes it look easy, you should probably just forget trying to do the same. naughton and brian o'halloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more often...they are the reason this gets 4 stars from me. if you're going to have the "spinal tap" of horror i suspect you might want the guy who made "spinal tap" to helm it...just thinking out loud there.
