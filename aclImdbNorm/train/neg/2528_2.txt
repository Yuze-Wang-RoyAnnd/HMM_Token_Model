the van is a feelgood movie about a guy who tries to lure girls into his new van, in order to seduce them. the only thing this movie doesn't fail at is precisely depicting the van fad in the us in the late 70s. it looks like it was totally made by amateurs. it's trash, but i loved it! i have to admit i am a fan of 70s trash! hope this one makes it to the imdb bottom 100!<br /><br />2
