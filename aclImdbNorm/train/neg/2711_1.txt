even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the 1960s (ok, so katie didn't join the manson family, and nobody died at altamont), this movie was still unbelievably awful. i got the impression that the "writers" just locked themselves in a room and watched "forrest gump," "the wonder years," and oliver stone's 60s films over and over again and called it research. a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode "head spinning". he was right.
