i am a big fan of stephen king. i loved the running man. so obviously i was very excited that someone had made a film of it. and when a local network showed the film, i was in heaven. i was all ready for a night of fun!<br /><br />the first indicator that something was wrong was when i noticed that someone had cast arnold schwarzenegger. i could simply not believe that a man who got famous for films filled with runnin' an' shootin' could play a more cunning part, as was described in the book. i still was convinced that this would be a good film, however. who knows, maybe arnold had some hidden talents?<br /><br />well, he didn't. i soon found out that the only reason he was even cast was because someone had re-written the entire story to make it about fightin' an' shootin'. yup, it was a standard arnold-film: hero is done wrong, hero solves problems by flexing his mighty muscles and scaring everyone away and hero gets the girl.<br /><br />i was stunned. this is not what the book said at all. i know that books can't be put on screen literally, but this didn't even have ties to the book. stephen king should have openly denounced any affiliation with the film and he should have forbidden using the title the running man for this shameless waste of film. i don't say it often, but this film was bad. if i weren't at home watching, i'd have tossed rotten tomatoes at the screen. once again: bad.<br /><br />(note that i used 'someone' a lot. i did this because i'm sure a lot of people are ashamed to have worked on this and i don't want to embarrass them even further by naming them here)
