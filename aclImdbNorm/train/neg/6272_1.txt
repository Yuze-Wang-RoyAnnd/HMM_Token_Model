that's a snippet of choice dialogue delivered by the evil, ballbusting lady assistant of a famous scientist to her prim maid just before she lures three incredibly dumb college girls to a mansion for behavior modification experiments. meanwhile, at the local bar, people drink and dance to lame 80s rock songs. a biker punk has sex with a cycle slut on a pinball table in front of a crowd of people, then tries to rape the scientist's virginal daughter jessica (debra hunter), who is in love with another biker (dale midkiff, from pet sematary), who, in turn, is in cohorts with the assistant! back at the house, the sorority bimbos swim, shower, change clothes and have sex with men from the bar. a small silver ball (part of the experiment) flies into victims mouths and turns them into drooling, killer zombies!<br /><br />if that isn't enough to entertain you, there's a hilarious theme song ("nightmare fantasy"), roller skating, some serious daisy dukes and a psychic hand puppet (!?) that warns "danger! danger!" just like the lost in space robot and recommends hitchhiking as one of the best ways to pick up men!<br /><br />this filmed-in-florida mess is so mind-numbingly awful that multiple viewings are recommended to soak it all in. and, hey isn't that nypd blue's detective jill kirkendall turned cnn newscaster andrea thompson as one of oft-nude bimbos? sure is! supposedly this was started in 1982 and new footage was added later for the video release in 1985.<br /><br />score: 1 out of 10 (and i mean that in a good way!)
