even if you subscribe to the knee-jerk anti-free-trade politics of this movie, it is still just the same tired note, played again and again and again. clink clink clink. even if you can accept a preacher with peroxide hair who advocates a return to first principles, the reverend billy is pretty hard to look at as a serious figure. the clownish reverend is the sort who wakes every morning with no aspiration more ethereal than to see his own face on tv before he climbs back into bed that night. he has a pretty wife, i have to admit, but it would take tons more than that to save this dreary mess of a movie. the interminable bus rides are the worst part--with progress shown--can you guess?--by a colored line moving across a map. aww, you guessed. oh well, it has the virtue of being short. is that the only favorable thing i can say? hmmmm. yep, afraid so.
