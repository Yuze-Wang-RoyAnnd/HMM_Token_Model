how could 4 out of 16 prior voters give this movie a 10? how could more than half the prior voters give it a 7 or higher? who is voting here? i can only assume it is primarily kids -- very young kids. the fact is that this is a bad movie in every way. the story is stupid; the acting is hard to even think of as acting; the characters are characterless; and the dialogue is terrible. i saw this one rainy afternoon on the sci-fi channel. in the sad event that it is ever rebroadcast, i suggest you read a book instead.
