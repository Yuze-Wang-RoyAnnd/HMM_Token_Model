man, even plan 9 from outer space is better than this movie. this flick doesn't have enough plot for half an hour, yet they managed to extend it for an eternity of more than an hour. jet li and corey yuen are pretty good, specially in those exaggerated fight scenes, but stuff like the legend of fong sai yuk is much better than this sorry thing that would be better left unmade.
