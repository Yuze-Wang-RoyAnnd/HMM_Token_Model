this movie displayed more racial hatred of jews by david mamet than i have<br /><br />have ever encountered in an american film. the sterotypes are so over the top that my ability to continue watching died. i was so disappointed at joe<br /><br />mantegna calling a bunch of men ,sitting in a new york jewish center cleaning weapons ,heros that common sense prevailed and i stopped. i am deeply<br /><br />disturbed at the concept that jews are not americans and "different". i suggest that mr. mamet is one of the causes of hatred not a healer of same.
