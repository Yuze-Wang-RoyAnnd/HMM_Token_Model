the movie appeals to public due to charisma of ben stiller and notoriety of j. aniston. it seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title, but there's nothing successful in this movie.<br /><br />polly is very well played by aniston, no doubt. this is the kind of character which suits her perfectly. <br /><br />bem stiller is the same troublesome guy like in " meet the parents", but in this movie the comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned above.<br /><br />the script is very poor with nothing special at all. with this two well payed actors the things could get a lot better - but what can they do when there is such a poor story and script.<br /><br />4 out of 10.
