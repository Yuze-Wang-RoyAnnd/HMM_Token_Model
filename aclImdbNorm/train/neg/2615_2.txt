i don't know why, but for some sick reason, i think since i've been on the disney sequel binge, i decided to just go ahead and see 102 dalmations. the first movie that was a remake of the disney cartoon classic starring glenn close as cruella de vil, it seemed like a sure hit, but it was just a bomb. i think the reason why these movies don't work is because 101 dalmations, the original, was a cartoon, it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults. this was not really that fun because it's adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings, i understand they're trying to make sure that it's appealing to the kids, but it's ridicules to see the way these actors are behaving in the film. and 102 dalmations's story isn't really that good.<br /><br />cruella de vil has been in prison for a while, but things change when she is proved that she now loves animals and is a pleasant human being. but her reputation is now damaged as a puppy-napper, but she buys a man's dog shelter and is all of a sudden is being loved by everyone and it looks like she's changed. but when she sees her probation officer's dalmatians, she goes crazy and starts seeing spots, and she looses it. she's back for revenge on puppies and is still determined to get that dalmation coat she's always wanted.<br /><br />glenn close is such an amazing actress, very under rated, but her taking on cruella de vil, she's good, but let's face it, this movie made the fun villain just more of a silly nut case. also, as cute as the puppies were, it just works more for the animation, it sounds stupid, but it's just not as believable without the cartoon and their personalities being in the mix. i wouldn't really recommend 102 dalmations, it's alright, but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time, this is just the same thing.<br /><br />2/10
