this is the first time i ever saw a movie with jamie foxx, and i bet it will be my last. i failed to see why he was funny, although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera, or for saying "i am going to take a shower".<br /><br />the plot is completely predictable. the bad guy comes after the good guy. the good guy has a woman, so the bad guy uses her. in between, the officials screwing up. the final scenes are utterly unbelievable. you spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy, but you don't do your home work to solve a trivial riddle?<br /><br />there's no great acting, there isn't much of a plot or storyline, and the shooting is done mtv style. don't waste your money on this one.<br /><br />
