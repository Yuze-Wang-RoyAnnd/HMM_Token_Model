now, i'm no film critic, but i truly hated "september 11". this film was, on a general basis, bad. with the exception of alejandro gonz'alez i~n'arritu's segment, which was the most effective and direct about the subject matter, the short films were at best boring, and at worst offensive. the worst in my mind was youssef chahine's pretentious segment in which he compared palestinian suicide bombers to american soldiers, even going so far as to suggest the suicide bombers were fighting for a greater cause. the segment was completely off topic and, considering chahine's seeming lack of any decency whatsoever, a waste of my time and patience. the idea of getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a movie featuring their views on a tragedy was good on paper, but in practice, it was tasteless.
