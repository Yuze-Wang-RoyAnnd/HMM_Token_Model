shocking!<br /><br />in 1965 i saw jury gagarin alive. he was sincere, unpretentious and kindly, he was at ease and looked like well-educated and intellectual person. in this movie i saw a clown! the actor looks like dummy with affected gestures and mimicry. they made a cartoon! the real gagarin was someone else! don't believe in this movie!<br /><br />i saw this movie after the movies like "taming of fire" and "apollo 13" and after reading books "rockets and people" by chertok and "korolev: myths and facts" by golovanov. i was shocked by tiresome scenario, poor acting and producing, and a lots of inexactitudes of "space race".<br /><br />the movie is the tedious rendering of well-known in russia historical facts. a lots of interesting known facts of the space projects was not demonstrated. some facts and details were perverted. for example, in 1945 korolev was already not a prisoner (liberated in 1944), and in 1940 he was already not in kolyma prison gold mine, but in special prison design bureau. korolev was the designer in prison design bureau and he was not buried the dead prisoners. but in the movie korolev worked as grave digger after 1940 (because jailer have shoulder straps on uniform). imho, the authors of movie have no profound knowledge about this part of the history and they can't to make interesting movies.
