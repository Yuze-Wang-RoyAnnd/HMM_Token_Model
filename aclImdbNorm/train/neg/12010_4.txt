the acronymic "f.p.1" stands for "floating platform #1". the film portends the building of an "f.p.1" in the middle of the atlantic ocean, to be used as an "air station" for transatlantic plane flights. based a contemporary curt siodmark novel; it was filmed in german as "f.p.1 antwortet nicht" (1932), in french as "i.f.1 ne r'epond plus" (1933), and in english as "f.p.1" (1933). soon, technology made non-stop oceanic travel much more preferable.<br /><br />stars conrad veidt (as ellissen), jill esmond (as droste), and leslie fenton (as claire) find love and sabotage on and off the atlantic platform. karl hartl directed. mr. veidt is most fun to watch; but, he is not convincing in the "love triangle" with ms. esmond and mr. fenton. the younger co-stars were the spouses of laurence olivier and ann dvorak, respectively. both the concept and film have not aged well. <br /><br />**** f.p.1 (4/3/33) karl hartl ~ conrad veidt, jill esmond, leslie fenton
