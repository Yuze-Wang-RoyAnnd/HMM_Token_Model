just a warning... this is the worst movie i have seen in years... i couldn't watch it to the end... it is a pure waste of time... i really feel sorry for snipes that he ended up in such a movie. there really is not much to say about it. horrible acting, incredibly bad lines, story, everything. the only reason i would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie shouldn't be. just to tell you one scene: the police are searching for snipes, and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars, they are shooting around inside the building, but still they are whispering so that snipes doesn't suspect a thing.
