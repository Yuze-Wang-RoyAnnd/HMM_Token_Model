i question its importance to queer cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violence.<br /><br />three tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner. i found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes, that alone didn't sit well with me. weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first 10 times.<br /><br />there was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film. more like a 45 minute boy's brief short rather than a fleshed out full-length film. it had a certain erotic flair, male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its parts.<br /><br />the 1st part: boxer/stalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin. bob has been following tim for four years and only now is he confronting him? i felt as though their cat-mouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion. we needed more information about them and less parking lot/locker scenes with tim relentlessly saying "what do you want?" <br /><br />the 2nd part: danny wants his buddy, tony, to beat him up while he jacks-off. tony doesn't seem to mind, but he doesn't even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby -- not even after they do it in the nude. this tale lacks the all-important transition from "i'm a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun" to "i think i might be gay and hitting him because i'd like to spread his ass and do him s/m style." a very important thing to leave out.<br /><br />clearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time. the 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought. furthermore, it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film. yes, the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy. the make-up (bruises and cuts) however was on par with a grammar school talent show.<br /><br />there wasn't enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic. the film made no statement, squandered time, and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment. its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach, that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously.
