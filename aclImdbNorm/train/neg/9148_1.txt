i was looking on imdbs bottom 100 because i thought id never seen anything as bad as plan 9 from outerspace or roller ball remake, i was wrong. ben and arthur has beaten both.<br /><br />this out of the many countless amount of movies i've seen is the number one worst film on the i ever saw. bad directing ,bad characters ,horrible acting ,horrible story there's a reason nobody but sam ever says anything positive about this film. sam was a horrible annoying actor but his directing was so bad he may just overthrow ed wood.<br /><br />the director should be ashamed of his work unfortunately i have to give it at least 1 star but it deserves - to be continued stars.
