this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen in the cinema!! could not wait for it to end. to make matters worse it is given a 12a certificate so you do not see anyone getting shot, just bodies slumping to the ground, even babban getting killed was cut out!!! too many scenes were cut to bring in the younger viewers as i think the makers knew it would flop disastrously!! amitabhs acting was great but that 'basanti' wannabe and the other idiot who plays devgans mate can't even act. devgan was wasted!!<br /><br />i would not watch this for free again and i advise all others who read this to do just the same you have been warned!!
