the only reason i even gave it a 1 out of 10 is because the option to give it zero out of 10 was not allowed. this was the biggest waste of time i've ever endured. for roughly 75 minutes, you are subjected to the worst acting (and i don't mean that in a good way either, like as in killer nerd which had great horrible acting) and a plot that is not only ridiculous but also has absolutely nothing to do with a massacre. the reason i even rented this piece of crap was because it has massacre in the title. that said, there was only one killing in the entire movie and it was pretty lame at that. you spend more time watching the kids bickering and doing yard work than anything. speaking of the kids, the little boy actor is probably the most irritating child actor since bob from house by the cemetery. did i mention it was shot on video as well? if you want to throw away money and over an hour of your life, then by all means watch it. but if you savor your hard earned dollars and time, then stray as far away as possible.
