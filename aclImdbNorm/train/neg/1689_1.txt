wow, what a total let down! the fact people think this film is scary is ridiculous. the special effects were a direct rip-off of "the ring." the story? was there one? not in my opinion..just a bunch of flashy imaging. the entire film was a boring, stupid, mess. i guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns. however, this is the worst horror film i have seen in years. and that buffy chick? well, she's a bad actress! as plastic as barbie and just as talented..no, wait, that would be an insult to the talents of barbie! i suppose many kiddies helped this film at the box office as it was pg-13, and had it been rated r, it would have bombed imo! stupid movie!
