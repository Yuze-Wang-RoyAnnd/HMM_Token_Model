as a huge fan or the cracker series, i have been waiting 7 years for the next addition. this episode i'm afraid just does not live up to the legend.<br /><br />fitz returns to manchester after 7 years for his daughters wedding and gets involved in a murder investigation were a soldier, tormented by flash backs from his tour of duty in northern irland, goes on a killing spree.<br /><br />what i did not like about this episode is the extremely convenient way it is all set up and how fitz is led to the murderer. it is all fat to far-fetched.<br /><br />there are however some good scenes in flash backs from northern irland which are filmed great.
