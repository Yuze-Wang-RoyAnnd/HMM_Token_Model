stupid! stupid! stupid! i can not stand ben stiller anymore. how this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me. i can't understand how this happens if i performed at work the way he acts in a movie i'd get fired and i own the company.....i would have to fire myself. god! this movie was just a plain, steaming, stinking pile of poo, that needs to be vapoorized if that were possible. something else i have to say the guideline about 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic. what is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie? i will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary.
