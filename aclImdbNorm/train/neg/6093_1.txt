this has to be the worst film i have ever seen. i bought the dvd and it didn't work, well the dvd worked fine, its just the film didn't, in fact its so bad that i think non of the actors have worked since (or before judging from the acting). there is no real plot to speak of and no real horror. the production values are rubbish even for a low budget film with some outside scenes being hard to hear due to wind on the microphone.<br /><br />all in all it was so bad a film that a viewer could think it was going to turn into a porno if they didn't know any better (which have been an improvement). there are only two lines in the film that are funny, both of which revolve around the transvestite prostitute. (although they hardly merit watching all 76 minutes for)<br /><br />as for the marketing of the dvd i feel thoroughly cheated. i mean reading the back i expected it to be bad:<br /><br />he chose his weapons. he selected his victims. he picked his nose. he turned into a girl!<br /><br />but i thought it might be funny. also the case claims it is digitally re mastered, i would love to have seen it beforehand, the print is so grainy you could use it as sand paper. the case also says it is an absolute disgusting movie, in what way?, disgusting production, acting.<br /><br />this film out stays it welcome in the first five minutes, (if you are considering buying this i would say buy `bad taste' instead it is a much better film and is funny, also it has peter jackson the director of the lotr in it.)<br /><br />incidentally if anyone knows anything about any of the actors (or director patrick j mathews) and what they have done since, please post here as i would love to know, purely to find out if there is a worse movie out there, or if anyone in this film ever bothered to learn to act
