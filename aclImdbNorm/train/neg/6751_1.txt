my boyfriend and i rented this because we thought it might be a good 'halloween' take-off. a killer terrorizing young people, a white mask...you get my drift. we were dead wrong! no pun intended. we not only discovered one of the worst movies out there, but also that it is a cult classic! it is filled w/plot holes and makes no sense. the actress who plays maddy is pretty, but that's about it. i do give credit for it being shot on a very low budget--i always support movies like that. just not this particular one.<br /><br />this movie may be good to see if you're drunk or high; otherwise don't bother. unless you want to lose your movie privileges like i did!
