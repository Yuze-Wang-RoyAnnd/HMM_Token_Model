i noticed that this film has taken the brunt of a lot of insults. it probably earned some of them, but it wasn't that bad. well, i'll be honest: i never want to see this film again. it was a bad film. but i don't hate this film, it tried to tell a story. as a drama, this film could work very well actually. i just think the filmmakers misgauged which road to take when they made this (they should have added more funny bits if they wanted it to be a comedy). with a rewrite, it could have been a great film. but as a satire, it didn't work in its current form -- many scenes did not fit within the context of the plot: for example, the robbery scene makes little sense in the story. still, it wasn't the worst independent film ever made -- is it in the top 10 worst? that's debatable.
