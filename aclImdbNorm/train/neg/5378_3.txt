i watched this film not really expecting much, i got it in a pack of 5 films, all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect? and you know what i was right, they were all terrible, this movie has a few (and a few is stretching it) interesting points, the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, i.e damned annoying and, well thats about it actually, the problem is that its just so boring, in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension, a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious (i had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready to press for most of the movie, but gave it a go) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking, coz they don't half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot, i thought he looked a bit like a meercat, all this and i haven't even mentioned the killer, i'm not even gonna go into it, its just not worth explaining. anyway as far as i'm concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london (who was actually quite funny) it wasn't because of their acting talent, i've certainly seen a lot worse, but i've also seen a lot better. best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry.
