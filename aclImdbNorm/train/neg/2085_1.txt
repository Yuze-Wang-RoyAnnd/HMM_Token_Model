this is one of the worst movies i have seen recently. when a man says that he wishes he had a super power of being able to orally pleasure himself i pretty much consider the movie to be in the realm of childish 14 year old male fantasies. the bed room scene was over the top and reduced an intimate moment into a farce of biological functions akin to passing gas in public. from the first every other scene was a discussion about how little sex they where getting, how long its been since they got some, when their next sexual liaison will be, and with whom it should be with. on top of that the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced, not felt, and they filled their lack of content with sleazy sex scenes. this could have been really funny because the concept is actually interesting but it is poorly executed here. please, do not even think about taking anyone under 16 if you have to go and see it.
