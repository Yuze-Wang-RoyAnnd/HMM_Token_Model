my husband is a huge robin williams fan. i like him too, but have generally found that he should "stick to what he does best" and focus on comedic roles. my thoughts were confirmed with this movie. i was completely bored throughout the entire film. the story was predictable. i realize it was inspired by a true story. but, my guess is that there could have been some suspense or intrigue even while maintaining truth in the story. none of the characters were well developed. there was a side story about the main character and his partner. this relationship could have been explored further. more important, though, would have been a deeper exploration of the mother of the "boy". her psychological profile would have been interesting to delve into. she obviously has a long history that was not touched upon except in the most superficial way. if my husband wasn't such a huge williams fan, we would have left 20 minutes into it. too bad i can't get my $20 or 2 hours back.
