"the bank" (1915, chaplin) "the bank" was one of charlie's 1915 essanay films. while these group of films are more watchable than their 1914 counterparts, this one seems a bit below average. the gag with the janitorial double combo-locked vault and the tough-luck ending that has charlie waking up from a dream, in which he is stroking the lead lady's hair, only to be stroking the head of a mop he had used as a quasi pillow, are both classic chaplin moments. they are both ironically the beginning and the end. the middle is filled in with fighting with the rival co-worker janitor and busting up a bank robbery to win the girl. the mop is probably the greatest physical prop of this movie and charlie uses it to expert comedic effect whether while it is the intention of his character or not. the mop seems to be charlie's alter-ego doing things he wishes he could do but wouldn't with his own two hands. interesting stuff but there's better.
