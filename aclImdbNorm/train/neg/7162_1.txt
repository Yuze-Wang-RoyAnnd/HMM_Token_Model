this film takes what could have been a good idea, a mummified 2000 year old witch and completely destroys it. nora and jim are alcoholics who go to ireland to dry-out. they go to stay with her nan and uncle. the uncle has discovered a 2000 year old witch preserved in the peat. he revives her and she takes the form of nora. she cannot be killed conventionally,(more is the pity). nora, however, works out a way to do so.<br /><br />this is a gothic horror movie that has been done on the cheap. it is a sprawling mess. i have to ask why anyone would want to make such a bad film. i am tempted to learn witchcraft in order to make it disappear.<br /><br />avoid at all costs
