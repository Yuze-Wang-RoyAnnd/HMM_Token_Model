when i was kid back in the 1970s a local theatre had children's matinees every saturday and sunday afternoon (anybody remember those?). they showed this thing one year around christmas time. me and some friends went to see it. i expected a cool santa claus movie. what i got was a terribly dubbed (you can tell) and truly creepy movie.<br /><br />something about santa claus and merlin the magician (don't ask me what those two are doing in the same movie) fighting satan (some joker in a silly devil costume complete with horns!). the images had me cringing in my seat. i always found santa spooky to begin with so that didn't help. the guy in the satan suit didn't help. but what really horrified me were the wooden rein deers that pulled santa's sled. when he wound them up and the creepy sound they made and the movements--i remember having nightmares about those things! all these years later i still remember walking out of that theatre more than a little disturbed by what i saw. my friends were sort of frightened by it too. i just saw an ad for it on tv and all those nightmares came roaring back. this is a creepy, disturbing little christmas film that will probably scare the pants off any little kid who sees it. avoid this one--unless you really want to punish your kids. this gets a 1.
