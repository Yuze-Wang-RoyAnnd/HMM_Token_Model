i fail to see the appeal of this series (which is supposed to be sci-fi). it's really just "let's see what soap operatically happens this week" and oh, the cylons are involved through flashbacks.<br /><br />the cylon "babe" that keeps nailing the other guy is pretty lame, it's pretty obvious that t&a was added to the show. every time she pops up i'm bewildered as to wtf is supposed to be going on. and don't even try to bullsh*t me about "story arcs".<br /><br />it's a soap opera with some cgi thrown-in. this is not science fiction aside from the original premise.<br /><br />this series is not everything it's worked-up to be. if you like trendy, edgy, dodgy, jumpy, vague editor-on-crack camera work, this show might be for you. since nerds seem to be raving about this show, it's a clear indication that vocal nerds' opinions have been changed from picard's tng.
