...in an otherwise ghastly, misbegotten, would-be oedipal comedy.<br /><br />i was the lone victim at a 7:20 screening tonight (3 days after the movie opened) , so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warnings.<br /><br />the bloom is off jon heder's rose. the emerging double chin isn't his fault; but rehashing his geeky kid shtick in another bad wig simply isn't working. it would be another crime if this were to be eli wallach's last screen appearance. diane keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck - basically because so few will have seen her in this, the very worst vehicle she's chosen in the last few weeks.<br /><br />sitting alone in the theater tonight i came alive (laughed, even) whenever daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the film's sole three dimensional character. he really is among our very best actors.<br /><br />in summary, even jeff daniels's work can't redeem this picture.
