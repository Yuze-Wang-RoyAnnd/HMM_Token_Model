you'll notice that the chemist, who appears in two scenes and gets to speak, is played by stephen king. "don't give up your day job" is the standard thing to say, but that's not fair. king acquits himself reasonably well: he's no worse than any other member of the cast, and better than most. the story, on the other hand, is pure rubbish. please, give up your day job.<br /><br />never have i seen so many dreadful performances - of which the lead actor's (the lead actor's!) is probably the worst - gathered together in the one film. everyone acts hammily, but not in any entertaining way; they all somehow manage to go over-the-top without expending, or manifesting, energy. i blame screenwriter/director tom holland. it can't be that all the actors are really this bad. what are the odds against that? admittedly, i've never heard of any of them before, but still, i don't think i could walk into a talent agency and walk out with this many bad performers if i tried: one actor, despite my best efforts, would turn out to have talent. so what's more likely - that tom holland rolled a dozen consecutive snake-eyes, or that he wrote a lousy script and then directed it poorly? that would also explain why actors are bad in direct proportion to their prominence in the script. the more direction an actor got, the worse he performed. ("you want me to bend over like a hunchback, talk from the back of my throat, show all my teeth, and look bored, all at the same time? okay...")<br /><br />this theory is confirmed by the fact that holland undeniably managed to co-write a lousy script. several writers here have commented on the fact that billy halleck is not a likeable character, but that's a misleading way of putting it. he's not a knowable character. all we find out about him before the supernatural stuff starts happening is that he's fat, and that all he can think about is food. ("all i can think about is food," he tells us, helpfully.) and in the end...<br /><br />(sigh) i suppose i ought insert a spoiler warning here...<br /><br />in the end he becomes evil. why? i can only shrug. perhaps he's under some kind of enchantment. yeah, that's probably it. by "evil" perhaps i mean "inexplicable" - it's not so much badness as a socially undesirable suspension of ordinary means-end psychology. anyway, his actions at the end make no sense, nobody's actions make much sense, and this is despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation for the benefit of the audience.<br /><br />by the way, here's my nominee for hammiest line/delivery: "i don't think you'd like it. in fact..." [big dramatic pause] "...i don't think you'd like it at all."
