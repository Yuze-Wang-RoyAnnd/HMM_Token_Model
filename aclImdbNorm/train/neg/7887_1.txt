...then they will have a proper place to file this crap. sorry, not a "mystery" as claimed, it is religious mumbo-jumbo. i kept waiting for the "unimaginable evil" that was promised me, but the "evil" in this flick would only be unimaginable by a five year old with learning disabilities.<br /><br />i can't believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this embarrassment. unfortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them, and i will likely avoid anything they do in the future. i'm also a little cheesed off that i now have a writer's name and director's name to memorize as i'll be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on too.<br /><br />it's really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. will get their reviews posted first. this could lead to more people getting tricked, as i was, into believing this movie was something other than religious preaching.<br /><br />well, it's off to the video store to get my money back for false advertising. too bad they can't give me back the 105 minutes i wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a hollywood horror/supernatural film.
