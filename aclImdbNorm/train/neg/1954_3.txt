first, let's get it out of the way. . . yeah, this film steals a lot from 'darkness falls' (2003). the plot for 'darkness falls' goes something like this: the tooth fairy, a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her out of revenge. in 'the tooth fairy' (2006), the disfigured tooth fairy (who, yeah, hides her face) unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone. a little too similar to be coincidence.<br /><br />but, what must be asked is this: if you're going to directly steal the exact plot from a movie, why choose something as mediocre as 'darkness falls'? sure it made a few bucks at the box office, but that was strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered. a low-budget, straight-to-video movie will not have that same effect. and it didn't.<br /><br />as i watched the opening 15-20 minutes of the film, my expectations actually rose. there seemed to be at least some production value. the story didn't seem terrible, just blatantly ripped off. past the first scene, we get an okay cast of characters including an ex-doctor with secrets (played by that guy who looks like a busey) and some hot veterinary student (jenifer from argento's 'masters of horror: jenifer'). after those few minutes, however, the film just slowly goes down the drain. it serves all the basic horrible clich'es including, but not limited to: some crazy old person with an unheeded warning, the buff dumb jock, the psychic, and the stripper with the heart-of-gold.<br /><br />one of the biggest problems this film had was its inability to stick with a target audience. it's kind of like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on screen at the time. when the adults were on screen, it had a more mature feel. when star (the stripper) and whatshisface (the jock) were on screen, the dialogue went down to a more stupid, err immature, level. when the kid was on screen, it felt like an episode of 'are you afraid of the dark?'. . . only less scary.<br /><br />technically, the film is all over the place. the visuals range from fairly good to plain boring. the writing is subpar, as is the acting for the most part. on the plus side, there's some excessive gore at parts (including a fairly cool (yet painfully predictable)) woodchipper scene and a pretty vicious nailgun scene. also, if you're looking for a bit of the sexy stuff, there's a brief topless scene (but if you want to see this chick topless, there are better films to do that). other than that, there's not much to bother with when it comes to this film.<br /><br />if you're a huge fan of 'darkness falls' (do those exist?), maybe you can check it out to see the story done in a different way. . . but, that's about the only reason i can find to see this one.<br /><br />final verdict: 3/10 -ap3-
