this is a typical 70's soft core sex romp in the russ meyer genre, though perhaps less outlandish than some of meyer's work. this film has higher 'production values' than many of it's contemporaries, suggesting a larger budget. it's plot, writing and acting are straight out the b zone, though. of late, this film has become a mainstay of b movie channels (such as "drive in classics") in the 500 channel universe. if soft core is what you are in the mood for, this is as "good" as anything else in the b range. don't expect polanski though, sarno is just sarno. nothing more, nothing less. jennifer welles performance as the "mother" is perhaps the best of the cast. none of the actors in the film went on to greater fame, unsurprisingly. confessions of a young american housewife is far from the worst example of it's kind. it is watchable, if this is your type of film. 30 years ago, this would have been an avant garde and riske film. you can see more or less the same kind of thing on showtime/hbo series these days, and in prime time.
