you know what you are getting when you purchase a hallmark card. a sappy, trite verse and that will be $3.99, thank you very much. you get the same with a hallmark movie. here we get a ninety year old ernie borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact, he is not dead like we thought. poor ernie, he is the poor soul that married ethel merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. in this flick, ernie jumps in feet first and portrays the grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid. we have seen it before. you might enjoy this movie but please don't say that you were not warned.
