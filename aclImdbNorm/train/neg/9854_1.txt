this documentary (or i should say mockumentary) is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be, when they have full enthusiasm on something like that. honestly, i hate cryptozoology. it is unscience, it just destroy it. however, something positive in this was the visual effects (dragons were beautiful), but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake, and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists, so that is the reason why it deserves a 1 of 10 and not a 0. an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea: it is true that, according to chemystry, the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions, so in that case, you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach. there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly, and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing, so it is impossible. anyway, there is actually something worse, the idea of the platinum: this element is more difficult to find than gold, and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that. it is ridiculous, they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth, but off course at least that explain why they got extincted. probably cryptologist's call themselves scientists, but they are not. people like them say lies like in this mockumentary, and what is worst, some people buy them. but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this. those fake scientists waste their time.
