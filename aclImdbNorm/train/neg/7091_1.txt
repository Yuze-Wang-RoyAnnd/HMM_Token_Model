this film was so amateurish i could hardly believe what i was seeing. it is shot on video! not film! i have not seen the likes of this since the early 70's, when late night networks showed movie of the week 'horror flicks' shot in......video. it looks like a bad soap opera, and that is paying it a compliment. some of the actors give it their best shot. michael des barres does okay with what he is given to do, which is to act like a sex addict out of control. i can't say that it is pleasant to watch.<br /><br />nastassja kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film, with very little variation in camera angles. i can't fault her for someone else's poor blocking, but she is totally unbelievable in her role. her little girl voice works against her here. and i consider myself a nastassja kinski fan. she is certainly ageless and exotic, but she's outside her range with this.<br /><br />alexandra paul is pathetically overwrought. every line she delivers is with three exclamation points. someone must have directed her to scream at all costs. why would michael des barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew?<br /><br />finally, rosanna arquette as the sweet, maligned wife comes off okay, and probably the most believable of the bunch. but that is not saying much.<br /><br />this has to be the worst film i have seen in years.
