one star for the "plot". one star for the acting. one star for the dubbing into squeaky-voiced american. five stars for monica broeke and inge maria granzow, with their propensity for taking all their clothes off. and ten out of ten for the divine emmanuelle b'eart, two years before she made 'manon des sources'. b'eart also undresses a couple of times, but even fully-clothed her presence is enough to make this film eminently watchable. watch out for the scene where she tells her friend about the three "first times" for a girl. it's corny, but still far more erotic than the rather laughably choreographed "love scenes" featuring broeke, granzow and patrick bauchau. incidentally, the cinematography is not great; the stills for the closing credits are a better indication of what david hamilton is capable of.
