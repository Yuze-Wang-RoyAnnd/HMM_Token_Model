this could well be the worst film i've ever seen. despite what mikshelt claims, this movie isn't even close to being historically accurate. it starts badly and then it's all downhill from there. we have hitler's father cursing his own bad luck on the "fact" that he'd married his niece! they were in fact, second cousins. hitler's mother, klara, called his father, alois, "uncle" because alois had been adopted and raised by klara's grandfather and brought up as his son, when he was really his nephew. alois was much older than klara and so as a child she'd got into the habit of calling alois, "uncle."<br /><br />the scene in the trenches where hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers. we see hitler chase the dog through the trench, when he catches up with the poor thing he proceeds to thrash it for disobeying him. in the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and chastise the cowardly little man, but then a shell lands directly on his persecutors, and every last one, we are told, is killed outright. how then, if hitler was the only person to survive the scene, did this tale of brutality and cowardice come to be told? did hitler himself go around "boasting" about it? - i don't think so.<br /><br />next up, hitler bullies and intimidates a poor, stressed out and war weary jewish officer into giving him an iron cross! i can only assume that this jewish officer had been a pawnbroker before fighting for the fatherland, and had thoughtfully brought along some pledged medals from his shop, because i'm certain that iron crosses were not being handed out as shown in this comic farce.<br /><br />all the grotesque clich'es are here, not least the calming and hypnotic effect of wagner's music upon the little man. if only the producers had kept ian kershaw on side. then they might have discovered that franz lehar's "merry widow" was more likely to float the fuhrer's boat than any "flying dutchman" from the cannon of richard wagner!<br /><br />hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people but how can he ever be forgiven for his appalling taste in music?<br /><br />i could go on but i'd be at it for hours.<br /><br />give it a miss.
