i have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life. this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i don't know how i sat through an hour of it. i must have been in a coma that night. i saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago. i couldn't even remember the name, but i knew that penelope ann miller starred in it. it must have really affected me to be wasting my time commenting on it today. yech! vomit! barf!
