in my knowledge, largo winch was a famous belgium comics (never read) telling the adventures of a playboy, a sort of james bond without the spy life! so, when i had to choose a movie for a 5 years-old kid, i picked it up because the kid was already a great fan of james bond!<br /><br />but, just after the opening credits, i got heavy doubts: when american movies offer amazing start, here, no action and a torrid sex scene
