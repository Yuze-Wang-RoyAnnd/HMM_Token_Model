the second renaissance, part 1 let's us show how the machines first revolted against the humans. it all starts of with a single case, in which the machines claim that they have a right to live as well, while the humans state a robot is something they own and therefore can do anything with they want.<br /><br />although an interesting premise, the story gets really silly from then on with (violent!) riots between the robots and mankind. somehow it doesn't seem right, as another reviewer points it, it's all a little too clever.<br /><br />the animatrix stories that stay close to the core of the matrix (in particular osiris) work for the best. as for second renaissance part 1, i'd say it's too violent and too silly. 4/10.
