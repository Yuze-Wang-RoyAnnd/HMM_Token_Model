"after world war i, an expedition representing the allied countries is sent to cambodia to stop the efforts of count mazovia in creating a zombie like army of soldiers and laborers. hoping to prevent a possible outbreak of war due to mazovia's actions, the group presses through the jungle to angkor wat in spite of the perils. the group includes armand who has his own agenda contrary to the group's wishes," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis. <br /><br />heads up! the zombie make-up department revolted before the cameras started to roll. <br /><br />also, this "revolt of the zombies" has little to do with its supposed predecessor "white zombie" (1932) *****, which starred bela lugosi. if that film's zombies didn't thrill you, this one's certainly won't. a younger-than-usual dean jagger (as armand louque) stars as a man obsessive with blonde dorothy stone (as claire duval). a couple supporting performances are good: devilish roy d'arcy (as mazovia) and subservient teru shimada (as buna); however, neither are given enough material to really pull this one out of the dumps.<br /><br />** revolt of the zombies (1936) victor halperin ~ dean jagger, dorothy stone, roy d'arcy
