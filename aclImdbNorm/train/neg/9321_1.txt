i rented this movie roughly 4-5 years ago and was instantly disappointed.<br /><br />i wanted to see a b-movie slasher flick, but ended up with a fecal matter for my eyes. the acting was similar to watching grass dry. i've seen better acting in a softcore film...<br /><br />the idea that a crazy killer comes out of nowhere baffled me. how was this a horror movie?<br /><br />this movie's production value, was laughable at best. there were no scares. it seemed like a high school student got a new video camera for christmas. the plot was all over the place, if existent. if you are bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent, skip this one. there are much better b-movies out there.
