overall this movie is dreadful, and should have never been made. one of the problems with this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters, for example, if she is about to be attacked, you want to feel, "oh my god, no!", but you don't in this case, you don't care because there is no link that has been made to know the character. in the trailer, it seemed as though the movie would be great, yet there is no suspense what so ever really. there could have been maybe some mystery but there is not. "all she has is a toolbox." was said on the dvd's back, you would think that it was carefully planned this movie, and cleverly made, but it is not, the ending, was just awful, very straight forward, and pointless too. the acting is either average or below average, maybe even lower. in my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life. the "special effects" and sets were average too, nothing special what so ever. there is not much gore, or bloody violence, not much blood is shown. this movie was advertised to make it sound quite amazing, yet really, its not even worth looking for, i do not recommend this to anyone, unless they are easily satisfied, by a few fights and a boring story.
