for those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to twitch in the original movie, heres your chance, and then get back to the real world.<br /><br />the guy who hid the gold in the first movie told twitch, so he gets transferred to another prison, where wrestling champs hang around looking broody. twitch plans to leave the jail in a month to get the gold to start a life with his woman.<br /><br />then something happens and someone gets shot, and the film turns into die hard in another prison. but the wrestler's daughter is caught up in it all, so he and twitch go to find her and twitch's woman.<br /><br />as you can imagine, the acting is below par, it features a lot of (really annoying) rap music, and poorly edited fight scenes. on the plus side, it's got that hispanic bloke in it, who stars in every prison/action/thriller ever made, and he shuts a door in this.<br /><br />it's not very eventful, but at least it's harmless.<br /><br />if you were a massive fan of the original, it's okay-ish stuff.<br /><br />if not, you have been warned.
