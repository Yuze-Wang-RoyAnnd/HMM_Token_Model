...was so that i could, in good conscience, tell everyone how horrible this movie is. i barely made it through twenty minutes before i started thinking to myself,"wow, this is pretty bad.". and, to be honest, i would've given this movie 1 star if it wasn't for esai morales (though he had very little screen time). he's the movie's only well-acted role, which is a shame because i really like gil bellows...or at least i thought i did.<br /><br />while watching this i started thinking back to his part in "shawshank redemption" and realized it wasn't as good as i thought it was. problem: his jail-house/tough guy act seems like it's just that, an act; his dialogue sounded like he was doing a very poor impression. has he ever met someone who speaks like his character was supposed to? i doubt it, but maybe he should have.<br /><br />and, to make matters worse, they've managed to inject a little jail-house philosophy and make it seem nothing short of contrived, especially when you consider that the rhetoric was being spouted by a "rasta" who's accent was so strong that it seemed unnatural.<br /><br />i wouldn't normally slam a movie like this, but when i saw the movie it had a fairly favorable review. i felt like i was cheated and lied to, and i thought i should try to save someone the misery of having to watch this movie.<br /><br />i say boooooooo.
