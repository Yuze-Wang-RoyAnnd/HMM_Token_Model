this was the worst film i have seen for a long time. <br /><br />not only that it has nearly nothing to do with the other american pie movies, the story is obvious, flat and absolutely not funny. <br /><br />the girls are nice though, but spending your time watching a cheap soft porno would possibly be greater than watching this film.<br /><br />this film seems to be a very bad made sex ad, made for an audience that is not older than 12.<br /><br />i never visited an american college, but i would seriously doubt that anyone who did could really laugh about any of the scenes.<br /><br />save your time, do something else.
