i like animated shows. i enjoy the nick fare pretty much, including hey, arnold. but moving a tv show to the big screen isn't easy and this just didn't feel big enough. it was more like a long episode of the show, and it just didn't move along that well. judging by the behavior of the kids we had with us, it didn't score that well with them either.
