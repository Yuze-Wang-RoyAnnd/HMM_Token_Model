i couldn't agree more with another reviewer that mentioned jodorowsky.<br /><br />barney seems to be utterly boring and uninspired "content-wise". he can produce eye-candy (and i like candy), but its pretentiousness and fundamental artistic emptiness just diminishes all the joy. <br /><br />i am afraid that many people don't distinguish between similar (but really only on the surface) works of jodorowsky or even more linear film-makers like tarkovski or kubrick (i love 2001 odyssey and was never bored through the ending scenes...) that kind of art as m.barney's makes adds confusion and fends off the viewers that could otherwise start to appreciate experimental cinema. typical empty post-modern "conceptual" art. and check his interviews. i just don't buy it, sorry. and so boring. <br /><br />i was never bored seeing alejandro jodorowsky's movies, while drawing restraint 9 was an utter disappointment. especially while it offered the possibilities to be something, to actually tell something in a non-linear unorthodox way (like the beginning and the great choreographed dance and preparations for the ship to sail out. ships "meeting" on the sea... ideas of feces as an object of value(if it was feces). those "pearl" divers... everything could construct a great surreal movie with some content. but it didn't. and those horrible pretentious scenes of dressing up and fake tea ceremony... how vain and fake and philosophically pretentious but empty can it get?<br /><br />i has some great picturesque scenes, but the whole movie became so boring and pretentious and utterly empty and fake that it made me physically sick.<br /><br />and it doesn't have good tempo. i like slow pace movies, but this was just boring in some scenes - because it was pretentious and fake - so i was just forced to witnessed prolonged scenes of artistic vanity...<br /><br />that kind of movies just kill the art and spirit in my view. <br /><br />i want more jodorowsky!!!
