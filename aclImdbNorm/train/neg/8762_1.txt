a scientist (john carradine--sadly) finds out how to bring the dead back to life. however they come back with faces of marble. eventually this all leads to disaster.<br /><br />boring, totally predictable 1940s outing. this scared me silly when i was a kid but just bores me now. i had to struggle to stay awake! with one exception, the acting is horrible. such expressionless boring actors! hopeless.<br /><br />there are some good things about this: carradine, despite the script, actually gives a very good performance. and there are a few mildly creepy moments involving a ghost of a great dane walking through walls. there's also one of the worst-looking knockouts in cinema history. still, none of this is fun enough to sit through this. avoid.
