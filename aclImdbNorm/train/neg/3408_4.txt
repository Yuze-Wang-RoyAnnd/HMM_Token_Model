i was in second grade, 12 years ago. i remember it clearly. we were learning about space. all little kids want to go to space, right? well, after i saw this, i was so scared to death that i would 'accidentally' get flung into space by some psychotic robot with a one track mind. i had no idea that this was a movie. i thought it was some news program or something. i guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program 'war of the worlds.' so, recently, i get this movie again to watch, realizing my favorite actor, joaquin phoenix was in it (then known as leaf phoenix). i can tell you, i was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting. i mean, when andy is in space, she moves in slow motion, did you ever notice that? i don't think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow.<br /><br />the best part is when andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank, and begins to float backwards as the security doors close. little max is trying to pull her in. suddenly, we get a major close up on max's face as he shouts (in slow motion) "whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?" i had no idea.
