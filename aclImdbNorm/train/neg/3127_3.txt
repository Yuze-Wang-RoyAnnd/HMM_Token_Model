an archaeologist (casper van dien) stumbles accidentally upon an ancient, 40 foot mummy, well preserved underground in the nevada desert. they are determined to keep this a secret and call in a jewish translator to assist in figuring out the history of it. the mummy, as explained at the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants that apparently existed in "those days". in order to save his son from a devastating flood which was predicted to kill everything, he mummifies his son, burying him with several servants for centuries - planning to awaken him years from then. in our present, the fallen angels still walk the earth and the mummy is resurrected and a ritual is expected to take place. most of the movie is slow, having to do with a lot of biblical crap and a couple lousy, air-punching fights. the mummy is decent looking but isn't shown nearly enough. it should have had more to do with that but it dragged on a great deal so... eh. don't bother.
