i was really looking forward to seeing this film, but after watching it i was really disappointed. the best bit was when stephen king was in it. rober john berk cannot act to save his life and neither can any of the others. a few of the performances even made me laugh out loud! the film was was not as i imagined it, after reading the book which was awesome, i imagined it darker and a lot scarier. if i was stephen, i would be really mad!<br /><br />i don't know why they changed the ending, i thought the ending of the book was very good. if you just found out the pie killed your daughter, you wouldn't feed it to anyone else would you?!<br /><br />book was so much better!
