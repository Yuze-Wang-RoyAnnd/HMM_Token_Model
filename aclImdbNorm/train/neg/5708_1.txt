people like me will tear this movie apart. it's just not realistic. the plot is sooooooo predictable. you can anticipate everything that happens convientantly of course, they find the treasure and become filthy rich, and trick the bad guy. we've seen it a million times before. the writers of this movie must think that the majority of the movie going public is stupid. they must be right because the majority of people actually liked this film. i mean solving riddles in a matter of seconds. the secret treasure room hidden under the manhattan subway? you'd think with all the work that's gone on in new york underground that room would have been discovered before. and all that was constructed during the civil war? please and the love story between ben and abigail?? how cute, and i thought the romance in clive cussler novels was weak. they just fall in love like that, in 2 seconds whatever i'd be more concerned with saving my own ass then getting some. the hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper. 1/10 garbage
