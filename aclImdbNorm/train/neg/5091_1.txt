my comment is for the russian version of space race named bitva za kosmos (battle for space) shown on russia's first channel on april 10-13, 2006. bad translation could have ruined some details but i doubt it's the case. the number of factual errors is such that it's impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (the development of first missiles). even the u.s. half of the film contains multiple errors and omissions. the audience is not told of any v-2/a-4 launches from the u.s. three different jupiter c rockets are launched with the same serial number 'ue' onboard. apollo 1 is to be launched to the moon, etc. in the russian half, each and every person is ludicrous. korolev is scared of nkvd, glushko is saboteur and traitor, mishin is alcoholic etc. men as functions; no motivation, no life at all. uniform and decorations are awful. gagarin sings a frivolous song awaiting launch (i think this was added specially for russian version).
