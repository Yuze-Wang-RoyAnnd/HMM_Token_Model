this movie was so bad! it was terrible! it was awful! i cannot stress it enough! the acting, directing, story, characters and everything about it was bad! it was so corny and clich'ed. don't be fooled by the cover, or the tag line "the 'texas massacre' is nothing to laugh at." are you frogging' kidding me! it was ridiculous.<br /><br />the first 2 minutes of the film is good until it gets to the main character brendan, ok now turn it off. what i got from the film was, a bunch of ugly, annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the middle of the woods and a clown that sings nursery rhymes kills them in unoriginal and fake ways.<br /><br />this movie was a waste of my time and money, and it would be a waste of your money and time too! i fast forward through most of the movie because it was so terrible, i just wanted to see how each bad actor died, and it still wasn't worth it! just looking at the cover is a waste of time. this is seriously the worst movie ever! rating: doesn't deserve one.
