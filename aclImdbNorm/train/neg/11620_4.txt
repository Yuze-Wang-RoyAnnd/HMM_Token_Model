i gave this more than a 1 because i did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and i. the acting and the dialogue were mediocre and i must confess i came out feeling like i had been beaten over the head with the god this , god that and christ is our saviour stuff. the movie and the story line did not need it. if , as i am , you are a recovering catholic or christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous. the movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been.
