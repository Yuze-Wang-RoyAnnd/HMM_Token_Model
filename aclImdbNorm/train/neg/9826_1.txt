i guess this would be a great movie for a true believer in organized christian dogma, but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will, rational thinking, the separation of church & state and good science fiction it is a terrible joke!<br /><br />there are some well known actors who were either badly in need of work or had a need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us heathens.<br /><br />i was entertained by this movie in the same way i was entertained by "reefer madness." that movie attempted to teach drug education by scare tactics the same way this movie tries to teach "christian" principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who don't share their interpretations of our world.<br /><br />it had me howling with laughter and at the same time scared me to realize how many people actually believe that our society should revert to the good old days of the 19th century!
