...well, pop this into the dvd, waste an hour and a half of your life that you will never get back, and find out.<br /><br />acting? what acting? <br /><br />production values? ...production? ...values?<br /><br />story? don't get me started.<br /><br />after many years of posting on imdb, i never thought i would see a film so bad that i truly wished for a lower rating than one. i always have found at least a reason or two to see merit - if only in the intent or the effort of the writer, the director, the cast, or the producer?<br /><br />in this case, they're all the same guy (!) who really needs to get a handle on the fact, at least as demonstrated by this worthless waste of video tape, that he has no talent. i mean it would be a reasonable excuse if this were some junior high schooler's "production" for his first cinema class, but the referenced "artist" behind this dreck was twenty-six at the time of this miscarriage. <br /><br />just how did this ever get made? who in their right mind ever wrote a check for this? moreover, don't let the box cover fool you: there's not even anything that remotely resembles a good sex scene or any good "exposure" of the hunk on that cover.<br /><br />two final items: there was one second when this "film" had redeeming value: the aforementioned "talent" gets roundly punched out by his lover. i cheered! and, i did learn one thing from this "film.". there are times when something is so very bad that it is, indeed, truly very funny. but not in any comical manner; it's just sadly humorous. very sadly humorous.
