although the actors do a convincing job playing the losers that parade across the screen, the fact that these characters are impossible to identify with had me looking at my watch a mere 20 minutes into the film (and more than once after that). the plot development is disjointed and slow, the verbal diarrhoea of the main character's only friend is practically insufferable, the base quality of most of the characters actions and the cavalier way in which they are treating is annoying.<br /><br />it is typical of ventura pons to put forth crass psychologically handicapped characters. however, this faux sociological analysis is a big step down from caricias or caresses, where the characters maltreat and despise each other for well founded reasons that play out during that film. in amor idiota we are forced to follow the meanderings of a truly subnormal intelligence as he stalks a severely depressed and detached woman. supposedly this is due to his own depression but the script doesn't support that. i won't give away the rest of the story just in case there are any masochists out there
