they're showing this on some off-network. it's well crap. while it is not as bad as the b-movies they show on the sci-fi network on saturdays but still a fairly large pile of crap. the acting is passable. the plot and writing are fairly sub-standard and the pacing is entirely too slow. every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where they're wrapping things up before the credits - not the peak of the movie, the denouement. also, large portions of the cast look way to old for the age range they're playing. the whole thing is predictable, boring and not worthy of being watched. save your time. it's not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free.
