dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and murder and mayhem result. violent sexy milligan at his most home made. little better than a home movie (as much of milligans films are) this is a trip into depravity 1960's style. notable for the copious nudity and sex this film is neither sexy nor gruesome, playing now more as quaint.(though decidedly r rated). the film suffers from its uneven cast and from the cheapness of the production.(no one was ever sure where the money went on his movies since he was always broke). its a bad bad movie thats not worth seeing except as a milligan completeist or because its got some good looking people fooling around.
