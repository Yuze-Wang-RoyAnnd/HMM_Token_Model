i think they really let the quality of the dvd production get away from them. i rented this dvd from 2 movie stores and the second time i finally got it to play on the 3rd dvd player i tried.<br /><br />anyone else have this issue? it's really hard to give the film an un-biased review after going through such a hassle to play it. for one, i've never seen a finnish horror film before so i was sort of bummed that the movie was done in english. also since it's never made clear what is wrong with sarah, she just came off as retarded and therefore i really just hoped someone would shoot her in the face and make all the horrific happenings go away.
