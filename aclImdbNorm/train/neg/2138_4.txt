war, inc. - corporations take over war in the future and use a lone assassin brand hauser (john cusack) to do their wet-work against rival ceos. a dark comedy satirizing the military and corporations alike. it was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on. i kept waiting for things to make sense. there's no reason or method to the madness.<br /><br />it's considered by cusack to be the "spiritual successor" to grosse point blank. i.e., war is more or less a knock-off. we again see cusack as an assassin protecting *spoiler* the person he's supposed to kill as he grips with his conscience. to be fair, john cusack looks kind of credible taking out half a dozen guys with relative ease. the brief fights look good. the rest of the film does not. it's all quirky often bordering on bizarre. war inc's not funny enough to be a parody, and too buoyant for anyone to even think about whatever the film's message might be, which i suppose might be the heartless ways that corporations, like war factions compete and scheme without a drop of consideration given to how they affect average citizens. interesting, but the satire just doesn't work because it's not funny and at its heart the film has no heart. we're supposed to give a damn about how war affects cusack's shell of a character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by war.<br /><br />john cusack gives a decent performance. his character chugs shots of hot sauce and drives the tiniest private plane but quirks are meant to replace character traits. marisa tomei is slumming as the romantic sidekick journalist. there really isn't a lot of chemistry between them. hilary duff tries a russian accent and doesn't make a fool of herself. joan cusack just screams and whines and wigs out. blech. ben kingsley might have to return the oscar if he doesn't start doling out a decent performance now and again. pathetic.<br /><br />it's not a terrible movie, but in the end you gotta ask "war, what is it good for?" absolutely nothing. c-
