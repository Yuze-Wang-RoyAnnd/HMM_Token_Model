the nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet. it bears little resemblance to eta hoffman's original story on which it is based.<br /><br />in the ballet, the story is essentially over by the second-half when clara (or marie in this version) travels to the kingdom of sweets to watch a series of character dances.<br /><br />there's an infinite variety of stage productions that re-interpret the story in myriad ways (not always successfully) to compensate for the ballet's weak libretto.<br /><br />balanchine's version doesn't really have any sense of drama or story at all (despite the fact that there is plenty of drama and mystery in tchaikovsky's wonderful first-act music). the result is a completely forgettable first-half christmas party where hardly anything happens and where even the dancing (the little that there is of it) isn't particularly memorable.<br /><br />the pantomime over-acting, particularly of drosselmeier, which might look passable on the stage, just looks silly filmed for the big screen.<br /><br />unfortunately, things aren't much better when we get to the kingdom of sweets (act ii in the stage version). although there are a few choreographic highlights, most of the choreography is bland and uninspiring. this certainly isn't vintage balanchine.<br /><br />balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance, but i have always felt he was less successful as a creator of narrative ballets. watching this film version of his stage production of the nutcracker has only re-affirmed this view.
