this film is awful. give me the dentist anytime! can you believe that one of the main tv stations here in arabia had this as their christmas film! i can only assume they expected to entertain the crowds with dudley moore rather than this. the last time i looked at my hot water bottle it had more acting, better plot, more drama and a lot more interest than this waste of celluloid. don't even watch it if you're drunk!
