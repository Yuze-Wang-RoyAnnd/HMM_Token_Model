i would of given this film a zero out of ten, but i will give it a two. reason one is that shah rukh khan appears in the film, which is not really a reason. last point is that rani appears in this film and does a smooch with kamal. i love rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress. which is why i didn't enjoy her in this movie kissing kamal, but its no big deal. anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable, lets actually talk about this film. is it good or bad, i think its a completely rubbish movie that made me yawn. me being a fantastic critic, you can see my other 250+ review's by clicking on my name, i have great taste. the movie is not entertaining is one thing and if this is suppose to be hard hitting cinema, why is there no morale in this movie. its a biased movie thats not a true story and it stinks. watching kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick, man cant kiss properly anyway.
