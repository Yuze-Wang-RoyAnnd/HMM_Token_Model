the movie that shoots scenes of a scenic caverns tour.<br /><br />remember no one from this movie except for michael pataki who dished out extreme pain as jc in "five the hard way". he's the really annoying sheriff who i did applaud when he practices nightstick on our rabid doctor. probably the most laughs you will have is with dr. beck's epileptic seizures out of nowhere. could mrs. beck be anymore wooden? seriously, if you took a 4 foot branch, stuck it in a hot tub, you wouldn't be able to notice a difference. the dread and suspense is looking over at the clock wondering when the credits will roll.<br /><br />watch it as a late night movie, mstified, but don't go out of your way.
