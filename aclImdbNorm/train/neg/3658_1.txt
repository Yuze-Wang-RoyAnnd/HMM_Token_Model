despite some mildly thought-provoking oddities in the script and the film's overall curiosity value, fury of the wolfman emerges as a dull, uninteresting excursion into lycanthropy, saved only by the statuesque presence of villainess perla cristal. the rest of the players, including the hammy naschy, are a complete write-off (though admittedly none are helped by often atrocious dubbing). although the screenplay packs in enough variations on werewolf/frankenstein/dr moreau themes to flesh out a dozen movies, the plot is so unevenly developed, the characterizations so feeble and the dialogue so verbosely ridiculous (at least in the english version), that any latent interest in the turgid proceedings is soon quashed.<br /><br />zabalza's direction seems jerky, even amateurish. his staging is clumsy and ineffective. he is not helped by villasenor's over-bright lighting. even promising sets are so unatmospherically photographed that the director's few attempts to give the audience a fright are signaled far in advance<br /><br />other credits fall into a similar pattern of ineptitude, though the stridently over-emphatic music score and the laughably crude, totally primitive special effects deserve special condemnation.
