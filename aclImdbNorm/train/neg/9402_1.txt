why was this film made? even keeping in mind the generous tax concessions that australian film investors were given, there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the go-ahead. for goodness sakes, the actors cast in this film are aussie b-grade celebs (not actors, people like john michael 'hollywood' howson, the original drummer from the band in hey hey its saturday, and the voice-over guy in countdown. but in saying that, this is still very watchable as long as you give it the brain attention it deserves : none. the script is bad (even for a self-confessed b-grade horror) and the acting and film quality is worse. it often looks as though it is a home movie, but even a home movie has 'realism'. anyone interested in australian cinema, please, for the love of god, pretend this film was never made.
