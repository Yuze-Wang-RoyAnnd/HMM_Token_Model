i suppose all the inside jokes is what made munchies a cult classic. i thought it was awful, though given the ridiculous story and the nature of the characters, it probably could've been a much better (and funnier) movie. maybe all they needed was a real budget.<br /><br />munchies, as many viewers have pointed out already, is something of a gremlins parody. hence, all the references to the movie. the movie begins somewhere in peru during an archeological dig. an annoying dufus named paul, aspiring stand up comedian who offers no sarcasm or witty jokes during the movie despite his career plans, is holed up with his dad in the caves. his dad is an unconventional kind of archeologist, searching the caves not for artificats or mummies or anything, but proof of u.f.o.'s. and that's where the munchies come into the picture. hidden in the crevice of a rock is an ugly little mutant that looks like a gyrating rubber doll with a gizmo voice. they name him arnold, stash him in a bag, and bring him home so paul's dad can finally show proof of extra terrestrial life.<br /><br />paul, the idiot that he is, breaks his promise to his dad to watch arnold (a wager he made with his dad, if he loses, it's off to community college to get a 'real' career). the creepy next door neighbor with the bad rug, cecil (television veteran harvey korman), wonders what his neighbors are up to. so, he and his lazy son, some airhead hippie type (who looks more like they should've made his character a biker or heavy metal enthusiast) to go and snatch arnold. why? a get rich quick scheme of course. and of course, even cecil's son is too dumb to look after arnold. and after a few pokes and prods at arnold, he multiplies into more munchies.<br /><br />this wasn't even a movie that was so bad it was good. it was just plain awful. i was hoping that the munchies would've mutated and killed the morons that were always after them, even paul and his girlfriend. at least it would be one way to get rid of all the bad acting in this movie that really hams up the movie. not to mention poor special effects that look like hand puppets. and really bad writing all around--it wasn't even funny--not even that young cop who can really give you the homicidal twitch in your eye. like i said, munchies, if they had been given an actual budget and better actors, they might've been able to pull off a good parody. pass.
