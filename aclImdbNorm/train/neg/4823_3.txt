lame plot and two-dimensional script made characters look like cardboard cut-outs. needless to say, this made it difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters, especially the fianc'e; he looked and acted more like a cartoon. in summary, i guess you could say it was on par with your typical made for tv drama. it uses just about every clich'e in the book. the tortured classical musician who wants to break-out and play salsa. the free-spirited fianc'ee engaged to a "bean counter" personality she doesn't love. i won't list them or else it would be a spoiler because i'd be giving away the whole plot. the dancing was ok but nothing special. i've seen worse. 3 stars for good music. the band was really tight. i saw it on youtube. thankfully i didn't pay good money to see it at a theater. i'm still a little shocked at how many great reviews this movie has garnished.
