oh god, what a horrible, horrible film. meant to be a comment on the state of society, it's just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality tv. interstitials hosted by jason jones and don mckellar are the most obnoxious part, written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflexive and insightful. rather, these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting, condescending speech that shoves the "meaning" of the film down the viewer's throat.<br /><br />also, a point to would-be filmmakers: long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art. neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of absurdity.<br /><br />if anyone out there is interested in watching this film, please don't. seriously. please. you have better things to do.
