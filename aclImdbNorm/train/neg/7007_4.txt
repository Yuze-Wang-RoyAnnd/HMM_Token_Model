this is a pretty bad movie. the plot is sentimental mush. i suppose the production values are ok, decent photography, unobtrusive direction and all that. mark hamill was terrible. i've never cared much for him, and this movie validates that perception. it's no wonder that he never really had any sort of career aside from his "star wars" films. i'll just say "buh-bye, mark" as he sinks into well-deserved obscurity. on the other hand, a very young annie potts utterly stole the show. she showed charm, beauty, and acting chops all in one performance. i remember seeing her in "texasville" recently and taking note of her beauty. it's interesting seeing her from ten years earlier. anyway, unless you are interested in miss potts, run away from this film screaming for the hills.
