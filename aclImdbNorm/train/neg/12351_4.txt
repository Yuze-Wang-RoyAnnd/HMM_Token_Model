a recent post here by a woman claiming a military background, contained the comment "a woman's life is no more valuable than a man's".<br /><br />this mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show. societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population, sometimes with astonishing speed. germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914- 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed. in south america's war of the triple alliance (1865), paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 chaco war against much larger bolivia.<br /><br />no society, however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population. only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight. israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered coed combat units for its defense forces despite the popular image of the israeli girl soldier.<br /><br />"g.i. jane" is hollywood fluff.
