first off, i have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen. its not even the low budget sci-fi channel movie, its just awful. me and my friend who love action movies, independence day, jurassic park, lotr, etc. went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a transformers with dragons, mindless entertainment. all we got was a mindless hour and a half. the cg was not as bad as i was expecting, but the plot is so awful along with the acting, it made up for it. its basically a chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years...sounds like a good remake of rain of fire? no, the plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes, but with magic, and a very small actual war between dragons(rather big snakes) it just gets ridiculous. the director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail. me and my friend laughed through the whole thing(along with all 5 of the audience), and cant believed we spent money on this. the short trailer on tv makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest. i've seen a lot of b movies like reptilian, the cave, spider, and others, but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour, watch this.<br /><br />story: 1/10 cg: 5/10 acting:3/10<br /><br />i don't drink...but it would have helped before watching this movie
