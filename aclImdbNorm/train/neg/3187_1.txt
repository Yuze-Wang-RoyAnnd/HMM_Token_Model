from the star of "mitchell", from the director of "joysticks" and "angel's revenge"!!! these are taglines that would normally keep me from seeing this movie. and the worst part is that all the above mentioned statements are true!!! ugghhh... joe don baker eats every other five minutes in this film. it's like a bad remake of "coogan's bluff"
