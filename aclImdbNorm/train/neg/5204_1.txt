"trigger man" is definitely the most boring and silliest movie i've ever seen in my life. my aunt's holiday videos are more fascinating.<br /><br />the actors seem to be recruited at uglypeople.com. they do not have any talent to act in a convincing manner.<br /><br />they walk and walk and walk through the forest. there's more walking-around than in all three parts of "the lord of the rings" together. after the first hour, i began to read a porsche brochure while watching "trigger man" along the way. awful.<br /><br />a total waste of time and money. i'd give that movie 0 stars out of 10, since this is not possible, i have to give 1 star.
