this is one very confusing movie. the film is very hard to follow and the plot just didn't seem to make any sense. the fury of the wolfman was made in spain and i think that when any film is dubbed from one language to another, it doesn't translate exactly as it was first meant. maybe this is part of the problem but i doubt if it can account for all the problems with this film. the dubbing is pretty bad and the voices don't match the characters very well. the scenes are choppy, there is an array of strange and irrelevant characters that do little more than confuse the viewer even more. what i did like about this film was the look of the wolfman himself and the scenes where he attacks. now if they could have put it all together and had it make some sense, they might have had something. don't waste your time on this one.
