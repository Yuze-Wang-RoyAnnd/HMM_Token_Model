this film is overblown, predictable, pretentious, and hollow to its core. the settings are faithful to the era but self-conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure. the lingering over artifacts stops the action and cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue. tom hanks seems to be sleepwalking much as bruce willis did in hart's war. tom, you can't give depth to a character simply by making your face blank! the content did not warrant the histrionic acting by paul newman. this is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing.
