tom is listening to one of those old-time radio broadcasts, something kids from the 1950s to today would watch on tv. however, they didn't television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio. <br /><br />tom is literally shaking in his boots listening to some story about the "phantom." he's actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying, such as "hair standing on end, icy chills race down her spine, her heart beats in her throat," etc. jerry, meanwhile, is watching tom and laughing his butt off at his scaredy- cat antics.<br /><br />we then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194- cartoon in which jerry tortures tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure. if the cat asks for trouble, that's one thing, but when he's minding own business and jerry is physically (and in this case, mentally) abusing him, i have a hard time rooting for the "little guy."<br /><br />these early t&m efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed. sometimes that one minute makes a difference. it did here as this actually dragged for awhile. it could have been cut to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches went on too long. that's usual for tom and jerry's. usually, they are much faster-paced.
