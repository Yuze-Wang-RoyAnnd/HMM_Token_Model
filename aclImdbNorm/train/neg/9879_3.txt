after viewing the film, i was truly shocked to see such a high rating on imdb.<br /><br />'the fantastic mr. fox' is an adaption of a beloved children's classic, portraying the story of the smooth, slick protagonist mr. fox (or 'foxy') as he attempts one 'last' heist to steal from the dreaded boggins, bunce and bean. that's right, one short, one fat, one lean, or however it goes.<br /><br />i don't quite know where to start with my criticism.<br /><br />well, i'm in my late teens and was never a fan of roald dahl, but i like his material well enough, having read a few of his books as a child and seen matilda and charlie and the chocolate factory over and over again. this film, however, struggles for an audience. is it aimed at children? adults? i'm still unsure! many of the 'jokes' would bore a child, especially as mr. fox visits a lawyer for example, or complains about being poor. also, an audience of (i'm assuming) children is expected to sympathise with a character who steals and kills chickens. i'm all for the food chain, but you practically see mr. fox biting down on their necks! surely that's a bit much? and also, the plot... well, it's kind of boring. i stayed only with the hope of it getting better, but instead i just got more and more annoyed at mr fox and his son ash for making stupid decisions.<br /><br />the humour, meanwhile, falls flat. i laughed only once or twice, even though i specifically recognised attempts at jokes. i think part of it is that the voice acting is so incredibly flat and monotoned. the voice actors have no sense of comic timing, instead aiming for the subtlety of humour that only works with certain mediums. george clooney aims to portray mr. fox as charming and sleek, but his voice has no character. meryl streep shows no emotion, i didn't even realise bill murray had a role until the end credits, and ash, twelve-years old in fox-years, sounds like he's about 30.<br /><br />i love animation, particularly stop motion, but the visual style actually creeped me out a little bit. characters are tall, spindly and lacking any warmth of design. they move with very little fluidity and often the animation is jerky and strange. there is also a distinctive 'mixed medium' feel, as 2d components are added in sporadically and unsuccessfully. characters look straight at the camera and talked; it was very awkward. there was one or two moments when kylie looked straight at the camera, didn't move and had swirls on his eyeballs. it actually freaked me out.<br /><br />fantastic mr. fox had so much potential. lots of people still seem to like it - look at the reviews. maybe it just wasn't for me.
