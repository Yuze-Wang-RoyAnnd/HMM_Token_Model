this movie is just bad. bad. bad. bad. now that i've gotten that out of the way, i feel better. this movie is poor from beginning to end. the story is lame. the 3-d segment is really bad. freddy is at his cartoon character worst. thank god they killed him off. and who wants to see roseanne and tom arnold cameos?<br /><br />the only good thing in the movie is the little bit of backstory that we're given on freddy. we see he once had a family, and we get to see his abusive, alcoholic father (alice cooper).<br /><br />other than that, all bad. there are some quality actors in here (lisa zane and yaphet kotto), and they do their best, but the end result is just so bad. the hour and a half i spent watching this movie is and hour and half i can't ever get back.
