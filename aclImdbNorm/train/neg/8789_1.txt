i checked this one out on dvd for a dollar so i could easily smile as this dreadful movie unfolds. every time that you think it cannot get any worse, it inevitably does. the acting is absolutely horrific. the plot makes no sense at all. the title "cold vengeance" in the us dvd version has absolutely nothing to do with the script. the action scenes are so obviously taken in their first take. there are lots of mistakes during dialogues indicating that there is just no intend to do another take to at least try to make this movie bearable. i cannot remember having seen a worse movie and i do occasionally get bad ones--well, except for unstoppable with wesley snipes. no, who am i kidding, while a bad one, unstoppable deserves best picture awards at the oscars when compared to this piece of crap.
