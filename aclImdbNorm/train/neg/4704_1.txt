a very bad attempt at a young spinal tap. at least the music in spinal tap was good.<br /><br />this is really a very sad case of hollywood nepotism at it's worst. a bunch of hollywood execs, bad musicians and producers create some "poopie" show so their kids can be in the spotlight. oh please!!! the potty humor was even bad. i hate this stuff when there is really incredibly talented kids (musicians, actors and artists) out there busting their butts to have success and this crap comes along.<br /><br />help u all!!!! why wasn't gene simmons in it??? ameriac's taste in entertainment is going down the toilet.
