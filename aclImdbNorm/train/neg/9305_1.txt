me and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good. but we were wrong. first of the acting....wow...the acting was the worst, the effects were really bad as well, it seemed like a film a college kid made. the plot was pretty good, but it'd been done. the thing that ruined the movies the most were the actors. the main guy was the worst actor ever...it's a shame i'm even calling him an actor...the only good thing about this movie was it was so bad it was funny...so if you want a good laugh see it....but other than that...stay far away from this one. i usually love b list movies and such, but this one... i do not know how it was passed to even be put on video...this one is the worst i've seen..and i've seen some bad ones.
