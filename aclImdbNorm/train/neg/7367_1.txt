i am truly beginning to believe that seagal is on a mission to see how crappy his films could become.this particular movie was a complete and utter waste of time to see.my first complaint was the cover of the dvd where they have doctored his pic and made him look slimmer and younger when in the film he looks like crap.he has his big pot belly and double chin going for him and the most miserable and bored look on his face.<br /><br />the whole plot was ridiculous to begin with and drawn out way too long.the whole film was leading up to the finale where seagal and his team had to take on a bunch of people under the influence of a top secret military chemical adrenaline enhancer.there was way too much useless dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of seagals voice even in the middle of a statement.the dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite comical.<br /><br />the fight scenes in the film were horrible.half the time when seagal fought you could not even see what was going on.there would be tight shots of him flapping his arms at the camera and then the person flying through a wall or something.it was reminiscent of the old kung fu series on television.they used way too much slow motion for the fight scenes.<br /><br />i believe this is seagals worst film to date and i am glad i did not purchase this film or i would have been very upset since i am a huge fan of seagal the aikidoist.the action star is quickly fading away and seems to be getting worse with every performance.
