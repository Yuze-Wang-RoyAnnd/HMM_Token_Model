"arahan" adds nothing positive to the kung fu genre. to compare this confused motion picture with the inspired craziness and quality of stephen chow's films is a mistake.<br /><br />firstly the fight scenes are nothing new. all that is presented here has been done before and better by the likes of yimou zhang, tony jaa and jackie chan. fights in intelligent motion pictures need logic. there seems no point serving blows that have no damaging effect as in the "matrix" sequels.<br /><br />the attractive female lead so-yi yoon captivated the screen but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as ziyi zhang had done so easily in "house of flying daggers". having a martial arts background serves well in kung fu movies. to cast actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake (see aya ueto in "asumi") unless you are a very talented director which as "arahan" proves seung-wan ryoo is not.
