i watched this movie after seeing other comments on imdb, even convincing my wife that it was a "unique horror movie." i wanted to like this movie, but was unable to.<br /><br />the "love story" was good, but the horror aspect was quite bad. if the story was just about a young man who fell in love with a girl suffering from parasomnia, then it would have been a better movie.<br /><br />the care centre stretched credulity well past the limits, in fact it was quite ridiculous. the doctor happily ignors privacy laws and professionalism. a nurse goes into a room for a routine feeding of a dangerous patient (without security escort), and drops the tray and runs out of the room screaming for no apparent reason. the forensic patient (and the film's villain) is tied up in a standing position fully clothed - apparently for years? none of it makes much sense.<br /><br />the movie even had some actors that i've liked in other things, such as the detectives, but still i can't recommend this movie.
