ever since i started visiting this site, and voting for movies, i have never given any movie a rating of 1. even the disturbing "dance! workout with barbie" got a 2. there is a reason for this.<br /><br />any time i find myself watching what i think is a really bad movie, i have to stop and ask myself the following question: "is this movie really as bad as the horrific soul-sucking beast that is 'theodore rex'?" and i've never been able to answer "yes".<br /><br />i would give anything within reason to know what crackhead said "hey! let's remake 'blade runner' with barney in the harrison ford role!" and decided it was a good idea to actually spend the time and money to commit it to film. furthermore, i want to know what the hell kind of market they were going to sell this towards if it hadn't gone strait to video. this is that rare monster: a movie that is way too violent for kids and way too insanely stupid for adults. i'd ask "what were they thinking?" but in this case, it might actually be redundant.<br /><br />anyhow, all you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if you're one of the five or six rabid fans of "howard the duck", or if you are curious to see the most evil insane movie of all time, or you want to really punish yourself.
