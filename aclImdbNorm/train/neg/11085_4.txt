tyson <br /><br />aspect ratio: 1.33:1<br /><br />sound format: stereo<br /><br />reverent - though scrupulously fair - account of the life and times of champion boxer mike tyson. given his conviction on a rape charge, the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain, but paints a warts-and-all portrait of his rise to fame, the pressures of success, and the people who shaped his destiny for good or bad. constrained by time limits, the script gallops through a succession of relevant details, alighting briefly on significant events, culminating with tyson's (temporary) downfall in 1995. novices will be enlightened by the chronology, while boxing fans will be entertained by director uli edel's straight-arrow approach to the material. he portrays tyson's life as a circus in which he was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of his own success. in fact, the script reserves most of its venom for tyson's ex-wife robin givens, characterising her as an ungrateful gold-digger who took advantage of his naivety. production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb: michael jai white does a fair imitation of the title character; george c. scott plays tyson's mentor cus d'amato through acres of gritted teeth; and paul winfield was surely born to play don king!
