if this is all the watchowski's have to offer in terms of a back story to the matrix, than i really have to question the claims of all of the fans who believe that the movies are intended to register on a deeper level. the second renaissance, while visually stunning & beautiful is, story-wise cliched & ludicrous. how many times have we heard the story of humans relying too much on technology, humans all-too eager to make war, humans basically destroying themselves? there is nothing new here. and i have another question. considering the plot of the second renaissance, doesn't that make the machines the good guys?! the machines are oppressed for generations by their cruel human overmasters. they fight back, win their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful harmonious coexistence with the humans, who reject them in favor of all-out war, which the cleverer machines naturally win. if this is the back-story, then we shouldn't be rooting for neo, we should be rooting for the machines! the humans were cruel and oppressive, while the machines were courageous and attepted to be compassionate. since i do not believe that the watchowski's intend for us to favor the machines over the humans, i have to believe that the second renaissance was simply a misguided attempt @ creating a back-story.
