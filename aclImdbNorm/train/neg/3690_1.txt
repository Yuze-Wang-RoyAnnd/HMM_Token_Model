baba - rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. this is the movie which caused his downfall. it was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors. rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred. soon after its release, he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably. its a very bad movie with horrible acting, bad-quality makeup and pathetic screenplay. throughout the movie, rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease. i'm one of the unfortunate souls who saw baba, first day first show in theatre. the audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission. sorry, i'll not recommend this one to anyone.
