to review this movie, i without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in tarantino's "pulp fiction" (1994) when jules and vincent are talking about mia wallace and what she does for a living. jules tells vincent that the "only thing she did worthwhile was pilot". vincent asks "what the hell is a pilot?" and jules goes into a very well description of what a tv pilot is: "well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. that show's called a 'pilot'. then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. some pilots get picked and become television programs. some don't, become nothing. she starred in one of the ones that became nothing." now to stretch on what jules was talking about, there are billions of television shows/pilots that were never aired because they simply were not...well, good. probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is "w*a*l*t*e*r", a spin-off to "m*a*s*h" with gary "radar" burghoff as the lead. hmmm, would somebody really want to be watching radar for a half-hour trying to solve crimes? hence, the show was never picked up. what many people don't know (or what they thought they knew) is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air, for they are made strictly for the television networks for them to decide. some have made they're way past and got onto the air (the pilot for the animated series "american dad" comes to mind, as the show's serial itself didn't begin until nearly four months later. however, there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air, and this here is why.<br /><br />"black bart", a supposed tie-in with the mel brooks comedy classic, "blazing saddles", is a stale and bland "sitcom" with little heart and no soul. "saddles" was a controversial comedy, nevertheless, with it's racist humor and vulgar comedy, which comes to mind "what idiot decided this would make a great television show for prime time tv?!?" i say "supposed", because none of the memorable characters from the movie, aside from bart, on in this mess of a tv show. mel brooks wasn't even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line (in a related story, i recently found out about an unaired tv pilot for a series based on the movie "clerks." that kevin smith was no involved in....you see what happens?!?).<br /><br />set somewhere around the same time as the movie (or at all), the story circles around the only black sheriff in the wild west, named appropriately 'black' bart, who is this time played by future academy award winner louis gossett jr., obviously before his stint in "real" acting, whereas in this he is playing a "g-rated" richard pryor. most of the other characters are carbon (if not, really bad) copies of the characters in the movie: jim, the waco kid is replaced by a similar looking character named reb jordan, a former confederate soldier who is quick with the gun. lilian von schtupp is now belle buzzer, a more of a ripoff of the character being that she's a show dancer and a german with a marlene dietrich-type accent and personality. while that's pretty much the end in similarities, the lead "bad guy" in the story is fern malaga, played by noble willingham, who i assumed would've been hedley lamar if warner bros. secured the rights to the name (see trivia for "blazing saddles") and his son curley...i dunno, taggart i suppose? the story is a poor excuse for a sitcom, much less a pilot. bart deals with the mayor's drunk son and he's out-of-control behavior which has caused the town to spin. really, it's a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the "series" and doesn't focus on the variety and context that would make this an "alright" show. i can't really call it a sitcom (and even if i wanted to) and that's primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at warner bros. studios and later added a laugh track, so the show is set up almost exactly like "m*a*s*h" (complete with a bland and dull "laughing" that is identical to the series). the acting is so-so, but there's one part that always make me laugh, and that's when the actor playing reb jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue. ha! the script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie (surprisingly, they use the word "n***er" numerous amount of times through a 22-minute episode, rather touchy for it's time period and even for today) and it gets repetitive.<br /><br />if you ever get your hands on this unseen piece of sssss...surly interesting novelty item, watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots (it's on the collector's edition of "blazing saddles", god knows why). there, yourself get a first hand chance for the reason why many movie tie-in pilots never air.
