they had an opportunity to make one of the best romantic tragedy mafia movies ever because they had the actors,the budget,and the story but the great director john huston was too preoccupied trying to mellow out this missed classic.strenuously trying to find black humor as often as possible which diluted the movie very much.and also they were so uncaring with details like sound and detailed action.maybe it was the age of the director who passed away two years later.
