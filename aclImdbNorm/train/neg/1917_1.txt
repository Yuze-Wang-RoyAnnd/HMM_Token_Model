this film, although not totally bad, should have been filmed where the actual events took place. grand island, nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornados on the night of june 3, 1980. grand island is situated in the nearly treeless, flat platte river valley in hall county. the makers of this movie filmed in the tree covered hills of ontario and moved the whole event to a non-existant town called blainsworth. the people of grand island bravely survived this awful night only to be forgotten because of a poorly made movie.
