there is an awful lot wrong with this picture, beginning with a script that is both obvious and redundant. courtney cox plays a comic book artist who escapes to a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city. she immediately is stalked by a local who appears quite unhinged (craig sheffer), and who seems to be attempting a third rate mickey rourke imitation. d.b. sweeny is a local cop, who is supposedly there to protect and serve. meanwhile, the script manipulates the audience as to who's really the good guy? logic flies out the window after the first ten minutes and never returns, and there are more unanswered questions than there should be. if you think "blue desert" might be saved by the wonderful philip baker hall, you will be disappointed. his part is insignificant, just like the entire movie. - merk
