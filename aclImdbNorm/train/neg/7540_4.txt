the wicker man, starring nicolas cage, is by no means a good movie, but i can't really say it's one i regret watching. i could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie, like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where cage is looking for the girl, has a hallucination, followed by another hallucination, followed by a dream sequence- with a hallucination, etc., but it's just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this. instead, here's five reasons why you should watch the wicker man, even though it's bad: <br /><br />5. it's hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it, the only problem is in its cheesy, unintentionally funny execution. if nothing else, this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film, or even read the short story on which it is based.<br /><br />4. for a cheesy horror/thriller, it is really aesthetically pleasing. it's pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets, so we get to see some very great scenery. there are also many nicely composed shots. it is a very good looking movie.<br /><br />3. nicolas cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature. whether you're a fan of his or not, it seems as if it's impossible for cage to play a "normal guy". there is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays, and personally, i am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does. whether nicolas cage is great or terrible, he always brings his unique energy into play, and he is never boring to watch. he is terrible in the wicker man, but in the most wonderful kind of way.<br /><br />2. a student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie, as it seems to be the strongest anti-feminist movie ever made. "see?" you could write, "this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society!" also, the similarities between this "summersisle" society and a bee colony are pretty interesting and worth noting.<br /><br />1. if you're reading this, there's probably a good chance you may have seen a youtube video that has become very popular: a collection of "highlights" from the movie, including cage running around in a bear suit, and of course, the infamous "aaghh!! the bees!! my eyes!!!" line. these scenes are hilarious out of context, and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the film's entirety.<br /><br />i bought the used dvd at blockbuster for about 5 dollars...when you work that out, it's about a dollar per reason. it's a pretty good deal.<br /><br />note: the unrated version of the movie is the best to watch, and it's better to watch the theatrical version just for its little added on epilogue, which features a cameo from james franco.
