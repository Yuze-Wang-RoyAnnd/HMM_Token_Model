don't be deceived as i was by the 'glowing' reviews quoted on the dvd box. "wildly entertaining.", "a seriously scary freakout.", and the worst of all, "on par with jaws." this movie is none of the above.<br /><br />normally i don't bother with writing bad reviews for films but i can't believe this one is resting at a comfortable 7 on imdb. it doesn't deserve it.<br /><br />after a so-so opening daylight attack by a monster created by, what else, chemicals dumped by lazy scientists, this movie goes absolutely nowhere and it goes there sloooowly. basically and improbably, a girl is snagged by the monster (i'll give them points for a good creature design but this ain't no weta creation) and her semi-comical family spend an hour-and-a-half tracking her down...in the sewers surrounding the han river. their search lacks any suspense-again, someone called this on par with jaws?-and by the time they find her you realize it was all pretty much pointless. other than that, a big bulk of the movie is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in one funny scene involving a guy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop.<br /><br />blech. this was bad. i'm not kidding. you want to see a rotten monster movie? rent deep rising. at least you'll save 30 minutes of your life.
