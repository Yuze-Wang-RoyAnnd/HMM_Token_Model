although in some aspects seven pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style, gabriele muccino's project is rather mediocre. the movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end: hearts human and emotional, eyes physical and metaphorical. seven pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of alejandro gonz'alez i~n'arritu's amores perros and 21 grams, with lots and lots of flashbacks. the problem is the story is quite predictable from very easily on through the movie. that's too bad, because seven pounds could have been as authentically "good" if ben and emily had been put in the right hands.
