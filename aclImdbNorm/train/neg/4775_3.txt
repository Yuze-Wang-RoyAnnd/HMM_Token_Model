what a complete waste of time. the movie starts as a clone of the saw series, but with even worse acting. melissa joan hart is absolutely horrible. the ending is ridiculous and the story contains no twists, not plot surprises and just a plain bad ending. i liked some of the characters and i was hoping for everything to be tied together at the end. it just doesn't happen. it's a total "wrestler" ending with none of the good acting. i can't believe i spent the time watching this. it's not "fun" as some people put it. a guy in a mask kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to figure it out. the connection is a stretch and he should have shot the main actress first.
