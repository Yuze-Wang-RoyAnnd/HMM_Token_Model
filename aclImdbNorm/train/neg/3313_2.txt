how can anybody say that this movie is a comedy?? if i had not gone with then my finacee i would have fallen asleep and asked for my money back. i love gwen paltrow, but it was like she was on the wrong set. i like most chick flicks, but i hated this one. this is the only time i saw so much clevage and was not turned on. those outfits were way overdone. no one talks that way anymore and i don't think they even did then. the dancing part was horrible.my ex said to me later..."didn't ya like that part? didn't ya think it was sensous?" i said yes only to spare her feelings. now i know why we never married.this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen.
