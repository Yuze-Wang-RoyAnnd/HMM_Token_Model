upon viewing tobe hooper's gem, crocodile, in 2000, i developed a great interest in the college/crocodile niche of the exploitation/monster genre. i look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness. if only ed wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts. with ed writing the scripts, and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer, all we'd need would be a cast of crocky fodder with russ meyer breasts and ren hoek pectoral implants.<br /><br />while tobe hooper's crocky opus referenced his own movies, blood surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies. see if you can look past the revenge of the nerds sequel sets to find the allusions/homages?/rip-offs to jaws, temple of doom, indiana jones' last crusade, the convent, godzilla 2000, and any james bond movie. also, try to find the ready-for-tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock.<br /><br />i was disappointed the crock didn't get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism...or crocky appreciation, but the quasi-captain ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach. perhaps, in the coming years, we'll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset. or hopefully, a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero-g monkey/midget/crocodile bloodshed.<br /><br />all-in-all, the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me.
