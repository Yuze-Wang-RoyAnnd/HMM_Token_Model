the tooth fairy is set in a small town somewhere in northern california where peter campbell (lochlyn munro) has brought a farming property which he is renovating & planning to turn into a holiday inn, he is joined by his girlfriend darcy wagner (chandra west) & her young 12 year old daughter pamela (nicole munoz) who arrive to help for the weekend. while exploring the property pamela meets another young girl named emma (jianna ballard) who warns her that evil lurks within her new home, she tells a tale of an evil old witch known as the tooth fairy who takes baby teeth from children & then kills them. pamela is worried & becomes even more so when she falls off her bike & her last baby tooth falls out, it's not long before the evil ghost of the tooth fairy has her eyes on pamela's tooth & just for kicks she also decides to kill anyone she comes across...<br /><br />directed by chuck bowman i thought the tooth fairy was just another poor straight-to-video low budget horror film that fails to distinguish itself from the countless other's which litter video shop shelves & fill late night obscure cable tv schedules, basically it's not very good. the script by producer stephen j. cannell, corey strode & cookie rae brown is a complete snooze-fest for the first 40 odd minutes, nothing of any great interest happen during this period at all & is basically dull exposition as if this stuff was going to surprise anyone. it introduces the character's, sets the tooth fairy legend up & that's it. the second half of the film improves slightly but even then it's hardly spectacular stuff, there are a few decent set-piece gore scenes but apart from that it's all very predictable & forgettable stuff. the character's aren't great & most of them are there purely to be killed off, the story has inconsistencies like the story of the tooth fairy herself, it says she kills children after they give her their baby teeth so why does she go on an indiscriminate killing spree that has nothing to do with teeth? what happened to her after the prologue set during 1949? why has she come back as a ghost? despite being a ghost of some sort she seems very human having to open doors herself & using weapons to kill people, there is no attempt to make any use of the supernatural elements except the ghostly children who are played for maximum sentiment.<br /><br />director bowman does ok, it's reasonably well made & there are a couple of half decent scenes but nothing to get that excited about. there's nothing i would describe as scary or atmospheric in here & don't take any notice of the comparisons between this & darkness falls (2003) as besides the teeth thing they're quite different. the gore is ok, someone is shoved into a wood-chipping machine, there's a decapitation, someone has their penis chopped off & the best scene when someone is nailed to a door & then has their stomach hacked open with an axe & their guts slide out.<br /><br />with a supposed budget of about $1,500,000 the tooth fairy is generally well made but there's nothing special on show here. the acting isn't anything great but it's not too bad & unusually i didn't find the child actors that annoying so that's something i suppose.<br /><br />the tooth fairy is the usual just below average low budget modern straight-to-video horror fare that seems everywhere these days, if you can find a cheap copy then it might pass 90 odd minutes if your not too demanding otherwise it's pretty poor & forgettable stuff.
