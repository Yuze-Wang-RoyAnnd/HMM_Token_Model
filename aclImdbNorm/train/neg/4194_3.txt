this film started out very promising with the story about a director who loses his sight and a blind woman who is bound to help him. however, somewhere in the middle it seemed like the script writers didn't know where to go from there.<br /><br />one unbelievable event followed the next (russia must be very small because they are all bumping into each other all the time), the motivation of the female lead character comprehensible (why does she still follow him after they got off the ship? why doesn't she try to borrow a mobile phone on the ship to call somebody?), the side stories were completely ridiculous (was the story with the mother and the boyfriend supposed to be funny? and what was the story with the younger sister about?). still with all this seeming arbitrariness of the plot, the movie managed to be completely predictable.<br /><br />the saddest thing about it is that there was a lot of potential. as i said, the idea of the film was good, the visuals and the score were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were good, too. so this could have been a really good film... but it wasn't.
