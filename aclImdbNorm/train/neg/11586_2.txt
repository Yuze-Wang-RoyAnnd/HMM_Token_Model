a nightmare on elm street: the dream child<br /><br />this is a bad movie. there's no escaping it. i love the series and i think freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies. but even being a fan i can't help but see this movie is mediocre.<br /><br />there's not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters. by now they had just given up. they don't even try. they are the production of course, hoping for a few more easy dollars.<br /><br />the story doesn't grab your attention. its so simple it's almost absent.<br /><br />alice, a survivor from part 4 is now pregnant. freddy is coming back through the baby's dreams. at the beginning we learn that to stop him alice must find his mother. and that's it. <br /><br />the story advances slowly since there's so little plot meaning it turns pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and awful acting. in fact that's the only scary thing, the acting, since the deaths are not even slightly cool. <br /><br />the characters are so uninteresting we couldn't care less for them.<br /><br />the girls are as unattractive as possible. the whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theatre group. i've seen better actors in school plays. it's embarrassing really.<br /><br />lisa wilcox still manages to bring some class to this. she is beautiful, sexy and has some talent. but the material just didn't let her shine. what a pity.<br /><br />stephen hopkins work is nowhere close to renny harlin's brilliant direction in dream master. he tries some imaginative shots near the end but that tension harlin and craven created so well in the previous movies is no where to be found.<br /><br />the dream child is just another unimaginative sequel. it's the kind of movie that give horror series a bad name. <br /><br />the end for the once scary freddy. it's too sad to see him now. a clown that's not funny. a bad joke. goodbye freddy.
