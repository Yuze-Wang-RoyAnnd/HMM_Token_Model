there's nothing worse than renting an asian movie and getting an american movie experience instead.<br /><br />it's only my opinion, but a good thriller is dependent upon the establishment of likable, intelligent characters. as far as likability is concerned, the protagonists in say yes are a quaint married couple. nicely done. unfortunately, they are stupid beyond belief. let us count the ways they mishandle being terrorized by a stalker.<br /><br />1. after a hitchhiker threatens to kill you, be sure to tell him what hotel you're staying at when you drop him off.<br /><br />2. beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses, thereby allowing him to press charges of assault.<br /><br />3. don't bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume (for no apparently good reason) that the cops were bribed by him.<br /><br />4. while trying to escape, let your lady out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps her.<br /><br />5. after getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife, be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him one-on-one. no point in being unfair, right? <br /><br />now, i'd never expect that any person would be immune to making a few mistakes under these stressful conditions, but the characters in say yes are so dense and make so many unbelievable mistakes that it's effectively impossible for the viewer to care about their safety, since they are victims of their own doing. this kills the enjoyability of the entire film. <br /><br />in case you were wondering, the scriptwriters didn't stop with dim-witted characters. since they themselves are surely dim-witted for writing this crapfest, they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the window.<br /><br />1. the stalker kills a cop inside a police station
