short version: seed isn't worthless. it's just derivative and inferior. and soulless.<br /><br />long version: if you have never seen any of the films comprising the vaguely-defined "psychological horror" genre, this movie will probably melt your face off. maybe not, but it will give you a good burn. the opening montage of real animal abuse will be sufficient to open your eyes to possibilities of brutality-on-video, and the (only) memorable gore scene later in the film will perhaps be more than you can handle. the climax will play with your emotions in a way that perhaps no other film has.<br /><br />but that's if you don't have much experience with the genre. if you've seen the real thing..."august underground's penance," for example, you will, as i did, find it terribly difficult to stay awake until the end of the film.<br /><br />other reviewers have compared this to the video nasties of old. i understand this comparison. like the video nasties, "seed" is more violent than a mainstream horror film and less subtle. but the reason the video nasties are still known to us is not only for the above reasons--those that are still popular had something special. permit me to be ambiguous, i think you will understand: those that have stuck around had "soul".<br /><br />take this quote from gabriele crisanti, director of "burial ground," on an interview on the new-ish dvd: "...we will never have more films like these, because today, technology has surpassed imagination. and technology is cold. so many things will disappear because small films like these won't be produced anymore. today we have great, exceptional tricks that are very expensive, but they are cold. today a horror, a terror film of this kind costs more than a million dollars. these films were not so expensive...they are real effects, made with our hands".<br /><br />perhaps it is wrong to take the comparison to old school horror so seriously. but crisanti has hit the nail on the head. even at their most seemingly exploitational, the best of the video nasties were pursuing a primitive "truth." and this is where boll falls short. it's like he's seen the movies and not understood them. everything on the checklist is there...bs about "making a statement about humanity," an obscene torture scene, etc. but it is, as crisanti puts it, "cold." the gore is all cgi. the whole thing feels like scenes pieced together from other movies of various genres. and the pacing is sooooo slow. man, so slow.<br /><br />another interesting note: the one gore scene really reminded me of a video game.<br /><br />anyway, enough bs. weak movie.
