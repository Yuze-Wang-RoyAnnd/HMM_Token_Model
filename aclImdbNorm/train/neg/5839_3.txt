winter kills is a terrible, incoherent and very disappointing conspiracy comedy-thriller from little-known director william richert. while watching the film, i honestly felt as if i was the emperor in the classic fable the emperor's new clothes. the film made me feel like a fool because i couldn't make head nor tail of the serpentine plot and the nonsensical characters. but i felt kind of embarrassed to admit to myself that the film was tying my brain up in knots. so i stuck with it to the end, hoping that the whole tangled mess would untangle itself. then i realised.... the film is supposed to be serpentine, nonsensical and illogical, because that's the whole point. this is a satirical look at conspiracy theories and theorists, with the knotting-up of the plot used as a metaphor for the knotting-up of truths, half-truths and lies that define any conspiracy. even when i got that the joke was on me, i still felt winter kills to be a pretty awful movie.<br /><br />young nick kegan (jeff bridges) is the younger brother of a former united states president who was assassinated in philadelphia. nick is present when a dying man claims that he shot the president and gives detailed information about where he hid the gun. nick follows the clues, but every step of the way the people helping him seem to die in mysterious circumstances. also, his father pa kegan (john huston), a vulgar and disgustingly wealthy businessman, keeps interfering with nick's investigation. the deeper he delves into the assassination, the more nick realises that he is descending into a web of complex lies and red herrings, where nothing is as it seems and no-one can be trusted.<br /><br />the film is an utter nightmare to follow, and in many ways is not worth trying to follow for the afore-mentioned reason that it deliberately tangles itself up. the cast is packed with extraordinary talent but most of them are wasted. toshiro mifune has one of the briefest and most pointless cameo roles in cinematic history; elizabeth taylor appears uncredited and has not a single line of dialogue; richard boone is given what seems to be an interesting role but his character goes nowhere. john huston has the best role as the powerful patriarch and provides us with the film's few enjoyable moments with his acerbic delivery. anthony perkins also gets a creepy role and handles it well, though his screen time is far too short to do complete justice to the character. some nudity and sex scenes are tossed in for no real reason and, while they're quite graphic and might appeal to voyeurs, they really belong in another film. the film's semi-comic climax is farcical and disappointing, yet paradoxically memorable in its weird little way. there's obviously a cult audience out there somewhere for winter kills.... but i won't be counting myself among its number.
