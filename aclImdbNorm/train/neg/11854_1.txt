for the life of me i can't understand the good reviews on this piece of crap. it was pointless. matthew modine was horribly miscast as a leading ladies man. gina gershon, well, others have said it, but i'll reiterate, why the stupid accent? totally unnecessary. and her acting was just bad. i don't know if she was thrown by the accent, or what. there was no chemistry between these two. <br /><br />and the girl modine was in love with, suddenly she's shoving half a head of lettuce in her mouth and acting in a goofy way? where did that come from? i think we were supposed to feel sorry for her as we saw her marriage to a workaholic begin to crumble, but frankly, i couldn't care less about any of these people.
