what a crappy movie! the worst of the worst! this movie is as entertaining as a dead slug. no-talent-what-so-ever-actors, stupid plot. who wrote this script?! was there ever a script for this goofy movie or did the director just accidentally press the record-button on his camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along? is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what? my friends younger brother is in the 6.th grade and him and his classmates just did an amateur-movie for their school-project which outdid this geeky movie.. this is by far the worst film i have seen in my life! there is just no excuse for this flick!
