> you are warned this is a spoiler! > this movie is so bad that i doubt i can write enough lines. great direction the shots were well thought out. the actors were very good particularly richard pryor tho i would have liked to have seen more of him. madeline kahn and john houseman were classic. dudley more god bless him could have done better. john ritter again i would have liked to see more of him. in my opinion this failure is due totally to writer failure. maybe the producer could have pulled the plug once he saw what he was creating. its just too bad that so much money went into this boiler,when with a little change here and there would in my opinion fixed it.they must have paid the writers standard rates. to produce one chuckle.
