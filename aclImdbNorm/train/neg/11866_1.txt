first up this film, according to the slick said it won "best film" at "worldfest" film festival in houston, texas. hmmm must have been a quiet year.<br /><br />wouldn't call this the worst film ever but it certainly sucks, is pretty much just as terrible as other aussie b grader "body melt", but at least that film didn't look like it was shot on hi 8 video.<br /><br />my guess is the film makers, watched a lot of troma films, and really bad b grade gore films, thinking that they too could crack into the business releasing this film.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, i love really low grade films, just the fact that some of the characters put on fake american accents, almost as if doing so would give them more chance to sell it in the states or something. really disappointing ending as well, the showdown could have been way more exciting, and some good fight scenes. you can completely see that the film makers are trying to copy "bad taste" with the whole, car explosion, rocket launcher, and endless amount of people being gunned down, yet the finale lacks any over the top humour, or style like "bad taste".<br /><br />if you like watching really bad gore films, or are interested in no-budget film making, watch it, otherwise stay away.
