this isn't one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology, or being dated, issues that only the dorkiest people could relate with, but rather a review on the story telling, which most of us are truly interested in.<br /><br />the plot is about a combination of wwii allied and german navy members, and two civilians (the hero and heroine), who are thrust together on a german u boat and wind up in a savage land of dinosaurs.<br /><br />the manipulations aren't so bad by film standards, and we know from the plot that realism isn't going to be high. what films like this need are credible and likable characters, along with some semblance of reason in the actions.<br /><br />this film lacks both. for a full length film, only 6 characters are given any time, and 3 of them are barely looked into. mcclure's hero is beyond "routine", and doesn't make much sense in any era.<br /><br />the female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of dinosaurs they entered, but the riddle is not much of a riddle, and we could care less.<br /><br />a lot of failure in a film that should have been better, even for its time.
