i have to say i am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie. i found it to be absolutely idiotic. the mother gets "visions" when she touches certain things or people? and one thing she touched twice made her vision continue... just seemed so ridiculous. deedee pfieffer's performance was awful i thought. she was very irritating. the girl who played lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with.<br /><br />i usually love lmn and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.
