a family with dad louis (dale midkiff), mom rachel (denise crosby), 10 year old eileen (blaze berdalh and about 3 year old gage (miko hughes) move to this beautiful house in maine--seemingly unaware of the semis that roar down the highway in front of their house every 90 seconds or so! the neighbor across the way (the wonderful fred gwynne) makes them feel at home...and shows them a pet cemetery where children bury their pets. but a little further on is a sacred ground which can bring the dead back to life...but the dead come back in a nasty mood.<br /><br />""definite spoilers** the novel by stephen king was good--it was long but it developed characters and situations that made you care what happened. this movie jettisons all the character development and just plays up the gore and violence. animals are killed on camera (i know it's faked but it's still repulsive); a little boy is hit by a semi and his casket pops open during the funeral (in a totally sick scene); he's brought back to life and attacks and kills people including his mom (i do wonder how a 3 year old was able to hang her); a ghostly jogger (don't ask) tries to help the family for no reason...the movie just works the audience over shoving every gruesome death or violence into your face. it just goes out of its way to shock you. **end spoilers**<br /><br />acting is no help. midkiff is just dreadful as the father--he's handsome and buff but totally blank. crosby isn't much better. the two kids are just annoying. only gwynne single-handedly saves this picture with his effortless good acting. <br /><br />this picture shows a total contempt for the audience taking large leaps in logic and having characters do incredibly stupid things (especially midkiff at the end). this movie was (inexplicably) a huge box office hit in 1989 which led to the even worse sequel in 1992. i saw it in a theatre back then and was disturbed how the audience kept cheering on the violence and was just appalled by what i saw. a sick repulsive horror film. a 1 all the way.<br /><br />when you think it's all over and can't get worse the ramones sing a title song!!!!!! ("i don't wanna be buried in a pet cemetery"). truly beyond belief.
