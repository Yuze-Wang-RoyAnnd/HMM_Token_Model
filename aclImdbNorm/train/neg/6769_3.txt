a failure. the movie was just not good. it has humor that 5 year olds that will not even giggle at. i mean, sure, some parts were amusing, but most of it is not. lindsey lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer,) and she should be working on better movies. the movie should have been aired as a disney channel original movie, that is free.<br /><br />the only thing that was well done about this movie was the music. nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to brighten up your day. these songs are so good. especially alyson and amanda's walking on sunshine and caleigh peter's, beach boy song, fun fun fun.<br /><br />4 out of 10. if i gave it a ten, 9 of that would be the music and 1 will be the movie. not worth your money, but the soundtrack is.
