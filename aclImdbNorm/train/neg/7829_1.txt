the beginning of the 90s brought many "quirky" and "off-beat" independent films, a particular sub-genre of which is the semi-spiritual desert crime movie. others of note are "wild at heart", "from dusk til dawn", and to a certain extent "natural born killers". good films like those spawned junk like "highway 666", "destiny turns on the radio" and this ineptly surreal anti-masterpiece "under the hula moon". it's a comedy that aims for a certain emotional tone, attains it, but keeps going to the point of irritation. while the pursuit across the spirit-world of the desert and the casting of chris penn are good ideas, the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime movie, and isn't focused enough on laughs to really be a comedy. i won't blow the ending, but let's just say it's bad. the film is basically a bad side effect of genre-cancer. this is the dregs of indie-mania.
