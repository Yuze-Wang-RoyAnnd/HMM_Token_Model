i saw this film last night (about 102 minutes) and don't know what kept me in my seat. i guess i just expected a film with gere would have some value in it eventually but nothing of value ever came on the screen. the story is a silly excuse to pile on shot after shot of bondage and torture. there is not a character in the film that does anything like real life. the cutting "style" relies on jump cuts, mini flashbacks and overprinting to give weight to this vapid setup of a gang of sadists apparently running free for years and surprise the leader is the "victim" of an executed killer. i don't see how gere, a buddhist, got involved in this violent, sexist trash.
