well, i like to be honest with all the audiences that i bought it because of kira's sex scenes, but unfortunately i did not see much of them. all sex scenes were short and done in haphazard manner along with all the weird and corny background music just like all other b movies - it just doesn't look much like two people having sex. there is a tiny bit of plot toward the end - kira's new lover is a killer. whoa!!! how shocking!!! why don't we nominate this movie for oscar award? i can't imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were r-rated (mine is imported from uk, rated 18). conclusion? put it down and walk away, so yon won't end up with being a moron like me.<br /><br />score: 2/10
