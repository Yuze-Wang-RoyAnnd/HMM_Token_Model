...and ethel merman buffs, too, will love her loud, bossy vocals as the wicked witch mombi, but this cartoon sequel to "the wizard of oz" is bereft of real imagination, substituting fantasy and excitement with noisy action (and cheaply repeating its footage like a bad music video). little dorothy is whisked back to oz, which has gone to ruin, and meets old and new friends. the inelegant animation is stuck somewhere between the weakest walt disney and the less-inspired shows from hanna-barbera, however many of the songs are good, particularly dorothy's sweet lament "it's a far away land", superbly performed by liza minnelli. you can count on minnelli for energy, which is why the movie perks up whenever dorothy is around. much of it is unmemorable, and i'm not even sure baby-boomers will get a charge from it since it has been out of circulation for so long. as a curiosity item, just fair. ** from ****
