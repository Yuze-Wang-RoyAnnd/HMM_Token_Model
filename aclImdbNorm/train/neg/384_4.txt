i don't give much credence to aids conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized. in the early years of the aids epidemic, the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies. this was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi-monde of san francisco. the city, renowned for its beauty, has rarely appeared uglier than in this film. a sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scene.<br /><br />while the acting and plot can't be said to be well-done the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss. actually, i found the most interesting performance to be irit levi as a crusty and cynical jewish, lesbian (?) police detective. she's interesting, though not necessarily convincing.<br /><br />highlights: the film's use of the garishly tragic turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist, ron athey.
