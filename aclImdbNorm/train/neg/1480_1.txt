he pulled the guys guts out his butt! that's a spoof right?! no one really writes that it just happens like improv gone horribly wrong. i think any way. this movie must be a spoof because who would say they wrote that script otherwise. can anyone imagine the entire cast sitting around as the director and writers go over the storyboard.<br /><br />director says, "next our inbreed villain uses his 24 inch machete to disembowel our token creepy neighbor. get this, he is going to pull the guts out his bunghole"<br /><br />"brilliant!" the entire cast proclaims.<br /><br />no way can that happen, nobody writes that stupid! gotta be a spoof.<br /><br />i loved the part where the skinny introspective gal beats the inbreed freak to death with the cast iron skillet she finds on the floor of the cave. i wasn't sure the inbreed cannibal types bothered to cook much. maybe that explains why the skillet was lying on the floor in the dark at just the right time to kill the malformed hulk. seems ironic that after the freaky guy had bested martial arts expert porn queens and a couple out doors type jocks he falls so easily to the frying pan of a skinny defenseless girl next door. <br /><br />what the heck is that richard greco guy doing in this? did he fire his agent or something? <br /><br />can anyone explain the ending to me please because i didn't get it either? i can't quite figure why the nice hero girl wanted to kill the funny lady who was making her some tea. never mind i don't want to know.
