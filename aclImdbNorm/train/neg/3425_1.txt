i'm going to spend as much time on this review as the writers did on the script. this is easily the worst sequel ever made.<br /><br />they killed navin johnson. not only was mark blankfield's performance god-awful, so was everyone elses!! the physical comedy was forced, flat and predictable. the script seemed to have been written by mongoloid monkeys using the pen names ziggy steinberg and rocco urbisci. how the producers managed to squeeze out such vile cinematic excrement is beyond me. they even managed to make veteran actor ray walston look like a talent-less buffoon. director michael schultz should be ashamed of himself.<br /><br />i want the 96 minutes of my life i spent watching this befouled memory of a brilliant comedy back so i can try and convict everyone involved for this cinematic atrocity.
