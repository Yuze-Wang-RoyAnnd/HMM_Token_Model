how is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other better flemish movie "congo express (1986)"? there are also some characters in congo express put together without having really a relation to each other: jean, (de congolees), the workman, the two taxi-drivers, the street-singer, roger, guy, lucienne and gilbert. of course, tom barman is a star and luc gubbels wasn't. that should not be a reason to pardon the flaws in the script (if there is a script) of anyway the wind blows. the joke (the only one!) at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is taken from that great flemish movie "de witte (1934)" where de witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes. some accidents happen in the movie but there comes no explanation after. tom barman delivers us here a movie that is more like an experiment to watch at the television than a movie for the theatres. another missed chance for flemish cinema.
