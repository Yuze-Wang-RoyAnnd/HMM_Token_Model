this is possibly the worst film i've ever seen. the fact that it has a flimsy storyline is bad enough, that they've hooked it around the subject of football violence makes it 100 times worse.<br /><br />i had severe doubts about the premise of this film even before i started watching, but went into it open minded enough even to accept the way that the writers saw fit to introduce elijah wood's character matt into the hooligan scene.<br /><br />but the film throws up inaccuracy after inaccuracy, to the point that by the middle of the film each one makes you cringe harder than the time before.<br /><br />let's clear up a few things: hooligans don't tend to virtually smash up their own pub before a run-of-the-mill league game; they don't set out to kill each other; they don't only wear stone island (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not, do). they most certainly don't, when having taken exception to a new firm member, trot off to their rival firms territory for pie and mash. and i'd love to meet the hool who would go and grass on his firm's top boy to the rival firm. (although you can scratch what i said about setting to out kill each other if one does exist).<br /><br />don't get me wrong,i'm yet to see a film on the subject that doesn't contain some fantasy whims, but this is on a par with the firm for cluelessness.<br /><br />i found it ironical that wood's american nemesis is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user, when this is part and parcel of the british hooligan scene. the film chooses not to challenge wood's morals and instead steers clear of any of the firm using coke.<br /><br />i could go on, but i think i've made my point.<br /><br />as for the plot, it's highly unimaginative, and i'm sure if i hadn't spent the entire film bemoaning the points, and more, made above then i would have guessed what was going on sooner than i did. and believe me, i was well in front.<br /><br />i get the distinct impression this film is aimed at men, with the hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional issues that are raised.<br /><br />if i'm right, then the makers have failed completely. it's too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene, and i can't believe the kind of female who looks for emotive films would give a damn about any of the characters given their violent tendencies.<br /><br />are there any good points? maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but i'm rarely impressed by slow-mo action, certainly not when it's a fight as the point is a ruck is rousing enough anyway.<br /><br />there are some funny, if unrealistic moments. wood's trip to school did raise a smile for me. but a few mildly funny moments hardly make up for watching two hours of complete fabricated dross.<br /><br />if you're british avoid like the plague, if only not to further develop misconceptions of the scene if you're not in the know. if you're american, you may enjoy it, as it's clearly tailored to the market. but no one can deny the plot is flimsy, predictable and ultimately over the top.
