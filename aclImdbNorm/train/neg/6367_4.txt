this film has the look and feel of a student film project. yeah, there are some interesting (albeit gimmicky) edits and shots, but the end result was juvenile.<br /><br />the director didn't seem to be saying "look at this film." it seemed as if he were saying, "look at me! i'm a director!"<br /><br />thumbs down.
