inventor wayne szalinsky (rick moranis) is preparing to donate his problematic shrinking/expanding machine to the smithsonian institution as he and his wife diane (eve gordon) get ready for a long weekend away from their son adam (bug hall). wayne's brother gordon (stuart pankin), his wife patty (robin bartlett), and his kids jenny (allison mack) and mitch (jake richardson) volunteer to look after adam while his parents are away, but as luck would have it (and the title would lead you to expect), the grown-ups are accidentally zapped by wayne's shrinking ray. as the kids run amok, their miniaturized folks must contend with monstrously huge insects, wrinkles in the carpet that look like canyons, and other threats to them. this was bad, like most straight to video sequels are, honey, we shrunk ourselves was sort of laughable. i had to laugh at that movie "roach" stuart pankin and the party bullies were even more ridiculous, view at own risk!
