what a shame it is when a potentially captivating and refreshingly low-key story manages to latch onto your interest at the start and then gradually lets you down further and further until you're left scratching your mystified head by the time it reaches its overdone conclusion. unfortunately, this is what happened to me by the end of white noise.<br /><br />it wasn't michael keaton's fault; it was a pleasure to see him return as the star of a brand new movie once again, looking a bit wrinkled perhaps, but still managing to give a strong and sincere performance. as a man whose wife has recently died, he becomes obsessed with her wandering spirit in the afterlife (not a new idea), apparently getting contacted by her through that funky electrical fuzz business you see on your television screen when there's nothing being broadcast.<br /><br />the idea of spirits communicating via the airwaves is called evp (electronic voice phenomena) and there are a lot of people who actually believe in it for real, so i'm not going to make any comments about what i think of that, or them. let me just say that i'm all for suspension of disbelief when it comes to buying into fantastic films like this, but what i can't tolerate is not understanding what the hell was supposed to be taking place, which is about where i was left stranded when the credits finally began to roll. much static indeed.<br /><br />there are occasionally movies like this that have me completely baffled, but if a film fails to make itself clear for me, i tend to consider that to be the fault of the filmmaker, not my own (unless i watched it while i was too tired to focus or something). well, for white noise i was wide awake, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed -- so guess who's to blame?
