no wonder pamela springsteen gave up acting to become a full-time photographer; it's a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one. while this movie is not without its interesting elements (mullets from hell, etc.), it is outweighed by flaws. for one thing, angela, the murderous counselor, appears to be about the same age as the campers. having an older, more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film. and then you have the murder scenes. the budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly (no pun intended), although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is certainly original. but overall, there are a ton of movies out there that are scarier/more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching.
