the reasons to watch this knock off... err... tribute to a great movie called se7en: - it's on while your channel surfing and there's nothing else on. - someone pays you to watch it.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and pop in the dvd for se7en, rent it, download it on itunes, or put it in your netflix cue and skip the flock entirely. the flock the same story with with a few changes. furthermore the editing just wreaks of se7en and actually ends up taking you out of the story several times. the worst one is probably the fly over desert helicopter shots, with sounds of people people chattering over the radio, except there are no police helicopters flying overhead in this one.<br /><br />bottom line: i call it a blatant knock off. if you wanna be nice you can call it a tribute film, go ahead, but either way go watch se7en.
