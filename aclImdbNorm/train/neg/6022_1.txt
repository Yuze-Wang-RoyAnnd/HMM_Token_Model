i'm getting a little tired of people misusing god's name to perpetuate their own bigoted view on the world. well i don't dismiss the idea of armageddon, or the coming of the anti-christ, i do dismiss the idea that only certain people who live truly good lives(they seem to be mostly white christian children) will go to heaven, while the rest of us must suffer through a millenia of hell on earth, just because we weren't good enough. god may be a judge, but i don't think he is going to measure every level of goodness. give the creator some credit.
