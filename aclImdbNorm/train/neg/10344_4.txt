saw this film ran in the wee hours on tcm. several problems with the film were apparent from what i saw. first, the adults did not age when the children did for 10 years. several parts of the film had continuity problems & for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the 10 years passed. <br /><br />the copy i saw was missing about 20 minutes or so, at least a huge gap with black screen appeared. it is too bad, because even though the script left something to be desired, bergman & russell both did fine in the film in their roles. it is a shame the large chunk is missing, but what is here is watchable.<br /><br />i just wish it was all intact. the script makes little sense in that bergman's character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults? some of the time lines don't make sense either. there is a stock market crash that resembles 1929 but the kids grow up to fight in world war 1. all the acting by the support folks in this film is fine. just wonder what was in the 20 gap of film i could not see as it was missing.
