a blair witch-war movie that is as much of a letdown as bwitch was! the title says it all, save your money and your time and spend it on a good movie such as "once upon a time in america", "the shawshank redemption" or "enemy at the gates" (if you want to watch a great "war" movie) etc.<br /><br />this movie, if it were a baseball team and the major leagues were the pinnacle and single a was the rookies, then this movie was high school ball. it was filmed as if it were a high school drama club filming with their daddy's old camera. sure they went into a hostile area (to make a film) but i don't call that brave, around here we call that plain stupid! this is a pass all the way! now go watch it and then you tell me what you think.
