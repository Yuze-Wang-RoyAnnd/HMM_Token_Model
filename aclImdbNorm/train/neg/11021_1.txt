hallam foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of oedepus complex afterward.<br /><br />it is something like 95 minutes long but would be better in ten. there's like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops, and habits in a church tower like quasimodo (only he is much less sympathetic).<br /><br />there's a strange love story involved which doesn't have anything to do with anything. she happens to look like his mother, yes so what? we know he misses his mother, that's what the first ten minutes were about. they should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a o.k. short film. now it's a portrait of a character who doesn't change. he is a guy that stuff happens to. the only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job.<br /><br />there's this whole oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character. he paints his face, dresses in women's clothing and wears a dead badger on his head. a badger! you've got to see the ending! he returns to his home with the badger on his head (and it is shot like a tacky horror film) to kill his dad's new wife (which he had sex with in the beginning). and somehow they thought this wouldn't be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background. i've got to admit though, i'm kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose. it feels like this mackenzie director/guy/whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school. you are so smart! thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories! you really dug! what a wallraff! okay so now i realized this film is based on some random book, but anyway..<br /><br />photowise it is boring. a lot of talking heads. plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene, you know cold and warm etc.. why? maybe "hallam foe" is both a feature and a test film for color blind people. or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn't be enough to tell us that he feels lonely, so they increased blue so that we really get it.<br /><br />i'm not even gonna comment on the clich'e indie-oh-how-how-how-cute drawings they have made in the presentation. and all the "cute" sex stuff going on. this whole film is an independent clich'e. but i do recommend it. i laughed more than a few times. though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine.
