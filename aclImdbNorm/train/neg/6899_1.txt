ever wonder why pacific islanders seem to automatically assume the sense of humour of black americans? regardless of their ethnic origins? well this film will not provide any answers to this often pondered question - but it will provide an excellent case study.<br /><br />from its onset this film acts as a sort of "old school" for pacific island new zealanders, which immediately raises the question what exactly is the point of such a task. is it meant to perpetuate ingrained stereotypes of pacific island new zealanders? or is it intended to exploit this potential market? the story is weak, jokes humorless, and the ending is expected. this film has done nothing for new zealand cinema, as it is merely an appropriated romantic comedy that is devoid of any merit.
