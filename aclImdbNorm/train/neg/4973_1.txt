i stopped five minutes in when beowulf was given a double-shot, automatic crossbow with sights on it. not only do crossbows not have telescoping sights, but beowulf beat grendel in hand-to-hand combat. the terrible, wooden acting and eternal darkness that plagues all sci-fi original movies didn't help either. having only gotten a few minutes in before i felt my bile rise and decided to watch i love lucy reruns instead, that's really about all i have to say. but, you might as well just realize that it's a made-for-tv movie and skip it right there.<br /><br />a travesty.
