yet another film about a tortured self-centered, arrogant, unfeeling hateful, self-destructive lead character we are supposed to care about.<br /><br />don't get me wrong i am very open to all kinds of off the wall movies that have as the lead character a strongly self-destructive character. what i object to about this one is that there is so little background to this guy. why did this guy hate himself and the world? had the script dealt with this more they might have managed to elicit some sympathy for him. as it is he just comes off as an unpleasant hateful character, not tragic, just hateful.<br /><br />after taking great pains to make this guy as crazy and anti-social as possible and making his fate as dark as possible the writer then has the nerve to make a happy ending....<br /><br />this is not the worst film i have ever seen but it is in there putting up a good fight! man! don't waste your time.
