easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays, it has been seriously let down here. shoddy direction, stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy.<br /><br />in the town of verona, the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo (patrick rycart), a montague, falls in love with juliet (rebecca saire), a capulet. bloodshed soon erupts...<br /><br />the studio work, especially in daytime scenes, seriously stagnates the energy of the play. it's a story that, with it's energy, deserves to be shot outdoors. coupled with this the costumes are hideous, with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces. the stage fighting looks horrendous, with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging.<br /><br />patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo. he manages the character's intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland, often inexpressive eyes limit his range. it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo. rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet - she captures the character's naivet'e but a little more sassiness would have been welcome.<br /><br />the supporting roles don't fare much better. joseph o'connor's friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut. anthony andrews' mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera. he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result. alan rickman, underplaying his role, has virtually no presence as tybalt. he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years, but that isn't in evidence here. the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera. only micheal hordern, in probably his best role in this series, comes out of this with any dignity. his capulet is well-played and a joy to watch.<br /><br />see one of the other versions of this story instead.
