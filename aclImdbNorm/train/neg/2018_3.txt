don't get me wrong, this is a terrible, clich'ed film, but it is a delight for fans of olivia hussey - quite possibly the most intoxicating beauty ever to grace the silver screen. one poster stated that she was unpleasant to look at - i wonder what his ideal woman looks like - paris hil-slut? blockbuster should really establish a sub-genre to this type of film, as the fatal attraction plot has become a genre unto itself. when will blockbuster adopt the "adultry" section? it will fit in quite nicely between the drama and action sections, right? this film revolves around olivia hussey, who spends a night of passion with an unstable yacht owner who may have murdered his ex-wife, who looks remarkably like ms. hussey. this ne'er-do-well proceeds to stalk olivia and thus make her life a living-hell. i like olivia hussey, but i have no sympathy for characters in movies that cheat on their spouses, so i really wasn't rooting for olivia to make it out o this stinker alive.<br /><br />violence: $$ (there is a smattering of violence in the film. don murray and anthony john denison get involved in a fisticuffs when denison says that he will not stop seeing olivia, murray's wife, because she is just too good in bed. olivia also gets to handle a shooter and might get to squeeze off a round - i'll let you watch).<br /><br />nudity: $$ (olivia is the queen of brief nudity and supplies a little here. she has a love scene with anthony john denison and also has a shower scene - shot at a distance).<br /><br />story: $ (we've seen this plot before - a hundred times over, and oftentimes done much better. the true culprit, when trying to decipher why this film was a dud, is william riead. the man's dialogue is sophomoric and moronic. the man has no story-telling abilities and fails to build believable human reactions to the plot. these people, of the upper strata of society, talk like middle school kids - with a habit of sleeping during english class. i have placed riead on the never-to-be-viewed-again list).<br /><br />acting: $$$ (the acting wasn't "phoned-in" as the insiders say, but was hindered a great deal by riead's juvenile script. olivia hussey resorts to calling anthony jonh denison "weird" and "crazy" to his face when he begins to stalk her. hussey, who is still beautiful, delivers the best performance here but denison was equal to the task of portraying a demented, love-crazed stalker. don murray was basically just there - his character not fleshed out, and edward asner, a terrific actor when given something with substance, is ill-used in this film).
