i'm sorry but this is just awful. i have told people about this film and some of the bad acting that is in it and they almost don't believe me. there is nothing wrong with the idea, modern day japanese troops get pulled back in time to the days of busido warriors and with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything. when the troops first realise something strange is happening does every single person in the back of the transport need to say "hey my watch has stopped"? imagine lines like that being repeated 15+ times before they say anything else and you have the movie's lack of greatness in a nutshell.
