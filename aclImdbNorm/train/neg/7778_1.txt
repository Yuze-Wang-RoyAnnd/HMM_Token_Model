this has got to be the cheesiest, stupidest, most retarded monster film of all time. it's a complete joke that this even surfaced into theaters. this is sort of like watching the loch ness monster in rural america. this movie deserves to be thrown in a toilet and completely forgotten. john carradine, shame on you. the people involved in this moronic pile of trash need to be lobotomized. wait! maybe i'm giving them too much credit. i'm sure they were lobotomized before the filming. how else can one explain the utter and sheer stupidity that this bucket of crap contains. don't waste a minute of your life watching this. don't even waste your time sending a review.
