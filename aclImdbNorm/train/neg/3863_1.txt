wow. that's about as much as i can say right now. who writes this stuff? who produces this stuff? what self-respecting actor would agree to 'act' in this stuff? oh my god! i don't know how i made it through this movie, but i assume the fact that i had had like 8 cups of coffee that day was the key element in keeping me awake. good lord! it was one of the most droned-out and predictable pieces of cinematography i have ever witnessed...and for the record, i don't ever plan to 'witness' it again.<br /><br />i first saw the film when i bought the dvd (mistake #1). i mean...i figured, hey! julia stiles. i like her. she's cool. i'll watch it as soon as i get home (mistake #2). i tried to watch it without groaning every five minutes wondering when this bunch of crap would come to an end, really i did. but i was unsuccessful. it was one of the worst things i had ever seen. i mean...what is with that thing where he imagines what would happen then snaps back into real life? that was annoying enough when the father used to do that in 'parenthood' like ten years ago. the 'jokes' - and believe me, it takes a lot out of me to call them that - are stupid, the characters are trite and forgettable, the storyline is entirely predictable...altogether this makes for a movie that should be wiped from history records! i should have figured something was wrong when i realized that i'd never heard of this movie. it was most likely a straight-to-dvd.<br /><br />to anybody who may be thinking of watching this, i have one piece of advice. don't! for the love of god...don't!!! i'm ashamed to have it in my dvd collection, and i can't get rid of it...nobody, and i mean nobody wants to buy it from me! and i'm talking second-hand and third-hand thrift shops that would buy the mud off your shoes and stick it in the store window. that should let you know just how crap it is.
