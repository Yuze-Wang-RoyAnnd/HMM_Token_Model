warning! don't even consider watching this film in any form. it's not even worth downloading from the internet. every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid. the so-called filmmakers apparently have absolutely no idea how to make a film. they couldn't tell a good joke to save their lives. it's an insult to any human being. if you're looking for a fun-filled movie - go look somewhere else.<br /><br />let's hope this mr. unterwaldt (the "jr." being a good indication for his obvious inexperience and intellectual infancy) dies a slow/painful death and never makes a film again.<br /><br />in fact, it's even a waste of time to write anything about this crap, that's why i'll stop right now and rather watch a good film.
