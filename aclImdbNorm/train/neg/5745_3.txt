this film was the recipient of the 1990 academy award for best animated short film. over the last few weeks, i have seen dozens of the nominees and recipients of this award from the last 30 years and i really think that this film might just be the worst of them all--yet it wasn't just a nominee but it won!! i assume that 1989 must have just been a horrible year for the genre.<br /><br />the film shows a group of characters that look a bit like super-skinny uncle festers. the appear to be simple articulated figures who are moved using stop motion animation. all are identical--with the same faces, bodies and clothes. the only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs. they are all standing on a large platform that is suspended, as if by magic, in space. each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform. the platform begins tilting slightly and in response the men move about in an effort to balance the platform. this goes on and on and on and on for the longest time. the only relief from this tedium is when one of them acts rather nasty towards the end, but it just isn't enough to make this fun to watch in the least. aside from passable stop motion animation, this short offers nothing of interest to me....nothing.<br /><br />by the way, the great short knick knack also came out in 1989 and i have no idea why it was not among the nominees. it was a great short and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the year before. perhaps pixar's success in previous years resulted in a bias against them, but knick knack is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it. could pixar have not entered it? this seems unlikely.
