this movie isn't worth the film it was photographed on. the dialog is flat, filled with clich'e overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time. the choppy, shaky, film style is a cheap imitation of the "the ring" style visual effects. the characters do not even act like a normal person would. for example, the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door, creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she doesn't even once call out her sister's name to see if she is home. what? you would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her. way too many flashbacks to her childhood. too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director. it is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street, up the driveway, around this corner, over here, over there, oh a side view, now a front view. enough already. you would think you are watching a tv commercial for the solaris! terrible movie. 0 out of 100. i really pity anybody who spent money making this film or to watch it.
