i bought this (it was only $3, ok?) under the title "grey matter". the novelty of seeing sherriff roscoe in a non-dukesofhazzard role intrigued me. as the other reviewers warned, it's a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awry.<br /><br />and yes, there are plenty of establishing shots, especially of a house with a pool in front of it. some of the characters and interiors are so nondescript i guess the filmmakers worried we might forget who is who, so they keep tipping us off by first showing the outside of the buildings. it's actually kinda funny. after awhile the pool shot feels like a tv channel's station identification logo, reminding us that we are watching "grey matter".<br /><br />i also enjoyed two bouts of name-calling. at one point an angry test subject taunts somebody in charge by calling her a "scientific b*tch!". it's just a very inadequate insult. several scenes later a different subject lets off steam by muttering about that "scientific b**tard!". it just sounded very awkward to me.<br /><br />someday this movie will disappear forever. another decade from now it will likely be impossible to find any copies of it. almost like it never happened.<br /><br />
