ariauna albright is a really good actress but why she participated in this lame written travesty is a mystery. what could have been entertaining winds up as classic boredom. the unique thing about ariauna is that she can act as well as look real sexy as opposed to her partner lilith stabs who looks fine but it is obvious she spent the money for acting school at the spa or beautician. this was a production that cried out for some t & a & with a imaginative script writer could have achieved it in the flow of things. however ariauna does what she can under the circumstances & to a extent salvages her reputation. the tempe company should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms the viewers will expect some fetish play & t & a. nough said.
