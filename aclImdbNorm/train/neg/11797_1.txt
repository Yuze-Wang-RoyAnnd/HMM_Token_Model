watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 bucks for rental in my life. if nothing catastrophic happens before i die, this will be the biggest regret of my life. who ever even thought about this movie, or financed deserves a kick between the legs, because that's where they were thinking when they made this movie. it's about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic, and writes pretentious drivel that tries to pass off as poetry. he joins his amorous friend in a trip to the coast. where they meet girls and such. only the fat guy doesn't get a girl. skin flicks don't annoy me, i take 'em for face value. but this movie tries to be more than a skin flick. it's about fat guy looking for love in some girl, but then meets another bikini silicone girl that enjoys his poetry. he finds his talent for volleyball which gets money for his family and impresses the ladies, only he has his lady anyways. the dialogue is super-horrible for even a c movie. it supports a ton of black stereotypes, no character development, it's a glorified porno movie, without any porn in it. never ever watch this movie.
