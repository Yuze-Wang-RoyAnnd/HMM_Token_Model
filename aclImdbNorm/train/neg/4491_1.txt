1/10 and that's only because i don't go lower with my ratings.<br /><br />skip this "movie" and wait for the last movie of the "trilogy", don't buy or rent it. trust me you won't be missing a thing. the architect brings no new info: _(spoiler)_ there have been more neo's before him, he's like nr.6 or something. you could already figure something like that out from the first movie: agent smith telling us the first matrix created didn't work because it was too perfect. trinity died and neo's "love" brought her back, where have i seen this before ? oh right in the first movie the roles where reversed ! same as the action-scenes nothing new just with more opponents. the action-scene (the 20+ ships) in the big battle which we didn't see (maybe in revolutions ?), betrayed by someone (hmmmm, maybe the guy holding the knife who wanted to stab neo?!) who pushed the egm-button to soon.<br /><br />all in all a shameless ploy to make money (especially off the guys who went to see it more then once), which evidently worked like a charm.
