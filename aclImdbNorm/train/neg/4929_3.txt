the spoilers in this review are offered as a public service, because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our protagonist, the lady barbara skelton, gets raped and gunned down in the end. and not a moment too soon. i'd have shot the screen myself but i was afraid i'd hit james mason.<br /><br />the original 1943 novel, called "the life and death of the wicked lady skelton" (i guess people didn't whine about spoilers back then), was written by a woman, an english navy brat who was either troubled or cynical or both. her heroine is devastatingly beautiful, and the author seems to think that if you have beauty, nothing else matters. but other things do matter, such as the fact that lady barbara's immediate and only response when someone gets in her way is homicide. she murders three men in five attempts. a serial femme fatale, she's got a case of dissocial personality disorder that should have landed her in either bedlam or newgate. <br /><br />lockwood plays her as a narcissistic vamp, wearing so much makeup that i thought of her as a restoration-era joan rivers (or a restoration-era joan rivers, ha!). yet lady b. is irresistible to all three principal male characters-- michael rennie, james mason, and griffith jones, all of whom do good work, as does patricia roc. of course, all three admirers realize in short order what a psychotic bitch barbara is, but the plot keeps them all in her orbit until one of them finally does gun her down - accidentally, in what is meant to be either irony or just desserts. given the dramatic death scene with a boom lifting the camera out through the windows and heavenward, i presume we're meant to give a damn about her death. but hers is the first corpse we don't care about.
