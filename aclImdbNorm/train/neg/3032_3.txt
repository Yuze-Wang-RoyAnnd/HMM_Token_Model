someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date. i have since discredited everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie. it's just terrible. without going into lengthy descriptions of the various scenes, take my word for it, the sex scenes are uninteresting at best. jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning was the highlight of the film (she does look good) but it's all downhill from there.
