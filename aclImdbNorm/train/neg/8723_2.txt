very bad film. very, very, very bad film. it's a rarity, but it defenitly is not worth hunting down. this italian jaws rip-off makes little sense most of the time, and no sense the rest. the "alligator" is not at all convincing, and many of the sub-plots go nowhere. if it's at the local video store, you may want to watch it if you're a fan of monster movies, but it's not worth hunting down.
