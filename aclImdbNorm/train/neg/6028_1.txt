i am a christian... and i feel this movie is awful.<br /><br />nobody but hard-core, bible-belt christians are going to like this movie. the message is just too in your face. if you want to touch a wider audience, you have to be way more subtle. you can't have the dad waving the bible around and carrying it with him in every scene. ridiculous! <br /><br />poor direction. the reveal of people missing should have been terrifying, but it was laughable. they leave their clothes on the ground? it reminded me of old ed wood movies: "oh my god! people are missing!" that scene in the plane is just stupid. think about it: if you found your relative's clothes next to you, you wouldn't just scream "oh my god. they disappeared! they're missing!" and start crying and yelling. you would first be in denial... you just wouldn't jump to that conclusion. watch jodie foster in flightplan. my favorite shot is the dog sitting out on the lawn with a pile of clothes and boots sitting next to him. i about fell off the couch i was laughing so hard.<br /><br />the music was so bad and so distracting. it was as if the composer was in his own world scoring his own movies. "here's my chance to do a thriller", "here's my chance to do action!" stop telling me how to feel james covell! a good score supports what's happening on the screen... this movie needed more of an under score, but instead it was as much in your face as the message was.<br /><br />the writing was bland. so was captain christian kirk cameron. chelsea was the worse: "you don't understand! people are missing!". brad johnson was laughable. the two stand out performances came from the anti-christ and the older guy (sorry, can't remember their names) in watching the "making of" (to answer my question of "what were they thinking???"), the producers and filmmakers and actors are just deluding themselves... saying "we're gonna reach wide audiences" and "brad johnson is amazing" and "this is just like a hollywood movie". i came to the conclusion that they just don't know what the "heck" they are doing.<br /><br />i commend the effort. getting the message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea. film is the best medium possible to do that. look at movies like wide awake, signs, contact, passion of christ, even o'brother, where art thou? the bottom line is that the film needed to be made by people who have talent and vision. unfortunately, it was not.
