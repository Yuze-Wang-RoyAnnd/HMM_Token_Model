i don't really post comments, but wanted to make sure to warn people off this film. it's an unfinished student film with no redeeming features whatsoever. on a technical level, it's completely amateur - constant unintentional jump edits within scenes, dubbing wildly off, etc. the plot is completely clich'ed, the structure is laughable, and the acting is embarrassing. i don't want to be too harsh: i've made my share of student films, and they were all awful, but there's no reason for this film to be out in the world where innocent fans will have to see it.<br /><br />safe assumption that - much like the cast - positive comments are filmmakers, friends, and family.
