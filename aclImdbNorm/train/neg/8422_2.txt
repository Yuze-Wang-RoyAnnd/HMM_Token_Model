before i begin, i want to briefly say that this movie in and of itself is very well made and well acted by all involved, including whittaker, who indeed deserves his nomination. it is highly entertaining, and . . . taken in the right context as a work of fiction, it is a very good movie. for that, i give it the two stars.<br /><br />however, rather than wasting your time with what you can read a hundred times elsewhere, i want instead to point out the absolute fictional nature of this film and how dangerous it is to sell people a work of fiction as if it is truth. i stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character, dr. nicholas garrigan, is a complete invention of fiction. rather, it presents this character into a real historical setting, and allows the uninformed viewer to assume he was in fact real, and what they are seeing is the truth. i have no problem with the blending of fact and fiction - but to do so in such a dishonest matter is, in a word, reprehensible.<br /><br />there can be no doubt that africa, along with most third world countries is rife with human misery and suffering. hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film. but hollywood also has its eye toward making money. the only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the west is to either experience it for yourself, or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary.<br /><br />but these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much. at the end of the day, they become less about presenting the facts for the viewer to decide for himself, and more about leading you from image to image and hitting you over the head screaming, "see, we told you it was bad!" the seminal example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the dvd after sitting through the movie. arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of kay amin, idi's second wife, whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity. in the film, we see that her limbs have been severed and reattached in reverse (arms for legs and vice-versa). this is the director making sure you understand that amin is, as the gungans say, bom-bad! but watching the documentary, we learn that this is in fact nothing more than a myth, which the sitting minister of health at the time himself tells us is not true.<br /><br />so . . . what . . . they just make up these things? why? because hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence, that's why! they don't trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves. look, that she was murdered and dismembered is in itself enough for us to conclude that amin was not the likable guy he portrayed to the media - we don't need this texas chainsaw massacre inspired imagery to reinforce that! and this is just the tip of the iceberg. what is also not explained to the casual viewer is that lead character garrigan is himself fictional. there was no young scottish doctor taken under amin's wing. as such, garrigan is clearly present only for the sake of helping us dumb westerners understand the african world. the producers seem to thing we won't be interested in a film about africa unless there is a white face in it. (ironically, even the titular character is portrayed by an american black actor!) the problem with this is that the movie is no longer an expose of amin and his regime, but instead an exploitative thriller about a white westerner coming to africa for all the wrong reasons, making several horrible mistakes, and then "redeeming" himself, even at the cost of three other innocent lives. honestly, i have to say it is nearly reprehensible to suggest that the real tragic death of mrs. amin was the result of a tryst with a fictional scottish doctor - it almost seems to become a morbid joke for the sake of entertainment! i really wish hollywood would stop jerking us around for our money. i first realized its propensity to do this with the woefully manipulative a beautiful mind, ron howard and akiva goldsman's sugary-sweet adaptation of the life of john nash, which deleted the darker side of the man to present only the tortured hero that america just can't get enough of. the sad truth is that hollywood has been selling us these fakes for years, and viewers, who are predictably and understandably too lazy or uncaring to investigate for themselves, buy these fake portraits hook, line, and sinker.<br /><br />look, i'm certainly not suggesting amin is being turned into a villain he wasn't. my point is, with the truth being so shocking enough to convince us of the brutality of the man, why must hollywood then go to such fictional lengths? why must hollywood continue to insult us by holding our hands through these films? why can they not trust us to think for ourselves!? can we not just put the honest portrayals on screen and let the audience decide for themselves? i urge all who continue to watch hollywood's purportedly "true" movies to do yourself the favor of always investigating for yourself, and to never assume that what is on screen is even close to the truth!
