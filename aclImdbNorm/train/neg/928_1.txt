this movie is so awful, it is hard to find the right words to describe it!<br /><br />at first the story is so ridiculous.a narrow-minded human can write a better plot! the actors are boring and untalented, perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy film.<br /><br />the camera receptions of the national forest are the only good in this whole movie. i should feel ashame, because i paid for this lousy picture.<br /><br />hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline :-)
