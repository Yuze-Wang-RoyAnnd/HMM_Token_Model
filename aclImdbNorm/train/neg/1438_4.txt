well! what can one say? firstly, this adaptation is far too long at 4 hours, for the complexity (or lack of such) of the plot. the actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available. swayzee is really not a quatermain character at all. after seeing sean connery's interpretation of the great man in "the league of extraordinary gentlemen", swayzee really does not make the grade. this chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength, stature, subtlety, or humour needed for the part, and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor, who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast. some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography. for example. when the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert, their tracks are visible down to the oasis, just waiting for them to walk in them. climbing out of the mine leads to an exit (on the next shot) nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through, et cetera. i was waiting for doug mcclure to appear at any moment. in some ways i wish he had. <br /><br />the leader of the russians pursuing quatermain is a shoddily created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything. <br /><br />swayzee does quite well as the sad father, returned to london, who is unable to obtain the custody of his son. swayzee should stick to that sort of thing. he is not able to carry the part of a courageous gentleman with a stout heart, experience of life, and sense of fair play.<br /><br />4 out of 10. barely
