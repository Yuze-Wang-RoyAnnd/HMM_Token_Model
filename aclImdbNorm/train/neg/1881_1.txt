this movie sucks ass. something about a heatwave in some european country, complete trash. there's nothing going for this movie whatsoever. maybe 30 seconds of sex but that's it. there is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off. this movie is complete rash and you shouldn't subject yourself to watching it. i regret it it's very boring. i would rate it zero but i can't. no body in their right mind should see this. i'm sure you'll regret it completely i did. how could they think up something this bad. even mystery men was better. mystery men. that sucks. that movie wasn't worth being made. complete waste of time. the characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored.
