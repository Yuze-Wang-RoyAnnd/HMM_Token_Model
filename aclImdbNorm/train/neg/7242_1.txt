the pallbearer is a disappointment and at times extremely boring with a love story that just doesn't work partly with the casting of gwyneth paltrow (julie). gwyneth paltrow walks through the entire film with a confused look on her face and its hard to tell what david schwimmer even sees in her.<br /><br />however the pallbearer at times is funny particularly the church scene and the group scenes with his friends are a laugh but that's basically it. watch the pallbearer for those scenes only and fast forward the rest. trust me you aren't missing much.
