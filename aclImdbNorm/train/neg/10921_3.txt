i make a point out of watching bad movies frequently, and the sci-fi channel original movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find. as such, i'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when i saw sands of oblivion. the acting was uncharacteristically sub-par, as opposed to the woefully disgraceful display sci-fi usually has in store for us. there are a few cameos made by people you'd most likely recognize, although you may not know their names by heart. the cgi special effects are minimal, and as such, one of the largest sources of comedy in a sci-fi feature is lacking. sure, there are some funny moments like when a guy gets beheaded by a bulldozer, or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save a girl he's known for a couple of days, but overall, it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter, and i consider that a major disappointment.<br /><br />if i was rating it on a 10 star scale made specifically to judge made-for tv movies, i'd probably give it a 4, maybe even a 5. a real shame that i may have to wait 'till the next sci-fi original movie to get a good laugh, and i really hope that this movie isn't part of some overall quality increase in sci-fi original movies.
