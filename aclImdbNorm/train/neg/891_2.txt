having loved 'paris, je t'aime', i highly anticipated this film and i admit i went in with high expectations, but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons.<br /><br />although, i was not expecting a re-make of 'paris' in new york i was expecting the same structure. what i liked about 'paris' was the breakup of the neighborhoods. you got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell. in 'ny', there is no clear separation of the stories, at different points in the film, characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who i was watching and what exactly was going on. also, the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flow.<br /><br />another thing i loved about the 'paris' film was the different takes on love. it wasn't all romantic. there was love between parents and their children, unrequited love, a lonely, middle-aged woman yearning for love etc., it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans. 'ny' seemed to only go for an edgy, over-the-top sexuality. there were some redeemable shorts (the older couple having spent a lifetime together, julie christie's short), but overall the'ny' film didn't evoke any emotion for me. i didn't connect with any of the characters like i did with 'paris'. i remember watching 'paris' and feeling a deep sadness, loneliness, yearning, hopefulness, wonder... it just had so much soul. for me, there was no soul in the 'ny' film.<br /><br />maybe if i had gone into it without having 'paris' looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response, but as a self-titled re-take of 'paris, je t'aime' i was sorely disappointed.
