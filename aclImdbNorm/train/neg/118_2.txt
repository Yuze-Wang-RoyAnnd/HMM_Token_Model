this is said to be a personal film for peter bogdonavitch. he based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. these detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? this entire movie was written by peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. you're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. and leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. this is a curio for people who want to see dorothy stratten, who was murdered right after filming. but patti hanson, who would, in real life, marry keith richards, was also a model, like stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. in fact, stratten's part seemed forced; added. she doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. all in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. for the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. that's what happens when you're out of touch. you entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.
