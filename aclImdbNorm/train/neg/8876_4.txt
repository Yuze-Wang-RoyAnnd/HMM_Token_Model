sort of family parody blending "an officer and a gentleman", "heartbreak ridge", "full metal jacket" (and without doubt other movies i am not able to remember now) into a rather dull movie, with some bright spots. the gags are always there where you would expect them, and damon wayans's lines are, well, predictable. as i said, unfortunately this movie never surprises you...
