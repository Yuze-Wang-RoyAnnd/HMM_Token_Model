was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama? this film starts with a light-hearted banter between three women. fine. it moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man. fine. there are a few antics between them. fine. but when the plot thickens and finally becomes black i started to wonder whether i had misinterpreted the first part of the movie. it continues in this vein for a while until, in the end, it tries to go back to the original light-hearted banter. but by now it's too late. it's hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing. truly a lesson (for british filmmakers anyway) of how not to make films. difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work. and the box office proved it to be a real flop, because i'd never heard of this film until this weekend (four years after its release).
