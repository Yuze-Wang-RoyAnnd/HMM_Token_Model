i'd like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot(!) for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest, crappiest movie i've ever seen!<br /><br />i have no idea what's wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here (imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings)... the only thing i can imagine is that people must've voted during one or more conditions:<br /><br />1. while being shitfaced / stoned out of their minds 2. they've received hard cash for the votes 3. under gunpoint<br /><br />i can't believe i wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie.
