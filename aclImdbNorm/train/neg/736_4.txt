twenty years ago, the five years old boy michael hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later. on the present days, michael (gordon currie) invites his girlfriend peg (stacy grant) and his best friends chris (myc agnew), jennifer (emmanuelle vaugier), lisa ann (kelly benson), ned (brendon beiser), mitch maldive (phillip rhys) and trish (rachel hayward) to spend the halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm. he asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear, and together with his indian friend crow (byron chief moon), they would perform an ancient indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy morty (jon fedele) that would eliminate their fears forever. the greatest fear of michael is to become a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong and morty turns into his father, killing his friends.<br /><br />"the fear: resurrection" is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows, but in a messy screenplay full of clich'es. there are some exaggerated performances, like for example ms. betsy palmer; others very weak, but in general the acting is good. unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live; further, in spite of being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies. the low-pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation. in the very end, michael shows a charm that his father was interested that i have not noticed along the story. i do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the dvd released in brazil with 87 minutes running time. the special effects are very reasonable for a b-movie. my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil): "fear 2: uma noite de halloween" ("fear 2: one night of halloween")
