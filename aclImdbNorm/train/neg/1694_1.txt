this movie may seem scary on commercials, but the actual movie was a reason to vomit. this is a below below average, (even lower than that) and has no plot. i mean every house can make you feel scared and sure, a dead japanese woman would scare the poop out of you, but so what? make a movie that would appeal to watchers and not just show images of scared people and some hair (dead japanese woman). can you say "horrible rip-off of samara (the ring)"? don't get me started with the "dead child". not even that scary! so what? he has a cat and he can imitate it, big freaking deal! just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being harmed by the grudge! 1/10! yuck! >.<
