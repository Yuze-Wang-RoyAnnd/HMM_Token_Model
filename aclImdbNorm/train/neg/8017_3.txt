i haven't actually finished the film. you may say that in this case i have no right to review it, especially so negatively. but i do, only because i stopped it on account of i couldn't watch anymore...i got over halfway, and i only got there by promising myself something good was just around the corner. this film is so tiresome, so lackluster that i was actually insulted. i haven't read many of the other reviews, so i'm not sure if there are other homosexual teens who have suffered through it, but i am homosexual, and i did go through "similar" revelations, day dreams, issues etc etc. there were maybe two moments where i actually felt this film could go somewhere, where i felt it may have some inkling of meaning, or relativity, but these hopes were dashed the moment the next set of clich'e-ridden narration came on. i mean, just look at the quotes on the imdb page. unfortunately you're not able to hear the scratchy play back, nor the echo-ey fades if you're just read the quotes, because they are just too painful/ridiculous/stupid to miss. i did give the film three stars, and all three of those stars go to the films cinematographer who did a fantastic job attempting to transform archer's tired "concepts" into something watchable. mind you, i pray he wasn't the one who decided to include all the long shots of tv closeups...another unnecessary clich'e already over done in films such as korine's gummo... i think it is extremely fitting that this film premiered at sundance (only because archer had connections in the festival via volunteer work he did, by the way...) because sundance seems to be the one festival where clich'e heavy drivel like this is still accepted as "arthouse". no, it's not art house, i'm afraid it's just plain s**t-house. do not watch.
