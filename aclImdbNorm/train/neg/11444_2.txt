snl is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a short skit on snl is a little dumb minded. it's nothing like snl, it's just a stupid piece of crap.<br /><br />andy samberg tries to act like jon heder but fails. although jon heder is only funny in napoleon dynamite andy tries his hardest and people think he's funny.<br /><br />only funny people in the movie were danny mcbride and bill hader. the only part that was decently funny with andy was the pool part.<br /><br />they could have made the "quiet place" a lot better if they didn't make the falling scene 3 freaking minutes.<br /><br />the part where he's pronouncing his h's more is retarded. they try going with it too long and half the time it looks like andy is laughing while he acts...he's a horrible actor and doesn't deserve to be in a movie.<br /><br />this movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a 10 year old level of comedy. which is about half the united states.
