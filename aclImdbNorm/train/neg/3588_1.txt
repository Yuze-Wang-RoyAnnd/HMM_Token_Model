follow-up to 1973's "walking tall" continues the real-life drama surrounding tennessee sheriff buford pusser, but this installment plays like a lame tv-movie. bo svenson takes over the lead role from joe don baker, but he's much too mild for the part; he comes off like an ambling country singer with a bat instead of a guitar. good supporting actors like richard jaekel, luke askew and robert doqui end up with very little to do. i would give the film one-star strictly on its good intentions, but the screenplay is a transparent and lazy mass of routine predicaments and the production is cheapjack. followed in 1977 by "final chapter-walking tall" and in 1978 by the television film "a real american hero".
