director spike lee is famous for making films pointing out racism. in many of films, such "do the right thing," most of the white people are all brutal racists. in this movie, interracial marriage is the subject, with racism once again being the entire issue.<br /><br />what lee does, however, is once again demonstrate his bigotry against christianity. it's amazing the double standards that exist in the film world. if lee or anyone else ever produced this kind of bias against another group he would be vilified, but christians? hey, it's "open season" on them.<br /><br />ossie davis, a reverend in this film, shoots his son and then puts the smoldering gun down on top of his bible. they zoom in on that for another closeup just in case you missed it. hey, folks, here's another bible reader and look what he''s like! lee does this sort of thing in just about every movie he makes.<br /><br />he shows the same hatred when dealing with race relations. who could argue with portraying racism as an evil thing? however, lee perpetuates it in this film as he has in his other films. his obvious bitterness toward white people doesn't help the situation. it only adds fuel to the fire. <br /><br />hey, spike: start "doing the right thing" and leave your prejudices in the closet. better yet, "get over it."<br /><br />this is too bad because the subject matter could have made for a thought- provoking film if it had been done with objectivity and intelligence.
