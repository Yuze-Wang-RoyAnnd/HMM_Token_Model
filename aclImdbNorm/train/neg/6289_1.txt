this is the most cliche ridden and worst romantic comedy i have ever seen. every scene is cringe worthy and the two lead actors - corey and danny are soo annoying. corey is very dumb and naive and should have never listened to danny's false promises.<br /><br />neve campbell and the killer from urban legend are the only redeeming qualities in this poor attempt of a film. danny (dean paras) looks in his late thirties and the girl he's trying to bed - corey looks as if she's still in college.<br /><br />here in australia, this film is called too smooth; there is nothing smooth about this film at all. 1/10 avoid
