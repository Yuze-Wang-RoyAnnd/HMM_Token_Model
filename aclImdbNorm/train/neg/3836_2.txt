as one of the few commentators not to have seen the 1st film, i found this to be a very disappointing movie.<br /><br />yes, it has a funny awkward type of humour if you can bear the (highly) morally dubious premise. however, it fails abysmally in the important areas.<br /><br />there is thin and nonsensical plot line involving gordon sinclair's generous friend who may or may not be entwined in a conspiracy to supply dangerous electronics to third world countries - possibly in free computers ... or possibly not. vague, long-winded and inconclusive. the lack of any substantial ending is so infuriating and what is present is pompous and wholly illogical. the film feels half-finished.<br /><br />suspension of disbelief is extremely difficult when witnessing a very attractive female teacher (maria doyle kennedy) can be drawn to gordon sinclair's unimpressive character, especially when he fends off her advances. laughable. it worsens later in the film when he achieves his romantic ambitions then throws it all away for some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value.<br /><br />not many films leave me feeling cheated, but i felt my time was stolen.
