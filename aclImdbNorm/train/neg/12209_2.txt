years ago, when i was a poor teenager, my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay. and, while i would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to, i couldn't resist a free trip to the movies! that's how i came to see crap like the second conan movie and never say never again! now, despite this being a wretched movie, it is in places entertaining to watch--in a brain dead sort of way. and, technically the stunts and camera-work are good, so this elevates my rating all the way to a 2! so why is the movie so bad? well, unlike the first rambo movie, this one has virtually no plot, rambo himself only says about 3 words (other than grunts and yells), there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped "romance" and the movie is one giant (and stupid) special effect. and what stupifyingly awful special effects. while 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at rambo, none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow rambo shoots hits its mark! and, while the bad guys are using ak-47s, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes all rambo had is a bow and arrows with what seem like nuclear-powered tips!! the scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers! it was wonderfully parodied in uhf starring weird al. plus, hot shots, part deux also does a funny parody of the genre--not just this stupid scene.<br /><br />all-in-all, a movie so dumb and pointless, it's almost like self-parody!
