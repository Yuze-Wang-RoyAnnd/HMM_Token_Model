ronald colman won a best actor oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles, particularly as shakespeare's othello. critically-lauded george cukor film has a marvelous pedigree, having been written by the estimable team of ruth gordon and garson kanin. unfortunately, the witty banter comes off as self-conscious here, and the backstage business is overripe. mikl'os r'ozsa also won an oscar for his score, and shelley winters has a few fine moments a tough waitress (when theatrical colman breathlessly addresses her, she asks him, "what are ya? some kind of nut?"). otherwise, this scenario is awfully obvious, surprisingly draggy, and not very funny. *1/2 from ****
