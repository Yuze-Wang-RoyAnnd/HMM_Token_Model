visually speaking, this film is stunning. it has some delightful black comedic moments. but on the whole, the plot is very clich'ed, as is its seeming message. if you're a fan of over-the-top violence in mainstream movies like hostel or saw, you'll love it. if you're looking for something at all high-brow, steer away. i saw it as part of the edinburgh film festival 06, and i only chose it because i was looking for something disturbing. ultimately, it isn't disturbing. just grinding and unpleasant to sit through. if you genuinely want to be challenged, go see something like the lost. if you want to be grossed out, or tell your friends about a really messed up film, then this is for you.
