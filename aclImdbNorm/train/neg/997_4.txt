having just recently re-viewed "lipstick" for the first time in a few decades, i backed it with "descent" even though i have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine.<br /><br />it's interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the rape revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years, from the full-on gore of "i spit on your grave," to the tawdry sensationalism of "lipstick," to the tasteful handling of the issue in "the accused." but "descent," though making some important points, never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning. no, "descent" is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make --- a message that, when examined closely, isn't that groundbreaking.<br /><br />i pretty much knew the plot going in. what i wanted to see *was* the "descent" or degeneration of dawson's character. being a big fan of rosario's, i was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted...you know, the kind of portrayal deniro brings to "taxi driver." unfortunately, the script and the director/writer's choices don't provide any sort of believable transition.<br /><br />the biggest point of failure is the second act. it became obvious what the filmmaker's intentions were for this segment of club-hopping, drug use, and obsession with big black stallion adrian (every white boy's nightmare, natch) from a q&a on the dvd, but this excursion into dawson's character is never believably rendered. we don't know exactly what the hell she's doing half the time, what she's after, or why she's doing it. the poor quality of the audio/video again don't help, but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless. it destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well-done first act. by the time we get to the finale, our interest has already waned.<br /><br />one point of success that dawson does point out in the q&a is that by the end "revenge" scene we are pumped for retribution, then realize just how drawn-out and ugly the reality is. while that's certainly valid, it doesn't make the scene any more intriguing.<br /><br />if you have the dvd, check out the deleted "classroom" scene. this is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation (though all verbal) and really does show dawson's slow crack-up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor francie swift's prissy, condescending dorm counselor. if more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down, we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence.<br /><br />as the film stands in the final cut, though, all we get is what we've seen before, only in a more graphic rendering. so what?
