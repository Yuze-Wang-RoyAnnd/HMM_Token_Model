polyester was the very first john water's film i saw, and i have to say that it was also the "worst" movie i had seen up to that point.<br /><br />water's group of "talent" included several people who i am sure worked for food, and were willing to say the lines waters wrote. every thing about the movie is terrible, acting, camera, editing, and the story about a woman played by 300 lb transvestite divine was purely absurd.<br /><br />that said, i have to recommend this film because it is very funny, and you won't believe the crap that happens to poor francine. her son huffs solvents and stomps unsuspecting women's feet at the grocery store. her daughter is the sluttiest slut in town. her husband is a cackling a-hole of a pornographer who does everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate poor francine.<br /><br />francine's only friend is played by edith massey, possibly the worst actress ever. edith looks and sounds like she is reading the lines off a cue card and has never seen the script prior to filming.<br /><br />despite all of francine's travails, waters cooks up a fabulous hollywood ending and everyone (who survives) lives happily ever after.
