i foolishly read the back of the dvd cover of this movie in best buy about a year ago, and said to myself, "seems funny, plus it has michael clarke duncan, how can i lose!" i proceeded to pay $15.99 plus tax for it. i took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted. wooden performances abound. all the "hilarious" and "outstanding" performances promised never seemed to arrive. after 90 minutes i hung my head in shame, knowing that i could never get that 90 minutes or $15.99 back. i literally almost cried as well, because if that was what could be considered "comedy" i didn't want to believe in movies anymore. my friend and i constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was. over the holiday season this year i watched it with him because he didn't want to watch it alone. this was my next horrible mistake, because as i watched i just became angry. i began to yell at the movie, and i'm not one to talk to movies period. everyone i know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they've ever seen. my sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but that could not save this movie even. the fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on imdb is astounding. the fact that its rating (at the time of this writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
