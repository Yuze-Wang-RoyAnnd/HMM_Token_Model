this film should have never been made. honestly, i must admit that before i saw it i had some serious doubts. the director is not a great actress, though she did a lot of movies in holland, and the young woman who took the main part is a tv-personality with a constant smile on the face and not much self-criticism. the actor who played the other main part i recently saw in bride flight and although that film is better, he did not convince me than. to start with the the story, i have not read the novel it is based upon, but the script that underlays the film is something that might have been done with in mind kids having a birthday party on a rainy sunday afternoon, not someone of the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie. something really disturbing were the overdubbed dialogues, it was most of the time spoken out loud. my regards go to the cameraman, at least he tried to make something out of it. it is a pity that the film is edited lousy, if not, some scenes were certainly more credible.
