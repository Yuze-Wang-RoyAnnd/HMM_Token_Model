rachel, jo, hannah, tina, bradley and john are all on top form here. they deserve oscar nominations for their performances. i am a great fan of the tv show aswell. their music rocks and they're all so talented! i am also a great exponent of sarcasm!!!!!!<br /><br />if you're an s club fan do not read this!!!!!<br /><br />the performances are terribly weak, the dialogue is terrible and the jokes are not even executed properly (i feel sorry for the director). the jokes are so unbelievably bad that 8 little, passionate s club fans weren't laughing. they thought they could do it better. and they did. they conquered the world. they became s club juniors. paul, "the fat, ugly one who started a mosh band" must be thanking his lucky stars that he left when he did. one of the worst movies ever made. beware of this movie! do not go and see it! you won't laugh! you will cry! 0/10 rjt
