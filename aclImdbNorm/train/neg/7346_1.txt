i feel like i've just watched a snuff film....a beautifully acted, taut, engrossing and horrible thing! a two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, decapitation, incest, corruption, live burial, and abuse, abuse, abuse. no redemption whatsoever. and i was entertained. i couldn't stop watching. what does this say about me, about the people who make and act in this sort of thing, and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm. and i'm neither puritanical nor humorless, i don't try to hide from the existence of darkness, and i definitely have not led a sheltered life, but i am ashamed of myself. and i'm sorry to see my british cousins dragging the subject-matter sewers the way my own tribe does. it doesn't have to be cozy, but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism?
