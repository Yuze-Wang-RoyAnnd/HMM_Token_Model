is it just me or is that kid really annoying?<br /><br />hideos sister, spends most of her time running around after the disobedient little so and so. as for him, well, i know he's a kid n all, but his acting ability is about as wooden as a dead tree. so far i'm only half way through, and am fascinated by the story, but the people in it, let it down, i just hope it gets better by the end, as i can't not know what it's all about. although, some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a notebook, indicate everything is backwards, i.e. dog is god, live is evil etc... just seems a little obvious at the moment, yet nobody mentions its obvious meaning, (as yet anyway) if my opinion changes at the end of the movie, i'll update this post, but if your reading this, then well...... see above statement.
