let me start off by saying that this doesn't seem or feel like a movie. it seems like just another tv show about popular girls and boys with no real film language top back it up.<br /><br />the camera angles are so straight forward that the story is told the simplest way possible never making the public connect with it. this film takes us to where no movie i've seen has done before: to a realm where the film theater becomes a warm medium giving the public every element of interpretation. too obvious. the large movie screen is only used as an enlarged tv from where we can see every attribute of these women in a larger than life manner.<br /><br />lately it seems that young directors are compromising the art of film making for sales. this is very scary. the industry is spoiling the art in movies. we must educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language are really about. not just sales and entertainment, but a way to communicate feelings, passions and even culture. not as a launching platform for young divas and jocks.
