okay this is stupid,they say their not making another nightmare film,that this is the "last" one...and what do they do?they go on making another one,not that the next one (part7) was bad,but why do they play us. anyway this movie made no sense what-so ever,it was extremelly dull,the characters were highly one dimensional,freddy was another joker,which is very stupid for such a good series.the plot is very,very bad,and this is even worse than part 2 and 5. i didnt get the movie,its a stupid tale in 3-d,pointless!id say. i hated this film so much i still rmember all the parts i didnt like which was basically the whole film.this is so different than the prequels,it tries,and tries,but this one tried the hardest,and got slapped back on the face.again there were hadly any death scenes,although they were different,they sucked bigtime. how can they have gone this far?didnt they see they made the biggest mistakes at parts 2 and 5?yet they make this?its all bout the money,do not see this sad excuse for a nightmare series.<br /><br />i gave a nightmare on elm street six (6) 3 out of 10.<br /><br />good points of movie: had potential with plot.<br /><br />bad points of film: terrible acting/lack of deaths/too funny to be classified as horror/very confusing.
