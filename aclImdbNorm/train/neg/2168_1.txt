having read another review, i thought this movie would actually be good. i do enjoy the "b" movies, but this couldn't even be classed as such. the photography is probably the only half-way decent thing in the movie. but the editing left much to be desired. it was very choppy and staccato. whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job. the music was awful, specially anything atmospheric or scene setting. if the acting had been better, they could have pulled the movie off. unfortunately, i've seen better acting in porn flicks. if you want to see a "b" vampire movie, check out 'blood ties'. you'll be much more entertained.
