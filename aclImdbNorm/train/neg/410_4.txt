unfortunately, one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a lumbering, silly and equally pointless plot and an inadequate, clich'ed screenplay. hollow man is a rather useless film.<br /><br />practically everything seen here has been done to death - the characters, the idea and the action sequences (especially the lift shaft!) - with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects. however, it is just the same special effect done over and over again, and by the end of the film that has been done to death also. i was hoping before watching hollow man that the invisible man theme, which is hardly original in itself, would be the basis of something newer and more interesting. this is not so. it isn't long before the film turns into an overly-familiar blood bath and mass of ineffectual histrionics - the mound of clich'es piles up so fast that it's almost impressive.<br /><br />on top of all this, kevin bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best. good points might be a passable jerry goldsmith score (but no competition for his better efforts), a quite interesting use of thermal imagery and the special effects. i was tempted to give this film three out of ten, but the effects push hollow man's merit up one notch.<br /><br />4/10
