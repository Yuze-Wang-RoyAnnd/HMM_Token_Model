i couldn't wait to put this movie in my dvd player when i rented it. then after i started it, i couldn't wait to get it out of my dvd player. actually i watched all of the movie. my wife and i kept waiting and waiting for something funny to happen, but nothing funny ever does. the box read like the it would be really funny. the premise of the movie sound good. ben stiller is funny. jack black is funny. how could this movie miss? well....it does miss! this is the unfunniest "comedy" i have ever watched. nobody i have talked with thought it was even slightly funny. it is just a really lame movie. trust me. avoide it....avoide it!!
