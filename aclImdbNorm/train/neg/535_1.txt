some of these viewer comments are just ridiculous. not painful to watch with your significant other? i was apologizing to my boyfriend the entire movie. <br /><br />it was so slow and awfully strange. <br /><br />both redgraves,vanessa and natasha were unfit for this, especially with vanessa doing that ridiculous brash american accent. <br /><br />claire danes was the same wiggly-lipped awkward girl that she was in my so-called life. she has yet to push herself in any way. girl, find a new way to pretend to cry! <br /><br />meryl streep was one of the only redeeming part of this movie, she was on screen for five minutes, and i swear to god, she reached out of the movie screen and slapped me awake. <br /><br />oh! and hugh dancy, who gets better every time i see him. <br /><br />glenn close and eileen atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes. <br /><br />i mean, this was a well-shot movie, it was very pretty, the settings were interestingly dressed, providing relief for the intense boredom i was feeling. <br /><br />i don't know, it's just pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a cast comprised of "the greatest actresses of our time" sucks so much. it sure had more than a few noticeable editing errors, and the main character (ann) was a huge jerk. i was glad she died. but that's because i felt bad for lila, ann's friend -- mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy. <br /><br />ugh. bad job, evening the film. you weren't entertaining and you weren't even thought-provoking. i sure hope the book was better, so it didn't waste even more of people's time. 3/10
