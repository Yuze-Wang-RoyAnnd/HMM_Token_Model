yikes did this movie blow. the characters were weak, the plot weaker. i figured this couldn't be too bad because it has christoper walken, oops. he must have done this because he was bored and needed the money. the characters were supposed to be irish but noone had an irish accent. i am desperately trying to find something nice about this, i can't except walken did a fine job with a wooden character. find something to read, or watch discovery, don't ever see this movie.
