the writers probably had no experience in the army, and probably never glanced at a history book, but i still give this cheaply produced war film some credit for taking a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war.<br /><br />the action is confused and unbelievable--any episode of combat! has better production values, but the cast is interesting. seeing new york giant rosie greer was worth the buck i paid for this. the art direction is fifth rate--the men wear korean war uniforms, and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the u.s. army reached germany in 1944, not sunny as they show here, and i don't think the terrain resembled northern california. the script never does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers. there is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying springfield rifles instead of m-1s, which second rate troops probably would have been issued with.<br /><br />this basic story idea(racist southern officer commanding black troops) should have been expanded into a big budget production back then, and its not too late to try it now. you have to take this for what it is, and i admire the creators of this film for making the effort.<br /><br />i remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was set in italy, which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944.
