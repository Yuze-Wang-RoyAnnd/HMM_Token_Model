earlier today i got into an argument on why so many people complain about modern films in which i encountered a curious statement: "the character development in newer movies just isn't nearly as good or interesting as it used to be." depending on the film(s) in question, this can be attributed to a number of things, sometimes generic special effects and plot-driven hollywood garbage like war of the worlds, but in the case of over-the-top, uninteresting attempts at social commentary and a desperate struggle to put "art" back into cinema, it's movies like dog days that are to blame.<br /><br />i normally have a very high tolerance for movies, no matter how dull or pointless i find them (ranging from good, long ones like andrei rublev and dogville, to ones i've considered painful to sit through a la alpha dog and wild wild west). i shut this movie off 45 minutes in, which is 30 minutes more than i actually should have. i wasn't interested in any of the characters whatsoever and found nothing substantial beyond a thin veil of unfocused pessimism. in an attempt to say something about the dregs of society, this film too easily falls into being self-indulgent, trite, and exploitative in a very sincere sense. granted, i've seen many disturbing movies on the same subject, but there are so many better films out there about depressing, pathetic people (happiness, gummo, kids, salo, storytelling, irreversible) that actually contain characters of great emotional depth and personality. dog days had none more than an eighth grader's distaste for society, choosing to ignore any true intelligence about the way people actually are, and instead choosing to be a dull, awful, and hopelessly unoriginal attempt at a work of "art." this isn't a characterization of the unknown or a clever observation into the dregs of society, it's just boring and nothing worth caring about.
