yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre. still, i did not like this one at all. about a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie, she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life. crappy sex scenes to follow. why are they crappy, for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act. i mean we watch porn for the sex do we not. little girls blue also does things in an artistic way, but it is still very erotic and nice to look at. of course the girls in that one are very cute. here we have a rather unattractive lead actress and that does not help things. if you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vision that is going to make me enjoy the film. the sex scenes range from yuck to bizarre...i mean there is a snake in one of them people. so for me this movie just fails as it does not excite me at all, but rather turns me off.
