only children below the age of 12 should be allowed to see this film. the rest of us should take a book, mp3 player, or just take a nice nap to endure the experience of this event. this can be best summed up as a "blown-up" tv movie being distributed into theaters. children will want to see this film, and they will like and be amused by the movie.
