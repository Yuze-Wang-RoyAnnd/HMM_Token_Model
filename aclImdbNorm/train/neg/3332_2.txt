i purchased this movie at a car boot sale, so i was not expecting it to be a horror movie on the same level as a nightmare on elm street (1984) or the hills have eyes (1977) but i thought that it would still be fairly enjoyable to watch. however, it proved to be not at all enjoyable, but instead the acting and the general movie was mock-able, such as the ways the the 'unsees killer' murders his victims and how all of the people killed just happen to be young blonde women. it was a stereotypical horror film. i say this because of the following reasons:<br /><br />1) three blonde women in danger, the majority get killed. 2) one survives by crawling around in the dark while being chased by the killer. 3) surprise surprise, help arrives in the form of a shotgun!<br /><br />by using three simple points, i have saved you two odd hours by summarising this poor excuse of a horror movie, so you are now lucky enough to not have to watch it.
