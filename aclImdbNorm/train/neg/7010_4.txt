i know no one cares, but i do. this film is historic for one reason. it is the unity of two heroes from two great seventies sci-fi films. well, one is great, and one is quite bad. the great one is truly great, in fact it's the best. the bad one is truly bad, in fact it's the worst. of course of the great i refer to "star wars" and it's star mark hamill, aka "luke skywalker", who is the hero of this film about a kid who gets his vette swiped and then goes to vegas (on a lead) and after a whole lot of adventures, eventually recovers it. (since he's into fixing cars i guess you can call him "lube skywalker"). along the way he meets a hooker with a heart of gold, and ends up facing off with a character played by kim milford, the hero from the seventies sci-fi cult film "laserblast", which is, as i've hinted at earlier, the worst sci-fi film ever made. milford plays the lead baddie whom hamill must steal his car back from. i realize that no one cares about this meeting of two great sci-fi heroes, but i do. and i also must say that this is one of the best/worst movies of all time. mark hamill's acting needs the force, the plot needs extensive jedi training, and the character of the hooker played by annie potts just might be the most annoying character of all time, ever, in any film i've ever seen. but it's a fun movie to watch on a weekend day, or a weekday night, late at night, very late. it's one of those films that meanders, looking for something but without quite finding it and yet, at the same time, it's entire purpose is, like free-form jazz, to simply exist as is. and it does. and what is, isn't that great, but you can't say it isn't entertaining, because for an hour and a half you might feel ripped off, but you won't feel cheated. so turn off your mind, relax, and enjoy this muddled gem without any expectations, and may the force be with you, always.
