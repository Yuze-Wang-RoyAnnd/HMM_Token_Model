was it a thriller, as i thought when i saw the cover at the video library? no. was it a 'food fr thought' as the author was maybe trying to make it? not really. so what was it? it was a very average movie, that had great potential, and was nicely directed but let down by a confusing story without strong points, beginning middle and end, with poor acting expect from the serial killer guy, who although he seemed overzealous at some points delivered the best performance of the cast overall. it was nice cinematography, with good colours, cool hi-tec stuff, beautiful scenics but leaves you lost about where it's going and where it has just been. and with a feeling of let's just quickly wrap it up in the end. ok to watch if there's nothing else on tv.
