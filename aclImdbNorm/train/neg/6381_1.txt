this film is about a group of extra terrestrial gay black men exterminating females on earth, in order to create a gay universe.<br /><br />i watched it with the intent of seeing how bad it was. still, i was shocked at how bad it was. it looked more like a film made 50 years ago. the acting, if any, is ultra bad. the sets and props are so ridiculously fake, making any college film look mega budget. and the special effects are laughably simple, indeed jaw dropping as others have commented, but jaw droppingly embarrassing.<br /><br />one has to be severely intoxicated, or in an altered state of consciousness in order to appreciate this film. if i was from denmark, i would be severely embarrassed and humiliated that my countrymen produced such a horrifyingly bad film.
