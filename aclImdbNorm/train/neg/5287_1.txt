i have no idea why they made this version of "persuasion" when they already had that fine mini-series with amanda root and ciaran hinds. i suppose that they wanted to make a feature-length version, but of course a lot had to be deleted; alas, what ended up on the cutting-room floor was all the lovely wit and humour, leaving a film that was mere melodrama rather than an amusing exposition of english country manners and mores.<br /><br />also, the characters were shallow and uninteresting. they had poor anne chasing up and down the streets after captain wentworth like a silly modern adolescent (and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this, let me tell you: running after a male like a female in heat is not cool). that is something a well-bred woman of the napoleonic era would never have done, and certainly not this level-headed heroine.<br /><br />some have said they found this antic laughable; my reaction was not laughter, but outrage. the very idea of such a corruption of an austen work is beneath contempt.<br /><br />it was ghastly.
