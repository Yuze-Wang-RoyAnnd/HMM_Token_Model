take one look at the cover of this movie, and you know right away that you are not about to watch a landmark film. this is cheese filmmaking in every respect, but it does have its moments. despite the look of utter trash that the movie gives, the story is actually interesting at some points, although it is undeniably pulled along mainly by the cheerleading squads' shower scenes and sex scenes with numerous personality-free boyfriends. the acting is awful and the director did little more than point and shoot, which is why the extensive amount of nudity was needed to keep the audience's attention.<br /><br />in the nutty professor, a hopelessly geeky professor discovers a potion that can turn him into a cool and stylish womanizer, whereas in the invisible maniac, a mentally damaged professor discovers a potion that can make him invisible, allowing him to spy on (and kill, for some reason) his students. boring fodder. don't expect any kind of mental stimulation from this, and prepare yourself for shrill and enormously overdone maniacal laughter which gets real annoying real quick...
