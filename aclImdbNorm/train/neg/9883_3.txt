reasons to watch the movie:<br /><br />1) bo derek at 16 looks good and occasionally gets naked. she does a pretty good job playing an immature, insecure 16 year old beauty, in fact<br /><br />2) many shots of a pretty greek island<br /><br />but:<br /><br />1) peter hooten turns in the worst performance by an actor since brutus played caeser's friend in "roman senate proceedings of march 15." he delivers each and every line in a delightful baritone bellow. turn down the volume whenever he speaks. preferably all the way down<br /><br />2) bo's fantasies are sadly tame, especially by today's standards. a few turns in the bath and as a fully clothed model<br /><br />3) the plot is skimpier than bo's costumes
