i am a guy, who loves guy movies... i was looking forward to seeing a dragon fighting with the army with cool special effects. all of this happened, however, this movie was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />the story was standard, but the portrayal of the story was terrible. the scene transitions were the worst i have ever seen. why would you walk out to a beach to relax if your life was in danger? the serpent dragon's actions itself was very poorly written... and the serpent dragon's attack capabilities varied widely throughout the movie, several times the main characters should have died.<br /><br />the director attempted to infuse a love story in the middle of the movie during the most stressful times, this movie was obviously not watched after it was made, i love movies, but had to force myself to finish watching it, thank god i did not buy this, i borrowed it from a friend.<br /><br />do not buy this, do not rent it, just watch discovery channel... much more exciting.
