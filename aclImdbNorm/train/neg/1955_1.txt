this movie is so stupid it simply goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous. i wanted to watch "darkness falls" actually and thought that this was the movie. boy, what a mistake! i fast-forwarded as much as i could and still i couldn't get rid of the boring moments. i just envy the people who was paid to play in or work on this movie. they were actually given money for this crap. isn't that amazing? i mean in this movie a man gets killed and chopped in a wood-grinder to little bloody pieces and few minutes later the mother and the kid talk calmly at the table as nothing happened and drink coffee. please! come on! who gives money for such crap movies? oh, and the "tooth-fairy" was lame. not scary at all and was obvious that it is a bored stuntman wearing a badly made make-up.
