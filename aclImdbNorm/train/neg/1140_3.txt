scary, but mostly in the sense that will it be over before i turn 70. i saw this as a late night re-run in about 1976 and thought it would never end. like crackers, it's better than nothing (but just).<br /><br />ray milland is a little scary because he looks as if he's been stuffed by a taxidermist. yvette mimeux looks as if she's smoked up all the beautiful downtown burbank brown. <br /><br />it's a sort of roy rogers version of rosemary's baby. this is one turkey that should never have been made. if you have insomnia and it's 1:30 on saturday morning and there's nothing on but replays of the 1972 roller derby chamionship, then i guess it beats that. but god help you if this is your only choice for entertainment.
