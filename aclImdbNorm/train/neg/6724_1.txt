when you pick a movie i hope one factor you will consider, are the actors in the movie using their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way? this is not a political statement this is a moral issue that effects are society. when a comedian/actor makes curl sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father we should ask ourselves (do i want to support that behavior)? in this case mr. foxx behavior tears at the social fabric that teaches our youth right from wrong, good behavior from bad that loving-kindness is better than hatefulness. mr. foxx should remember he is only entertainment and there is a lot of that out there for us to choose from. saying sorry does not get him off the hook. it will not undue the hurt or remove the bad behavior he spreads to our youth. one way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. no longer see anything they are part of. we cannot change them but we can stop the fame we give them.
