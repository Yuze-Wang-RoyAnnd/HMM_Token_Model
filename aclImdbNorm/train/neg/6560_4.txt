"shadrach" was not my favorite type of movie. i found it overly sentimental and the acting was below par. harvey keitel and andie macdowell were good but some of the other actors weren't at all believable. i also did not believe that paul's parents would go away and leave him with the dabney family, especially when they had a housekeeper living in the home. their social classes were too far apart to consider this believable. it seemed the dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated. there was a scene in the beginning of the movie that showed andie macdowell getting out of a car after having sex with someone. who was it? her son? what was the scene supposed to show us? why was the scene even included? it had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and was in fact never alluded to again. it seemed gratuitous and not fitting into the story at all. there were too many inconsistencies in the movie for me. the story concerning shadrach was nice but i wasn't convinced that the dabneys would have been as kind and generous as they were portrayed.
