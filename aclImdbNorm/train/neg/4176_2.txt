perhaps i missed the meeting when the meaning of "b-movie" was explained, but what i just saw was ridiculous. you want a good synopsis of this movie? take aliens, replace the xenomorphs with vampires, then remove everything that was good about it, and that's pretty much it.<br /><br />5 minutes into the movie, the "v-san squad" (that's the dumbest acronym i've ever heard) checks out a "base" thats been massacred by vampires and then they climb down (down? what?) a ladder obviously attached to a billboard with an obvious present day train in the background. when is this supposed to take place? 2210. okay...(hold on, i'll get back to that)<br /><br />yeah. the characters. wow, well there's the token lesbian asian chick, the redneck cowboy wannabe, the weathered captain, the goth vampire/hot topic part-time cashier, and the wussy noob second in command. all of them are played by their respective actors with the same lack of ambition. it almost pained me to see micheal ironside in this flick. isn't he getting enough money being the voice of sam fisher in splinter cell? pretty much the only thing original about vampire wars is about how bad it is.<br /><br />watching this afterbirth of a film, the only amusement i got was from the feeble attempts at set-making. since when does taping pci computer cards on a wall count as a ready room on a starship? the money required to do this film could have been put to much more better use.
