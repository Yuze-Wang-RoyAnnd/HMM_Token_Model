the incredible melting man plays like an extended episode of the six million dollar man, but with violence and some nudity. i know this film is a bit crummy but i found it impossible not to kind of like it.<br /><br />the acting and script are not the best. but the effects are good for a 30 year old movie with a budget of $50 - the title character takes quite a while to actually melt but when he does it's reasonably impressive; we also have one inventive death scene involving electrocution. of note too is the music, it's insane - a cheese-tastic medley of nonsense.<br /><br />notable highlights: <br /><br />* marvel at the slow-motion nurse who jumps through a pane of glass for absolutely no reason whatsoever.<br /><br />* be amazed by a day in the life of a severed head.<br /><br />* beware of the psychotic cannibalistic melting humanoid. called steve.<br /><br />* be astonished when our hero takes a break from hunting the melting lunatic to have a bowl of soup and complain about insufficient crackers in the kitchen.<br /><br />this film is just too 70's for me to hate it. it's tacky and trashy but i thought it was a lot of fun. you could do a lot worse.
