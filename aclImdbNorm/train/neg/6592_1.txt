brief summary: this movie demeans everyone it touches. that means you.<br /><br />first off, let me say i'm not a purist, and this might have been funny for a few minutes. the impersonations are not bad. but overall it's just dull and excruciatingly not funny. a few simple jokes are repeated over and over again.<br /><br />it's clear that this movies only exists to squeeze the last few dollars out of the now-trademarked laurel and hardy. the producers cannot have any real regard for their place in film history, or their talents. this is what offended me the most.<br /><br />of course, my daughter liked it, so i'm also a failure as a parent ;)
