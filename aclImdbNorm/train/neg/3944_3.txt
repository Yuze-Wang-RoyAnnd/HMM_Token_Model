the film my name is modesty is based around an episode that takes up about one page in the 10th modesty blaise novel called night of the morningstar. it describes an incident in which the young modesty (17 in the book, mid twenties in the film)asserts her leadership in a war over a casino. as this is set before the actual blaise adventures her trusted sidekick willi garvin is not in the film. that is one of the main problems as the relationship between blaise and garvin was certainly always one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and the long running comic strip. the other problem is that the film is quite simply incredibly boring because it really is just one small episode blown up into a screenplay. the casting is okay but alexandra staden is not really convincing as the heroine and actually too old for the role to play the young modesty. i get the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution as not to lose the rights to the blaise franchise.
