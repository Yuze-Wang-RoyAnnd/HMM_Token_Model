i saw the movie late one night on cable and could not believe how bad it was. i usually enjoy bad movies, but this one was so revolting that it wasn't even entertaining. some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music which is constantly playing throughout the movie, the hideous special effects (when someone is shot with a laser gun they turn neon green and promptly disintegrate), and the disgusting acting. the acting, in fact, is what i feel steals the show. i didn't recognize any of the actors in the movie, and i hope that i never have to see any of them again. overall, i recommend renting this movie (if you can find it; i can't imagine a video store carrying this garbage) just so that you can learn to appreciate quality films after seeing this trash.
