the comparison is perhaps unfair, but inevitable. those attracted to the intimacy and depth of umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cut-and-paste musical in the american style - awkward, stilted dialogue with inexplicable song-and-dance numbers. gene kelly's french accent was apparently so poor, that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted (as you'll remember, the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in umbrellas). the translation of the french (for subtitled versions), as well, leaves something to be desired, although this can't be attributed to demy. the film also has several self-aware moments that come off a wee disconcerting, such as references in songs to legrand himself. and the costumes - well, the tight pants/white boots combination, and the freakishly unnatural colors, reminds one of an austin powers film . . .<br /><br />but demy does reward the viewer with allusions to umbrellas; note, for instance, the suitcase carried by maxence in his departure from rochefort - this is the same suitcase carried by guy in his departure from cherbourg. also, note the "convenient brunette of resolution" - madeleine in umbrellas, and josette in young girls.<br /><br />generally speaking, those expecting the natural feel of umbrellas (save the floating bicycle scene), or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in umbrella's script, should probably pass this one b y. those looking for a french version of a thin '60s american musical will be quite happy.
