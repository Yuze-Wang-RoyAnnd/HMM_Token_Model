i don't what that other review was talking about. this definitely isn't a bimbo movie, in fact, i don't think there was one decent looking girl in it. no, it's just cheesy, poorly-done, ed wood-style science fiction schlock. and it's bad. i can't even begin to tell you how bad it is. i saw it late at night on cable, and i was in shock. the fact that this movie was ever released is an insult to us all. the actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded, the special effects are a joke, and the pace is insanely slow. to me though, the music tops it all. a monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone. do not rent this thing, but if you ever see it on cable, watch it. you'll be amazed at how bad a movie can be.
