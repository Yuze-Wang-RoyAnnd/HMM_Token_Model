this movie is mostly chase scenes and special effects. it is very weak on plot. most of the computer talk was just mumbo-jumbo. i watched this because i was a big fan of the original war games movie which was based mostly on computer fact and real computer terminology. this movie had none of that. most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic of real computers and networks, but just lame. it is like it was written by somebody who has no comprehension of real computers.<br /><br />the ripley game was lame and was essentially just an arcade game. no real hacking, so what was the point? movie was boring. lame sequel.
