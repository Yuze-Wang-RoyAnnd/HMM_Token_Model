while it does crack the odd good joke, the humour is generally quite dry with members of the panel frequently pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokes.<br /><br />unlike what an other comment says i don't think this is the best rte have ever made, its really dry and sarcastic. sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud. people seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which aren't really that good. overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often it can be fairly mediocre. its not as good as jasper carrot or dave allens stuff. i find benny hill funnier.
