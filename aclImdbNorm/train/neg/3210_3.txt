there's really no way to beat around the bush in saying this, lady death: the motion picture just plain sucks. aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence, the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980's cartoon based on a line of action figures. the bad guy himself even talks like a skeletor wannabe, has the obligatory inept henchman, and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old saturday morning blackstar cartoon. just don't expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue. at other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai, yet there is no sex, no tentacle rape (thank goodness!) and very little sex appeal, this despite the physical appearance of the title character. there is simply no adult edge to this material, unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths. essentially, what we have here is a feature length episode of she-ra, princess of power, but with skimpier clothes and more gore.
