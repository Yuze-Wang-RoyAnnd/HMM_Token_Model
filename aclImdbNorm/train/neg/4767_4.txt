i watched this movie as i liked the plot, a group of strangers are held captive trying to figure out how they're connected.<br /><br />the setting and the premise were obviously influenced by the first (and best) saw movie & although there wasn't much action the story moved at a relatively good pace.<br /><br />there was comedy relief ion the form of the two bickering 'alpha males' and it was a welcome surprise (for me anyway)to see melissa joan hart hasn't given up on acting yet.<br /><br />a few things let it down for me personally; 1. the paedophile was way over characterised making him get turned on by everything from children to dead bodies.<br /><br />2. mjh's line about her cop ex 'getting her into this' when in reality, he was the least deserving person to be there, he hadn't knowingly contributed to the events leading up to their capture.<br /><br />3. the ending..... what sort of movie just ends in the middle of something going on? there was no resolution, no cliff hanger, no obvious end... it just ends.<br /><br />and for that alone i dropped two stars off my rating. the first 2 points i would let slide but not the end!
