spoilers will be in this. the movie could have been better if they had just had a different script, director, and cgi provider. not much right? the movie has a man starting his own theme park...err...zoo on a deserted island where people can see dinosaurs...err...sabretooths and it is called jurra...oops...primal park. i do not mind rip-offs, because there are no original ideas for these kind of movies, but this one just slaps you in the face with it, r e p e a t e d l y.there is even the "creature's shadowed head on the design" thing. the sabretooths, that are not sabretooths according to mr. primal park (just ancient killing cats), are rather junky but the crowning accomplishment is the one i call "sloggy". because, after disposing of one big cat, a hero is relaxing a little because there is only one left. enter the weird feeding guy who says, nah, we made three, the third being a monster who pulls itself around with its front feet. great, groovy. a group of college students are also on the island for a scavenger hunt, there test to get into their cliques frat or sort (always thought that needed a short nickname). out of the ones who do live, only one has completed their task, so i got a kick out of that. oh yeah, the mandatory "evil capitalist must die" clique is in force with not one, but two of them! mr. primal park's death is the most laughable thing you will see in one of these movies as a sabretooth statue's tooth jars loose (courtesy of sloggy), shrinks a few sizes, and impales the man through the throat. if i had only gotten away so easy. i like "sabretooth" better than this spin-off.
