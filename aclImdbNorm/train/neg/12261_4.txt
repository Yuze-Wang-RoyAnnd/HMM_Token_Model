standard "paint-by-numbers" monster fare, filled with a bunch of routine plot devices from big-creature movies. it's like somebody had a deck of cards with plot ideas from other movies written on them, which were shuffled, and dealt. whatever plot lines and characters came up in the deal were then tossed into the script. <br /><br />characters are so clich'e-ridden, that you can play a game of "guess who ends up as a monster meal" after less than ten minutes into the movie, and probably get every single one right--including the order that they will get devoured. many of the characters are so obnoxious, that you root for the creature to shut them up. some of the main characters include: a billy idol clone who surfs with sharks, a loudmouth brat who flashes bankrolls, a capt. ahab guy with a vendetta, and ahab's girlfriend who does sleazy dances at a bar. oh, and a big, big beast in need of anger management therapy.<br /><br />along the way, people argue a lot, pretty girls run around with wet t-shirts, couples make out on exotic beaches, explosions occur, ruins of a shrine appear, and greasy-faced pirates drop by. <br /><br />amusing, for the most part, but one thing bothered me: the callousness by characters when other people were killed. after one violent demise, they make one-liner jokes. i could almost hear rim shots.<br /><br />overall, ok, if you have 90 minutes to waste, and you want to laugh at a so-bad-it's-good-movie. otherwise, you may want to skip this one.
