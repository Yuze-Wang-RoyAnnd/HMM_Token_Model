nice attempt and good ideas (redemption of the prostitute, human beings helping each other out,...) but a poor result... the director obviously tried to emulate his french colleague tran anh hung by recreating an ambiance which is suppose to portray viet nam... the only problem is that this viet nam is long gone and when "the scent of the green papaya" had a historical background... trying to project this kind of ambiance (muffled sounds and the slow pace of life...) on modern days leaves a feeling of fake. besides it rapidly creates a sentiment of boredom and the outcome becomes too obvious.<br /><br />i can only suppose the action takes place in saigon or da nang because that is where harvey keitel, ex-marine in the movie, was probably stationed during the war... but in southern viet nam nobody or very few people speak with the clip northern accent displayed by the actors... seriously odd even for a bad vietnamese speaker.<br /><br />an old poet with leprosy...very doubtful (not a disease for people of his condition), a peasant girl who can read and write elaborate vietnamese poetry,... even more doubtful... <br /><br />
