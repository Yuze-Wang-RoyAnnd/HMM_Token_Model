after seeing the credits with only one name that i recognize and that was the preacher in this film (russ conway), i did not expect much from this film and i was not disappointed. a man is planning on killing his new wife by convincing other people that she is insane and will take her own life. unbeknown to the husband is that the plastic looking skull that he uses, in contrast, a ghost of a woman apparently his first dead wife has revenge on her mind and uses a real skull. a simple plot with a twist of irony at the end. if you are tired late one night and in need of sleep, this will help you to sleep that sleep.
