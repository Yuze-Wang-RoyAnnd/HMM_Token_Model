think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as "power rangers" and you have this film from 1990, "robot jox". a movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins. the robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good, it isn't all bad to watch. there are as i recall two robot fights in this one, one that ends badly and the final showdown. there is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed, but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done. the fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage, but still somewhat fun to watch. this movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament. so it is worth checking out once, but probably not more than that.
