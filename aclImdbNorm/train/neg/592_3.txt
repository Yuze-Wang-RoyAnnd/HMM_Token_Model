all logic goes straight out of the train window in this british horror film, set in the london underground and starring the usually reliable franka potente (run lola run), franka plays kate, a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friends who falls asleep at an underground station, only to wake up and find she has been locked in and finds herself being chased by "someone" or "something" with killer intentions.<br /><br />plot holes and unbelievability are rife and there are very few moments that are actually jumpy/ scary but plenty that are just plain dull.<br /><br />all in all an unpleasant film that should just stay locked underground forever and do us all a favour.<br /><br />the only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor ken campbell, who's done better than this
