how rick sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion. this film is absolutely criminal. before watching this movie i thought manos: hands of fate was the worse piece of crap i ever saw, but at least manos moves so slowly you might fall asleep, thereby rescuing your eyes from the pain it will suffer. the greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man that keeps the hobgoblins "locked" up makes it to the final scene. the time i spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life.
