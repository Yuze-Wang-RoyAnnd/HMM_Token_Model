i couldn't believe it. i had to rub my eyes a few times. was it true? <br /><br />yes, there were billy dee williams, jeff conaway, maxwell caulfield and tracy scoggins - all of them have some manner of talent but here they all were in what basically adds up to a cinemax-style skin flick set on board a spaceship!<br /><br />sad as it is, "alien intruder" tries to be unique, with a computer virus/alien demon/harpy/whatever else you want to call her named ariel (scoggins) infiltrating this sort-of high-tech virtual reality station on board a spaceship where four men are allowed to live out their fantasies as the system is over-seen by their captain (williams).<br /><br />interesting? maybe, but here everything just plays out like a well-padded episode of "red shoe diaries". williams out-classes everything right and left, and looks like he'd rather be doing anything else, anywhere else. ah, the things people do for money....<br /><br />the fx are pretty static, maybe even less than what you'd expect for a straight-to-video cheapie like this. unfortunately, even the female nudity is less than you'd expect. sexual innuendo is the real star here and, of course, it gets all the best scenes.<br /><br />if you like a movie that's all tease and no brains, check out "alien intruder". of course, you'll probably have to look no further than cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning.<br /><br />no stars, not even for what star power this flick can muster.<br /><br />leave this one lost in space.
