body slam (1987) is a flat out terrible movie. the low budget reeks, the direction is pedestrian (at best) and the writing and acting is lame. but if you're into old school wrestling (circa 1970's through the mid-80') then you'll be more entertained than the average viewer. i have to warn you, this movie stinks on ice. i gave it a two because i felt like being generous. this turkey was "directed" by stunt master hal needham. the stars are roddy piper, the tonga kid and a bunch of scrub wrestlers and c-list actors (dirk benedict).<br /><br />the synopsis of this "movie" is about a promoter who wants to combine "hair rock" and wrestling. but their are others that don't want him to succeed. there's more but i don't want to spoil it for you. if you can stomach the bad acting and inane storyline, there's a few surprises near the end for die-hard wrestling fans. <br /><br />i wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemy (and i mean it).
