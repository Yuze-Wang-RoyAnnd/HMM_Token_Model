this movie is most possibly the worst movie i have ever see in my entire life! the plot is ridiculous and the whole "little man" crap is just so stupid. the entire movie is unrealistic and dumb. let's face it, it's just a "black comedy". this is just a pointless horrible piece that should have never made it to theaters. the jokes are not funny and the acting is horrendous. please, i beg of to you save your money than see this worthless piece of crap. i had to endure sitting through little man for an hour and a half wishing my eyes would bleed. i am disgusted that something like this would even be thought of! who writes this crap? the actors have no talent what so ever, how do these people get into hollywood? they are making money off this junk!
