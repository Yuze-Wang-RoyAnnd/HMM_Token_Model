documentary about nomadic persians making a treacherous traverse of massive mountains to get their herds to grass. watching this silent, black and white feature, marred in part by a twink-twink-twink oriental music score that could not have been used in the original exhibition, is even duller than it sounds. the spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen, and there is an utter failure to establish any kind of plot line. i loved nanook of the north and march of the penguins, but despised this movie, notwithstanding the similarity of the theme. physical hardships alone are just not that interesting.
