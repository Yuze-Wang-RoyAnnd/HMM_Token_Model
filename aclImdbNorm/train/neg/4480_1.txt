let me start off by saying that i didn't watch this movie at first with high expectations. it was recommended to me by a friend with mediocre taste in movies, and "mtv" was pasted on the front cover so i was not expecting much. what i was expecting was a tear-jerker, overly dramatic but at least effective.<br /><br />i was wrong.<br /><br />firstly, let me start off that i had never read the book nor watched any other versions of the movie.<br /><br />the acting was my main gripe with the film. by god is it awful. the main girl is pretty mediocre, but when compared to the rest of the cast she's maryl streep. the main "hero", heath, is just plain awful. he can sing decent sounding clich'ed songs, but that's about it. his acting broke the 'sad' moments by being so bad at points that i just burst into laughter. the isabel girl was pretty godawful too, and the brother was just a flat character that was played by an actor that couldn't display emotion whatsoever. and when he tried to, it failed miserably. neil patrick harris was the only decent actor, playing edward, although it's obvious the direction was bad because even he did not live up to what i've seen him do. oh, and the father wasn't half-bad to my memory, but he was in the movie for such a small amount of time i can hardly remember.<br /><br />the story itself was not very good. more breakups than you can imagine. predictable story (until the ending, which i barely understood). extremely one-sided characters with no real depth to them... overall just not interesting or compelling, nothing we've never seen before done much better, and nothing worth watching here.<br /><br />the ending is suppose to be a tearjerker. it did nothing of the sort. the ending isn't built up at all, it almost feels like an afterthought. in fact, i had to ask my friends why the ending actually happened, which when they explained it to me i must have had a look on my face of "wait, when did they say that? what?". never a good sign. the editing was probably the worst i've seen, though i do understand the fade-ins-fade-outs are done because this was originally made for tv, but that's really no excuse.<br /><br />overall, the movie is just garbage. i'm a sensitive guy, i cried during two episodes of the simpsons. i never cried during this crap, not even close. really, this movie is not worth your time. if you really want to see a tearjerker look elsewhere.
