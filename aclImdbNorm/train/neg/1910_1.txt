i've tried to watch this so-called comedy, but it's very hard to bear. this is a bad, narrow-minded, clich'e-ridden movie. definitively not funny, but very much boring and annoying, indeed. bad script, bad acting. it's a complete waste of time - and there remains nothing more to say, i'm afraid.<br /><br />1 out of 10 points.
