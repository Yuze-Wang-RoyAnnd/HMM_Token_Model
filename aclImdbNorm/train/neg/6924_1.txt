if this movie were any worse, it would have been directed by uwe boll. this nonsensical mess makes ed wood look like hitchcock. it has been a while since i have seen this steaming pile , but i do remember that i wanted to do grievous bodily harm to all those involved. how anyone can give this movie any more than 1 star amazes me to the graciousness of all those that viewed this tripe. i give it one star because there is not a rating lower. all copies of this movie should be burned the ground sowed with salt and reserved as a landfill for the most toxic of waste. no, one copy should be kept under ultra hi security and shown only to film makers as an example of how not to do it.
