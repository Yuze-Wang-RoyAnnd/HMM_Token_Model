i rented this film yesterday mostly due to the good-looking art and the summary given on the back of the jacket. after popping it into my dvd player i re-examined the jacket cover and even though i took the cover out of from the plastic viewer, i still could not read any of the production detail information about the film. this film is entitled evil on the jacket and had to locate it by going to faith films website to find out any linkage to it here on imdb.<br /><br />the filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good ... then, a line-reading actor spoke. oh dear ... this actor's reading sounded like some pimple-faced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch, and no attempt given to go beyond reading the lines from the script. at first i thought i got a bad disc out of audio sync, then had to surmise it was a foreign film since i couldn't read the jacket... english dialog dubbed. if they'd casted the right person for dubbing the dialog, this film might have been decent. i gave it a chance of about 20 minutes before ejecting it when i discovered the bad line reader wasn't going to get killed off, but stay as the constant main fixture. yes, it is that bad! the jacket cover art and the art done in the film are great, so gave the one star, but minus 1,999,999 stars for the rotten dialog. i do not recommend this one!
