featured in 1955's the cobweb is an all star cast ranging from silent screen veteran lillian gish to actors studio progeny susan strasberg. set at an exclusive psychiatric hospital, what is this movie about you wonder......high drama ? doctor & patient relationships ? shock therapy treatment ? no, this howler is about who exactly will get to pick the draperies for a psychiatric hospital ! you think i'm kidding ? you won't believe your eyes as you're watching this unbelievable storyline that was turned into a movie ! progressive head shrink dr. mciver (richard widmark) wants to have all of the hospital's patients involved in the design, selection and execution of the needed new draperies. mciver's wife played by marble mouthed gloria graham wants to get her 2 cents in on this monumental task too. so does long time staffer miss inch (lillian gish). directed by vincent minelli, you kinda wonder if he really became this overly involved in minute detail because of his marriage to worry wart judy garland. talented actors like lauren bacall, susan strasberg, charles boyer, and john kerr are wasted in this hokey story. what were they thinking ?
