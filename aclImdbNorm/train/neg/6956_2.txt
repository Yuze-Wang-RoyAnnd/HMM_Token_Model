sorry, but every time i see a film wherein a woman sucker-punches a man and the man does nothing but cower, the film looses all credibility. so the new (female) starbuck immediately tainted the plot before it even got off the ground (no pun intended). dirk benedict was so much more plausible as the sensitive hero-type than the new-age kattee sackhoff-- whose overacting will probably be henceforth lauded as "a compelling, exciting, must-see, ground-breaking performance," by the politically correct new-speak of today's review copy editors; but in essence, it is just a tired, old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a townhouse: the biggest clich'e on screens today. i may give this series one more shot, but human caricatures alone will not keep me tuned in. as james hilton once bemoaned, "a story, please; just give me a story."
