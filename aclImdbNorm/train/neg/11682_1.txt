now isn't it? considering all the good work done by danzel,clive and jodie, the movie never grew into something more than a horrible die-hard/heist movies copycat. yes a couple of jokes, no absolutely no unpredictable twists, to be honest the only unpredictable moments are there because both director and editor made some stupid mistakes, it is a shame for them and a waste of time for us. if someone can tell me why on earth were they digging a hole inside that safe, who the hell is the rebe and how on earth did they know that the diamonds were in the particular cell, it could just make my day, but it seems that spike asks us to take too much things in this one for granted, and do not raise our eyebrows when something looks stupid...its just another studio contract movie relax and enjoy...
