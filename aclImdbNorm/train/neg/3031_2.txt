tony scott destroys anything that may have been interesting in richard kelly's clich'ed, patchy, overwrought screenplay. domino harvey (kiera knightley) was a model who dropped out and became a bounty hunter. this is her story... "sort of".<br /><br />the problem with this rubbish is that there isn't much of a story at all and scott's extreme graphic stylization of every shot acts as a distancing mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in harvey's chaotic life.<br /><br />you just don't care about harvey. knightley plays her as an obnoxious, cynical brat who has done nothing to warrant our respect. she punches people she doesn't like and sheds her clothes and inhibitions when the situation calls for it, but she isn't the least bit real and knightly isn't the least bit convincing, either.<br /><br />the film is boring. it's loud, too, and shackled with one of the most annoying source music scores i've heard in a long time. the final twenty minutes are a poor re-run of scott's "true romance" climax with domino's gang going to meet two sets of feuding bad guys who are -- surprise! surprise! -- destined to shoot it out with each other at the top of a las vegas casino.<br /><br />unfortunately, this potentially exciting conflagration is totally botched by scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious, pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation. this is not an artistically brave or experimental piece; it is a failure on every level because it gives us no entry point to the lives and dilemmas of its characters.<br /><br />mickey roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter, but he disappears into the background as the "narrative" progresses. chris walken turns in another embarrassing cameo and dabney coleman, always solid, is underutilized.<br /><br />don't be fooled by this film's multi-layered, gimmick-ridden surface. it is still a turd no matter how hard you polish it.
