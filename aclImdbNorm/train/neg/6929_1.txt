i read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot. i'm an open minded guy after all and i've given good reviews to some pretty bad flicks. as the end credits rolled on this one i searched for meaning and something nice to say. here goes: "this film was mercifully short." that's all i got.<br /><br />okay, okay. the sets and visuals were well done and the music helped lend to the mood of asylum life but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took away from the good bits. i did find myself laughing at this film but the way you laugh at your best friend who just embarrassed himself in front of a large crowd.<br /><br />by the time of the "chicken dance" at the finale i had just decided to tuck and roll with the film and let the bodies fall where they fall. i don't know what could have salvaged this film. the acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just wasn't any way to make it watchable; not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts. maybe i should have sparked a doobie or drank a lot of beer to get the full experience of the film. either way, i'm not watching this film again unless i'm really depressed. then i can tell myself "at least i wasn't in 'dr. tarr's torture dungeon.' i'm better than those guys."
