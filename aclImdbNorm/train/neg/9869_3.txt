didn't care for the movie, the book was better. does anyone know where it was filmed? *** this was my first visit to your site...just found the answer to my question. so now i look like a dummy, but i think i'll still submit my comments. and yes, british columbia is lovely ***or why they took it from its south carolina coastal setting?(this question stands) the place was essential to the fabric of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the movie. oh, i just read where i need to write at least ten lines. here's my other main issue with the film. kim bassinger was too vapid and not at all what i pictured from the book. i know, the book was the book and the movie; well not so good. i found the character in the book much more empathetic. also the book evoked rustic, almost primitive images of the monastery. while the "castle" in the film was much more visually impressive, it distorted the feel of the story and seemed at odds with the characters.
