yet another venture into the realm of the teen-gross-out-comedy, set on a college campus featuring a nerd's quest to coolness, and how he decides to blackmail a trio of popular jocks into making him get the girl. it's all been done before, and it's all been done in a far more satisfying manner. the gross-out humor that has made teen flicks like "american pie" and "dude! where's my car" so popular is taken completely out of context in this installment, appearing so completely at random that the viewer can only frown and disapprove. the film is badly written, and the actors never succeed in making any of it even slightly bearable. i won't even dignify this terrible picture by divulging, as it's a waste of my time and yours. at best, slackers never manages to entertain or induce laughter, and at worst it is excruciatingly bad and at times completely unwatchable. <br /><br />jason schwarzman, who impressed in his debut rushmore, humiliates himself by appearing in this picture and one wonders how a career can end up in the toilet so fast. please avoid, please avoid. save your money.
