i guess this goes to prove that joe don baker will do anything for a buck. the concept of the film wasn't very good to start with. this movie has so many bad things about it i don't know where to start. the acting is horrible. the cinematography is marginal at best. the soundtrack was pretty bad. the score is terrible. there's a reason why this movie ended up on mystery science theater 3000. i voted before i wrote this and i cannot believe that 9 people actually thought this "film" is excellent. they must have liked the two go-go dancers. final justice would be if they locked this stinker in the film vault outside wichita and never let anyone see it again! a 1 out of 10 rating is far better than this deserves.
