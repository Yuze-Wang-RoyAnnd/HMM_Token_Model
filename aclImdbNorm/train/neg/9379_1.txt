this movie . . . i don't know. why they would take such an indellible character as pippi longstocking and cast the singularly charmless tami erin, i will never know. why they would spend money on art direction and some not-all-that-bad special effects, then not bother to edit it properly, i will never know. why the sets and costumes are sometimes in period, and sometimes bizarrely not, why they commissioned such bad songs, why the script doesn't make any sense whatsoever (not even on a silly, children's film level) . . . . what were they thinking?? nothing about this movie is quite as it should be. every single part is dubbed (and always poorly,) every sound effect is slightly wrong, every edit is in the wrong place, every performance is bad in some way. it does manage to create an appropriate atmosphere, despite all the problems, but it never captures the magic that is astrid lindgren's creation.
