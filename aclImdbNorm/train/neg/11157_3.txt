hip. erotic. wickedly sexy ... whatever. it's "the terminator" with werewolves.<br /><br />no, seriously. the cop saves the girl (waitress!) from the big monster and refers to himself as her 'protector'. the lead actor ryan alosio does a pretty good job of emulating kyle reese ... there's a massacre in a police precinct ... the bad guy is muscular with red eyes ... and it even contains dialogue along the lines of "you said it yourself, he won't ever stop. never." the dire script comes from a first-time screenwriter who, thank god, hasn't sold anything since this, and it's all thrown together by famously bad director richard friedman.<br /><br />the movie opens in a strip bar (always a good sign), and a mean-looking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason, pursued by three cops. one of them is black, and (shock horror!) he's the one who gets killed in the first five minutes. the film goes downhill for the next hour or so, then picks up a little with some decent action sequences, before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending.<br /><br />for the most part, the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who's willing to settle for less. if nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and alosio, along with some of the supporting cast, shows signs of talent. darkwolf in his human form is played by gargantuan kane hodder -- famous for his numerous portrayals of jason vorhees in the 'friday the 13th' movies. he's decent enough, especially considering he isn't used to speaking roles.<br /><br />it's become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between andrea bogart and sasha williams, who gets her kit off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former 'power rangers' actresses. and it's unnervingly clear that the editor spent way too much time on that scene ... anyway, the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good, and the design of the wolf isn't bad at all.but the cgi is bad. just plain bad. i mean seriously, if you can't reach some level of realism - why bother? just throw a little extra money into the make-up! aside from the terrible script, this movie does have it's moments, many of which are unintentionally funny. it's good for a laugh if you don't have anything better to do, but just don't spend any money on it. please.
