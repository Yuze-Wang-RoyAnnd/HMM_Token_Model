i felt obliged to watch this movie all the way through, since i had found it in a bargain bin and bought it for my own, but i came close many times to turning it off and just writing off the money i had paid for it. if you are a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is ok. if there is one thing that the makers of this film know, it is the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a sickening effect. if that doesn't thrill you, then stay away.<br /><br />this movie is shot on a home video camera, with grade school props and terrible actors. it's dubbed from german, but even allowing for that, the sound is awful. this film is about as budget as budget gets, except for the aforementioned special effects. if they had spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and guts, the film might have been a little more enjoyable.<br /><br />the story is about three men that land on an island inhabited by an army of tin-masked sadists. they are captured, and the rest of the movie is about their attempt to escape. i call this a story in the loosest sense, since it is really a series of scenes of torture and combat strung together by inane obscenity-filled dialog.<br /><br />there is nothing whatsoever redeeming about this movie, unless you like mindless gore. consider yourself warned.
