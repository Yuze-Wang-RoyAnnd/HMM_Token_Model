this is a low-budget "scream" style movie. "maddy" is a new worker at a conspicuously-unnamed office, where she meets and starts a relationship with her co-worker "chris". during a hot tub-party, chris and his friends convince maddy they belong to a "murder club" where everyone has killed someone for kicks. when maddy loses it and kills someone for real, hijinks ensue.<br /><br />the film looks good, and there are the requisites for this genre and budget level (nudity, gore, maybe a few cameos from slightly bigger stars than the cast), but, after the credits roll, you'll ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching it.
