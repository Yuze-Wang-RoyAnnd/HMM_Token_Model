the waterdance (1991) the main character of the waterdance, played by eric stoltz, finds himself in a rehab center with some others similarly injured. and there he must face an harsh new life, confined to a wheelchair. it's an interesting, and promising premise, but unfortunately, it fails to deploy. what ensues instead is largely hollywood schmaltz, with some interesting moments. certainly the cast (eric stoltz, william forsythe, wesley snipes, et al) is brilliant, and perform well here as one would expect, but their talents are wasted. the characters are mainly stereotypes of one kind or another, and most of them are thoroughly unlikeable (the snipes character being the exception). i suppose this is some kind of attempt to break through people's ideas about the handicapped being "crippled" or "weak", by depicting them, for the most part, as in-your-face pricks, but it makes for an entirely annoying experience. admittedly it will show you something of what those with permanent disabilities go through, in a way that is not softened or romanticized, which is useful, and a good idea, but while the process being depicted can make one a difficult person to get along with, and that's worth dealing with, it is not part and parcel to that that these characters must be, to varying degrees, despicable. they wouldn't have to be disneyfied, either; surely there's a middle ground somewhere. by the film's conclusion, the eric stoltz character has come to accept his status as a handicapped person, but since he is such a flaming narcissistic monster from the beginning of the film to the end, we couldn't care less. <br /><br />in addition to its character problems, the film suffers from that weird syndrome that so many hollywood movies suffer from; the syndrome doesn't really have an official name, but you might call it "inexplicable forgiveness syndrome". it goes something like this: characters abuse the crap out of each other, and then without so much as an apology, all is forgiven (an especially obnoxious example of this is in the movie the breakfast club, in which one character spends most of the film verbally bullying everybody within earshot; as a result
