absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen! the acting, the dialog, the manuscript, the sound, the lighting, the plot line. i actually can't say anything positive about this, although i enjoy swedish movies. the fighting scenes are so ridiculous that it's impossible to take it seriously. and when the lead character just happens to loose his shirt, while dodging bullets in a strip bar, i'm not sure if it's supposed to be a joke, or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good film?! regina lund is the only half descent actor, but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions. it leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this...
