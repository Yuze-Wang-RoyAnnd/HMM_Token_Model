there aren't enough gay-themed movies and there aren't enough `coming out' movies. every one is a welcome addition to the genre. although the production values are high(the movie `looks' good, matthias freihof (philipp) looks real good in a pair of jeans) this is a bad one. it is a period piece: gay life under an oppressive regime(east berlin, 1989) a life that seems 40 years behind the west. in a way we're seeing our own history; what it might have been like for gays in the 40's and 50's here(it often reminded me of `last exit to brooklyn :the book not the film).but it is unremittingly depressing and slow in a contrived way that evoked an old sctv send up of ingmar bergman. it is so sloppily edited i wonder if the director just didn't hack at random. yes, it is a miracle that this was filmed and released before the wall came down and yes, life behind the `curtain' was hard for gay people. a good director could have shown all that without stupefying the audience. a good director would have had me mark this one as one of the great coming-out movies and not one of the misses.
