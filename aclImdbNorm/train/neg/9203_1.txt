many people like to point to this tv movie when arguing with the vast legions of hanks-philes out there that tom did in fact make crappy films (i think "bachelor party" was great, but that's another story). the movie focuses on a "dungeons and dragons-style game" that eventually drives our young gump to hallucinatory madness. the story is charmingly early 1980s, focusing as it does on the imminent threat to our youth posed by those evil role-playing games.<br /><br />i, however, prefer to view "mazes and monsters" as the turning point in the "whatever happened to chris makepeace?" story. we all remember him as 'rudy the rabbit' in "meatballs" and as the hapless clifford in "my bodyguard", where he gave us all a vicarious thrill by beating the crap out of matt dillon. few could argue (especially those of us who read "dynamite!" on a regular basis) that great things were in store for him.<br /><br />and then came rona jaffe. the line between bad acting and bad writing is razor thin, so i leave it to you to decide whose fault makepeace's performance in this is. all i know is that the last major release i saw him in was "vamp", and that was 1986. he had a small role as sean penn's brother in "falcon and the snowman", but by that time the brat pack torch had been passed to others with straighter hair and flashier resumes.<br /><br />i can't in good conscience recommend this movie. watch it if only to see a younger, more idealistic chris makepeace, before rona jaffe feasted on his soul.
