well, i could nt get into the plot, but thats just me maybe. listless camera-movements at times, nevertheless this movie has got a charming vintage quality.the acting is genuine at times and entertaining with the occasional chase sequence involving scantily clad ladies, which was nice. the climax is confused and disjointed, but still ...err riveting, thanx to stella stevens.<br /><br />the stunts are interesting, specially because of the 70's las vegas backdrop. there are a few jerky hand-held camera-movements at the end, which keep me guessing, for a while. but i don't think i ll b chasing the dvd, just yet.
