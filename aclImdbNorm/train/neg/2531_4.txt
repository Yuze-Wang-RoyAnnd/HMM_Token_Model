the title song for this movie ...........is the greatest free spirited ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /><br />i first saw this movie back in 1978-79 when i first subscribed to cable. in 1979 cable was just starting to become common place in homes. (or at least that when it was becoming common here in missouri).<br /><br />this might very well be the first movie i ever watched on the pay channel called "the movie channel" - which was called "the star channel" back then, they changed the name to "the movie channel" in the early 1980's........i received a free month of "the star channel" with my new cable subscription. "the van" was one of the movies that was in heavy rotation on that network at that time.<br /><br />i remember watching this movie back then, and thinking it was a typical teen flick(along the same lines as other medium budget teen flicks) ...the ones where the plot revolves around nudity and parties.<br /><br />i totally forgot that this movie even existed until i recently seen this movie again after having not seeing it for decades( i found a copy of it on dvd for sale in cheap bin) i recognized it, and bought it for a mere $4.99.<br /><br />seems like i had remembered this film being much better that it was(is). however watching it back then was a different experience than watching now(30+ years later).<br /><br />it was fun to see the kids listing to rock n roll music, smoking weed, and having sex in the back a fancy van(often all at the same time). this is what a good teen party movie should be.<br /><br />there isn't much of a plot other than the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his arch rivals good looking girlfriend ...he blows all of his college savings money to purchase a tricked out dodge van(with shag carpet walls . mirrored ceiling and a water bed in it)to get her attention, and he eventually gets to have sex with her. but his arch rival finds out and comes looking for him (so that the two of them can settle their differences by drag racing their vans)....he and his arch rival end up wrecking both of their vans, and instead of stealing away his arch rivals girlfriend, he wins over the heart of a preppy(lesser attractive) girl that he half/ass dates through most of the movie and he decides he is happier/better off and the movie ends.<br /><br />the movie does have it's funny moments. but watching this movie 30+ years later, it becomes more of a trip down memory lane. because i still can remember pizza parlors, pinball arcades, it also brought back memories of cruising around a small town while we smoked pot as we would yell at good looking girls and hoping to get laid (sometimes i'd get lucky and get some decent looking girl to share a joint with me and we'd screw in the backseat afterwords, i also remember many of the songs in this move(when they were new)......this movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era in those regards (brought back lots of memories)<br /><br />the one thing that is depicted in this movie that i honestly can not remember is ....i never remember a time when full sized vans were as popular as this film depicts them as being. i remember that era very well, and i don't young men going around wishing they had a van. instead i remember young men in the 70's (self included) wanting a pontiac trans am, chevy camaro or a hot rod ford mustang, but never a van. this movie makes it appear as if vans were most popular item going and that every young man wanted one(which just wasn't true of that era)
