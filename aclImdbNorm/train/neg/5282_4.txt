i have to confess that i am severely disappointed.<br /><br />this version can in no way compete with the version of 1995. the reason why i watched it was that i wasn't entirely happy with ciaran hinds as captain wentworth and thought that rupert penry-jones looked much more like the captain i had imagined when i read the book. and he was too.<br /><br />unfortunately that is the only redeeming quality of the film. the rest is as un-austen-like as possible.<br /><br />miss elliot would never have run through the streets of bath like this. it wasn't in her character and it just wasn't done by a lady of the those times. the anne elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity. there are other painful anachronisms but this was the worst.<br /><br />although there are 3 important quotes from the book, they are at entirely inappropriate moments, warning those who know the book that yet another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed.<br /><br />and although this version is not much shorter than the other one, it feels like everything is rushed. very little care was taken to introduce the characters, show their dispositions and motives. important scenes were omitted. how could they possibly have butchered the final scenes in this way ? a disaster ! and it was by far not as beautifully photographed as the other one.<br /><br />no, no, no. if you love austen, then don't waste your time with this.
