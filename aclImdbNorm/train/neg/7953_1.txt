while the acting and directing could be argued as having some merit - the storyline is a very poor wannabe vietnam movie with the country name simply changed.<br /><br />at the very least, for a movie to hold some credibility, try and have some semblance of accuracy in equipment, weapons and tactics. nevermind the gross misrepresentation of the behaviour of the troops as a norm.<br /><br />aside for the limited use as silly propaganda about the south african defence force, it serves little purpose - definitely no entertainment value.<br /><br />aspiring movie makers - this is how not to make a war movie. do some research, and have some pride in your product.
