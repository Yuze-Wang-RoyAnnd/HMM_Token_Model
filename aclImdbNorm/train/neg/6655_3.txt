the only redeeming quality of this overlong miscast melodrama is the scenery of southern france and the voice of nana mascouri singing the theme song. stephanie powers is miscast and betrayed by a phony accent. as has been pointed out, she is too old to play an 18 year old and looks far too young as a grandmother with a college age granddaughter? lee remick is good although she also is ageless in her later years. the talented joanna lumley is under utilized and also manages to look forever young when her middle aged son (robert urich) finally marries grandma stephanie powers. stacey keach's ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him. don't know how any viewer could relate to his excessive portrayal? the most credible performance is given by ian richardson, who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs. it strains credulity that the handsome male suitors in this epic would remain ever single while they patiently await the subject of their affections to finally consent to accept them. can anybody believe that handsome robert urich would remain single for decades waiting for stephanie powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals? the ww2 engagement between the wehrmacht and the marquis is laughable. to begin with, the germans did not occupy the provence section of france until late in the war, it was controlled by the vichy french puppet government. we see the french resistance staging a daylight raid on mistral's villa to steal sheets after which they all lounge under a bridge waiting for a lumbering truckload of nazi troops to surprise and annihilate them? if you want to see a well acted mini-series set in a foreign country, don't watch mistral's daughter. a far better alternative would be the thorn birds.
