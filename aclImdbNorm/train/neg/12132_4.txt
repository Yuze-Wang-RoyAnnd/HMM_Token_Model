a trio of low-life criminals, led by matt dillon, botches a late-night burglary. they flee but quickly cross paths with the police who just happen to be in hot pursuit of a terrorist. of course the police mistake the burglar gang for the terrorist, the real terrorist gets away, and the burglars are forced to take refuge in a small dive of a bar, taking hostages, unaware why the police are so intent on catching them. and guess who else has picked the bar as a sanctuary for the night?<br /><br />unbelievable? absolutely. and it goes down hill from there. spacey did acquire a good bit of acting talent; matt dillon, faye dunaway, gary sinise, viggo mortensen, and m. emmett walsh, but they're all wasted. mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar, all they do for the remainder of the film is argue. endlessly and aimlessly. long before the conclusion of the film you've stopped giving a damn about what happens to them.
