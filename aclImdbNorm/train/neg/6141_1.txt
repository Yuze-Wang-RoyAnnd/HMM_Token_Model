one night i was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and "gymkata" happened to be on; i watched way too much of it. it is indeed hilarious, and horrifying, really. think about it this way--if in your job you had an idea for something this bad and went on to execute it in as terrible a fashion as this, how long exactly would you last? not as long as this movie. it's a must-see, obviously.
