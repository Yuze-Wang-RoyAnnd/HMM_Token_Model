"i'm a cartoon!" "you're an illustration!" what does that suppose to mean?! this plot could not be worse as a boy, who's afraid of everything, becomes very brave at the very end of the film because he went into a library. the only purpose of this waste of celluloid was to encourage american kids to read, when a cheaper, and more effective way of doing this could have been a series of adverts! even the talents of macaulay culkin(as the kid), christopher lloyd (as the so predictable "that he's a the page master" librarian), could save this pointless film from the dull plot. even the voices of whoopi goldberg, patrick stewart,(even) leonard nimoy, or the hollywood god of voices, frank welker as the cartoon characters don't save it ever. i can only describe it as a 1990s equivalent to the even ghastly 1978 adaption of the water babies, because the bland animation makes the film worse, not improving the dull plot!
