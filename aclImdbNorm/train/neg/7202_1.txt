since i had loved the inspector gadget cartoon in the 80's, i went to see this movie. i wasted my money. the plot was very thin. also, the movie could not keep me interested for long. i was glad it was over.<br /><br />if you want to see inspector gadget, watch the cartoon instead. it was much better than the movie.
