full house is one of the worst tv series ever! why?because all the characters are so irritating that it's impossible to bear.the best character is joey an even he is pretty irritating occasionally.an that girl dj,who wrote her character?i want to kill my self every time she speaks.not to mention when danny start's with his philosophy.<br /><br />example: dj won around ten thousand dollars or more in the casino.however,she's not eighteen so she shouldn't gamble according to law.however the casino was ready to pay her the money but then danny,her father cought's her and don't let's her raise that money because she is not eighteen.oh come on,give me a break,will ya?since i've seen that stupid and childish scene i instantly turned off the television.some of the thing's they say in this series not even a child would bought.who in the world could think that full house is entertaining and funny?every single word they say in this series seem's like shakespeare wrote it.except that shakespere knew how to write and except that he wouldn't be that childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the script for the full house! <br /><br />for everyone who has a bad heart or any kind of bad medical condition or any will for life or any sense of the real world,i deeply recommend 'do not watch the full house'!not even one episode as a try out.avoid this series.save your self from stupidity and nonsense.this is the worst television show ever!i'd rather watch teletubbies then this.'do not watch this'.
