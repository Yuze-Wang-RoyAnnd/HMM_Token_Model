what an utter disappointment! the score of 6,1 here on imdb built up some mild expectations but, oh my, was i disappointed. the first thing that bugs me are those braindead, stereotyped university kids. yes, i know teens can be childish and so on, but why are they in movies always portrayed as complete braindead morons? there was one character that i thought was alright, but he/she (not revealing it here) was killed off way before the end. the other characters was poorly executed and even the supposed hero/heroine just didn't do it for me. on the plus side: the plot is pretty good and the productions values a cut above for these kind of flicks. the acting was generally not very good, rutger hauer stands out in a small role. but it all fails with bland and braindead characters. you just stop caring about them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and thats being generous).
