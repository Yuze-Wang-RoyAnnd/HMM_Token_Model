i cannot believe that i wasted five hours of my life on this rubbish. the previous five day offering by this author was highly enjoyable and i was really looking forward to this. but most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. suranne jones was the principal culprit since she either mumbled or gabbled her lines, but most of the rest of the cast followed her example. notable exceptions were bernard hill and anne reid, old stagers whose diction was exemplary. do producers not listen to productions before they are aired to make sure the dialogue is audible? as a result i suppose i lost track of what was going on, and since the original plot line seemed to metamorphose into to the standard them-and-us thing between muslims and the rest i soon lost interest. the ending was a complete anti-climax. a complete dud.
