doris day never lets a bad script get her down. even in the most trying of circumstances, day gives 100% and usually comes out unscathed. this comedy, perhaps inspired by a real-life new york city black-out in 1965 but actually adapted from a late-'50s french play by claude magnier, gives doris little to do but spoof her own goody-goody image and, in the second-half, be comically sedated (which is amusing because of the spin day gives to the situation). there are some funny lines here, yet the staginess of the material has obviously been carried over from the play...and instead of conjuring up some amusing incidents within the big apple, we get stuck in the suburbs. doris' co-stars (patrick o'neal, robert morse, and terry-thomas) are not well-suited to her, and neither is the shapeless hairdo they've got her wearing. still, it's not terrible, it features a few big laughs, and for day-buffs it's a must-see. ** from ****
