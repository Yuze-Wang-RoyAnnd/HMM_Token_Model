i voted 3 for this movie because it looks great as does all of greenaways output. however it was his usual mix of "art" sex and pretentious crap.i know lots of people like this film but i grew tired of it very quickly. it is definitely not for everyone. the ubiquitous mcgregor obviously took the part for crediblity's sake i guess but he really should not have wasted his time. i hate to consign anyone to pseud's corner but please.....!!! on the plus side it is visually very attractive and i enjoyed the music but could not see it through to the end and i cannot say that for many movies. i usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable!!
