this is only a response to the yahoo who says this movie is more realistic than the classic, genre defining masterpiece, jaws. yes, brainiac, great whites(and other species of shark, bull, black-tip, oceanic white-tip, tiger)have been known to populate areas where easy prey is found. humans don't often make it onto that menu, granted, but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be exhibiting abnormal behavior. it's not like it's never happened. the odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town, singling out a human nemesis, sinking several dozen thick hulled north atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people, all friends of the aforementioned "nemesis", are close enough to the water for it to reach, are so slim as to be laughable. much like this turd of a jaws knock-off. laughable. great white sharks are also known to frequently chew on boats, protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards, as they look like seals from below. a shark the size of bruce(if you don't know, look it up)would be more than capable of sinking a boat like the orca(hey! that's the name of the blatant rip-off we're discussing!), as it would weigh upwards of 6,000 lbs. i could go on, but i don't need to. jaws is amazing(better acting, better effects, better music, better writing), orca is crap(blatant rip-off of jaws, lousy writing, abominable effects, most ridiculous plot this side of an olson twins flick). it doesn't take a masters from columbia university to see that. watch better movies.
