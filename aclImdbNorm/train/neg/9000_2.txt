when i rented this i was hoping for what "reign of fire" did not deliver: a clash between modern technology and mythic beasts.<br /><br />instead i got a standard "monster hunts stupid people in remote building" flick, with bad script, bad music, bad effects, bad plot, bad acting. bad, bad, bad.<br /><br />only reason why i did give it a 2 was that in theory there could exist worse movies. in theory.....
