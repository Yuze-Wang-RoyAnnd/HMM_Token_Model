this movie is bizarre. better put, it's "freakin' weird". i could give you a plot summary, or some hoity toity analysis, but i would consider it a waste of your time. all anybody needs to know about this movie is two young sisters, one incestuous relationship, homicide, post mortem mutilation, and one really disturbing infatuation. at the end of the movie you feel like you need to go take a shower to wash the filth off yourself, but not in a good way like after "pulp fiction" or "fight club". it's like you're a teenager (or high schooler being that i am myself still a teenager)and have just done something you a: wish you hadn't done, and b: hope to the good lord of heaven and earth that your parents never find out about. and nobody likes that. my advise is that rather than defiling your mind and by watching piece of wanton cinematic filth, just go waste your time on something a little less horrible and watch "kazaam"(yes, i would rather watch "kazaam" than "murderous maids", read into it what you want).
