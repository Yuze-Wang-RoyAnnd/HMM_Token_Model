vincente minelli movies are usually worth your time; meet me in st louis, the bad and the beautiful. i awaited this movie with great interest. but what a disappointment. <br /><br />some came running is scene after scene of go-nowhere fatalism. sinatra is a sad sack, returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships, a disappointing floozy hanging on him, living in disappointing digs as a gal persuades him to finish his disappointing writing project. the movie has a big dramatic finish in which a disappointing villain catches up with sinatra and macclane and something disappointing happens. the sequence is intended to be tension-filled but minelli is no hitchcock; he gets so distracted by pretty colors, he doesn't notice the scene is a wheezing clich'e and the characters are so thinly-drawn and poorly developed we don't particularly care that they get shot. (especially macclane) but that's the only real cinematography in the project. otherwise we look at constipated characters standing around bars & living rooms getting on each others nerves for two hours. hell is other people, apparently.<br /><br />there is nothing going on in this movie. the dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after ww2 is handled more deftly in 'the best years of our lives.' and either of two inge products, 'splendor in the grass' and 'picnic' covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead-end town, with much more poignance.
