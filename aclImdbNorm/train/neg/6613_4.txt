iam a big fan of mr ram gopal varma but i could not believe that he made this movie. i was really disappointed.<br /><br />ram gopal varma ki aag doesn't come anywhere close to the real sholay. it does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer. ram gopal varma fails to create chemistry between the characters . there is no camaraderie between heero(ajay devgan) and raj(prashant raj). there are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together. the sequence outside the courtroom with amitabh bachchan and mohanlal face off is remarkable. amitabh bachchan should not have done this movie. ajay and sushmita sen was trying their best but no use. rajpal yadav's voice modulation - ineffective and rather pointless. mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language. rest of the cast was below expectation. the comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay fall flat in this movie.<br /><br />ram gopal varma could have worked upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he messed up and just for the sake of making he made this aag. but there is no fire.
