"cavemen" exceeded my expectations, and not in a good way. it was even worse than i thought it would be. basically, here's the show: the cavemen are an alternate race, they face prejudice, etc. quite possibly the stupidest idea ever created; almost being worthy of jail time for the writers. one show featured the cavemen going into a club, trying to pick up girls, and then nothing else happened. it was reminiscent of listening to a 22 minute andy rooney dialog, followed by death by steak knives via midget cannibals. for those who have not seen this show, here's an example of the dialog: "you're sure you're okay with going out with a caveman." "yeah, that's fine. i've had like 10 - thousand!" hilarious... possibly the best writing i've ever witnessed.<br /><br />22 minutes of cavemen with horrible makeup, tackling tough social issues... sounds like an entertaining night. i also love how bad the recent ideas are that they're resorted to making a sitcom out of car insurance commercials. i wonder if they'll do the gecko next, so that i can have a new title for the worst show i've ever seen. i would even say that this is worse than "viva laughlin." at least "viva laughlin" was ripped off from something that was somewhat inspired.<br /><br />shows like this make me hope that there's a comet up there somewhere aimed for earth.<br /><br />(unratable honestly...)
