this was the worst movie i've ever seen in theaters. it was just a compilation of recycled material. people getting hit in the head is not funny. people getting kicked is not funny. after the third time a guy got kicked in the balls not even the youngest audience member was laughing anymore. it just got tired fast.<br /><br />i went with my younger sister. she actually laughs out loud at king of the hill but this cinematic masterpiece bored her. i'm not surprised. the story is pretty lame. a midget thief steals a big diamond in what was definitely the easiest heist in hollywood history. then he hides out with a family pretending to be a baby. i know it sounds exciting but that's the whole story. say those two lines over and over for 1.5 hours and you'll get the picture there were predictable jokes galore. i really felt ripped off after seeing this. i wasn't expecting much and i was still disappointed. i wish keenan would just hire some decent writers to write jokes and/or his next script. this was even worse than white chicks if that is possible. i've seen high school plays that were better, and cheaper.<br /><br />there wasn't anything positive about this movie. i don't like my entertainment to be dumbed down.
