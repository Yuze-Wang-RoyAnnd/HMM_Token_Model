band camp was awful, the naked mile was a little better, and this third straight to dvd in the american pie franchise seems the same quality as the predecessor. basically erik stifler (john white) split from his girlfriend after losing his virginity, and now him and mike 'cooze' coozeman (jake siegel) are joining erik's cousin dwight (steve talley) at college. with the promise of many parties, plenty of booze, and enough hot chicks at the beta house, they only have fifty listed tasks to carry out to become official privileged members. but a threat comes into sight with the rivals, gek ("geek") house, led by power-hungry nerd (and sheep shagger) edgar (tyrone savage) offering bigger and better than what beta have. to settle it once and for all, beta and gek go into battle with the banned, for forty years, greek games to beat each other in, with the loser moving out. the last champion of the games, noah levenstein aka jim's dad (the only regular eugene levy) runs the show, which sees the people unhooking bras, a gladiator duel floating on water, catching a greased pig, russian roulette in the mouth with cartridges of aged horse spunk, wife carrying and drinking a full keg of alcohol (with puking not disqualifying). it all comes to the sudden death, with a guy getting stripper lap dancing, and they have to resist cumming, beta house win when edgar cums with a girl dressed as a sheep on his lap. also starring flubber's christopher mcdonald as mr. stifler, meghan heffern as ashley, dan petronijevic as bull, nic nac as bobby, christine barger as margie, italia ricci as laura johnson, moshana halbert as sara coleman, sarah power as denise, andreja punkris as stacy and jordan prentice as rock. the nudity amount is very slightly increased, as is the grossness of the jokes, and i could guess it being rated one star out of five, but i like it. adequate!
