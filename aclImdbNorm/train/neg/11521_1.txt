this movie is truly one of the worst pieces of garbage ever. it really is surprising that something so completely terrible could be made. but, if you can stand the mind-numbing plot, character development, and direction, you may get a kick out of the soundtrack which is so appalling that it is funny. the movie begins terribly and quickly becomes unwatchable. someone should give anyone involved with this movie some sort of consolation because their career was probably ruined because of involvement in this movie. if you do end up seeing this movie or have seen it already (i feel your pain) then these words have come too late. for anyone else, stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will waste 2 hours of your life. then at least you can clean up or something while viewing it.
