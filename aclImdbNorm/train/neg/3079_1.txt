my favorite quote from crow was, when the car was going off the cliff, "the movie is so bad, even the car wants to get out of it!"<br /><br />this had to be the funniest movie i have ever seen. it was seriously out there to scare you, which makes it even funnier! if it weren't for mystery science theater i wouldn't be here today! :-p
