the animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds, and looks more like caricatures rather than characters. i've been a fan of scooby doo ever since the series premiered in 1969. i didn't think much of the scooby doo animated movies, (i'm talking about the tv series, not the full length movies.), but some of them were pretty cool, and i like most people found scrappy doo to be an irritant, but this series is pure garbage. as soon as i saw the animation, and heard the characters, (and i use that term loosely) speak, i cringed. also, mystery inc., was a team, and without the entire crew to compliment each other, it just seems like opening up a box of chocolates to find someone has already ate the best ones, and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants. what's new scooby doo was better than this. if you're going to have a scooby doo tv series, include the elements that made the series endure so long. the entire cast of characters, and quality animation. they need to put this one back under the rock from where it came.
