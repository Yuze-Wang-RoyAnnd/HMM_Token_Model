i should have trusted my instincts better: no expectations - no disappointments. instead, however, i expected to experience a similar masterpiece like koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed. powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor, and - artistically - it fails miserably. it appears some producer gathered up leftover material from koyaanisqatsi, hurriedly threw it together, placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of philip glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music, which is incessantly repeated. where koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes, powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow-motion (if you view them on your vcr in fast preview mode, you'll see what i mean). what disappointed me the most, however, was philip glass's soundtrack. i couldn't - and still can't - believe that these commercial-sounding new age type drones, which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14-year-old on a casio calculator, were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly-synchronized music for koyaanisqatsi. all in all, a big waste of time! my advice: forget commercialism! watch koyaanisqatsi again instead!
