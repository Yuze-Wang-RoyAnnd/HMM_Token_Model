films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning. while there are some exceptions, the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes. the kids in paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds, as they're both very annoying and they don't have an ounce of acting ability between them. in short; they're rubbish. this isn't good considering that they're the leads, and it especially isn't good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors. it's a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isn't (not completely). it follows a young girl who, after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook, wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created. it soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings, and so sets about making various changes, until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare. oh dear.<br /><br />as you can see, this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie. however, it is squandered through a number of fatal faults. first and foremost, in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness; the movie is extremely stale. the central plot is hardly played with at all, and the result is an entirely boring experience. the lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie, as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just don't care any more (which is due to a lack of ideas). thanks in part to it's lead characters, the film feels like a kids movie throughout. this is to be expected as it stars kids, but bernard rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story; as the horror in the movie is laughable at best. the film is also very cheesy, and the 'romance' between the two leads is extremely cringe-worthy, and makes for very painful viewing. in fact, if i had to sum this travesty up in one word, i would choose 'painful'. paperhouse is poorly acted, laughably plotted, very corny and dull on the whole. save yourself the pain, see something else.
