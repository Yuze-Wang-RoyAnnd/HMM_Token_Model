i am not from america and i know what 'wife swap' is. when a show came out of that name i was thrilled to see some cool glamorized sexual moments from the program. but what i got was a real sucking stupidity. i was misjudged by its title name, it has no adult contents, no nudity, not even vulgar dialogues (broad casted threw hallmark channel and i think they edited/mute out such contents to make it neat).<br /><br />a show which gives a picture of current american/western family state, overweight chubby peoples, polluted teenagers, and their sucking family goings. in each episode two wives/two mothers (more correctly) were chosen to live in each others home and re-changes each others family routine with their new own rule. sometimes its turns out to be good or more evenly bad. on the ending section each mothers are brought back with their husband and try to conclude what they did to each families past days. it's the sucking portion of the program were each contenders fights for their rights. i was sucked to see all of these instead of seeing some cool adult sex stuff. i mean who make this program, more than that who gave the name "wife swap"; its better to be called as "mother swap". all in all it corrupts all the great things the real wife swap stands for! <br /><br />wife swap = average sucking reality show.
