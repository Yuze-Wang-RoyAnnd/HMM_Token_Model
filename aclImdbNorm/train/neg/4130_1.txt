a top contender for worst film ever made. joanna pakula's character seems to have an i.q. of 3 which is only one less than the writer and director. the screenplay would not have passed in a high school writing class; the "jokes" are juvenile; the concept corny. these performers were obviously desperate for work. i stayed to the end only to see if it would get worse. it did. life is too short to spend any part of it watching this film.
