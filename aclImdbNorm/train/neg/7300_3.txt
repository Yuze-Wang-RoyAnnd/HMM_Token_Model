this film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods. one of the friends catches a horrifying flesh-eating virus. suddenly, the friends turn on one another in a desperate attempt to keep from contracting the disease themselves.<br /><br />"cabin fever" is a horrible film. for one, it tries to be many genres at once. is it supposed to be a homage, a slasher, a black comedy, or a scary movie with unintentional comedy? nobody can tell. there's a serious scene at first and a second alter, it turns funny. when the film tries to be funny, the humor is quite bland, excluding the ending. i liked the ending a lot.<br /><br />but apart from the ending, i was pretty disappointed and disgusted. the violence is cringe-worthy, more looking away from the screen than being scared. the tone changes within each scene, sometimes funny, sometimes scary, and sometimes quite random. in fact, you see a girl doing karate in slo-motion. what are we supposed to get from that? this same girl would bite one of the characters. was that supposed to be funny? i don't know.<br /><br />some of the performances were decent, and many were quite amateurish. i didn't care for most of the characters. i liked the plot but the execution was done horribly. as a horror film, i didn't know what it was trying to be. i didn't find it funny, tense, nor scary. by the end, you're left indifferent, thinking, "what have i just been through?" unfortunately, you'll never know the answer to that question.
