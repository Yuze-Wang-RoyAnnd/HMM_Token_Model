i initially gained interest in this film after reading a review saying this movie reminded the reviewer of silent hill.<br /><br />being a huge silent hill fan, and disappointed with it's movie debut, i thought i would give this one a chance. mind, fearnet only lists this movie as "dark floors", not by it's full name. so when i saw the name "mr. lordi" in the credits i immediately thought of the band (i had a few friends in college that like them) but didn't think it was important and quickly pushed the thought aside.<br /><br />the film starts out strong. despite the fact "creepy little girl" has been done to death, the good use of audio and sense of isolation really started to piece the the story together. the tense atmosphere built rapidly, and every indication pointed to the film being excellent. as monsters are the true stars of horror, i couldn't wait to see what was lurking in the halls of the hospital the main characters had found themselves trapped in...<br /><br />and then the first monster showed up, and i found myself greatly underwhelmed. by the time the second appeared, i boggled at the fact it looked like it had just come from a megadeth concert, and the silliness turned me off completely.<br /><br />over the course of the movie the atmosphere did remain intact, and the story left you wondering just what was going on, but the scares were pretty much non-existent. however, i held out hope that the end would make it all worthwhile. unfortunately that was not to be the case. by the time the movie had reached it's climax, i was in utter disbelief, and i immediately recognized the big bad in his final reveal... the lead singer of lordi? seriously? <br /><br />was that what the movie all boiled down to? a bunch of poor souls being chased around a hospital by lordi band members? the silly monster design suddenly made sense. if you're going to be that corny, may as well through the members of marilyn manson, or even kiss in there too. not to mention the fact that i'm pretty sure i saw the ending in one of lordi's music videos a few years ago. they had to go and make an entire movie off of it? <br /><br />worst of all, when i found out what really had been going on, all i could manage was a yawn. i'm not going to "ruin" it for you, but i can safely say it's probably a plot device you've seen before. most likely more then once.<br /><br />so, unless you're a huge lordi fan, stay away from this. it's not scary, it doesn't bring anything new to the table (although it does a decent job of borrowing from other horror movies, mainly silent hill). and, i can't stress this enough, lordi is the antagonist. lordi. talk about a buzzkill. <br /><br />really, you'd be better off trying to scare yourself watching slipknot music videos. in other words, it's just not possible.
