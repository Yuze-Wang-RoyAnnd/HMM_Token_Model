my personal vision of hell is being locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or block my ears and have this movie play for eternity on every available surface in that room. the whole notion that streisand plays a boy/man only begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous a premise this movie is. the single most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of "willing suspension of disbelief" . . . it is impossible to do that in this movie.
