it's unfortunate that you can't go any lower than one star. prior to watching the wicker man, i had considered aliens 3 to be the only movie that would actually merit negative stars. in all fairness, the wicker man doesn't detract from the enjoyment of an earlier film, but the fact remains that my cumulative movie enjoyment has been reduced by seeing it.<br /><br />there is a cheap trick all too often used in hollywood when the producers are too stingy to hire good writers or in too much of a hurry to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfactory conclusion: slap in a shocker ending and hope that the public will mistake it for something artistic or meaningful. it is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case manages only to splatter embarrassment on a fine actor and ridicule upon the producers. even more so in that the "carefully crafted" (or however they put it) conclusion didn't seem to follow logically from the plot (which naturally i can't elaborate on without introducing spoilers), and instead negates what merit the plot had up to that point.<br /><br />it is a film that might logically appeal to psychopaths, pedophiles, and possibly die-hard nicholas cage fans, but only to a few of the mainstream audience. if you really want something along these lines, i heartily recommend m. night shyamalan's the village instead. lacking some kind of memory-erasing pill, i suppose i need to watch something better to force it from my mind, say, attack of the killer tomatoes or pee-wee's big adventure?
