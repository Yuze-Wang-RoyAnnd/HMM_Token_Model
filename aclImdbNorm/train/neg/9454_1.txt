when my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film, i know it is bad. i wanted to claw my eyes out. i wanted to reach through the screen and slap mike myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had. this is one of the few films in my life i have watched and immediately wished to "unwatch", if only it were possible. the other films being 'troll 2' and 'fast and furious', both which are better than this crap in the hat.<br /><br />i may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget i ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good seuss name.<br /><br />to mike myers, i say stick with austin or even resurrect waynes world. just because it worked for jim carrey, doesn't mean seuss is a success for all canadians.<br /><br />
