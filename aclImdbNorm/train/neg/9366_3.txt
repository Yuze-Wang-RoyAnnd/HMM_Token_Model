i hired out hybrid on the weekend. what a disappointment! a stupid lame attempt at a tele-movie. the guy they got for the lead was totally weak and when running {he did a lot} looked like he was eating those minty sweets...with his backside! the wolf contacts he wore were great, though i feel the actor relied on them too much, as there was nothing menacing about his acting at all. the wise native american indian chick has to be one of the most stony hard faced hags ever seen. talk about a sour cow! she smiled about once for the entire film, and i think that is because she had sex. the sex scene was lame too. they may as well have shown blowing curtains, if you can dig that.<br /><br />last of all, and this is a big pet hate of mine, on the cover and the dvd menu, the losers digitally drew in cool sharp teeth on the guy. they were nowhere to be seen in the film. :(
