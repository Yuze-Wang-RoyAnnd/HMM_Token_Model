okay the promos promised a comedy and people(few) went to watch it being the first release of 2006 is not a bad thing, or for that matter of any year, because the first and last films mostly flop except ghajini and some more<br /><br />okay coming to jawani diwani<br /><br />review in short the film is about emraan hashmi doing his usual stuff sadly it's annoying this time after repetitions it has an irritating hrishita bhatt and a flop celina jaitley<br /><br />cringeworthy dialogues, comedy scenes and badly handled drama and lots of loopholes<br /><br />direction is bad emraan hashmi is annoying here, luckily now he is coming of age but post footpath and murder and some decent work in some more films the actor in him took a backseat and directors focused on his kisses and womaniser image which sadly lost it's touch after repetitions hrishita and celina are bad mahesh is horrible
