jean luc godard's marxist polemic is as close to unwatchable a film as you're likely to see from an internationally respected filmmaker. bits of political theater, mind-numbingly boring and interminable, are interspersed with the making of "sympathy for the devil", featuring the rolling stones in the studio.<br /><br />the process of the song's development, from mick jagger playing a demo on acoustic guitar, to the backing vocals being recorded towards the end, is fascinating, and it's worth renting this film just to see the bits with the stones. almost half the movie is devoted to this, so thanks to the miracle of chapter stops, you can skip all the bizarre political skits and just watch the stones put a song together.<br /><br />when i had this on laserdisc, i valiantly attempted to watch it all, but i don't see how anyone could get through it. i finally gave up and just chapter-skipped my way to the stones segments.
