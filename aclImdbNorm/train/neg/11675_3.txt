yes i know "talkies" had just been invented for the cinema 2 years earlier when this was produced in 1929 but this film showed that much had to learnt about the art of producing films.it comes over as a filmed "hammy" stage play with the actors melodramatically enunciating their lines,rolling their eyes, using too many pregnant pauses and using gestures more appropriate to silent cinema, which i suppose was normal during the process of educating them to appear more naturalistic on screen.the gaps between lines spoken should have been tightened up during editing as it considerably slows the film.it is now only of interest for titanic buffs who want to see an early example of this marine accident on film.in next chronological order they could see "titanic" (1953) a night to remember (1958)"titanic (1997), to see how the cinema's depiction of this tragedy as evolved over the years.there have been many documentaries and tv films made including the atrocious "sos titanic" (1979) on my version which is a dvd, david mccallum gives the introduction.it was he who played harold bride marconi's junior wireless operator in "a night to remember"(still the best feature film - please read my "tribute to walter" comments on imdb under howard morley.demon.co.uk)and gave the commentary on the series of 4 videos entitled "end of a dream" so he was well qualified to give the narration.of more interest i found was a recording accompanied by actual photos of the 1912 us senate hearing which is also on the dvd.actors speak the actual words spoken by lightoller 2nd officer, j bruce ismay,managing director of white star, harold bride and others including gloria stewart (the "old rose" in titanic 1997) whose voice is used for one of the first class women survivors.
