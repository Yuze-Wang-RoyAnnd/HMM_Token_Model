as a huge fan of only the first 2 seasons of bsg and the stand alone feature bsg razor i was hoping that this release would return the franchise to its original glory days. usually i have no problem with science fiction that is mostly dialog driven as opposed to a visual bonanza of special effects. if the script is tight with some original ideas delivered by good actors one can create a profound film with little cgi money spent. this prequel has none of those aforementioned requirements going for it. the virtual reality world created by the terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous & unbelievable. this scene was simply put there to raise the release rating to restricted. not that teens don't love virtual reality mosh pits filled with sex & violence & heavy dance music. its the part about those same teens having the intellectual depth & reason or political & religious passion as to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers that perplexes me. these kids are definitely not from this planet. the movie plays out like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being slightly interesting. the scene with eric stolz giving his cyborg a devine conscienceness via the student firmware upgrade was amusing if not entertaining. but this old concept was far better portrayed & much more believable in the brilliant, classic original "frankenstein" with boris karloff. caprica rips off its only interesting idea from an old hollywood horror film. no surprise there! overall this movie was bland & unoriginal & cheap looking, using recycled cgi of caprica from bsg. i doubt i'll be watching this space soap when it premieres on the sci-fi channel. unless of course i happen to be suffering from a bad bout of insomnia at which time this show would definitely be the cure. zzzzzzzz
