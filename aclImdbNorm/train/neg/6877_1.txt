i sat down to watch a documentary about puerto rico, and i ended up watching one about nuyoricans. when i go to puerto rico, i fail to see the 50% that live in poverty. when i do see struggling people, they are usually haitians, dominicans, or cubans that have recently arrived to the island. there is no such thing as spanglish... either you speak spanish, or you don't.... and from what i heard... you don't. pedro albizo campos is not mlk to me. mlk was a great man. campos is a great man to those that want independence which is 1%. to the rest he as loco as osama bin laden. puertoricans that want independence are a bunch of fools. if you want any proof to all of you dreamers of an independent puerto rico see cuba, haiti, dominican republic, bahamas, all of south and central america, and mexico. its worked wonders for them. this documentary is not about puerto rico, this documentary was about the nuyoricans and their struggles.<br /><br />to the person that complaint that not enough of africa was on the show... it was suppose to be about puerto rico... not africa. denzel will make one shortly just for you.<br /><br />in conclusion... to all those ignorant white people that think we need green cards to come to the us, and want to learn how the prime minister runs things, this is not a good documentary about puertorican culture. tell your kids to pay attention in geography, and history class.<br /><br />***update***<br /><br />bocabonita... "doc." was about nuyoricans. she promoted it as if its how we all feel. should have been titled... "yo soy nuyorican... lunche...can't speak spanish." please stop using puerto rico, rican, boricua, or anything else associated with pr with this nuyorican historical lesson. god forbid they play this on the island.
