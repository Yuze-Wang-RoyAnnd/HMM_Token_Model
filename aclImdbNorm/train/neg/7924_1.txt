ted v. mikels's film corpse grinders 2 is 103 minutes of excruciating cinematic swill. the plot is pretty much a mixture of nonsensical business dealings among people who grind corpses into cat food while cat aliens, who are losing a war with dog aliens, looking to get some of this cat food. watching this movie, i began to look for any kind of distraction, anything to reassure myself that i was doing something else besides losing my mind from the inside out.<br /><br />several scenes go on for far too long, as characters take forever to do simple things. i've heard that mr. mikels doesn't like to use jump cuts too often, fearful that they will confuse his audience. i'm not sure if this attitude is "avant-garde" or just "stupid." try as i might, i could not bring myself to care about any of the characters in the unnecessarily huge cast, well with the possible exception of the old men who are the caretakers of the factory. the majority of the cast are a bunch of no-talent amateurs who don't even bother to learn the lyrics to "amazing grace" before they have to sing it on camera. although perhaps the blame should go to the poor sound quality, since i only actually heard around 80% of the dialogue while watching the dvd.<br /><br />this is quite possibly the worst film to ever be shot. i've listened to snippets of the commentary,and mr. mikels comes off as a surprisingly sweet old man, what the hell was he doing making this kind of trash? i'd like to hear the explanations from the old men who had to lie shirtless on a metal conveyor belt waiting to be ground up. movies i've long hated suddenly seem a lot better. i long for the intermittedly appropriate music of excalibur, and the consistent lighting of dawn of the dead. i need to go do something, anything. don't see this movie.
