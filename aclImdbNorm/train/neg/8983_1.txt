ulises is a literature teacher that arrives to a coastal town. there, he will fell in love to martina, the most beautiful girl in town. they will start a torrid romance which will end in the tragic death of ulises at the sea. some years later, martina has married to sierra, the richest man in town and lives a quiet happy live surrounded by money. one day, the apparition of ulises will make her passion to rise up and act without thinking the consequences. the plot is quite absurd and none of the actors plays a decent part. in addition, three quarters of the film are sexual acts, which, still being well filmed, are quite tiring, as we want to see more development of the story. it is just a bad bigas luna's film, with lots of sex, no argument and stupid characters everywhere.
