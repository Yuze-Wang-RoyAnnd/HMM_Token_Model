first of all, this plot is way overdone - girl wants to make it, everyone loves her, snobby girl intervenes, all looks lost, girl pulls through, everyone loves her again etc. throw in the fitting in thing, an attractive male crushing on the heroine, plus single-parent troubles and it's so predictable that you can practically recite along with it.<br /><br />second of all, i really hate how they keep on dissing classical music. they send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and close-minded - in fact, i don't recall the quote exactly, but i remember at one point in the movie, holly says, "why do they have to be so uptight...so classical?" it's really insulting how label classical music in this way.<br /><br />third, i've went over it dozens of times, but the only reason that i can think of for making this movie is to promote britney spears. there just isn't any point at all.<br /><br />and oh yeah, while the actress who portrayed holly (i'm not sure whether that was really her singing or not) had a reasonably good voice, it wasn't as amazing as they were making it out to be - especially when she was belting. she was oversupporting the whole time.<br /><br />1/10 stars.
