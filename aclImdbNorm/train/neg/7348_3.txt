i was really disappointed with this film. the first waters movie i saw was serial mom and i loved it. then i saw pecker and i loved it. then i watched polyester and really sort of hated it. the only thing i liked about that movie was divine. she/he had a hell of a lot of talent. i was truly surprised. as a whole, i wouldn't recommend this film...
