it's 1982, two years after the iranian embassy siege which involved the dramatic sas rescue from the balconys, and with a war with argentina over the falkland islands currently taking place, what better film to make than a gung-ho "sas" film that re-creates the iranian hostage siege, whilst using britains number one action hero of the day, lewis collins. throw in edward woodward and a few other well known actors and you've got a winner on your hands?...well maybe not! the film itself doesn't make the situation serious enough, whilst the acting is quite second rate. it's like a movie long episode of "the professionals", but without the formula. this film goes nowhere fast and is quite predictable. maybe cubby brocoli watched this film and decided to ditch lewis collins as a touted james bond replacement for roger moore. watch it if your a fan of lewis collins or sas stuff in general, if not, save your time.
