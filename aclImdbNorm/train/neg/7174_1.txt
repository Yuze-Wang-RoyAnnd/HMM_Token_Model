i wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules: this movie is aweful! from the acting to the non-realistic animation to the countless errors. i was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination (can't extend flaps without engines). the landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity. that tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear. the one thing i thought was quite peculiar is when they landed, the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off, thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air. how did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that weren't touching the ground? did they forget the spoilers? word to the director: find out *all* you can about planes before attempting a "plane" movie. sorry for the technical rant, but i give this movie 1/10.
