without question one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s, gaots seems to really, really want to be something important. the tragic truth is that it's so entirely valueless on every level that one can't help but laugh. reaching in desperation for the earthy elements of ingmar bergman's films, it follows a city couple's day in the wilderness...they walk along a shady path, allthewhile pontificating like a u.c. berkeley coffee clatch. almost every line of tarradiddle dialog delivered here is uproariously bad("i feel that life itself is made up of as many tiny compartments as this pomegranate....but is it as beautiful?") after what seems like an eternity of absolutely nothing happening(well...ok...we are treated to some nudity and a tepid soft sex scene), there is finally a very anticlimactic confrontation involving a pair 'nam vets who are making the nature scene and performing some pretty harsh folk ballads with an acoustic guitar. <br /><br />nothing at all eventful or interesting happens in this entire film. i thought the larry buchanan picture "strawberries need rain" was a weak example of a bergman homage. "golden apples" is every bit as bad, but the ceaseless random verbiage it presents makes it memorably awful. 1/10
