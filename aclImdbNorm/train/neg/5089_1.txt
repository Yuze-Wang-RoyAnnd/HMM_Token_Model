it's so sad that romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows, as superficial and brutal as the "garcea" series or the "vacanta mare" child-plays... the difference is that mugur mih"aescu, doru octavian dumitru and other such sub-artisans never presume to claim their shows as "art". pintilie, who 40 years ago made a very good movie ("duminic"a la ora sase") followed by another one, nice enough ("reconstituirea"), tries to declare his film-lenghts "art works" - but, unfortunately, he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression. as such, "niki ardelean" offers again a sample of "how not" - this being about its only merit.
