much like the early horror film the boogens, the devious unseen killer is quite a letdown when it finally becomes seen. although animal house's stephen furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest, his performance is more comedy than horror.<br /><br />the plot, an extremely tired one, has three sexy women(bach, lamm and lois young) unable to find a hotel for the evening, so they willingly accept to stay with a seemingly kind museum curator, exceptionally played by the deceased sydney lassick. if you have ever seen any horror film, you know that lovable il' sydney is a deranged psycho, so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies.<br /><br />the three women are all very attractive, especially barbara bach, but lois young(a helen hunt clone) is the only one to go nude, as sydney watches her take a bath.
