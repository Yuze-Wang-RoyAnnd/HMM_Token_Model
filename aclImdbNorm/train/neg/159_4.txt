i have always admired susan sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor. i therefor found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts. her character's rescue from the south pole was done by a canadian charter company from edmonton, alberta flying a canadian designed and built twin otter aircraft. the trip had been turned down by the us airforce, navy and coast guard as beyond their capabilities. the same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the south pole base. i feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task. i fail to see why the producers would find it necessary ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a usaf hercules.
