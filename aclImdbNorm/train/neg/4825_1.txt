judging by the hype, and other reviews on this site, i was ready for an awesome horror movie focusing on junkies. what i got was complete crap focusing on junkies. i wonder if there's another movie called "cookers" that these people reviewed? there are only 3 main characters, and none of them struck me as well-written or well-acted. basically the whole movie i just spent shaking my head and marveling at the stupidity of these drug addicts.<br /><br />do yourself a favor. don't rent this movie. rent "cabin fever" or some other decent horror movie. hell, rent "mary poppins"! the animated penguins are scarier and more convincing than anything you'll find in "cookers."
