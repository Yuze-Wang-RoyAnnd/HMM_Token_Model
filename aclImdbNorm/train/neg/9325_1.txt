s.i.c.k. really stands for so incredibly crappy i killed myself. there was absolutely no acting to speak of. the best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the box.the budgeting of this movie was sufficient. the filming was sub sesame street. the production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits. the props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store. the ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh. if there is a book out there for this movie i'm sure it's better. i would avoid this at all costs. i did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it. just kidding.
