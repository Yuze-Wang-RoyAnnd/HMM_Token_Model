considering that i felt like picking up a new jet li film to see some but kicking and brainless hand to hand fighting, i grabbed this title.<br /><br />unfortunatly, this movie contains more gun battles (ala chow yun fat but nowhere near as good), than jet li and company's acrobatic fighting. thus it was a let down.<br /><br />the faucet fighting was interesting and even funny, considering this was something totaly unexpected in a jet li film for me, more on the line of say jackie chan.<br /><br />but alas i'd recommend fist of legend, tai chi master, or even the enforcer over this dissapointment.<br /><br />rating 4 for martial arts rating 3 for overall movie score
