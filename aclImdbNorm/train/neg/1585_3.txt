:::spoiler alert:::<br /><br />soooo, arnie's really a good guy, but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and some disobeying of orders, he's sent to jail (or rather some sort of work camp). he escapes, but after a short while he's caught once again. this time ends up in a freakish reality show in which he's supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes, and eventually die. but we all know arnie, and we all know that he's tougher than even the toughest of tough guys.<br /><br />i really wanted to like this movie, being an arnie-fan and all. however, "the running man" contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me. e.g. the reconstruction of arnie's fight inside the helicopter, where the shocked audience is showed a short summary of the incident, complete with 5-10 different camera angles. this means that the military helicopter in which arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras filming the crew members, one of which _inside_ the eye of one of the crew members arnie beats.<br /><br />there are other flaws also, and the plot, which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative, works for a while, then it sort of creates a pool of stupidness and unrealism in which it drowns.<br /><br />the acting can't really be said to be anything better than sub par, with arnie in the leading role, doing an average arnie performance. the rest of the cast get by without being especially good or bad.<br /><br />the special effects are ok, without being impressive.<br /><br />rating: 3/10
