unfortunately, this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original. nicholas cage, fairly wooden as far as actors go, imbues the screen with a range of skill from, non-plussed to over the top. the supporting cast is no better.<br /><br />the plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse. not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold. it turns out it's just a bill of poor goods. disbelief cannot be suspended, nor can a befit of a doubt be given. the only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual, as the medium requires, and whomever scouted the location should be commended.<br /><br />there was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos, literally, at the end.<br /><br />disappointed! wait for the original to come on television, pour a whiskey and enjoy.
