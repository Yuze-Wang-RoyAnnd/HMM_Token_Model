this 2003 made for tv movie was shown on a women's channel, naturally. as a man, why do i even attempt to watch this? i don't know, but i should have my head examined. and director and writer simon gornick should be ashamed of himself to give men an injustice as he does. he takes away any strength and conviction a man could have by having several boring women do him in. number one bore is joyce hyser as the wife. i couldn't wait for him to drop her. her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing through most of the movie. the other femme fatale was nichole hiltz, about the coldest person you'd ever want to meet. her looks didn't warrant our leading man to go that ape over her and her acting was so obvious, only a fool could miss. definitely a loser. tembi locke was pretty good, but slow on the uptake as to the slut seducing her own husband, again played as a guy who is a loser, by david deluise. rounding out our cast of losers is anthony denison as a boss who has little to do but scowl at our hero. stephen jenkins as our hero, or should i say victim, was not that good. at first i thought he just a bad actor, but later i believed it. he never got the part off the ground and was repetitive throughout. although, as a man, i became enraged when the two women got away with it. men, beware of this channel that puts men down and women get away even with murder. lmn is the channel. beware. note: having watched this a second time by mistake, i am convinced on my initial thoughts. especially on the writer/director, simon gornick. i still believe he has disgraced the male species and should be horse whipped. only saving grace in this film is tembi locke who doesn't have a chance to show her talents with the awful acting of jenkins, hyser, hiltz and deluise around her. plus the stupid plot that only makes it worse. down with gornick's movie and his vacant stars in it. please lmn don't show this trite again.
