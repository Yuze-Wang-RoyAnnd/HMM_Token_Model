this movie was disappointing. it was incomplete and dull. while alec baldwin tried to portray himself as the perfect fair and just prosecutor (not to mention executive producer), the movie never showed any of the defense counsels or tried to challenge the audience with an actual meaningful debate on the subject of how a country could be led down such a terrible path.<br /><br />sure, nobody wants to defend the nazi's point of view, but that was the point of the nuremberg trails! four hours of simply bashing on the nazi's.... c'mon! thats been done already!<br /><br />i really think alec baldwin should just stick to being kim bassinger's husband.<br /><br />right after the movie ended, tnt showed the 1959 movie, trail at nuremberg. that movie is far superior.
