hopelessly inept and dull movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly. you might think things would perk up when they explore mars but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red/orange filter which makes everything very murky. the martian landscape/vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing. there are echoes of 'bride of the monster' when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about, the difference being that the ed wood film is a hundred times more entertaining. better wear earplugs when watching otherwise the 'sci-fi' music score, repeated endlessly, will drive you insane. if you find yourself unable to sleep one night just slip this one into the vcr and your insomnia will be cured in no time.
