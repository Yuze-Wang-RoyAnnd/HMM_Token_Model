this movie is unworthy of the omen title. it is so bad that it has actually damaged the classic nature of the first three. it never should have been made, they ought to change the title.<br /><br />they don't even spell damien thorn's name correctly!!!! and there are no daggers, the most important element of all the omen films. pull it from the shelves and burn it.
