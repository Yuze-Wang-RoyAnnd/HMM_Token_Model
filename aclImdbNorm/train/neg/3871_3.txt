i try to be very objective when i view a low budget movie. i also apply a lower weight to independent and low budget productions versus the big budget productions. i expect near flawlessness from big budget productions and their studios. therefore i apply tougher criteria to the major studio releases. but this movie was just a dud. period. the premise was terrible. the main character, mary gordano (alicia silverstone), was unbelievable as a high school senior with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes. there was not enough depth in her character or her acting that pulled you into her world. also, to make this movie more mysterious, the lighting in certain scenes did not set the mood, especially in the warehouse.<br /><br />once again another disappointing movie that i could only give three points to.
