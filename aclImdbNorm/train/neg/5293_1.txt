i picked up this video after reading the text on the box, the story seemed good, and it had keanu reeves! but after 5 minutes of watching, i noticed how horrible his acting was, he walks and talks so stupid the whole time, it's fake and not convincing. it doesn't end there, almost all the characters act so badly it's laughable, the only acceptable acting was by alan boyce (david), but the guy commits suicide early on and you don't see him again, you never even know why he did it! everything about this movie screams low quality, i can't believe how such a thing gets released! i was tempted many times to stop watching, in fact i did, half way through it i decided to stop watching and turned the thing off, came to the imdb to check what other's thought about it, i found zero comments (not surprised), so i decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it then come here to comment on it. the only good thing going (for me) was the high-school rock band theme, the occasional guitar playing and singing parts, but that's not worth it.<br /><br />very bad acting and directing... terrible movie.
