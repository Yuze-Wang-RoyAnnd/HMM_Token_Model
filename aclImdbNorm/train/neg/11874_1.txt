what the hell is this? "kooky drama"? "lawyers in loony tunes land"? the world's thinnest, most duck-faced actress (even more duck-faced and anorexic than michelle pfeiffer) overacts her bony butt off, making cretinous grimaces that would shame bugs bunny, in one of the most animated non-animated tv series ever. this is also the most annoying one-hour-format tv show ever, hence the worst.<br /><br />all the men act like pansies, and i for one refuse to believe that even hip big-city shysters are all as delta-male-like as this sorry (short) bunch. wuss peter macnicol manages to be even more irritating than calista flockofducks with his fake hollywood "shshshs" speech impediment: it's the sort of pseudo-inability to pronounce the letter "s" by turning it into a moronic "sh" that the likes of jon shtewart and christian shlater also practice with zeal. watching macnicol talk, i always wonder how come his jaw doesn't dislocate... human facial anatomy was never meant to support the pronouncing of the "sh" sound more than three times per second. he is a medical wonder.<br /><br />this badly conceived and written legal-drama/comedy hodgepodge also features some very 90s pc. it has political correctness written with huge, neon letters. is there anything more unrealistic than a bunch of lawyers being full of ideals, high principles, and moral fiber? laughable, but that's the way defense lawyers have been portrayed in hollywood since its inception. after all, what is more noble than defending a murderer, a rapist, or a thief? when a tv series as retarded as "ally mcbeak" starts preaching to america about how it should run the country, then it must be time for paris hilton to become president. "ally mcquack" is both a product of recent and large-scale western dumbing-down and a perpetrator of it.<br /><br />those supposed touches of "eccentricity", like the unbelievably annoying musical numbers, are unconvincing and embarrassingly unfunny. this is no monty python. whatever "new" the talent-free makers of this garbage were aiming for, they failed with honours. "ally mcbeak" is a highly commercialized tv venture aimed at indiscriminating yuppies, bored housewives, and bipolar lawyers. it's yet another dull "objection overruled sustained your honour may i call the witness" legalistic baloney that the american audiences seem to eat up with relish for some strange reason...
