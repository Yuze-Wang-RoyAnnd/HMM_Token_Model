i saw this movie in 1979, i was 17 or 18, when it was released. the theater was perhaps 1/4 full when the movie started. ten minutes into the movie me and the friend who went with me to see the film were the only two people in the theater. the movie was really weird and had no plot or reason to its script and people demanded their money back. we decided to stay for the entire movie.... why endure such torture??... here's why. we wanted to be true movie critics... to have a standard to base all other movies on it is hard to justify saying you have seen the best movie (a 10)they always come up with something better. but, it is easy to be able to base all other movies off of the worst movie ever made (and this is it... a 1 at best). there may be other movies out there that truly qualify as a 1, but i have yet to see them. i now base all movies i see on a scale based on this worst....i am a true movie critic...he he.
