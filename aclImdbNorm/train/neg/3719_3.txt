imagine pulling back the mask of a lethal assassin and finding barbara cartland there... that's what happens with this film.<br /><br />the opening showed promise, but soon it drops all pretenses of being a thriller (or even an imaginative love story) and the only reason they made this story becomes abundantly clear: to fill a gap in their female viewing market by creating yet another re-hash of 'mis-understood, brooding bad-boy' (andrei) meets 'innocent, whimsical beauty' (paula). <br /><br />rather than waste any time in creating an original premise, the filmmakers went straight for the money-shot: the bad boy being tamed by said whimsical beauty. thence follows a string of insincere and heavily-clich'ed love scenes sprinkled with pseudo philosophical/poetic fluff. andrei's admission of being (eponymously) a 'poet' is levered in to round out the perceived qualities a byronic hero should have - but even when we're told in heavy, underlined writing who and what he is, it's still difficult to believe it - or care.<br /><br />for a byronic hero/antihero to work, the story needs subtlety, style and innovation - all of which are utterly absent here. this is not a modern day phantom of the opera, it's just what happens when a weak and rather silly woman (with loose knicker elastic) dates a bad man, who, after meeting her, seems as dangerous as bunny slippers.<br /><br />the performances might have saved this film, had they been any good: the female lead is preoccupied with looking sexy and 'otherworldly', no matter how forced or ridiculous; and poor dougray scott appears to have been drugged as he shambles through his part. this is not his best work. the glimmers of interest were brought by j"urgen prochnow as 'vashon', and andrew lee potts as the young photographer/brother. a better movie would have offed the sister and kept the brother instead.
