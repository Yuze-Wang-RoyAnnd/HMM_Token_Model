this is the most messed up entry on imdb that i've yet to stumble across. all the previous reviewers act like this is the movie. this is not the movie. rather it's merely a featurette that's an extra on the dvd of the movie "the one" it also nowhere near being the 90 minutes that it's listed here as. in actuality it's barely over 13 minutes of how cool jet li can do martial arts. and his reflections on the movie. so yeah this imdb entry is quite a bit fubar. don't listen to any of the other reviews as they are all wrong. you can trust me, because i never feed you, dear reader, bs.<br /><br />and that's the truth. i guess u can say that i'm "the one" reviewer that matters.
