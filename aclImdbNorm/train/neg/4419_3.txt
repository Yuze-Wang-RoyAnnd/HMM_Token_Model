as a "lapsed catholic" who had 11 years of catholic school, but hasn't been to mass in 35 years except for weddings and funerals, i thought i'd get a kick out of this. and i did . . . for the first two-thirds of the movie. it was all the standard stuff -- strict parochial school teachings, repressed sexuality, etc. but then, suddenly, the movie turned mean. really mean. now mind you, i saw this before the pedophilia scandals hit . . . and maybe i wouldn't have been quite so offended at such nasty, hateful digs at the catholic church if i'd known about those abominations (such a catholic term!) and coverups.<br /><br />it's been a few years since i rented the video, and i won't go back to rent it again with a new perspective. it just left such a dirty, nasty, ugly taste in my mouth . . . i wonder what experience all the actors had with the church, because either they *really* hate it, or they whored themselves for the paycheck. it's an incredibly anti-catholic movie, offensive to anyone who has a glimmer of a gleam of respect for catholic education. which i still do because there were no better teachers back in the '50s. whatever else those nuns did, they forced me to learn how to read and write the english language. they made us memorize. (how many kids today can do simple arithmetic in their heads?) truth is, there's nothing more essential for success in america. can ya read? can ya add/subtract/multiply/divide? great. you can get any advanced degree you want. and the discipline of catholic education will stand you in good stead, not just as you continue your studies, but also for the rest of your life, no matter what you think of the catholic "mythology" we all had to learn.<br /><br />such a great cast, such a lousy, rotten script. i really feel bad (and no, it's not "badly" -- trust me, the nuns taught me better) for the writer and director.<br /><br />i thought i had mixed emotions about catholic school. but the participants in this project must've been those bad (ie.e, stupid) kids who sat in the back of the room, if they were willingly involved in making this movie.
