not only does this movie have a poor plot, bad direction, and terrible acting, its opens up a whole new meaning to racism.<br /><br />in this film "white" chicks are the sluts, "white" boys are the wana-be gangsters, and successful (yes again) "white" businessmen are revolting toilet shitters.<br /><br />i just wonder what would happen if i made the exact same movie with the exact same story line and script, only i made it about caucasians. "he dude, its good to finally see your've stopped dating those black chicks".<br /><br />nobody seems to notice it, but watch this film again and you'll vomit at how they have portrayed the new zealand "white boys". all of a sudden its white folks who are the main cause of gang aggression, and whores out for a quick bang. only samoans girls have a heart, there's no such thing as a non-slutty white girl.<br /><br />it disgusts me that they couldn't make this film without giving the caucasian community in new zealand a repulsive profile. if you think i'm overgeneralizing, go watch this film, and see what you make of the "white boys". just because samoans choose to call us "white boys" in actual life, doesn't mean its funny. if i said hey black boy i'll loose my teeth.<br /><br />don't see this movie. don't waste your money. don't be racist.
