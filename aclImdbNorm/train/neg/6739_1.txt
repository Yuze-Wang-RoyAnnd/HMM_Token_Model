one wonders why anyone would try to rehash successful movie plots that have already been seen, like it's the case with this movie. "the wedding date" is one of the best examples of why not to even try to remake, under the guise of a new story, something that should have been let alone. if a project like this goes ahead with the studio big honchos' approval, then go all out with big stars and glossy production values, that way, people will come for the stars.<br /><br />alas, that's not what happens in this misguided attempt at comedy. the problem seems to be the way the screen writers have transplanted the story to london, when basically, this seems to be a typical american situation that not even the setting will be able to fix. then there is the problem with the stars. debra messing and dermot mulrooney? they have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar!<br /><br />since the kat and nick have no conflict from the start, the viewer is not pulled into the film the way the creators thought they would be. it's clear that kat will fall for nick, and vice-versa in this predictable story. amy adams, who was the best asset in "junebug", comes across as a shallow girl who is willing to keep her lie going on and not come clean to the man that loves her and is going to marry her.<br /><br />for anyone interested, the credits at the end of the film run for almost seven minutes!
