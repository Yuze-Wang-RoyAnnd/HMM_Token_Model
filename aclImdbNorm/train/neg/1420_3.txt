[i saw this movie once late on a public tv station, so i don't know if it's on video or not.]<br /><br />this is one of the "baby burlesks" (sic) that shirley temple did in the early 1930s. it is hard to believe that anyone would let their daughter be in this racy little film which today might just be considered this side of "kiddie porn".<br /><br />shirley temple stars in a cast which probably has an average age of 5. they are all in diapers, and are in a saloon which serves milk instead of alcohol. the "cash" is in the form of lollipops.<br /><br />shirley playing a "femme fatale" sashays up to the bar and talks to soldiers who make suggestive comments about her (!). but shirley doesn't need really their lollipops/cash because her purse is full of ones from other "men".<br /><br />meanwhile a little black boy does a suggestive dance on a nearby table (!).<br /><br />what a strange film . . . infants using racy dialogue playing adult roles in a saloon. who thought up this stuff any way?
