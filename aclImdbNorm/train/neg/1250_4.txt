i have to admit that this "re-imagining" of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment. specially when taken into consideration that this is a tim burton film. he is defenetly one of the most original and, might i say, cool directors hollywood has produced.<br /><br />i am personally a great fan of his work, but something obviously went wrong with his latest flick, the planet of the apes. i really enjoyed the original film. when it first came out people expected just another cheezie 70's science fiction film, but a very surprise anding totally proved that theory wrong. it had indeed a clear cut message. an obvious anti-war message. fear of the cold war, where it was taking the world and fear of the use of nuclear weapons played a big role in the mind of the film-makers. those reasons made the film rise above all expectations and it became a instant classic. although, the new film, the "re-making" or whatever, leaves us with nothing. no message, no ideals behind it. it is just another money-minded summer blockbuster.<br /><br />visually tim burton does not let you down. the dark and creepy settings were excellent and of course the make up was terrific.<br /><br />obviously that is not enough to keep people intrested in a film. there has to be an exciting plot or storyline. in this movie the plot is highly uninteresting and it is extremely badly thought out. the script is very lame and it is full of gaps. it looks like this film had been written in a big hurry. the explanation for why the apes where there, and why the ruled the planet was indeed very stupid and proved the script-writers ignorance.<br /><br />it raised a lot of questions, which had no reasonable answers to.<br /><br />for example; why did the apes speak english?, why were there other ape-species than chimps on the planet (given that there were only chimps in the space ship that crash-landed on the planet) where the hell did all of those humans come from? how were a few chimps able to evolve into a huge raise of all kinds of monkeys in only a few thousands years. (i mean it took a few million years for us to evolve from monkey to man!)<br /><br />and finally, the bad surprise ending was just plane dumb. it was probably just thrown in because the original film had such an end, then they felt that the audience were expecting the same kind of ending. the ending also raises a lot of questions, which i know, don't have intelligent answears. did theid learn to work the space ship?, which was power-less, and learnt to fly back in time and take over the earth single hand?, and, what did he do, breed with all the women? and lets say that that would happen, i higly doubt that history would stay the same, like washington would be built exactly like it is today! (i mean wouln't there be a huge banana instead of the memorial?)<br /><br />well, just to say something posative about the film. some of the cast was great. helen bonham carter's character was interesting and well-acted, as for tim roth as theid. he was very good, a little exaturated at some points of the film. michael clark duncan was also fine. i was not happy with marc whalberg. he is not much of an actor, and plays here a very macho colour-less character. very unbielevable and is nothing compared to hestons character in the original. and the main female character had no reason or place in the film. she was just casted for the looks. hardly said a word throughout the entire film.<br /><br />well, i think that in the future when people think about the planet of the apes, they will think about the original one. the latest will soon be forgotten.
