pyare mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst-ever films made by mankind. the film, one of the many handicapped-people flicks that arose after the phenomenal success of black is makes a mockery of the handicapped fraternity. vivek oberoi and fardeen khan are mere caricatures of handicapped people. while black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, pyare mohan shows two desperado-like monkeys who have no qualms about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests. anu malik's music is fair enough. vivek oberoi who made a promising start with saathiya is sadly losing his balls quickly in hindi cinema. fardeen khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. amrita rao and esha deol are just pretty damsels in distress having nightmarish times in thialnd with no one to save them - except for the afore-mentioned desperados. boman irani, as the villainous don toni, is somewhat acceptable. avoid the film if possible.
