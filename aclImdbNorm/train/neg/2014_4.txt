i remember loving this show when i was a kid. i thought the helicopter was the coolest thing i've seen. it was ultra high-tech for it's time. it could repel enemy fire, do all sorts of acrobatics in the air, and take down nearly anything in it's way. now i go back and watch it today and am surprised how lousy this show really is. the casts members are hardly compelling, there are a lot of cheesy moments, and the fight scenes are incredibly fake looking. and nearly every ending has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious reuse of grainy low quality stock footage. lot of the footages appear to date from the vietnam war era.<br /><br />airwolf has basically the same theme as knight rider, except the crime-fighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car. after watching a few episodes, i found myself utterly bored. i do, however, love the theme music.
