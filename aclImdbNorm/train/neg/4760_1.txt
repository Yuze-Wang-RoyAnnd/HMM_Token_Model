this reworking of anthony shaffer's classic play did not last long in cinemas. having recently suffered through it on cable, i still congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket. director kenneth branagh, writer harold pinter, and star/producer jude law deluded themselves that their prestige alone could sustain this travesty through an interminable 93 minutes, without the fun or class of the longer original.<br /><br />michael caine enhanced his reputation playing the second lead in the marvelous 1972 film. he now seems intent on destroying it by attempting the lead, played in that version by laurence olivier. (both were nominated for best actor oscars, but lost to marlon brando in the godfather.) looking puffy and washed-out, caine glides through the part with less depth than he displays as batman's butler. he had already lowered himself to a guest appearance in the atrocious remake of get carter. what's next -- alfie ii, or son of the man who would be king? <br /><br />but then, no one benefits from this inane adaptation by pinter, who thinks that frequent cursing and an added sexual angle can compensate for the absence of shaffer's witty character interplay. branagh's direction relies on bluish lighting and a soulless set design that wouldn't hold up in a second-rate nightclub. neither the shadows nor the tight, overacted close-ups can help law overcome his dull screen persona. the result is a failure both as straight drama and as detective thriller, almost making you forget the purpose behind the title.<br /><br />fans of the original stage production (with anthony quayle and keith baxter) and the olivier/caine film would do well to regard this enterprise as a bad dream. the late mr shaffer, who wrote the 1972 screenplay, as well as hitchcock's frenzy and several agatha christie adaptations, must be turning in his grave, wishing he could plan a real murder or two!
