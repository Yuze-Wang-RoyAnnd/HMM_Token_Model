the leap years stars some heavy hitters in the local and regional film and television scene. and yet, they cannot save this movie. it has so many things going against it - over acting, overly melodramatic, poor script, inconsistent direction; and too few things going for it - decent music , good cinematography. this comment is mainly for anyone who throws all local movies into one basket after watching this film and says all local movies are bad. please do not judge the rest based on this one film. this is a television soap opera masquerading as a romantic feature film. my hopes were high when i bought my ticket and my hopes were dashed five minutes into the film.
