perhaps i'm not a sophisticate. this and closer are two of the more supposedly cerebral films i've seen recently, and both suffer from exactly the same problem to an excruciating extent. the dialogue is false false false. nothing that comes out of anyone's mouth seems remotely believable. perhaps the way this film is set up that's the way it's supposed to feel, but it was unwatchable. and boring. i walked out after 20 minutes of tedium.<br /><br />i'll stick with sleeper and bananas for my woody allen fix. if i ever come across this on the teevee, i'll turn over and try to find an episode of quincy instead.
