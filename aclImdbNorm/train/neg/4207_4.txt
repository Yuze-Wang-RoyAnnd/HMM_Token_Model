ghost town starts as kate barrett (catherine hickland) drives along an isolated desert road, her car suddenly breaks down & she hears horses hoofs approaching... deputy sheriff langley (frank luz) of riverton county is called in to investigate kate's disappearance after her father reports her missing. he finds her broken down car & drives off looking for her, unfortunately his car breaks down too & he has to walk. langley ends up at at a deserted rundown ghost town, much to his shock langley soon discovers that it is quite literally a ghost town as it's populated by the ghosts of it's former residents & is run by the evil devlin (jimmie f. skaggs) who has kidnapped kate for reasons never explained & it's up to langley to rescue her & end the towns curse...<br /><br />the one & only directorial effort of richard governor this odd film didn't really do much for me & i didn't like it all that much. the script by duke sandefur tries to mix the horror & western genres which it doesn't do to any great effect. have you ever wondered why there aren't more horror western hybrid films out there? well, neither have i but if i were to ask myself such a question i would find all the answers in ghost town because it's not very good. the two genres just don't mix that well. there are plenty of clich'es, on the western side of things there's the innocent townsfolk who are to scared to stand up to a gang of thugs who are terrorising them, the shoot-outs in the main street, saloon bars with swing doors & prostitutes upstairs & horror wise there's plenty of cobwebs, some ghosts, an ancient curse, talking corpses & a few violent kills. i was just very underwhelmed by it, i suppose there's nothing terribly wrong with it other than it's just dull & the two genres don't sit together that well. there are a few holes in the plot too, why did devlin kidnap kate? i know she resembled his previous girlfriend but how did he know that & what was he going to do with her anyway? we never know why this ghost town is full of ghosts either, i mean what's keeping them there & what caused them to come back as ghosts? then there's the bit at the end where devlin after being shot says he can't be killed only for langley to kill him a few seconds later, i mean why didn't the bullets work in the first place?<br /><br />director governor does alright, there's a nice horror film atmosphere with some well lit cobweb strewn sets & the standard hollywood western town is represented here with a central street with wooden buildings lining either side of it. i wouldn't say it's scary because it isn't, there's not much tension either & the film drags in places despite being only just over 80 odd minutes in length. forget about any gore, there a few bloody gunshot wounds, an after the fact shot of two people with their throats slit & someone is impaled with a metal pole & that's it.<br /><br />i'd have imagined the budget was pretty small here, it's reasonably well made & is competent if nothing else. credit where credit's due the period costumes & sets are pretty good actually. the acting is alright but no-ones going to win any awards.<br /><br />ghost town is a strange film, i'm not really sure who it's meant to appeal to & it certainly didn't appeal to me. anyone looking for a western will be annoyed with the dumb horror elements while anyone looking for a horror film will be bored by the western elements. it's something a bit different but that doesn't mean it's any good, worth a watch if your desperate but don't bust a gut to see it.
