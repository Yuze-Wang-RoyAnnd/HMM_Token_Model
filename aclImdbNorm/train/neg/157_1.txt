ok first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s i was shocked to find out it was released in 2001. secondly the plot was all over the place, right off the bat the story is confusing. had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would've been better. also i appreciate fantasy but this film was too much. it was bizarre and badly filmed. the scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd. it was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand. i love chinese epic films but if you're looking for a chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development) not this film. beware you will be disappointed.
