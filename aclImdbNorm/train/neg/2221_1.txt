i'm sorry, but this may have been scary in 1978 when it came out, but in modern times it just doesn't hold up. the only interesting scene in the entire movie is the opening scene where michael kills his sister, judith, wearing his halloween mask. the most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter. the film goes downhill from there and doesn't pick up until the last fifteen minutes, but by then it's too late, we the audience have lost all interest in the story. there is barely any character development, and people always rave about laurie being such an exceptional heroine, when there really isn't much to her. i'm sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie, but if you want a great horror movie go watch the shining or rosemary's baby. those are the two best horror films ever made. halloween is certainly not in their ranks. i can't believe roger ebert gave it four stars, for there is no way this film could ever deserve such a high rating.
