as a wwii naval history buff, and someone who is not proud of this country's history of race relations, i was looking forward to seeing this movie. what a disappointing piece of schlock. i made it about 3/4 of the way through, but i should have turned it off at the sub attack scene. the idea that a u-boat would fire a torpedo at a dde, as if there was a hope of hitting it, and then be able to "run away" from the dde while submerged, is preposterous. and that's just a small detail. the whole movie was poorly written, poorly directed, and poorly acted. i agree with others on this board that this could have been a good movie. it's as if they decided that, since all those crappy wwii propaganda films were made with all-white casts, they needed to make one with black people. and as bad as those old movies were, this is actually worse. and it almost smacks of false advertising to headline ossie davis and stephen rea. it turns out they had very minor roles. i have to believe those two fine actors were embarrassed to be associated with this film. i'm done. i've given way too much of my life this crap movie.
