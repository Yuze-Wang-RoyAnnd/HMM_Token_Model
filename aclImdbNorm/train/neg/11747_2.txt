although it got some favorable press after playing at the toronto intl. film festival, there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this. one -- it's an ultra-low budget canadian film. two -- it's written, directed and starring the same person (usually a bad sign, unless it's woody allen, george clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers). but despite my watching it with lowered expectations, it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than i thought possible.<br /><br />in a nutshell -- bad script, bad acting, terrible directing! don't waste your time or money on this turkey. it claims to be a comedy, but i only laughed twice. plus, there is awful music blaring throughout. how this got any attention i'll never know.
