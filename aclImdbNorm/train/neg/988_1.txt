this movie offers nothing to anyone. it doesn't succeed on any level. the acting is horrible, dull long-winded dribble. they obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for. complete garbage, i can't believe what a laughable movie this was. <br /><br />and i'm very sure rosario dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit, a wowing nc-17 movie. the problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the oc or something aimed at teens. pathetic.
