i wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on tv. i went to tinsel town to see it last night at 7:40. i regret the day that wasted my ticket on this trash when i could of saw something better. the beginning was all a bunch sex trash and cliches. they exaggerated the way love works in reality. all of the girls were stereo types. the boyfriend was too stupid for his own age. the passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having barely got any laughs. the bank robbery was completely boring with gags that have been used in other movies. their getaway car was an old beat up chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks. hey why didn't they get nice girlish vehicle for the robbery instead? it might have boosted the audience opinion about the movie. this movie was very low low low low low budgeted since nothing in there was damaged or destroyed. this movie had a lot of stuff in it that would drive christian people nuts. hey i even expected a car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but i but there was never any. so i rate this movie b which stands for low budgeted and 1 out of ten stars.
