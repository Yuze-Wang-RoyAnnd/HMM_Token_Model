usually, i know after the first minute of a movie if i will hate it or adore it... but now, i was wrong.<br /><br />the start was great; the "this is based on a true story" and blah blah blah thing was funny. after, the cartoons and the description of the guys' life with pictures made me think i had made the right choice.<br /><br />then, seeing the hilarious fake look of toronto was cool. also, the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea.<br /><br />that was maybe the first 10 minutes of the movie... which afterwards looked like an eternity.<br /><br />maybe that's just me not understanding english canadian humour (that's possible, english canadians also do not always understand quebecois humour), but hey... there was enough stuff in that for a short movie, *nothing* more. maybe that could be a meaning for the title? anyway, almost everything was filling, and very few things were even close to funny in my opinion.<br /><br />as a matter of fact, the "making of" was better than the movie. at least you understand the motivation behind that which made everything bad. the potential of the idea was great; that's why i rented the movie, being interested in the "annoying people disappearance" thing. but yet, i did not know the whole universe would vanish, and with it even a point to the movie.<br /><br />if you are english canadian, it seems you could appreciate the local humour, considering the surprising number of people who gave this movie an 8. otherwise, just think twice before losing your precious time...
