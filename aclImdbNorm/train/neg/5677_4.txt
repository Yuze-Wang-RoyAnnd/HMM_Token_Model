"seed" is torture porn...no doubt about it. but, strangely, uwe boll has written, produced, and directed a more polished film than any other he has made in recent memory.<br /><br />every time i watch a boll film, i feel that some pages of the script must have gone missing. there are simply huge gaps in the story and dialogue. of course, nothing makes much sense, either. the films are somewhat surreal in this respect.<br /><br />*****spoilers***** <br /><br />why do the six cops who go to arrest seed split up and go their separate ways when they get to the darkened residence, unlike real cops who would enter and clear the house in pairs or by threes? why don't the cops ever use their radios? how can the bodies decay so quickly, a process that would normally take many months? (i know it's time-lapse photography...but seed would never be able to stay on schedule killing people if he always waited around for the previous victim to decay to the point shown.) how come seed gets to wear bib-overalls and a mask while he's waiting on death row instead of typical prison uniforms? how can seed enter a maximum security prison, stroll around the cell block, and then walk out again without being stopped or even noticed? if nearly 80 people (according to some newspaper articles shown in the movie) have been murdered, why is there only one investigator working on the case? why did the investigator suddenly decide that he should go look for seed at seed's house, where he was originally arrested and where he murdered his victims? (didn't he think of doing this sooner?) why does the police detective go it solo, without back-up and without even letting dispatch know what he was doing and where he was headed?<br /><br />this is particularly frustrating when boll obviously goes far out of his way to make sure we understand why the electric chair fails to work properly. he spends several screen minutes in setting this up, when he could have spent them making other aspects of the film at least a bit more logical.<br /><br />*****end spoilers***** <br /><br />in short, the film just sort of serves as a framework for a few assorted scenes (perhaps boll would think of these as his "visions") of a brutal death by bludgeoning, gunshots to the head, execution by electrocution, and the skinning of live animals raised for their pelts. (the opening scenes of animals being skinned were indeed unnecessary and disturbing, but i understand their purpose in the context of the film.) the centerpiece is undoubtedly the bludgeoning death of a middle-aged woman by seed using a hatchet. it's obvious that much time was spent on this and it vaguely reminds me of the classic scene in "reservoir dogs", though without the steely dan soundtrack.<br /><br />is this a good movie? no. is it worth seeing? only if you are a dedicated fan of the torture porn genre or if you are absolutely determined to see a sample of torture porn. as i said at the start of this review, even though this movie is pretty disgusting and can be sickening at points, it is truly much more competent than most of boll's movies. perhaps he will continue to improve as a filmmaker. i can only hope that he progresses beyond torture porn and continues more in the vein of "postal".
