i agree with most of the other guys. a waste of photons and valuable time.<br /><br />nearly no joke is worth the paper is was written on. the only highlight from my pov is olli dittrich as pinocchio. ("egal, ich muss eh waldsterben") this reminds of old times with rtl samstag nacht. it is hard to describe the performances of the actors, since most of them don't even seem to have a good time during production and just "do their thing". camera is ok, plot is laughable, i think you would be ashamed even if you discuss this with lots of beers.<br /><br />apart from this i yawned all the time, wondered about how a script like this could even be considered for production and waited for the end.<br /><br />my 9 year old son was pleased, but then he is pleased by so little at this age :-)<br /><br />anyway, a 1 point rating here nearly is 1 point too much...
