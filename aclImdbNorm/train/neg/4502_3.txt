another double noir on one disc from warner home video and by far the better of the two movies is rko's marvellous 1950 thriller "where danger loves". this is a memorable classic with a great cast in robert mitchum, faith domergue and claude rains. crisply photographed in black & white by nicholas musuraca it was tightly directed by john farrow. "where danger lives" is a prime example of the noir style of picture making and will always be remembered for its stylish craftsmanship that was hollywood's past - (see my full review).<br /><br />unfortunately, none of the above praise can be applied to the second movie on the disc, the abysmal mgm 1949 stinker tension! poorly written (allen rivkin) and directed by john berry this movie is full of ludicrous characterisations and unlikely situations. the inconceivable relationship between a mild mannered and wimpish pharmacist - blandly played by richard baseheart - and his overtly floozy wife (a risible audrey totter) is totally implausible and unconvincing (how on earth they ever got together in the first place is anybody's guess). then when she "unsurprisingly" ditches him for one of her playmates (lloyd gough) our timid pharmacist, instead of being euphoric and over the moon with his new found good fortune, plots revenge and attempts to kill gough but at the last minute chickens out. the guy gets murdered anyway and our pharmacist is immediately suspected by homicide detective barry sullivan (another bland performance). so who did kill him? well, at this stage of the movie you really couldn't care less since it is all so badly executed and rendered ridiculous by director berry. mr. berry has no idea of pacing and is unable to inject even a smidgen of style into the thing. there is nothing he can put in front of the camera that will prevent you from nodding off! the only tension contained in this movie is in the rubber band that is stretched to its limit and snaps in the fingers of barry sullivan as he gives the intro at the film's opening. so much for that! a most unfortunate effort! c'est la vie!<br /><br />best things about this turkey is the smooth monochrome cinematography by the great harry stradling, an effective score by a young andre previn and an early dramatic appearance by the lovely cyd charisse before she found her dancing shoes. hey! - maybe she could have saved the picture had she given us a few steps and a couple of pirouettes! huh?<br /><br />in its favour however, are the heaps of extras that are included which boasts trailers, commentaries and featurettes for both films. but the disc is worth it alone for the rko mitchum classic!
