that's right! under 9 on average, but maybe under 12s for some others! i was 11 when i originally saw this on video and at such youth i wasn't able to notice the shoddy cartoon-quality or the fact that those classic characters we have all grown to love are not the same or as good to see. just about everything is so 2d here! belle is, i'll agree, not even beautiful but just a plain-looking woman with tinted skin, she wears the same bright blue dress all the way through with not one glamorous dress on, wardrobe is to say the least, annoying - my ears may bleed if i had to listen to her everyday! lumiere, in both the original and the christmas edition was suave and elegant, but here he is a womanizing, unfunny twit! cogsworth, despite being the no-nonsense housekeeper he is famous for, is a complete sh-t and the most insufferable character i'd say! he always seems to find shutting that unbearably grating pie-hole of his very difficult in this one and whose clock face should really have been used for turning back in time to the unforgettable two film in this series! poor, poor mrs potts was not brought to life by angela lansbury (one of my favourite classic actresses) but by anne rogers who captured none of mrs potts' character, no offence to her! not if she did her best! when the beast roars it sounds so horrifically fake with clearly no additional roars, snarls or growls by a microphone. i am aware that this is only a third feature following two other films so of course it wouldn't be as good but i'm sure that more of a contribution wouldn't have hurt the disney artists who, indeed, have achieved such remarkable styles of animation over the years. it's alright, i guess, and i do watch it sometimes though only when it suits me. it's quite difficult to make a recommendation for you reading this because it depends on how old you are but remember this will not at all be what you may expect following the earlier spectacular movies! and to think that on my video of it the text on the back cover said "boasting brilliant animation"! it's a nice little flick but for one thing it's also highly poor and, for another, those 3 words ought to have been saved for the next re-release of the original!
