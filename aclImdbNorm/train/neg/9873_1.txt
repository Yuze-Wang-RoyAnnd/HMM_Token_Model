i watched it with my mom and we were like...<br /><br />what the hell? we didn't get it at all. i may have this wrong, but a chair had something to do with the death of this woman's father. that movie was terrible! this is not a movie for those who love a good suspense movie. bad suspense movie! *shakes cane at movie* i'm never seeing it again. and i'm a big fan of lifetime movies, too! they kinda need to quit trying to make movies outta books. it's driving me crazy!!!<br /><br />and whit was butt-ugly and yet, she loves him more than hugh, who was a tiny bit nicer-looking.<br /><br />my rating: 1/10
