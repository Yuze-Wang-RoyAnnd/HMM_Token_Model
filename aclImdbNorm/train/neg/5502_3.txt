silly, often ridiculous romp involving the landing of a space ship and the resulting havoc this causes on tim (jeff daniels) and the people in his orbit.<br /><br />am always amazed by daniels. he showed such depth and promise in 1983's "terms of endearment" as shirley maclaine's philandering son-in-law. as the years have passed, daniels has been unable to get his hands on a good, meaty role. instead, he is in inane comedies such as "dumb and dumber."<br /><br />as for this picture, it fails because of the subject matter. at least, the television show brought about a variety of situations. in the film, we have constant slapstick and people turning into monsters as the government is thwarted into capturing the martian-martin.<br /><br />the part of mrs. brown is a perfect example of the non-success of the film. on television, pamela britton portrayed a ditsy individual caught up in situations with the martian leaving her perplexed. in the film version, a blond bomb-shell as brown, tries romantic entanglement.<br /><br />television star ray walston has a small role as a government agent, or is he really that?<br /><br />a very big disappointment for those who enjoyed the television show so much.
