this is a german film from 1974 that is something to do with some women who come to a castle and beyond that, i can't really tell you their purpose or even what the purpose of the movie is. i can tell you that there's several women who also moonlight as servants at this particular castle who strip, put on body paint and gyrate to bongos like they were at the goth kit-kat klub, though, and that seems to be a good portion of the run time of this film. yeah, there seems to be something with devil worship and vampires, and there's some girl on girl stuff, etc., but the main focus seems to be the painted babes gyrating away in the basement. i did rather like the eye-rolling of one of the main housekeepers/devil worshipers, that lent an authenticity to the proceedings and made her even more evil-looking. was that wanda the evil lesbian (as billed in the credits)? no matter. if you aren't too picky about your lesbian devil worshiping movies, you might like this, otherwise it's pretty dull stuff and i couldn't even finish it, i was so bored. 3 out of 10.
