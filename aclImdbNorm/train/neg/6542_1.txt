the person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the writer/director/star--or is, in fact, the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle. how about this? you want to make a movie--tell a story; entertain; draw me in with vivid characters. sure, you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal. however, do not address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads. if i'm to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy.
