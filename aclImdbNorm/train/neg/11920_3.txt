oscar wilde's comedy of manners, perhaps the wittiest play ever written, is all but wrecked at the hands of a second-rate cast. sanders is, as one would expect, casually, indolently brilliant in the role of lord darlington, but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time. jean crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy; indeed, the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy -- doubtless the hays office insisted. preminger's direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal. stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with helen hunt as mrs. erlynne; or try reading the play for the pleasure of the words. but skip this version.
