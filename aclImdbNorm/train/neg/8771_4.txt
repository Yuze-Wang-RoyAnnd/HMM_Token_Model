okay, i was bored and decided to see this movie. but i think the main thing that brought this movie down was that there would be a hour of footage, then basically that same hour repeated 4 times. it consists of 1. gathering the troops and discussing the attack plan, 2. flashbacks to the men's wives 3. the approach of the troops marching in a long line 4. men running up hill and shooting, usually the first getting shot in the head then 3 other men rescuing him. 5. defeat of the enemy and calling to base to tell of success 6. men flashing back to wives and singing 10 minute songs. that was the basic movie, and that same order of events happened about 4 or 5 times. and every time it did a flashback to the wives, it would show the man, then his wife and him. there were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback so this took up tons of time. other than that, the men couldn't kill their enemy except with either bayonets or grenades. i liked the music and there was a lot of action, though the action was repetitive. overall, i probably wouldn't see it again, but it wasn't too horrible.
