96 minutes of this is cruel..and i love the old munster's. yes, the plot is thing; yes the lines are trite; but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan. there is so much 'intrigue' (and i use that word with great pause) that i wonder if it's an old starsky & hutch episode. i lost count of the number of times i noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar. refusing to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid-60's (ludicrous) the producers simply replace marilyn & eddie with younger actors. why not let them grow and age? the addition of an addam's family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the halloween party.<br /><br />grandpa & herman fly to transylvania and back in a few hours (preposterous.) sid ceaser is the most, yes the most unbelievable character (i am including the bad robots) since he babbles an unwild combination of gibberish & yiddish but claims to be an ancient arabic ruler. and yes, it looks like the laugh track is missing. in fact, there are several spots where there is dead air, as if the laugh track was to be inserted later. the actors seem to wait on the faux audience. it's not laughable; it's sad. oh, and the best part! yvonne decarlo has a line that just goes to show you how out of touch the writers and producers were. marilyn says something like: "where could uncle herman and grandpa be? they could have been in an accident. they could have been hit by a car...or a train!" lily says responds with something like: "you're uncle herman will be here if he has to drag himself off the train track." what's amazing about this is: yvonne decarlo's husband was a stuntman in the early 60's and lost a leg and was nearly killed in a train stunt. he never recovered and this financially devastated her family. (check out biography's fantastic review of her life and career) this line could have been easily changed to be more sensitive to her.<br /><br />if you are a real fan of the munster's then you'll have to rent this mess. it illustrates how some things are better left alone. even with the (nearly) original cast, this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years ago.
