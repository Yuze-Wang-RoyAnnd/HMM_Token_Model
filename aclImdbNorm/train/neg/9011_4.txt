pretty standard b-movie stuff. seriously, anyone who watches "dragon fighter" with dean cain and a bunch of people making their first movie should know better than to expect real quality or even moderate intelligence. b movies exist to re-work formulas that are popular. if you give them even token analysis, you'll wind up ruining the movie for yourself (and perhaps writing some self-important, slanderous review on imdb).<br /><br />i liked the female lead, kristine byers. she had charisma and i thought she was notably attractive. it was a memorable b-movie appearance. unfortunately, i don't see where she has made any movies since. i'll watch for her again.
