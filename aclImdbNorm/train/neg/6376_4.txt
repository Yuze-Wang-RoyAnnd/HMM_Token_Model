jennifer cassi (gina philips from "dead and breakfast") returns back to the house she grew up in which she recently inherited from her deceased sister, unbeknownst to her grandmother (fay dunaway) who's still living in it. jennifer decides to sell it as she's in dire need of the money much to granny's chagrin. she also begins to have troublesome recurring nightmares of a mysterious raven. there was really no one to relate to in this film. jennifer seemed cold, distant, unsentimental, and narcissistic, whereas the grandmother seemed spiteful, sad, and also narcissistic. the film is good and well-made, but with no one to empathize with i found it hard to care about what happened to them.<br /><br />my grade: c-
