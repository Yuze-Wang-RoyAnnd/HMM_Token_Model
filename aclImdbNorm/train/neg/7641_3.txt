this is one of those movies that's trying to be moody and tense, and instead, ends up tripping all over itself. having seen it at a queer film festival, i was intrigued by the "young college threesome gone wrong" write-up, however, over-all ended up quite disappointed.<br /><br />it's hard to critique a "true story" since there's not much that can be done about the plot - but i found this disjointed, melodramatic and wholly depressing. it's dark and almost sinister, painting a darn creepy flash of the seventies with imposing music and jerky close-ups. it just doesn't work - some scenes where so cheesy that instead of hushed awe, my audience was supressing snickers and rolling eyes.<br /><br />the story has an interesting premise, but this just spins downward into a dark, miserable spiral.
