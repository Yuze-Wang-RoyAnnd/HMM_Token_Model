<br /><br />get your brewskies out and enjoy this flawed action flick. speakman's considerable kempo skill (nice spin kicks, decent with the sticks - poor couch!) is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting. the plot isn't half bad; just executed pretty poorly. but if you're seeing this movie for anything other than martial arts, you're missing the boat entirely. and for a movie that is supposed to take place in koreatown, way way too few korean actors (even extras).
