seriously, i don't even know where to begin. it's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to an autistic third-grader and said 'make me a movie about the secret service'. the editing is ridiculous, the cinematography was random at best, every single syllable of dialogue was completely retarded and the directing ... well, was there even a director there? everything was just so pointless and lame and pointless...and random....and lame.<br /><br />here's a spoiler for you; this movie is the dumbest thing you'll ever see. <br /><br />however, if you liked this piece, you'll also enjoy; deterrance, dark blue, and a partial frontal lobotomy.
