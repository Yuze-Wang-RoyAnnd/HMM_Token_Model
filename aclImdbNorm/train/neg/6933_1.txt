relative to other columbo movies, this can only be rated a 1 (awful). i seriously do not understand what the other reviewers have seen in this appalling train-crash of a film. it was only through morbid fascination that i continued to watch it - to see what bizarre or inept decision the director would make next.<br /><br />another reviewer suggested that it was falk's only directorial outing because it interfered with his acting role. in fact, i think the real reason lies with the studio bosses, who must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money. it's a wonder they didn't murder him.
