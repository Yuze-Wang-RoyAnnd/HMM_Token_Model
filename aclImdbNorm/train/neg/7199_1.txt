why?!! this was an insipid, uninspired and embarrassing film. the embarrassment comes from being from the city where they made it...pittsburgh pa! why did they let these people do such a baaaaad movie there?<br /><br />when this movie was originally to be released...it was more of a romantic comedy...and no robo-anything. that all got changed along with cuteness courtesy of disney. why???? they did a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character. seeing matthew broderick make fun of his own movies was not fun either. sheesh!!
