dude, really!!!! where have you guys been the past 20 years, this is shocking in all kind of ways, horror ? this is a joke, there is nothing wrong with being low budget, but this is a laugh, if you want to look at the classics, freaks of tod browning, the victims of dracula and frankenstein, the undying monster, ernest thesiger, paul wegener's the golem and the passengers of the ghost train, you can't compare it, it gives it a bad name, bad acting, bad screenplay etc. total waist of money and free time, have watched a lot of movies, were as horror is my all time favorite, i really am speechless, have nothing more to say that please don't do the effort to watch something so daft, please understand
