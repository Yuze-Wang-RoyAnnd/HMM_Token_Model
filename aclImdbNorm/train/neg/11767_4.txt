i had somewhat high hopes for this since i like tim roth. i was not pleased with this film. i liked the ang lee the hulk a few years back so i figured this would have more of a bang to it. first i was very disappointed with john hurt's performance here. he looks as if his eyebrows were re-shaped for this. his performance was not convincing. he was not as good as one would expect. tim roth is cool as always here. the gama thing didn't really stick to the original story line i don't think. i guess the best part of the film was the end. it had some cool action. the only problem with the original was that it was too long. this one is not as long but it got a bit boring at times. i remember some time ago when walmart had this movie really cheap for sale and i always wondered why?. now i know. i was hoping to to get blown away, but i was not.
