how can barry levinson possibly assemble white-hot comedy talents ben stiller and jack black, the gorgeous rachel weisz, old pro christopher walken and still deliver such a humourless stinker?<br /><br />stiller and black are friends until the latter invents a spray to make dog mess vanish and becomes a conspicuous consuming multi-millionaire.<br /><br />the premises is thin but sound enough in the right hands to have been a springboard for some great bitching between the two stars but all concerned overplay every hand, every chance they can.<br /><br />stiller and black are simply not funny for way too much of the time, weisz looks sensational as always but is criminally underused and, with the exception of walken as a batty barfly who urges stiller's character to take revenge, it's a turgid trudge to the end of this strained farce.
