one of, if not the worst film to come out of britain in the 80s. <br /><br />this tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who 'seduces' two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux-posh wife has nothing to redeem it.<br /><br />in turns gratuitous, puerile, uncouth and unrealistic, this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial. <br /><br />perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of george costigan, michelle holmes and siobhan finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script. it's no surprise that this was the late andrea dunbar's only work to make it onto the screen. complete and utter rubbish on every level.
