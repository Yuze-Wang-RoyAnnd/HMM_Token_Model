this movie is a cringe-fest of bad acting and poor set design as well as tacky lines and a lame plot. but it is so much fun to watch. everything about it is hilarious.the basic plot is a group of scientists from the future travel back in time to capture their evil co-worker who is intent on destroying them all. they catch up with him in the year 1146. the 'futuristic' lab of the scientists from the year 2033 is an eighties-style room with a bunch of 'futuristic' flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn shed. the actors deliver their lines with unenthusiastic aplomb, which isn't hard to understand considering that the lines are usually earth-shakers like " i double-checked everything twice!" he double checked everything twice? he checked it four times? not only that, but they feed you the entire premise of the movie in the first five minutes, and continue at a rapid fire pace until they hit the medieval part. when roger corman ran out of money. and had to stop travelling through time and consequently different sets. the medieval set is a comic mish-mash of anything from the late 10th century to the 16th century. any costume they could find, they used. i guess chain mail wasn't on the budget, 'cause the guys all wear sequined shirts masquerading as armor. the fight scenes are laughable, with men casually throwing themselves onto cardboard swords with abandon and dying in death throws with nary a blow cast.it sounds truly awful, but i enjoy it every time i watch it. the lines alone are enough to have you in fits and everything else pulls together to create a fabulous b-movie that, if you are a connoisseur of corny flicks, i would suggest you see. and once you have, read the review on unknown movies. i love hearing them point out all the funny, truly awful bits in the movie.
