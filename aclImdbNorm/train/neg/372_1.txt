i saw this movie once a long time ago, and i have no desire to ever see it again.<br /><br />this movie is about preston waters, a hard-lucked preteen, who always seems to be overlooked by his family and who always seems to be short on cash. all this changes when a bank robber runs over preston's bike and passes him a blank check as compensation. preston uses the check to withdraw $1 million from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check). preston then buys a mansion and says that he's working as the assistant of a mysterious and wealthy backer named mr. macintosh (named after his computer). after that, he just goes crazy with the money.<br /><br />on paper, this sounds like a great idea. however, on screen, it is one of the emptiest movies i've ever seen. for one thing, it's too unbelievable. i know some parts of the movie were meant to be incredible, but i draw the line at a twelve-year-old boy going out with a thirty-year-old woman, and being put in charge of a imaginary person's small fortune. also, this was a shallow movie with weak acting, a predictable plot line and characters who are less than memorable. the characters were either cheesy, over the top, annoying, or underdeveloped. but "juice" was a funny character.<br /><br />if you're looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this one.
