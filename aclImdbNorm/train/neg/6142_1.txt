gymkata is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made. but not the bad kind of bad movies. this one is so awful it's fun to watch and laugh. kurt thomas clearly does not have a lucrative career in acting. he should go back to gymnastics. but who can forget such memorable scenes as the high bar with chalk, the stone pommel horse or the five minute chase scene through the village of the crazies in slow motion. i don't think it was meant to be this bad, but who can tell. it's not art, but if you want something lite and fluffy that will make a good conversation, rent gymakta. makes for an evening of fun.
