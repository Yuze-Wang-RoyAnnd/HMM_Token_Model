oh, my gosh...i thought cbs primetime television shows were the<br /><br />worst things gerald mcraney appeared in...<br /><br />four people are experimented on by a crazed mind control<br /><br />computer. that's it, don't rent it.<br /><br />i saw this under one of its many titles- "grey matter," and it is<br /><br />perhaps one of the worst films of recent memory. the other<br /><br />reviews are right, it is awful. never have so many establishing<br /><br />shots appeared onscreen, never. the cast is awful, the direction<br /><br />is awful, and the script is awful. i cannot stress how awful this is. <br /><br />avoid it like you would smallpox.<br /><br />this is rated (pg) for physical violence, some gun violence, mild<br /><br />gore, some profanity, and some adult situations
