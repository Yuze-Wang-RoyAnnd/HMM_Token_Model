as the faux-russian scientist says two-thirds of the way into the movie, "i came for the science." this pretty much sums up the reason i watched this movie - anything that involves a half-man, half-hammerhead shark definitely deserves a serious empirical investigation on the part of an impartial aspiring scientist. or, as they say in the biz, my girlfriend's brother had the remote and the rest is history. to say that the special effects were bad would be a disservice to the field of special effects. this is 2005, it is not that hard to film a car scene without a cheesy bluescreen background. yeah, this was charming and state of the art when hitchcock was filming "the birds" but in 2005 it just looks low budget. spare me the cheap attempt at sci-fi and do me the service of actually making an attempt at the willing suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />however, having seriously defamed the overall concept of this film, let me tell you again that, as sad as it may sound, this is probably worth your time. if nothing else, it is a tour de force of bad sci-fi - worth the education for the new movie buff and certainly worthy of a refresher course for those who have seen a few movies in their day.<br /><br />the crazy hunchback mad scientist with a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it is a good idea to spoon canfuls of blood into the nearby water makes me question not only the intelligence of mankind, but also the ability of "b" movie writers to come up with remotely plausible plot lines.<br /><br />this film also pretty much fulfills one of my longtime bad movie contentions - bad guys always wear sunglasses.<br /><br />if this weren't 2005, i would be deadset on the fact this film was some sort of insanely poor metaphor for the cold war. i mean, you might as well have khan on the bridge of a klingon bird of prey inserting leaches into chekhov's ear.<br /><br />one of the most moving lines of the movie is when the chick without the bra insists that the charlton heston lookalike, "wait for tom" as he is trying to lift the escape helicopter off the ground. the thing is, tom is wasting the bad sunglass guys with his never-ending banana clip attached to his kalashnikov, or ak-47, in layman's terms.<br /><br />as the mad scientist says near the end of the film, "my goal is to evolve the human species" - suffice it to say that this movie contributed only to a devolution of humankind. the faint freudian references uttered by the mad scientist as he prepping the female protagonist to be mated with a hammerhead shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction we can all find something to laugh about.
