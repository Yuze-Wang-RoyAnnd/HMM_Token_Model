even when i saw this movie at a teenager, i wondered just how ironic it was that pia zadora starred in a movie about an artist who slept her way to the top. as beautiful and sexy as ms. zadora is, even she couldn't keep this sorry-ass excuse of a movie from tanking. not even her photoshoot for penthouse, in which "the lonely lady" was promoted "back in the day," could keep this movie from tanking. the only thing that could have saved this movie? a completely different script. give this one a miss.
