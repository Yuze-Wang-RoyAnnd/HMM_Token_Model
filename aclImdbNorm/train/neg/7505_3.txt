this long winded film turns out to be less about berkowitz and his effect on nyc, but more about painting caricatures of a certain group of italian-americans, known locally as "guidos." the problem is that "guidos" are uninteresting, no matter what kind of story or setting they are immersed in. they are already living caricatures, so lee only amplifies them, rather than simply portraying them.<br /><br />when someone has a caricature done of themselves, they don't go home and say, "hey, let's make the ears and nose even bigger!" that's what lee has done in this film. the most interesting characters in the film are the two (adrian brody and jennifer esposito) who wish to escape the "guido" lifestyle. top it off with an uninteresting storyline for the characters, particularly john leguizamo's, and you get a nice film to fall asleep by. especially considering it's lengthy run time.<br /><br />one more strike against it: for someone proclaiming to be a yankees fan, and has grown up in new york, spike lee should know how to spell phil rizzuto, which is spelled incorrectly in the closing credits.
