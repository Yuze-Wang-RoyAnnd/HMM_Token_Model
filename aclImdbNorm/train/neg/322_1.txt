i saw this movie about 5 years ago, and the memory of it still haunts me to this day. i was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it, so i have only myself to blame. but like most, i didn't believe all the negativity. being a sandler fan, it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad. i figured it was just sandler haters. i couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />what we have here is a comedy that does not contain even 1 second of anything funny. that is actually quite an accomplish. you'd think in a 90 minute comedy, they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing. but no, it's just horrible. it's not "so bad it's good", its just bad. you cannot laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. you wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle, but they never come.<br /><br />have you seen the movie the ring? where the people watch a video tape and die 7 days later? if this movie was on the video tape, people would die instantly, by their own hand, and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended, and that would be the first smile since they pressed play.<br /><br />you might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is, unable to curb your curiosity. don't. please don't. trust me, i'm doing you a favor. there are 2 types of people in the world, those that think going overboard is the worst movie ever made, and those that have not yet seen it.
