note to all mad scientists everywhere: if you're going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster, you need to give him a scarier name than "paul." i don't care if he's a frightening hammerhead shark with a mouthful of dagger-sharp teeth and the ability to ambush people in the water as well as on dry land. give the kid a more worthy name like, "thor," "rock," or "tiburon." because even if he eats me up i will probably just sit there laughing, "ha! get a load of this!!! paul the monster is ripping me to shreds!!!!!" that's the worst part about this movie is, this shark-thing is referred to as "paul" throughout the entire flick. it makes what could have been a decent, scary horror movie just seem silly. not that there aren't other campy and contrived parts of "hammerhead: shark frenzy." the scientists spend the entire movie wandering along this island, and all of a sudden one of the girls starts itching madly from walking in the lush forest, and just has to pour water on her feet to relive the itching, which of course allows "paul" to come out of the water and kill her. the one thing scifi channel did right in this movie was let the hottie live. but that's a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie.
