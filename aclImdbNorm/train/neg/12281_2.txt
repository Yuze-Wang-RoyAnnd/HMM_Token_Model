hearing such praise about this play, i decided to watch it when i stumbled across it on cable. i don't see how this "elivates" women and their "struggles" by focusing on the topic at hand. i guess if you have an interest in stories about women's private parts and how it affects their lives, then this is for you. otherwise, it's rather dull and boring. if anything, i found it a bit degrading.<br /><br />i inquired with a female friend who also watched this and she thought it was horrible as well. so, it's not just a guy "not getting it".
