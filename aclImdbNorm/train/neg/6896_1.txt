sadly imdb does not allow me to rate judges lower than 1. what a shame. this ghastly movie is so bad that i actually turned the damned thing off well before the ending. the script had a few bright moments, but the directing, editing, acting, audio quality, and especially timing on line delivery was so abhorrent as make judges utterly unbearable.<br /><br />judges was advertised as being like a modern day comic book style western, but in reality was nothing of the sort. what it is most like is dog poop on the bottom of your shoe. you can try to pretend it is okay, but it just keeps on stinking.<br /><br />why video stores think it is okay to carry this kind of crap with constant gaps in the audio and worse than high school drama class acting is beyond me. we rent movies in order to see something better that what is on television. but judges is worse than the most pathetic scifi channel original. i intend to demand my money back from hollywood video.
