although the casting for this film was admirable, particularly dianne keaton and tom everett scott, the quality of the writing was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this film worth watching.<br /><br />my wife and i decided that the reason we watched the entire film was that it was like a train wreck, and it was almost impossible to turn away. it may have been that we "hoped" that the message would eventually make itself apparent, and that we would be able to glean some meaning from this effort. unfortunately, this did not happen.<br /><br />of course the audience may have been able to "make sense" of this convoluted tale, a credit to the ingenuity of the human brain to make sense of the absurd. the writers, however, did nothing to facilitate this innate need we seem to have for finding meaning.<br /><br />it was apparent that those involved were simply going through the motions of their respective crafts, and that any intrinsic passion for the characters or the story was either secondary or non-existent.<br /><br />unfortunately, made-for-tv movies have seemed to devolve over the years. whereas communicating a message to the audience may to have been the primary interest of the writers in the past, present-day writers and producers seem condescending to their audience, concentrating primarily on manipulating us to "stay-tuned" through the incessant advertising which seems to be the only reason movies such as surrender, dorothy are made.
