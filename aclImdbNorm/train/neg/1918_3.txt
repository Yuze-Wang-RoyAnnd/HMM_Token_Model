tv version of "twister" springs a few leaks but manages to remain watchable. my sister bought this at a wal-mart a few years back when it was released, i saw it back then and thought it was okay. later "twister" with bill pullman and helen hunt comes out (or was it before? i think it was '97) and did a better job overall. but "twister" was more silly fun; this is realistic with a message. it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters: twisters, or a low-budget character study?<br /><br />john schneider and devon sawa (he's the reason my sister bought it) star, and devon sawa, who went on to "wild america," "final destination" and "slackers" got his big break here. so in a way, i was one of the first people to see him really take off. i don't know if it's an honor or a shame, i haven't seen how he acts in recent films.<br /><br />"night of the twisters" all depends on personal taste, like i said, it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters: twisters, or a low-budget character study. "night of the twister" has the latter. so you decide.<br /><br />i give it a 2.5/5...<br /><br />- john ulmer
