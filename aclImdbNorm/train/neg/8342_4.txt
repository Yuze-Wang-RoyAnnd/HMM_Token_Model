salvage: 4 out of 10. groundhog day meets a christian coalition horror film. okay maybe it's not that bad. but it is close.<br /><br />claire (played by alicia silverstonesque lauren currie lewis) is stalked and possibly killed by a serial killer (chris ferry who is quite menacing and brutal). i say possibly because she wakes up and it was all a dream
