i've waited a long time to see dr tarr's torture dungeon and after i watched it, i was really disappointed by it. it's not the baroque film i expected it to be. the trailer (which i saw on a something weird dvd) is much better than the entire film, which is remarkably forgettable. there are almost no stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is interesting but it doesn't even come close to other baroque styled movies out there, from fellini or jodorowsky. the characters are dull and there's almost nothing dramatic going on, even though we see rape, crucifixion, insanity, etc.<br /><br />the main problem with dr tarr's torture dungeon was the fact that it was a talk-a-thon more than anything else. it was almost like watching a book. i just wanted the film to have moments of silence or mood or something, instead we see/listen to the main characters chit-chat endlessly about dull stuff.<br /><br />a missed opportunity.
