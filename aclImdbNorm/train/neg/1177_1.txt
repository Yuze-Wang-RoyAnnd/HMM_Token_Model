this movie is complete crap! avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs, it is rambling and incoherent. i pride myself on plumbing the depths of 70's sleaze cinema from everything from salo to salon kitty. i like being shocked, but i need a coherent story. however if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you. the saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang. i mean its just plain hard to sit through, not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly. please, i know the cover is interesting (what looks like a gorillas hands reaching for a woman's bare ass)but don't waste your time or money as you won't get either back.
