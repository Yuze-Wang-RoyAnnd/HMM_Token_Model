the hazing is confused mumbo-jumbo that wants so hard to be the evil dead that it even references bruce campbell several times. the problem is, it is simply not in the same league as that terrific movie. this movie is nowhere near as original. the plot has been used before, by kevin tenney in night of the demons, and that was a lot more fun. this flick wastes too much time with complicated exposition before getting the kids into the spooky mansion and starting the demonic happenings.<br /><br />brad dourif is, as usual, not given much to do here, but when he is on screen he puts in another over-the-top performance that would make christopher walken jealous. as for the acting of the kids, it's passable but by no means good. the shaky camera work is more annoying than clever or atmospheric. there are a few good moments when the first guy gets possessed and throws around some deadly one liners while dispatching his victims, but it was never scary for a second. the gore level is mid-range to low, but the director tries to make up for it by showing the actresses topless a few times. all in all, just okay if you have 87 minutes to waste.
