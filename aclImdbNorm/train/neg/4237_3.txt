judaai was a bold film by raj kanwar at it's time in 1997 when such a topic was damn out of the box<br /><br />to give him his credit he does succeed in showing how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wants<br /><br />the film however is damn melodramatic, many places ridiculous<br /><br />one wonders why anil doesn't buy a tv for his wife? when he earns so much just to show how poor he is?<br /><br />the twist is well handled but the handling is straight out of 80's the johny- paresh comedy which entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it doesn't fit in the story<br /><br />even there are several cringeworthy scenes<br /><br />direction by raj kanwar is adequate though at times too melodramatic music is okay but most songs look forced<br /><br />anil does his part well sridevi is excellent in her part urmila is decent amongst rest kader khan is as usual johny lever is funny, paresh irritates farida is decent
