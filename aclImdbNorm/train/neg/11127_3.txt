i'm not sure what diane silver was thinking when she was making this movie, but it obviously had nothing to do with richard wright's novel, which the movie is based on.<br /><br />we read the novel this past summer for ap english 12, and just watched the film. during periodic note-taking and checking of the clock, i contemplated the chances of being struck by lightning. of course, the sky was completely clear, and i was forced to watch the rest of the movie... and then write a 5-paragraph essay on it.<br /><br />wright's novel discussed very real themes, of the mind of a killer and the psychology behind it. silver's movie turned a murderer into a victim, which is not what wright wanted (see: "how bigger was born" 454).<br /><br />i'm going to make this short and sweet: if you want to leave your consciousness, in raphael lambert's words, unsullied, skip the movie and read the book. the 1986 adaptation is not thought-provoking material.<br /><br />... ::sigh:: now i have to write the essay.
