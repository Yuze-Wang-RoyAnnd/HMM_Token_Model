nacho vigalondo is very famous in spain. he is a kind of bad showman who can make you feel sick... very embarrassing. nacho had made some commercials in tv, i remember one in which nacho was looking for paul mc carney around madrid (the commercial was about a mc carney cd collection). <br /><br />this little movie is like a nacho's commercial: bad storyline, bad directing, and awful performances. i can't believe that a disgusting movie like this was in the kodak theater. poor oscar...<br /><br />nacho could made this movie because of his wife, the producer of this 7:35, a woman very well connected with spanish tv business men.
