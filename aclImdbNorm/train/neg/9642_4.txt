i couldn't believe some of the horrible dialog coming out of people's mouths, and the end reel of bloopers attached to body of the film was a real hoot. and we get titty shots of angelique pettyjohn (sort of) and loren crabtree to boot.<br /><br />a teleportation device activated by psychic angelique pettyjohn brings an alien container to an underground lab out in the desert. according to director fred olen ray, they were leftover sets from the klaus kinski film, android which gives the film an increased value beyond how cheap it looks.<br /><br />inside the container is a midget alien (played by ray's son) who starts clawing people to death. it was pretty funny watching this little 'creature' in a black reptile suit with what looks like large beetle shells attached to it, running around in the dark. we even get to see the little thing stamp and tear at a poster of et, which i thought was hilarious.<br /><br />and then there's what looks like a snake that also comes out of the container that gets hammered to death by william fair, after the mini creature chews into frank mcdonald's neck in the kitchen. a low budget take on alien, i suppose...<br /><br />the whole thing ends abruptly, looking like they ran out of film at the end before the blooper reel comes in with the end credits. talk about a lack of funding...<br /><br />fred olen ray also mentions in the director's commentary that they also weren't sure if aldo ray would make through the shooting and remember his lines. he barely did.<br /><br />low budget cheese sneeze. it's fun to watch, i'll grant ya that. <br /><br />4 out of 10
