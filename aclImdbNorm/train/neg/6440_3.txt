this was one of the worst wrestlemania's i've seen. it just didn't stand out at all, really. card wise, i thought it was going to be pretty good, but every match just seemed to fall short.<br /><br />chris benoit vs. mvp one of the better matches. benoit carried it. i just didn't think mvp was that great, but benoit saved this match. <br /><br />kane vs. khali wow, these two guys don't mix. or maybe it's khali and any other person alive don't mix. awful match.<br /><br />melina vs. ashley i'm not a fan of female wrestling.<br /><br />ecw originals vs. new breed i was excited about this match, until i saw it. really, really disappointing.<br /><br />edge vs. cm punk vs. king booker vs. jeff hardy vs. matt hardy vs. mr. kennedy vs. finlay vs. randy orton absolutely the worst mitb match so far. just a major let down, to many people in the ring at the same time. it just didn't live up.<br /><br />bobby lashley vs. umaga o.k. not extremely impressive, but not the worst of the night.<br /><br />batista vs. undertaker this was maybe the best match of the night. very, very, very nice to see something good for a change. <br /><br />john cena vs. shawn michaels i really feel like this match deserved to be last. people make a case for batista vs. undertaker, but this match was just as good. i am starting to get sick of seeing cena win every match though. it's getting a little old. now, i have to say, i feel this match is the best of the night, but i'm a huge shawn michaels fan, so i'm a little biased. batista vs. 'taker may have been better, but i'm biased, so...sorry. the last two were undoubtedly the best matches of the night and most everything else really came up short.
