read on and take note - you could save 88 minutes of your life (was that all!).<br /><br />unremittingly bleak, this film sets out to produce (i'm guessing) a modern small town american christmas fable in the capra style. if fails....completely and absolutely fails. i've been trying to think of one good thing about it and can't. let me mention some of the highlights ...<br /><br />people don't die, they get to spend eternity as immigrant workers in santa's factory. angels are actually ex-cowboys who sit in trees. santa can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a nice letter). <br /><br />and the plot.. i won't spoil it for you but there has to be some light in films if only to contrast with the darkness but there isn't any. even the photography is bleak - snow shown at the end of a freeze, everywhere looking cold, damp and miserable. <br /><br />as you might guess, the film has a happy (schmaltzy) ending. what a relief !
