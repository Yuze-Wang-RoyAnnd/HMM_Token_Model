i'll be blunt. i'm not one for politically correct movies where the woman plays the bad ass who's not going to take any crap from anyone. if any one of the cast members wanted to, they could have just taken her out in a heartbeat. it was entertaining on mst 3k, but don't rent the real version. trust me. have i ever lied to you?
