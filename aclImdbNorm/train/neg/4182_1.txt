this movie is not as horrible as most sci-fi channel movies. i am used to seeing the gray cgi blobs and the amateurish special effects such as close-ups of fake blood that make it very obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup or some other syrup variation. however, i had thought that i had seen all the possible lows that the sci-fi channel could hit. then i saw this movie.<br /><br />imagine a hand inside a rubberized sock that is glazed with syrup? those are the main alien vampires in this movie. you can clearly see the fingers inside the rubbery sock puppets. a talking hand comes out of the guts of victims, and the vampire who is on the vampire hunter's team can talk to these rubber sock puppets in transylvanian. how did alien vampires learn transylvanian? and isn't transylvania in romania? so shouldn't they be talking romanian? why would some little town have their own language? if you can suspend your gag reflex and get past the talking rubber socks with the fingers clearly moving inside the aliens' heads; then you have to deal with the other alien vampires. there are the "leatherfaces" who like to wear the faces of their victims. then there are the just plain ugly ones that all seem to have a lot of facial scars. then there are the annoying valley girls and their boyfriends who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies so that they can sabotage the defense systems so that these space vampires can attack.<br /><br />finally, if you think all of the above is funny and worth a laugh, you have to deal with the third rate cast of network tv rejects that make up this team of stereotypical angry heroes which are constantly fighting among themselves. why does almost every sci-fi channel movie have to use lead characters that are annoying, abrasive, crude, or just totally unsympathetic? i found myself hoping the talking rubber socks would win.
