metamorphosis i am working my way through the chilling classics 50 movie pack collection and metamorphosis is the seventh movie in the set. released in 1990, metamorphosis seems to be a remake of "the atom age vampire," which also featured a scientist striving for similar results. set in modern times, metamorphsis is not my kind of horror movie.<br /><br />a university researcher is working to crack the human genome in order to create a serum that would prevent aging. pressured by the administration to publish his papers; and, produce some results (or risk losing funding), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! at first thinking that he suffered no adverse side effects, he eventually discovers that the serum has indeed altered him in the most unexpected manner! <br /><br />the acting is stilted; and, the performances left me with a much diminished interest in the film. the score is pandering. and, the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only fallacious; it's absurd; it's ridiculous
