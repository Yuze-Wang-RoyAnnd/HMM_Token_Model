let's be honest. as a film school project, made without budget and "real" actors, this is a passably interesting film. as something to be released on dvd for an innocent viewer, it's a very poorly produced product. if i would be idly changing channels and happened to catch this film accidentally, it would probably arrest my eye and attention for a while. as a person who bought this dvd under the impression that i would be getting a proper cinematic product, i.e. a film, i feel deeply disappointed. it's a videotaped tv play, something along the line of old sixties serials, but without that certain charm. aside from the leading man mr redfield (who also is the director), the other actors seem to be either chaps from the campus (a bit too old for that actually), or members of the director's household, who appear before the camera without any help from not only the acting couches, but also the make-up artist or hairdresser (a bonnet over outgrown permanent bangs or a top hat over mullet is a very long way from creating 1840s). it's all shot using a motionless mounted camera in a small, bare studio, sometimes using blue screen for outdoors backgrounds. synthesizer generated uninspired score of lame "period" inspired romantic karaoke insults the viewers ears on more than one occasion. the film attempts to be "dreamlike", whereas in fact it's merely conceptionless collage of those shots that made it to the editing (and believe me, the standards weren't too high to start with). there are interesting dialogs every now and then, but overall it's pretty lame and two-dimensional production in more than one way with no flashes of genius from either the director or any members of the crew. that's how "artsy" films attempted to look in the 80s. mr redfield does a much better job as an actor than the director.
