tony scott directs a thriller sports flick that should attract even the non-sports fan. and some say baseball is a dead sport...boring...too damn slow. well perk up! on the outside he appears to be a disgruntled salesman(robert de niro) while on the inside he is a psychotic san francisco giants fan. along comes a new slugger(wesley snipes)and designated savior from the doldrums. our salesman harbors a murderous obsession when the hard hitting all star falls into the worst slump in his career and the giants are feared to crumble along with him. de niro is terror personified. snipes seems very natural as the ballplayer. other notables in the cast are: the still attractive ellen barkin, john leguizamo, benicio del toro and patti d'arbanville. you are a free agent...so enjoy. violence and very strong language is to be expected and you get your moneys worth.
