this film was absolutely awful, i even feel uncomfortable calling it a film. its the typical "mumblecore" movie, with zero plot and a bunch of aimless whiny twenty somethings stumbling around trying to "figure stuff out". i have tried to give mumblecore a chance, but lets be honest its just horrible.<br /><br />i am not out of sync with cinema, i appreciate dogme95 films, idioterne is one of my all time favorite films. so i do not mind if a film is cheaply made so long as there is some (any) substance.<br /><br />everything in this film is horrid, the acting, the writing (or was it all improvised?), the direction, but most of all, above everything else, the camera work was just plain and simple nonsense. the camera was never anywhere logical, there was no consistency. i got to admit being a guy i had heard there was nudity in this film so i thought to myself well even if its horrible at least there's nudity (yea i know, i'm a jerk). well thanks to the uber crappy camera-work you never really get to see anything, and the things you do see, trust me - you do not want to see. this film made me want to vomit on numerous levels.<br /><br />the dialogue made me want to vomit, the camera-work made me want to vomit, but mostly the idea that this film was praised by some legit critics, well now that more than anything makes me want to vomit.
