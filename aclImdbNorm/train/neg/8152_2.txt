"don't drink the water" is an unbelievably bad film. it's based on a 1966 broadway play by woody allen. it stars jackie gleason, the comic genius behind "the honeymooners". the director, howard morris, has appeared in several mel brooks comedies (life stinks, high anxiety, silent movie)and has made a mark in animation (characters he has voiced include gopher from "pooh", jughead (archie)and beetle bailey) what went wrong?<br /><br />i think the problem is that the premise is played out too seriously to work effectively. allen's original play was tongue-in-cheek, which is why it worked on broadway and in allen's 1994 remake. the screenplay by r.s. allen and harvey bullock beats the premise to death and makes too many changes from the original play. making gleason's wife an airhead in this version when she was a headstrong woman in the original is just one example of why this doesn't work.<br /><br />the acting isn't much better. gleason does the best he can with the material, but he can't save this. gleason was a comic genius , but also a fine actor as he demonstrated in "the hustler" and "soldier in the rain". his abrasive personality could have worked here, but the lousy script doesn't even give him a chance. too bad. estelle parsons' airhead wife will drive you nuts after 20 minutes. see how soon it'll take for you to want to strangle her. that is also a shame because she is also a fine actress, having turned in two exceptional performances in "bonnie and clyde" and "rachel, rachel" none of the other actors do particularly well either.<br /><br />woody allen hated this film so much that he remade the film in 1994 with himself and julie kavner (marge simpson) in the leads. they manage to hit all the right notes and the film itself is a comic masterpiece. it's finally on video after a long battle over rights. do go out and find that version. all the 1969 original is good for is clearing out unwanted guests who overstay their welcome.<br /><br />1/2* out of 4 stars
