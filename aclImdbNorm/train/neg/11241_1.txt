if you are looking for eye candy, you may enjoy sky captain. sky captain is just a video game injected with live performers. the visials are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie. now, saying that, the visuals are the only thing good in sky captain.<br /><br />after ten minutes, i knew i was watching one of the worse movies of all time. i was hoping this movie would get better, but it never achieved any degree of interest. after thirty minutes, the urge to walk out kept growing and growing. now, i own over 2000 movies and have seen probably five times that number. yet, this is only the second movie i felt like walking out of my entire life.<br /><br />acting---there is none. the three main performers are pitiful. jude law (also in the other movie i wanted to walk out on) is just awful in the title role. i would rather sit through ben affleck in gigli than watch law again.<br /><br />paltrow tries so hard to be campy, that it backfires in her face. the last article i had read said that paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting. after this performance, i would applaud that decision.<br /><br />story---soap operas are better written. the story behind sky captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progresses.<br /><br />directing---none. everything was put into the special effects that story, acting and directing suffer greatly. even "the phantom menace" had better acting and that is not saying a great deal.<br /><br />i would have to give this movie a "0" out of "10". avoid paying theatre prices and wait until video release.
