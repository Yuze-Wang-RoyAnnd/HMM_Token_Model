as a history nut who is particularly interested in this particular historical event, i was very disappointed with the movie. granted, the costumes and staging was quite authentic, but the hollywood portrayal of this "british little big horn" was truly boring.<br /><br />the amount of film footage dedicated to marching or parading troops has to have been unprecedented in film history. eveytime i heard triumphant background music begin, i knew i had to prepare myself for another laborious scene of meaningless filler. obviously, the producers had invested heavily into "staging" and were determined to get their money's worth.<br /><br />despite the outstanding cast, their dialogue was, again, boring and their characters were never developed. whenever peter o'toole or burt lancaster finished a scene, i would cringe with disappointment. their given lines were so weak and meaningless that i could hardly believe these were the same two great actors who portrayed lawrence of arabia and the bird man of alcatraz respectively.<br /><br />there are worse epics, but this one is not much better.
