i ended up watching this movie before even going through any of the reviews, on the request of a female. just out of curiosity, i thought, let me find out if there are people who actually recommend others to watch this movie. i am quite shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this website that makes me conclude that it's a scam.<br /><br />as far as my opinion goes, i have to ask,"are these filmmakers retarded or do they assume that the viewers are retarded?" the movie is atrocious on so many levels and i'm not even talking about the story or presentation.<br /><br />so, these bunch of guys plus one girl (the lead actress) form a music band; guessing from the constant presence of guitars it is supposed to be a rock band. hell, when did dancers started becoming the part of a rock band??? anyway, let me accept it as the-bollywood-version-of-a- rock-band, but amusingly enough all the scores which actually had these two guitarists doing all kinds of cool "rock gestures" and i am assuming they were playing the instruments, the sound of the guitar was completely missing!!! i simply can't comprehend the magnitude of stupidity here....<br /><br />i am just going to conclude here because it is absolutely not worth pointing out any further flaws in the movie. bollywood directors seem to have no shame anymore!!!!!!!!
