run...do not walk away from this movie!!!!! aimed at the very young kids, this movie will bore you to tears. if the gamera trilogy of the 90's raised the bar, this film just lowered it. it's slow paced and the monster fighting is good, but seldom seen. this movie had me dry heaving in the cat box. just a very poor offering after a phenomenal 90's series.<br /><br />spoilers beyond this point!!!!!!!!!!! here are the top 10 reasons gamera fans of the 90's series will hate this film.<br /><br />10. this movie is a drama that follows a kid trying to cope with the death of his mother and fears losing baby gamera to a fight after knowing his father saw the adult gamera die.<br /><br />9. you see the adult gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the film. he gets his butt kicked by a few gyaos and self destructs??? he looks old and lethargic. plus he looks nothing like any gamera you've ever seen. his suit looked cheap and rushed.<br /><br />8. the young gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a pokemon. big-eyed and cute...it will remind you of the baby godzilla from godzilla vs mechagodzilla 2. gamera is now too cute.<br /><br />7. this movie has the pace of watching a nascar race during a 3 hour rain delay. i watched this movie with 2 other gamera fans and nobody was happy with how slowly this film moved along. i've seen an suv full of fat people going up a mountain road move faster.<br /><br />6. like godzilla:final wars, this movie had very little kaiju time on screen. final wars had much more, actually, and better fights although short.<br /><br />5. kids take the title role. the friend of all children theme and poor writing killed the original gamera series in the 1970's and history repeats itself in the 2000's. the most successful gamera films abandoned the sesame street feel and went to a darker place. why go back to a failed formula? this was to be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue (thank god).<br /><br />4. gamera lost his iconic roar. he now sounds like an elephant with strep throat.<br /><br />3. this movie may produce a new olympic event.....imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children into harm's way. you have to see the ending to understand this point. where were the parents? oh yea..right there sending their kids into a kaiju battle zone.<br /><br />2. the special effects were good, but sub-par for a gamera movie. legion and iris had better effects. the best effect was showing the apple sized baby gamera fly. not too impressive.<br /><br />1. this movie is just not what adult kaiju fans come to expect. the director was involved in power rangers and it shows. it comes off like a cross between et, always: sunset on third street and tmnt. kudos if you know all 3 references.<br /><br />rental at best or watch once if you buy it to complete the dvd series.
