i'm dumbfounded. yes that's right. i'm really caught here. no way did i find it awful, but on the other hand it was a frustrating experience in macabre hysterical and murky incoherency. the idea behind such a trim, minimal low-budget indie production isn't bad, but it's a confused muddle and in the end didn't do anything for me. it's amateurish and simple; it wants to exploit beyond reasoning and do so in that of-late fashionably rapid filming style. we have the documentary laced (hand-held) camera moving everywhere (despite never leaving the van), and sometimes feeling unfocused and blurry making certain details hard to figure out. lately you kind of get use to it, but there are times when it does become too distracting and even nauseating. keeping it still will help. the context has little groundwork (which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads. at a road-side store they become involved in a minor accident which smashes an unoccupied suv headlight. scared, they flee and not too long that one-light suv appears behind them. soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror) spending most of the time playing out a drawn out, noisy and relentless cat and mouse game. <br /><br />as for being disturbing
