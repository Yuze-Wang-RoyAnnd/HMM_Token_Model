i loved "anchorman; the legend of ron burgundy" and hoped this would be just as funny, but alas, it wasn't. some bits are excellent though. i thought the sports guy, champ kind, professing his love for ron burgundy in the car filled with the other members of the news team was hilarious. everyone is ignoring him and he just gets louder and louder and finally kisses burgundy which doesn't get acknowledged either. but on the whole the story doesn't gel. it's a noble attempt, however, to salvage the unused bits from the first movie, including an entire plot about some pretty benign would-be domestic terrorists called "the alarm clock." maya rudolph of saturday night live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines, but basically this unused plot line has good reason to be unused in the first movie. the extras on this disk are pretty good, with the best two being the filmed rehearsals featuring lots of improv comedy, and the faux commentary with will ferrell and an "exec producer" who ferrell discovers early on was not even a part of the movie in any way, shape or form. turns out he's "just a guy" who walked in the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer. it's some pretty funny stuff though and goes on for about 10 or 15 minutes
