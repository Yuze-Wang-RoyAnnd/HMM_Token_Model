a terrible movie containing a bevy of d-list canadian actors who seem so self-conscious about the fact they are on-camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable.<br /><br />this film is badly written, badly edited, and badly directed. it is disjointed, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way. mcdowell does a great job with what he is given, but is the only one in this film to do so - he really has a bad story and script to work with. it's not even camp enough to be funny.<br /><br />i have yet to see van pelleske act in a credible manner, and even the sub-characters like eisen (with his nasal, whiny voice) confirm that we are on a lot in toronto rather than on a barge off africa.<br /><br />didn't the director see that the 'creature' looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit? the fight between the blue bolts of lightning and pelleske's orange wisps of 'magic' (!?! for lack of a better word), is obviously the result of bad actors, with no choreographer, overlaid with completely derivative special effects. was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film (not the good kind)? <br /><br />learn from the mistakes of others ... don't even waste your time with this one, you'll regret it like i did. i have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid.
