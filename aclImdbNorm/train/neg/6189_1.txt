i bought the dvd version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw aired in television. but the version put to dvd was a disaster. the lighting was poor to non-existent and entire scenes were simply excised. in one instance adele is being put to bed, and we immediately cut to another scene - coming in in mid-sentence - where it's the next night. characters such as grace poole and mason are never even introduced, leaving one to wonder if they'd dozed off for a few minutes during the movie.<br /><br />the dvd we saw was produced by platinum disc corp and even at $6.32 it was a gyp.<br /><br />be careful which version of this movie you buy! we're sending this one back.
