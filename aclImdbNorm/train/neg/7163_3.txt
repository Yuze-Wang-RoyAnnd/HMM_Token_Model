<br /><br />upon concluding my viewing of "trance," or "the eternal," or whatever the producers are calling this film, i wondered to myself, "out of all of the bad movies i could have seen, couldn't i have at least seen one that was entertaining?" even if a film is not well made in terms of acting, directing, writing, or what have you, it can at least be fun, and therefore worthwhile. but not only is this film bad in artistic value, it's incredibly boring. for a plot of such thinness, it moves awfully slowly, with little dramatic tension. at the very least, in a low-brow attempt at entertainment, the deaths of the characters could have been cool and/or gory, but the creators of this dreck failed in that department as well.<br /><br />what does this movie have going for it? pretty much nothing, unless you get entertainment out of watching christopher walken, who is capable of being brilliant, put so little effort into his acting that he falls into self-parody mode (why did he decide to do this film anyway?).<br /><br />i give this film 3/10, because, god help us, there actually have been worse movies made before.
