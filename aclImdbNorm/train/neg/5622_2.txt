ok, aside from the psychedelic background imagery, the info presented here was good. the music i could have done without (not that it was bad music, just that it didn't fit this film at all).<br /><br />as for the content of the film, the director brings up the often-lacking pagan perspective on christ's existence and a startling comparison of the deeds and events of christ's life vs. the lives of mythological figures/deities such as mithra and dionyses. then he brings up the chronology of christianity's origins and presents an 'ok' case, but not one that blew me away.<br /><br />if the director had stuck with the facts and continued on with them, this film would have been good. however, at this point in the film, it disintegrates into a group of personally-gratifying attacks on mel gibson's "passion of the christ" and a christian private school which the director attended in his youth. during an interview with his old principal, (which during the course of, it comes to light that the director set up under false pretenses) i felt that the director was acting sort of childish. he was asking good questions but, like the film itself, the interview crumbled into an attack on this particular private school's rules, not christianity.<br /><br />all in all, if you're just interested in some info, watch the first 30 minutes or so and then shut it off.
