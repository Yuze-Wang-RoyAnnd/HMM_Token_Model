oh a vaguely once famous actress in a film where she plays a mother to a child . it`s being shown on bbc 1 at half past midnight , i wonder if ... yup it`s a tvm <br /><br />you`ve got to hand it to tvm producers , not content on making one mediocre movie , they usually give us two mediocre movies where two themes are mixed together and nowhere to hide is no different . the first theme is a woman in danger theme cross pollinated with a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme which means we have a scene of the heroine surviving a murder attempt followed by a scene having her son sam ask why she divorced ? and being a tvm she answers that the reason is " that people change " rather than say something along the lines like " i`m a right slapper " or your daddy cruises mens public toilets for sex " as does happen in real life divorce cases . and it`s young sam i feel sorry for , not only are his parents divorced but he`s as thick as two short planks . actually since he`s so stupid he deserves no sympathy because he`s unaware that a man flushing stuff down a toilet is a drug dealer , unaware that you might die if someone shoots at you , and unaware that i love lucy is painfully unfunny . if only our own childhoods were so innocent , ah well as orwell said " ignorance is strength " . oh hold on sam is suddenly an expert on marine life ! is this character development or poor scripting ? i know what one my money`s on . and strange that sam the boy genuis hasn`t noticed that if the story is set in 1994 then why do people often wear clothes , drive cars and ride trains from the 1950s ? but as it turns out during a plot twist it`s the mother who`s the dummy . then there`s a final plot twist that left me feeling like an idiot for watching this
