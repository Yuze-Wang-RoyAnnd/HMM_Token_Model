live a little, love a little is one of elvis' weirdest movies. part slapstick, part fluff, part surreal and part strange. elvis meets up with a very off-beat girl with an annoying voice. she looks like jennifer aniston. story doesn't make much sense as is the case with most elvis presley movies, and there a bunch of odd characters galore. not much music in this one, but what there is i liked, although none are memorable. strange continuity. elvis and michelle carey go into her beach house at night, but a few minutes later a delivery boy comes in and it's stark daylight!! what?? that's about the essence of the movie. what?? oh, two good things about the movie: a) elvis looks great and b) the dog steals the show.
