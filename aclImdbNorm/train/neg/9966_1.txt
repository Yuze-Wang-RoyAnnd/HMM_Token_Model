though i never like to be the sort of person who negates another's personal taste; if you like something, that's fine. but, this movie was horrible and there is no way around it. i don't like ani difranco too much, but she's a great guitarist and songwriter, that i can admit. but i can't admit to there being any redeeming qualities to this film. many people way that it is an accurate portrayal of issues that high school students face. maybe, but everything is portrayed too far-fetched. there seems to be an attempt at a "naked gun" - esque kind of comedy, but the timing is off; there is too much space between each actors line, as if they're holding for laughter (there wasn't any). whoever wrote the script was all over the place. they tried to cram as many controversial issues together in one film, almost never fully developing any of them (especially the girl getting impregnated by a teacher). i did not laugh once throughout this entire movie. i was too insulted by this attempt at humor and satire to do anything but roll my eyes at the screen.
