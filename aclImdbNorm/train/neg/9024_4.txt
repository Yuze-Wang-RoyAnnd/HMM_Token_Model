"shinobi" is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story. unfortunately, for the audience to actually care about the people dying, you have to develop the characters, otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters, all of whom die.<br /><br />ok, so if you can't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, you can at least make the reasons for why they die plausible, right? nope. here we have a war between two ninja clans, with neither side really knowing why they are fighting each other. they kill each other because the emperor says so. yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead, they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions. that's not stubbornness... that's just plain dumb.<br /><br />fine, fine! there is no character development, and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting. at least they die fighting in cool action scenes, right? yet again, no! in fact, many of the fights aren't even fights at all: super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly (and lamely, in my opinion). i'm talking about things like, "lalala, i'm walking along and i- *neck gets slashed*." the end for that character. not even halfway through the film, i threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it.
