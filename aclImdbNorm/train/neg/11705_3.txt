this stuffy melodrama is quite easily the worst film starring ingrid bergman that i've seen. even her luminous screen presence can't save this insufferably slow and meandering movie that's nearly impossible to sit through without fast-forwarding a lot of it.<br /><br />only for die-hard bergman fans; others are very likely to fall asleep. i suggest you to watch "for whom the bell tolls" instead.
