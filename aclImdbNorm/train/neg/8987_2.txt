the only redeeming quality of this film is the actual storyline...otherwise, this movie was terrible. the acting was ridiculously bad, and the set design was cheesy and very tacky. the story was decent, but it was very hard to watch due to all the horrid acting. i wouldn't recommend watching this one...the only redeeming quality of this film was that the actors were somewhat attractive...especially ryan bauer, the man who plays the soap opera star. some of the editing was well done, but there are continuity errors all over the place...i'm just starting to get sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad...can we get a good one soon?
