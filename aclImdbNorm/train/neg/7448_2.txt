i watched this film version of r.d. blackmore's classic novel as a substitute until the 2001 a&e version was released on video. and what a poor substitution it proved to be!!!!<br /><br />this version does not have the authentic, i-feel-like-i'm-there aspect of the a&e movie. the actors are, for the most part, wooden (with sean bean the exception) and the "romance" seems forced and contrived. in fact, there is no kissing until the end of the movie!!!! the triangle between john ridd, lorna doone (or lady lorna dugal, whichever you prefer)and the evil carver doone isn't mentioned or expanded upon. we don't get much insight into carver here, or as to why he has some (if any) romantic feelings for lorna. this movie cuts out many of the key and interesting characters of the novel, such as counsellor doone, and john's sharp-tongued youngest sister lizzie which were crucial to the plot. the screenplay itself is lacking in conviction. the political intrigue also doesn't figure in the script. the way lorna came into being with the doones isn't true to the original story. now, don't get me wrong, clive owen is a handsome and talented actor (watch gosford park and king arthur for confirmation) but he comes across as bland and stoic throughout, and long hair (it may have been a bad wig) just doesn't suit him!!!! polly walker is a lovely and accomplished actress (see enchanted april and patriot games, in which she also costarred with sean bean), but she appears colorless and lackluster. she has a cold sore on her lip that make-up can't hide, and the costumes don't seem authentic. the late robert stephens does a respectable turn as sir ensor doone, although he only refers to lorna as his favorite rather than his granddaughter, which she was reputed to be in the book. also, it seems to me that owen and walker are too old for their roles (maybe it's the make-up) and the scenery is brown, cold, gray and barren, without so much of a hint of a sunny sky. i understand that it is set in southwest england, but it is green there and they do get their sunshine!!! the portrayal of tom faggus' character and his "death", which doesn't happen in the novel, depresses the film even more. the one positive note is sean bean's performance as carver. although it doesn't even come close to matching aidan gillen's portrayal in the a&e movie, bean does make one mean villain. in short, watch this only if you've got a few hours to kill, but don't expect anything exciting or for it to be true to the novel. see any other version ( but i highly recommend a&e's film) over this tired adaptation.
