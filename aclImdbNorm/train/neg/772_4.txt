this movie is not as good as all the movies of christ i've ever seen. and i'm quite amazed that in this story pilate wants to finish jesus, when the scriptures (as well the other movies) state differently. it lacks also a very important issue: the resurrection.. none of the other movies skip this very important part: the faith of all of us christians lies in this very event. as paul says in one of his letters "if christ did not rise from the dead, our faith is vain". a very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when jesus entered jerusalem. <br /><br />finally, and in opposition to my jewish co-commentator, jesus was not a myth. and as a matter of fact, he was also a jew. there are plenty of documents (relgious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man(or should i said, god become a man) that indeed changed mankind. i strongly advise him(given he is a historian) to read about flavius josephus, the most brilliant jewish commentator of the 1st. century.
