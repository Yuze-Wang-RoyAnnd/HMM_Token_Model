i only rented this movie because of promises of william dafoe, and robert rodriguez. i assumed that upon seeing rr's name on the cover (as an actor) that this movie would be good. it sounds like a movie that rodriguez would of made so if he's going to lend his name to it, than it has to be good right? wrong wrong wrong. by far the worst editing since "manos hands of fate". the way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wont even want to try to follow it anymore. i have no idea how dafoe and rodriguez got involved in this film, maybe they owed somebody, but they are way to good for this. besides they were only in this movie for a couple minutes apiece and rodriguez didn't even talk. so if you wanna see a movie with poor editing, poor acting, and confusing storyline than be my guest but don't say you weren't warned.
