i have nothing more to say but it was awful. i cannot imagine why helen mirren and others were part of this degrading mess. and if certain actors don't want people to question their sexuality then perhaps they should refrain from making more of these films. there was at least one seen that left me curious. just my opinion. shudder to think what was going on that was cut from the film. shudder to wonder what went through the minds of the actors who made this film. shudder to think about the thought process and voyeurism that went on in the directors mind. like i stated before its a degrading mess. its not even funny. as ebert said of the film caligula with malcolm mcdowell, its not a good film, not a good story and its not even good porn. yeeshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh............
