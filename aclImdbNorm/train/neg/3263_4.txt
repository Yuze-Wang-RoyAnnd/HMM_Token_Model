this is the second british rank film to adapt the stories of sommerset maugham to film. all but one story from 'quartet' does not travel well into the contempory era; and the actors speech is decidedly "clipped", as only british pre-1950's actors delivery can be. in anycase 'trio' seems tighter and more filmic than the first film adaptation.<br /><br />one of the problems these two films can't overcome is that their source material was written 25-30 years prior to the films. consequently, by the 1950's maughm's (pre-war) popularist "small morality" storyteling seemed rather quaint, if not downright coy.
