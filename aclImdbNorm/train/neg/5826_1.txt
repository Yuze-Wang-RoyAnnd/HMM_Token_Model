slow and nice images changed one another, with sometimes annoying music (you know bjork) in background, for the first 75% of the movie. if you did not have enough sleep, that's a good time. <br /><br />but, in the last 20% of the movie director decides to bring idea of re-birth, re-incarnation or else, through s&m images: "spiritual lovers" are cutting each others bodies with knives. for me it was very much disturbing and actually changed general impression of blend of abstract art and images of modern japanese mystery. <br /><br />operator and director are great, but weird. <br /><br />did not enjoy it at all.
