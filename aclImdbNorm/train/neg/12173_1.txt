me and my friend rented this movie for $2.50. and we both agree on one thing:<br /><br />this is the worst movie ever made!<br /><br />also me and my friend counted 475 face shots. (which makes up 95% of the movie).<br /><br />so in other words: do see this movie unless you like wasting money! and i do!<br /><br />
