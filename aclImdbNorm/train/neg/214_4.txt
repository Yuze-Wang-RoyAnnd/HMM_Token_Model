considering that this movie had a serious and quite successful launching campaign, i would have expected something to be worth the fuzz...from the opening scene on (in which the two brothers "sensually" caress each other, laying naked in a bed) it goes rapidly downwards...nothing to get the attention, not a mind-catching thing in the whole plot, baaad baad acting (a few minor exceptions, but artificiality is at its best). incest and lesbianism are promising themes, but the script analyses none of the two in depth ( mind that a possible excuse of the makers, saying that they aimed for a subtle movie would be hilarious, unless subtle and superficial mean the same thing...). the too curious viewers will not get any interesting scene...at this point, that could have saved some of the movie...so you can imagine how bad it is. many other things could be said...but please watch the movie yourselves...i am an egoist and i would like as many people as possible to waste about 1 1/2h of their lives...like i did :(
