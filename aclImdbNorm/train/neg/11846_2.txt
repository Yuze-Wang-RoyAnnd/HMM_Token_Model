after seeing this film i complained to my local cinema about the quality of the sound-track or whether the cinema sound system may be faulty. for at least the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what anyone is saying because of the background 20's music and the scratchiness of the sound-track. i was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so - it was the director.<br /><br />i was told the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film. the music and the sound was supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film. these days, directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique. unfortunately, no matter where or how you see that film the sound score will be the same.<br /><br />so apart from the historical inaccuracies of this film (which you can find out for yourself elsewhere) the sound-track distortions are in themselves a good reason to give this film a miss. you will only hear the distorted scratchiness of the sound-track and certainly not a cat's meow.
