what a sad sight these tv stalwarts make, running out the clock on their careers stumbling about a little rusting hulk of a ship - boat might be more appropriate. the whole production feels cheap and shabby, and it's not helped by a "big name" star who is barely capable of spitting out the few lines that he's given in a credible fashion.<br /><br />at no time do the supporting cast rise above the material; they're clearly watching the clock here. bang out the scenes, get the pay cheque, go home, and try to forget all about it.<br /><br />it's not particularly badly scripted or filmed; there are no real clangers, it's just utterly anodyne, and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a small cast of extras. the pacing is a little bizarre; an embarrassingly tentative romantic sub-plot is only begun after the main action starts, which makes it feel irrelevant.<br /><br />maiden voyage scores a couple of points for being competently scored, and for being a fun game of "spot the kiwi bit parters"; most of the cast are graduates of shortland street or xena: warrior princess. the saddest thing about this production is that this film probably constitutes their big break.
