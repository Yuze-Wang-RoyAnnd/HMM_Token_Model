this is possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i don't care what the critics say, it's bad. i think the problem is with kundera's novel. it's not that it's unfilmable; it's just that like 99% of his work, it's pretentious and overdrawn. he seems to be enamored with himself,his characters come off as navel-gazing, and his novels as a whole are misogynistic. i have read many of his works (even his socialist realist poetry. that was truly awful) -- i just don't understand what the fuss is about. characteristics (like the self-absorption) in his novels make for infuriating reading. in a movie, all the things that i dislike about kundera were magnified. maybe i just missed something, but i don't think so. on a side note, i cannot believe that this is a criterion collection dvd. no way is this movie that essential.
