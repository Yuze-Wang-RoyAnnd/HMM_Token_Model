the word "1st" in the title has more ominous meaning for the viewers of this film than for its crime victims. at least they don't have to stick around and watch this interminable film reach its own demise.<br /><br />1st should refer to: 1st draft of a script; 1st takes used in each performance in the final film; 1st edit in post production; etcetera, etcetera.<br /><br />the movie is not cast too badly, it's just that everything about the film come off as worse than third rate, from the goofy script, to the wooden performances. and while suffering through this cobbled together film, by the 2 hour mark you want to be put out of your misery. at 160 minutes long it is readily apparent that it should have been edited to under 2 hours.<br /><br />going into details concerning the lame script and acting serves little purposes. even in the equally awful, lake placid, at least the performances bill pullman and bridget fonda constructed out of an extremely weak script, were nuanced enough to make you laugh at the movie. in 1st to die, one ends up grieving only for the time lost in waiting to see what happens after the opening scene of the preparation of the female lead's suicide.<br /><br />the editing is so bad one is never introduced to one of the main characters, who i think (were never quite told) is a d.a. she just appears in one scene in the middle of a conversation. obviously the scene where she is introduced to the viewer was dropped on the editor's floor. and no one realized that a character appearing out of nowhere was an unusual film ploy.<br /><br />in a word, don't waste your time with this one. my wife and i wish we didn't. but at least we created our own diversions by commenting in various places in the film like it was mystery science theater. "meanwhile, in cleveland . . . ." !!!!
