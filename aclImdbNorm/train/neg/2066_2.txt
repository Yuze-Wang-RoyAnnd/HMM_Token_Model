after two long, long opening skits, one of which my brother saw the conclusion coming of and the other totally joke free, we start the fast-forward fest that it groove tube proper. naturally, uber-stupid frat boys who still mainline jackass or tom green will find the idea of fecal matter coming out of the some tube, sex olympics(i really don't need to give you details, do i), and a clown who basically does the "not very endearing clown" bit i think i've seen approxiately ninety times now will eat this up like dung beetles: well, more power to you.<br /><br />i just want to express that, despite what you've heard, this movie was in no way a model for the many infinitely funnier movies like kentucky fried movie or what not. the skit movie had already been done in and now for something completely different, everything you always wanted to know about sex, and so on. and done way better.
