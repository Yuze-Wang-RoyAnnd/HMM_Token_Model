this movie is quite possibly one of the most horrible horror flicks i've seen. the length wasn't nearly long enough to include a good storyline. also, the way the foster parents died was just plain ridiculous. the mother suddenly dies from falling through a shower after tripping over an action figure, and the dad is shot by a police officer? i can see where some originality might have been what they were going for, but it could have been better. also, the cheesiness of it all made me want to press stop before it was over. after hearing all of lucy's name and figuring out it was 'lucifer', i wanted to gag. yes, it's interesting that lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. it's a male's name. it should be given to a male character. all in all, the movie was a bore, and could have used a better plot.
