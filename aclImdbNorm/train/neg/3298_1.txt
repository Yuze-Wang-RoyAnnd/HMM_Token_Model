when i heard that the dukes of hazzard was going to be remade with current actors and a solid script, i was like, "alright, i'll give it a chance, it's not going to be better than the first, but we'll see what happens." well, i saw what happened. i saw a great late 70's/80's show that was a classic, basically humiliated by hollywood. it's so sad to see that hollywood scriptwriters cannot come up with something original these days. they are seeming to take a great show that had a great target audience, and try to "remake" the classic show. heads up hollywood... it ain't workin!!!! anyway, more about the show. i think they could have casted a better actor than sean william scott (stiffler from american pie) to play bo. i'm sure that john schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and taken advantage of. also, get for real, johnny knoxville, as luke duke. how low can you go?? a crappy jackass actor to play lovable luke. this sickens me. also, i'll give jessica simpson is a beautiful woman, but her acting sucks. catherine bach who played the original daisy, was smart, sexy, strong, opinionated and a good il' southern girl. she was every little girls role model growing up! (i owned the doll and the jeep - thank you very much!!!) anyway, jessica simpson played a smart ass, 2-bit slut as daisy duke. daisy never was blonde. why did they have to cast her. jessica alba would have played a great daisy duke. she can speak with a great southern accent, and she is gorgeous, and would have done a wonderful job. anyway, i'd like to say that this movie blew something fierce. i feel like i got ripped off by paying $8.50 for tickets, and they should refund my money. if you like the dukes of hazzard (the original series) don't see this movie. it'll just upset you. cmt (country music television) plays the reruns of the dukes all the time later at night. so set your tivo's and go with the real thing, not the imitation on the big screen in hollywood.
