clearly rips off hideo nakata's ringu (ring, 1998) and hongurai mizu no soko kara (dark water, 2002), with hints of ju-on (the grudge, 2000), but atrociously done gore (a green corpse with red eyes!?) weak story, and a weak theme (i find it very difficult to find a picture message scary). there were two moments in this film that made me shudder, both involving an unexpected hand, and after oodishon (another miike takashi one, this one from 1999) had me tingling all over for hours after seeing it, and all of the films this steals from were actually scary, i can't see this film as anything other than a sell-out to the western popularity of the big japanese horror films. two out of ten.
