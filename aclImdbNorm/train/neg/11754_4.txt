i have to admit that i'm a great fan of this show, so you must know how disappointed i got when i watched this movie. first of all, the plot was awful, i thought it was going to be something more interesting, like to see what happened to arnold fathers, or something more interesting, but nooooooo, a maniac wants to destroy arnold's house, between many other places, so many people tries to stop this.<br /><br />i must admit that the plot wasn't so bad after all, but what really sucked were the steps that arnold and his friends do to stop this maniac, they become friends of a spy,; they drive a bus (based on a video game, for god sake), and to worse everything, they make super-moves on the bus, things that many persons had already tried and died, but not arnold, gerald and helga, 'cause they are experts on a video game.<br /><br />honestly, my mom, my sister, even me got really disappointed after watching this movie, 'cause it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon. i must admit that i used to enjoy "hey arnold!", it was one of my favorite cartoons on nickelodeon, but after this crap of movie, i'm not quite sure if i'm going to watch "hey arnold!" as i used to watch it on the past.<br /><br />other thing nickelodeon, with that enormous number of dynamite i can assure you that not a simple street would explode, i think that the whole city could explode with that, oh, and please, if all of your future movies from good cartoons are going to be like that, don't do more movies, you give a bad critic to cartoons that used to be good.<br /><br />honestly, i think this was the worst way to end this show, a good show transformed into this crap of movie.
