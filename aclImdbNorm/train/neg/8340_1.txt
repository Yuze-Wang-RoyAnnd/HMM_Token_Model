one of the worst films i have ever seen. got so bored that i switched it off midway through to watch the news. when i switched it back on, i fell asleep. the film starts with a dream, continues with a dream, and ends with a dream. then there are a few more dreams in between. come on, what is supposed to keep me interested in that? a film needs to have a reason to be interesting. the minute you felt the film was only a dream is when any sensible film-goer switches off. ever had someone insist on telling you their dreams and what it means to them? this is it!!!<br /><br />absolutely awful.
