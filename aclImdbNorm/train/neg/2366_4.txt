i am a fan of the nightmare series but this one is horrible. the deaths are so trendy. if you were to watch this 20 years later the whole nintendo scene is outdated. i did like the flashbacks. i think they should have just made a prequel about when he was still alive. that would have been more interesting. this is a movie you can take or leave. depends on how much spare time you have.
