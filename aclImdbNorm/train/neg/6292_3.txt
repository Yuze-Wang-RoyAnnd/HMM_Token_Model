i wonder how much this movie actually has got to do with the 1984 movie "bachelor party", starring tom hanks. is this movie even an official sequel? this movie is lacking in every department and you're obviously better off not watching it.<br /><br />for a comedy this movie simply isn't good or funny enough. it relies mostly on the character's their stereotypical assessments, rather then the movie actually features some good, original and funny moments.<br /><br />of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude breast than script pages. you just keep waiting for things to finally start off. there is a main plot line in it somewhere but that one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so poorly in the movie that it feels more as if it's something non-existent. i guess there even is a message and moral story in it somewhere but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it simply does not work out.<br /><br />it's basically a typical teenage comedy, with lots of sex jokes and nudity, only without the teenage main characters, which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless. the movie makes some really wrong jokes, that are misplaced for any type of movie.<br /><br />i regret ever watching this.<br /><br />3/10
