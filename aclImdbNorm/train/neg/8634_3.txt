seeing a photo of a man being attacked by zombies gave me hope that lucio "zombi" fulci might be up to his old tricks. unfortunately, other than the close ups of a rotting corpse, there's little to recommend in this story of the murder of a wealthy man and his daughter's quest to figure out who killed him. none of the characters are appealing and by the time you find out how they did it (that twist, at least, was cool), you stop caring. the only good thing i can say is that it made more sense than nightmare concert!
