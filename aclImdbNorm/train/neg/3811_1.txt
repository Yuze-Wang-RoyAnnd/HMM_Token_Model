i hated this crap, every friday as part of tgif it was on, and consistently sucked big time with stupidity each and every week. if you want to see something funny go watch "no on would tell" starring candice cameron and fred savage, it really is hilarious, shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible tv show. this show really makes me sick, i hate those kids, and bob saget needs to go jump off a bridge for ever making this crapfest. i've seen funner stuff everywhere else but here. i ahet writing 10 lines! watch 'full house' to see the least humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment.
