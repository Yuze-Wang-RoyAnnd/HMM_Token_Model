so, prom night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie. i'm a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning, but upon seeing it, it is neither horror or thriller.<br /><br />i was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable. you could predict what was going to happen next. the young actors were alright at playing their characters, but i'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wise.<br /><br />yes, i'll give props for the plot because it was good, but it's not thrilling or scary. there were almost zero "jump-in-your-seat" scenes. so, don't waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres, wait 'til it comes to dvd.
