okay so i found out about this movie and i watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time debating whether i should watch it or not. before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it. i was so unsure if i was going to watch this and be disturbed for like a long time. so i choose to risk it and watched it and heres what i thought: the beginning started off fine for me. it seemed to be heading in a decent direction. got past the rape scene and i couldn't figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie. don't get me wrong the rape scene was just as sad and scary but it didn't really bother me to a dramatic point. then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff that was going on. there was like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing! its one thing to have a shot where a person is showing some kind of emotion but this movie didn't have that. it had about 3 of these pointless scenes, where you see the main character maya kind of get out of control but it didn't show it right making me want to fast forward. then when she engaged in the hardcore partying it wasn't so boring but still a little dull. oh and as a note rosario dawson still did a great job. okay moving on so finally after an hour of pointlessness to the middle the revenge comes to maya's attention. thats where it got disturbing. i didn't feel bad for him or nothing he got what he deserved but the whole scene was really disturbing and i just felt all eck after it. i cant really tell you whether or not to watch this movie because its so...i don't know i cant find a word to sum it up. but if you choose to watch it just don't be unsuprised.
