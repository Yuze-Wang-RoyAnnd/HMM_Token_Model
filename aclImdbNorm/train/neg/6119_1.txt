muscular man-ape in the jungles of africa is hunted by an opportunistic expedition team; the comely daughter of the team's leader finds him first. much-ballyhooed version of the tarzan tale has an ok production, but is crippled by the single-handedly worst direction of a film i have ever seen. john derek is bereft of inspiration beyond cheesy slow-motion action shots and peek-a-boo glimpses of wife bo derek's unclothed body; he has about as much talent behind the camera as ed wood. trying for tongue-in-cheek sexuality, the dereks lack finesse, snappy timing, and taste. they have a sense of self-parody and bravura abandonment (they do throw caution to the winds), but after a promising opening it all goes to hell. miles o'keeffe (who possibly had marbles in his mouth the entire time) has the title role, but plays third fiddle to john derek's ego and bo derek's sense of self-importance. * from ****
