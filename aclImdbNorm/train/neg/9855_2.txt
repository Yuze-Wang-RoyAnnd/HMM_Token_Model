let me begin by saying i am a big fantasy fan. however, this film is not for me. many far-fetched arguments are trying to support this film's claim that dragons possibly ever existed. the film mentions connections in different stories from different countries, but fails to investigate them more thoroughly, which could have given the film some credibility. the film uses (nice!) cgi to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragon's life. this is combined with popular-tv-show-csi-style flash-forwards to make it look like something scientific, which it is definitely not. in many cases the arguments/clues are far-fetched. in some cases, clues used to show dragons possibly existed, or flew, or spit fire are simply invalid. to see this just makes me get cramp in my toes. even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it, but this one just doesn't have it. bottom line: it's a pretentious fantasy-csi documentary, not worth watching.
