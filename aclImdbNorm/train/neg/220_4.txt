"the crush" is a pleasant enough 40-something friends romantic chick flick for the first two-thirds or so, as it tries to be a brit "sex and the city". <br /><br />i particularly enjoyed the turn-around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out (come to think of it we didn't see all that much physical flesh of him either and kenny doughty is worth seeing more of). <br /><br />they sure make a lot more deal of young man/older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of "sabrina" (neither movie do i like) or for that matter with the douglas/zeta-jones or dion/svengali nuptials.<br /><br />surrounding andie macdowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from brit dramas and comedies, such as tart-tongued anna chancellor. <br /><br />the plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina. but it wasn't until the credits came up at the end that i realized what might really be wrong. just as with "sex and the city," the writer/director is male, here first-timer scot john mckay, and i think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men, probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work (the characters are a school principal, a cop and a doctor), which would have been a better and more interesting movie. the working title for the film was "the sad f*cker's club" which would have made its parallels with the gay "broken hearts club" even more obvious.<br /><br />(originally written 4/6/2002)
