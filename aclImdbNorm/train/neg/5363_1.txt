i did not think this movie was worth anything bad script, bad acting except for janine turner, no fantasy, stupid plot, dumb-ass husband and unfair divorce settings. if you have never seen this movie before don't even bother it's not worth it at all. the only thing that was good about it was that janine turner, did a good job acting. terry's husband is a stuck up smart-ass defense attorney who has won a lot of cases and even gotten guility murderers off. he think he is so smart but he is really just a nut. her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her. nice girl huh. yeah she's a real peach, not. she's no day at the beach either.
