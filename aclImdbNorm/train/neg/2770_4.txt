hollywood hotel was the last movie musical that busby berkeley directed for warner bros. his directing style had changed or evolved to the point that this film does not contain his signature overhead shots or huge production numbers with thousands of extras. by the last few years of the thirties, swing-style big bands were recording the year's biggest popular hits. the swing era, also called the big band era, has been dated variously from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949. although it is impossible to exactly pinpoint the moment that the swing era began, benny goodman's engagement at the palomar ballroom in los angeles in the late summer of 1935 was certainly one of the early indications that swing was entering the consciousness of mainstream america's youth. when goodman featured his swing repertoire rather than the society-style dance music that his band had been playing, the youth in the audience went wild. that was the beginning, but, since radio, live concerts and word of mouth were the primary methods available to spread the phenomena, it took some time before swing made enough inroads to produce big hits that showed up on the pop charts. in hollywood hotel, the appearance of benny goodman and his orchestra and raymond paige and his orchestra in the film indicates that the film industry was ready to capitalize on the shift in musical taste (the film was in production only a year and a half or so after goodman's palomar ballroom engagement). there are a few interesting musical moments here and there in hollywood hotel, but except for benny goodman and his orchestra's "sing, sing, sing," there isn't a lot to commend. otherwise, the most interesting musical sequences are the opening "hooray for hollywood" parade and "let that be a lesson to you" production number at the drive-in restaurant. the film is most interesting to see and hear benny goodman and his orchestra play and dick powell and frances langford sing.
