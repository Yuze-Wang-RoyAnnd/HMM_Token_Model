i consider myself to be a bit of a snob when it comes to everything and although the cinematic experience is more suited to explosions than high drama, i can be very stuck up about films, too.<br /><br />not all art films, however, are better than king kong. i quite possibly would give kong two stars, double this film's haul.<br /><br />my guess is that people got so excited about this because it was almost identical in style to what you can see in a play. for the less discerning art-buff, a film that looks like a play is 'great art'.<br /><br />this film, however, was useless.<br /><br />there was hardly any story so it relied on high drama. the only drama in this film was whether the cat would drop off the roof or not. so, deep and meaningful dialogue, then? no. great acting? hardly.<br /><br />to be excessively fair: some of the scenery was interesting, though: communist flats, city vistas (petersburg?) and the soviet trams still in service.
