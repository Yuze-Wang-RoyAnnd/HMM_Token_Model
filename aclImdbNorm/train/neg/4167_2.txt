i was eager to see "mr. fix it" because i'm a huge david boreanaz fan. what i got, though, was a 1-1/2 hour nap. the premise seemed enjoyable: boreanaz is lance valenteen, proprietor of a business called "mr. fix it", where dumped men enlist his help to get their girlfriends to take them back.<br /><br />among the problems with this movie are the editing, script, and acting. although i've found boreanaz delightful in his other film roles (with the exception of that "crow" movie he did), this was disappointing. at times, his character was interesting and others, flat. the supporting cast reminded me of soap opera day players. i realize it wasn't a big-budget film, but some of the scene cuts and music just didn't seem right.<br /><br />my advice: watch at your own risk.
