holy crap! what a terrible, terrible spanish thriller! i've had it for about four years and finally started it the other night. i watched an hour or so before heading to bed. i was pretty intrigued by the whole thing. i finished it last night and couldn't believe where i stopped it the night before. literally, i stopped it the second before the movie went completely downhill.<br /><br />like i said, i was pretty intrigued and curious as to where this mystery was going but stopped it right when simon receives the package in the bar. i picked up when he opens up the package to reveal a laser gun and then plays a "menacing" game of laser tag. whew! then the big reveal is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot by role playing game nerds. whew! you can tell the spanish industry was definitely behind director mateo gil (co-writer of amenabar's two big previous hits). there is an excellent score and great photography. but this scenario reeks of silliness. how anyone sat through the last 40 minutes with a straight face is beyond me.
