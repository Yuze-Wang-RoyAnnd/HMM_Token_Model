i rented this movie on the merits of what the trailer showed, and of course sir anthony hopkins.<br /><br />if jackson pollack teamed up with david lynch, and timothy leary to make a movie, this would be the end result. i don't think i've seen a movie like it that made an lsd trip look like an episode of sesame street.<br /><br />it's a bunch of set pieces where the characters flash in and out of reality, or various realities, and the film doesn't culminate into anything until the last 5 minutes, where all of a sudden it makes sense. i wrote a scathing review on my movie review blog that essentially gives everything away, and i won't do that here. it's a well acted piece of cinema, and the soundtrack was written by sir anthony hopkins, and let me say this, if there's one redeeming feature to this film, it's the music. it fits perfectly. some of the dialogue is unbelievably good, and unbelievably bad all at the same time.<br /><br />i enjoyed parts of this movie, i truly did, and once you get to the end of it, you'll actually figure out what's truly going on. it's unfortunate that you have to wade through 2 hours of crazy to get to a salient point, which minimizes the effect of the entire movie.<br /><br />i give it a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this film isn't the acting, it's everything.
