i have not yet seen anyone slate this film and i think i may be the first.<br /><br />it was awful. i actually didn't watch the end of it. it was like watching a boring soap or a really good one (all soaps are crap). the actors were poor and storyline was bad. the person who rated it 10/10 has no idea what he is on about. the script was awful. 2 people was in an angry conversation together involving threats and you expect the good guy to say some thing really good and beat the crap out of him but no. he says "if you do that ... i will hurt you" hahahahaha. if comedy is your thing, watch away. please do not watch this film because ... it's crap!!! <br /><br />summary: poor acting, bad fights, bad script.<br /><br />don't watch! of course this is in my opinion.
