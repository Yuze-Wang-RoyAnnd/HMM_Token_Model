...for the lt to have chosen this one. first, the film wasn't horrible, it was just hollywood. worst case i-need-this-to-happen-or-we-have-no-movie scenario: if willis' mission was to save the doctor, but she was adamant that her "people" make it out of the missionary, he would have put her on that first chopper and marched those refugees to the border without her. he would not have compromised his package for the refugees. that's not how it works. but, as i pointed out, this is hollywood, we must have drama. this is why we make movies, because reality isn't quite so complicated. however, i did think that willis and the good doctor had workable chemistry. that said, there are also some well done battle scenes in the film. it's not a waste of time, "tears of the sun" is worth the dvd rental fee. check it out on a rainy day and you'll be satisfied.
