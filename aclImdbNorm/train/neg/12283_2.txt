college student alex gardner (nicholas celozzi) is plagued by nightmares of a cellar-dwelling ghoul at alcatraz. he dreams of cutting off his own hand, spitting up a worm, a ghoul ripping open his chest and being roasted over an open fire. after his friends see him levitating "6 feet" over his bed, a helpful, occult-obsessed teacher (donna denton) suggests that they sneak into alcatraz to face his fears. of course they go in the middle of the night when no one is around to help when things get out of hand!<br /><br />the group become stranded, alex's brother richard (tom reilly) becomes possessed and starts killing everyone. toni basil of "mickey" fame shows up as the helpful ghost of sammy mitchell, lead singer of the group "bodybag". she teaches alex how to levitate out of his body and does a rock music dance intercut with repeat nightmare footage to pad out the running time. all of the victims show up as wisecracking ghosts a la the griffin dunne character in an american werewolf in london. the script is full of plot holes, cheesy dialogue and lame attempts at comedy. good fx work and cool opening credits (both by ernest d. farino) are the only things gaining any merit. basil and devo ("whip it") do some songs on the soundtrack.<br /><br />score: 2 out of 10
