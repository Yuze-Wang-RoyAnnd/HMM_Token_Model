"national lampoon goes to the movies" (1981) is absolutely the worst movie ever made, surpassing even the witless "plan 9 from outer space." the lampoon film unreels in three separate and unconnected vignettes, each featuring different performers. the only common thread is the total lack of any redeeming qualities.<br /><br />well, maybe there is one. another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are nice, and he's right. misses ganzel and dusenberry flash their assets prettily, in part one and part two, respectively. but their glamorous displays are, alas, wasted. the directors seem to have forgotten that even t&a needs a credible story to surround it, and there's none in sight.<br /><br />the third segment, starring robby benson and richard widmark, is the most disgusting of the three, and an unfortunate choice as the windup of this film. benson plays an eager-beaver young policeman, brightly reporting for his first day of duty, ready to rid the streets of evil. he is paired with an old, cynical cop played by widmark, and when these oil-and-water partners set out on their first patrol together, we sense a possible redemption of the film's earlier failures. maybe, just maybe, the cynical old-timer will be reformed by his new partner's stalwart sense of duty and loyalty. maybe all will end happily after all. but alas, this movie heads straight for the toilet, with no redemption, no happy ending, no coherent story of any kind.<br /><br />before "national lampoon goes to the movies," i thought i had already seen the worst schlock that hollywood could possibly turn out. unfortunately, i hadn't seen the half of it.<br /><br />
