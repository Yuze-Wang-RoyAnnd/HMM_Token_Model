very poor effort that offers pretty much nothing to anyone but a hardcore fan of stanley tucci, who tries, but can not save the poor structure, dialogue, direction, or talent of our leading man.<br /><br />pretty much the only trick this plodding tale of a naive new salesman for an alarm company has, is its quirky side characters. but without a realistic backdrop, such characters are pointless.<br /><br />nothing to see here, keep moving...<br /><br />
