much has been written about purple rain, the apparent "quin-essential" musician bio movie, however i'm here to tell you that the movie does not deserve it's high praise.<br /><br />first of all let's get one thing straight prince is a great musician and music is the one area where purple rain excels. even the score is mesmerising, and if this was shot purely as a concert film it would be a great experience unfortunately it's not and as such the movie has some problems.<br /><br />first of all is the horrendous acting/writing, prince's character "the kid" is supposed to come off as some type of mysterious loner of few words unfortunately this just comes off as corny and incensere. a good loner character should at least have some talkative moments, unfortunately prince's character rarely has over a few words of dialog in the film and it's hard to believe that he'd get the girl this way. everything just seems a little off here, which is a shame because you can tell this is a character that's terribly conflicted and lives a very complicated live, but we aren't ever allowed to get inside of it.<br /><br />a surprising aspect of this film is just how much of this takes place in concert. prince and morris's lives seemingly take a back seat to the performances here, which i guess makes sense from a business perspective, but it's exhausting to have a 2 hour movie where seemingly half of it takes place on stage, especially when the character's back stories get pushed aside for it.<br /><br />so to sum it up: this isn't a very good movie.
