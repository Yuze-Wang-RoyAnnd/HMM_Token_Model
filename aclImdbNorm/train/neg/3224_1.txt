when i was a kid, i remember watching this while visiting a friend of our "uncle" phil. we're back! a dinosaur's story is a silly cartoon about a dinosaur called rex (voiced by the wonderful john goodman). he tells a little boy dinosaur the story about how the dinosaurs came back to earth to live. he explains that he was part of the thing that brought them back, along with some friends. the doctor/professor villain of this film i think might have been responsible for them being them back, but i don't care about him. the kids might like this, but personally it is just too cheesy. john goodman was probably the only decent thing. poor!
