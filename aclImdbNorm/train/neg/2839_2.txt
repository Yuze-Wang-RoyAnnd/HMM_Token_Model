this movie's one of my favorites. it's not really any good, but it's great to laugh at. the dialogue can become incredibly ludicrous and poorly acted (eg, "manji, can we ask you a few questions?" "sure." "we think you can help us with the answers.") any fighting is more or less surrealistic. make sure to watch for brock, the oafy white guy who attacks the main characters. he only has two lines, but he's one of the best guys in the movie!
