when i went and saw this movie, i had great expectations. but i had so wrong. this movie was exactly as every other horror movies. it's a virus, zombies etc. exactly as resident evil and many, many other movies. but the difference with this, and other movies, is that the story is very week. it's bad actors and boring music. the photo is ok but the rest is total crap. don't see this "horror" movie, go and see the ring 2 or any other movie who's much more of a story. i hope they will stop making horror movies who has a virus and the virus spread and make people to zombies. we have seen enough of that. the only good thing in the movie is when they are standing at a roof and shoot famous, infected celebrities.
