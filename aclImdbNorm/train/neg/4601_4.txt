i don't know anything of the writer's or the director's earlier work so i hadn't brought any prejudices to the film. based on the brief description of the plot in tv guide i thought it might be interesting.<br /><br />but implausibility was piled upon implausibility. each turn of the plot seemed to be an excuse to drag in more bloodshed, gruesome makeup, or special effects.<br /><br />the score was professional and kari wuhrer seems like a decent actress but the rest was more than disappointing. it was positively repulsive.<br /><br />i will not go through the vagaries of the narrative but i'll give an example of what i think of as an excess of explicit gore.<br /><br />chris mckenna goes to an isolated ranch house and pulls the frozen body of his earlier victim (wendt) out of the deep freeze. mckenna had killed wendt by biting a chunk out of his neck. now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in wendt's demise. (what are the cops going to do, measure his bite radius?) mckenna unwraps wendt's head and neck from the freezer bag it's in, takes an ax, and begins to chop off wendt's head. whack. whack. whack. the bit of the ax keeps chipping away at wendt's neck. the air is filled with nuggets of flying frozen flesh, one of which drops on mckenna's head. (he brushes it off when he's done.) mckenna then takes the frozen head outside to a small fire he's built. he sits the head on the ground, squats next to it, takes out some photos of a woman he's just killed, and shows them to wendt's head. "remember her? we could have really made it if it hadn't been for you guys," he tells the head. "duke, you've always liked bonfires, haven't you?" he asks. then he places the head on the fire. we only get a glimpse of it burning but we can hear the fat sizzling in the flame.<br /><br />i don't want this sort of garbage to be censored. i'm only wondering who enjoys seeing this stuff.<br /><br />there's no reason to go on with the rest of the movie. well, i'll mention one example of an "implausibility," since i brought the idea up. mckenna has been kidnapped and locked in a dark bare shack. he knows he's going to be clobbered half to death in the following days. (he's literally invited the heavies to do it.) what would you do in this poe-like situation? here's what mckenna does on what may turn out to be the last night of his life. he finds a discarded calendar with a pin-up girl on it and masturbates (successfully). give that man the medal of freedom! <br /><br />a monster who looks like pizza the hut is thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks. the camera is often hand held and wobbly. the dialog has lines like, "life is a piece of s***. or else it's the best of all possible worlds. it depends on your point of view." use is made of a wide angle lens that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks. a house blows up in an explosive fireball at the end while the hero, mckenna, walks towards us in the foreground.<br /><br />some hero he is, too. he first kills a man for $13,000 by bashing him over the head several times with a heavy statue, then a potted plant, before finally tipping a refrigerator over onto the body. (this bothers him a little, but not enough to keep him from insisting on payment.) then, i hope i have the order straight, he kills wendt by ripping out part of his neck. then he kills the wife of his first victim by accident and blames the heavies for it, although by almost any moral calculus they had nothing to do with it. next he burns the head honcho (baldwin) alive. then, having disabled the two lesser heavies, he deliberately blows them up, though one of them isn't entirely unsympathetic. and we're supposed to be rooting for mckenna.<br /><br />these aren't cartoon deaths like those in the dirty harry movies either -- bang bang and you're dead. these are slow and painful. the first one -- the murder for $13,000 -- is done clumsily enough to resemble what might happen in real life. it isn't really easy to kill another human being, as hitchcock had demonstrated in torn curtain. but that scene leads to no place of any importance.<br /><br />some people might enjoy this, especially those young enough to think that pain and death are things that happen only in movies. some meretricious stuff on screen here.
