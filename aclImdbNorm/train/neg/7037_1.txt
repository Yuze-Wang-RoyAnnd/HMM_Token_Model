this is truly an awful movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life. it is simultaneously bland and offensive, with nudity and lots and lots of violence. however, the nudity is not that exciting, and the violence is repetitive and boring. also, the plot is flimsy at best, the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped, and the acting is some of the worst i have ever seen. <br /><br />i have heard that this movie is supposed to be funny, but it's not. i did not laugh once while watching it, nor did i even crack a smile. the makers of this film tried to combine a comedy movie with an action movie, and they failed on both counts. <br /><br />some poorly made movies are funny because they are so bad, but this is not one of them.
