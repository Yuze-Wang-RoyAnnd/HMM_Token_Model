i was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library - cary grant in a comedy set in the services, director stanley donen, so far what's not to like? it's the sort of film that has me wondering two things - when did all involved (including some well-known names) realize they had a turkey on their hands, and what's the worst thing about it among a number of contending aspects? still pondering the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the meandering storyline, ahead of the wordy sometimes pretentious script, the uncertain tone, the lack of consistent and well-developed characterization, and the lack of rapport between the characters. you have to add very uneven acting to the criticism but it's understandable that the actors were struggling with this stuff and in addition seem under-rehearsed. quite often they can hardly get their lines out quick enough. cary grant tries to portray his usual charming and urbane persona but at times seems uneasy and staccato in his delivery. i have to say however that i was relieved when the initial suggestions his character will be paired with the unspeakably vulgar jayne mansfield go away with the appearance of suzy parker. what's to like about the film? - for me chiefly the beauty of parker who also acts with restraint and a grace kelly-like dignity. generally speaking the film is nice to look at. the naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - however you have to truly wonder at the ghastly black fu manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite. even grant can't look elegant in his. back to the credit side, ray walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre-hogan's heroes werner klemperer speak without an assumed german accent!
