this is a really dumb movie. it could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting, but it just isn't.<br /><br />some aliens hear the broadcast of war of the worlds when a small country radio station plays it on halloween. they come to earth to kill humans, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and act goofy. the front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in space...not really what they do. these aren't party aliens, they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices. the alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the jack nicholson rip-off alien who always wears his sunglasses. other than the aliens, the acting is terrible. the writing is obviously meant for children, because every character is written like a kid.<br /><br />this is a dumb movie, that only children will appreciate, maybe.<br /><br />my rating: 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. pg for mild language.
