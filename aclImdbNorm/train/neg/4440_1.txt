let me be clear. i've used imdb for years. but only today i went through the trouble of registering on the site, just so i could give this movie the lowest possible rating. i've seen hundreds of films, some of them bad, a few awful. never, though, have i seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence, of high intentions and failure.<br /><br />mira sorvino is horribly cast as the princess, but entirely unbelievable as phocion, a young boy. fiona shaw is always an entertaining character, but the dialogue in the film is much worse, even, than in the insipid french play that is the source (marivaux never reached hollywood until now, and we should keep it that way).<br /><br />to illustrate, for example, that leontine is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from beaker to beaker, shouting out names of famous scientists. and the romance between agis and the princess is played even sillier. for this, the pair should receive a joint 'clair danes' award, which in a just world would be awarded for gratuitously anachronistic and uninspired re-interpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats of the 1990's (see miss danes in les miserables).<br /><br />aside from the atrocious plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming. for example, there are moments when a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action, sitting in chairs, watching the principal characters. the director wants us to realize she's adapted a play. i get it. but it doesn't happen at all until far into the film. at that point, seeing a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment, then disappearing, is creepy and distracting. they're like some sort of un-scary zombie crowd, appearing through the mists, filling us with dread. when you see the horrible frolic and song that ends this movie, you'll want to rouse your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the grave injustise of poisoning your mind for 112 minutes.<br /><br />-matthew mcguire
