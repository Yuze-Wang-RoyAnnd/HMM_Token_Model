begin spoiler: fitfully funny and memorable for mr. chong's literal roach-smoking scene: chong coolly mashes a stray kitchen cockroach into his pipe's bowl, lights up, coughs and hacks violently for a seeming eternity,then with perfect aplomb and not skipping a beat, re-loads the bowl properly, re-lights, re-tokes. end spoiler. alas, i began to lose faith less than half-way through the proceedings. it occurred to me that the lackadaisical duo are way obnoxious and less than relatable. i have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary stoners, harold and kumar. i simply prefer brighter company. yet, the movie is probably a perfect fit for baked frat bros or those viewers who are so feeble-minded as to be outwitted by a stoner when they-- the former are sober. notable guest appearance by paul reubens spouting obscenities in pre-pee-wee form.
