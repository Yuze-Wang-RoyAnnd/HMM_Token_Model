i bought this at tower records after seeing the info-mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central. i was actually really looking forward to watching this. my god where did i go wrong? now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies, hell i own over 1,500 dvd's! with that said, the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have ever seen. i tried to give it a chance, but not only was it not funny. it had no point, did not offend what-so-ever and was all around stupid. god who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny? this is going right to the bottom of the bin...
