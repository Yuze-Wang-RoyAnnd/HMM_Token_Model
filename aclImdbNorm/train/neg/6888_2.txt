this movie is poorly conceived, poorly acted, and poorly written.<br /><br />jon heder is terribly annoying, and cannot escape the same napolean dynamite routine. self-obsessed and ignorant.<br /><br />furthermore, diane keaton plays the same manish, overly obsessed mother, who cares too much and yet not nearly enough about the lives of her children (see because i said so). <br /><br />anna faris, though i generally like her, plays a vapid idiot in this film as well.<br /><br />jeff daniels is passable but nothing special. <br /><br />please, skip this film if you want to keep your soul.
