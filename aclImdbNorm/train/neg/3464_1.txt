it seems that several of the people who have reviewed this movie only watched it in the first place because it was filmed near where they live. how's that for a ringing endorsement? if this movie was filmed near where i lived i wouldn't be mentioning it in my review. it is horrid! several reviews state that this film is a spoof or tongue-in-cheek horror movie, it is neither. it is sad to see this film reviewed as a comedy as that makes it not only a bad attempt at a horror film but as a comedy as well. i did laugh though, at how unbelievably bad the film was.<br /><br />this movie has 2 good things going for it, the mask and the weapon of choice, unfortunately it would have been more interesting watching an hour and a half of the mask and weapon laying on a table then watching this garbage. the social commentary behind the film is also laughable, juvenile and stupid. don't bother with this movie, you've already wasted time reading this review don't waste anymore on this movie. arrggghhh! it's infuriating that movies like this even get made. i was expecting the entire cast a crew to be credited to alan smithee, a name used when a person, usually a director, doesn't want to be credited with a movie because it's so bad.<br /><br />there is nothing redeeming in this movie, i spent $1.19 on the rental and feel i was ripped off. avoid. 1 out of 10
