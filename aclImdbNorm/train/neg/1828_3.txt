i watched 'envy' two nights ago, on dvd, at a friends house. the premise of this film is quite promising, jack black and ben stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential, but it completely fails to deliver. i watched it with about five friends and no-one laughed for the entire film. the jokes (which are few and far between) are not funny in any way... the story line is crap, and they never answer the question... where does the sh*t go? of course the answer to that is no one cares. this film lacks any sort of comedy value, and as a few other users have said the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching is christopher walken as the j-man. none of the characters are developed, the plots so thin it's nearly transparent - and is that song throughout the film supposed to be funny??
