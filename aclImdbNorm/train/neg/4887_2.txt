the first movie is pretty good. this one is pretty bad.<br /><br />recycles a lot of footage (including the opening credits and end title) from criminally insane. the new footage, shot on video, really sticks out as poorly done. scenes lack proper lighting, the sound is sometimes nearly inaudible, there's even video glitches like the picture rolling and so on.<br /><br />like all bad sequels, it basically just repeats the story of the first one. ethel kills everybody who shares her living space, often for reasons having to do with them getting in the way of food she wants.<br /><br />at least it is only an extra on the dvd for the first one, which also includes the same director's film satan's black wedding. too bad it doesn't include the death nurse movies though.
