can you say "all shock, no plot?" there were so many unexplored directions in this movie. there was no history about the room other than the deaths. *why* was it evil? what made it that way? why an "hour" countdown? then, there were the unexplored things hinted at; for example we *saw* a camera in the air vent, which he mentioned. but when he climbed up said vent, there was no camera.<br /><br />how about the fact that all the ghosts looked "digital", and things "winked out" before hitting the ground making a static noise? hmmm... when you put all of *those* things together, it makes room 1408 look like a high-tech spook house. except that there was no follow up on that.<br /><br />oh... by the way... electronics don't work in 1408. well, except for the tv... the cell phone has no signal, but wireless internet works fine. how many incontinuities can you possibly add? i'm sorry, but this film was nothing but "shock after shock". it's all been done before. reflections in the mirror. things just out of site. changing paintings. bleeding walls. the "oh, it was all just a dream... no it wasn't." and, if the room was "evil", why make our main character come to terms with his daughter's death, if it was going to keep him trapped there forever anyway? it just didn't make sense.<br /><br />additionally, there was no background information about "the first book" that he wrote. just some vague information about the "dad was a jerk" and so forth. speaking of dads, what was with the bit about his father? "you'll be in my place".<br /><br />overall, a truly horrible movie. it was 100% adrenalin shock factor, without any new or innovative effects, and certainly no back story, character development, etc.<br /><br />my overall impression is that the entire movie was made on the "cheap"; pretty much using one set and a couple of location shots, and was nothing but an effects film of recycled, cheesy, "seen-that-before" effects.
