if you like a syfi soap opera this show is for you, as fare as i am concerned it does not work for me and after watching 3 episodes i just can't watch it anymore. it is boring and slow and for a show that the timeline is based around 100.000+ years ago if you base it on battlestar galactica's timeline for arriving on earth they sure seem to have all the same stuff around like the 100.000 year old chevy vans driving down the streets and people watching the 100.000 year old popular name brand lcd t.v. sets. it also goes the same with the rest of the sets as well on the show, there is just to much of today's stuff involved in it to not overlook, i think they could have done a lot better of a job to get around these issues and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same issues but not nearly as bad. as fare as the rest of the show it is not nearly as good as bsg was and it is a poor pre sequel to it
