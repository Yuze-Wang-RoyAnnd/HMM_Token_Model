the eternal jew (der ewige jude) does not have what we today would call the markings of a scholarly document: rather than naming experts or sources to support what it says, it simply says, without opposition, what it wants us to believe (one will concede that american newsreels of that period were also much less regulated than would seem ethical to a modern audience, often inserting dramatized scenes and passing them off as actual news footage). add to this directed propaganda the fact that filmmaker hippler was "preaching to the converted," not so much asking gentile europeans to hate the jews as validating the feelings so many of them must have held already, in order to have allowed the holocaust that followed. the weakest link in the film's logic shows in its "rat" analogy, wherein it goes on to explain the behavior of rats, and then adds something to the effect of "well, jewish people are like that too." similarly it characterizes jewish people as ugly by showing ugly jewish people in comparison to attractive gentiles; the accompanying leap of faith is that ugly is bad. the film appears to contradict itself a few times, for example by attacking western painters who portrayed old testament characters as light-skinned europeans; thereby the text admits that so-called "hebrew" ethnicity is in fact an ingrained aspect of christian culture. it also shows ghetto jews willingly living in roach-infested filth, despite the supposed treasure they've hoarded, and then flip-flops by saying that these same undesirables live in wealth and luxury as soon as they leave the ghetto. incidentally, who wouldn't? the use of scenes from a well-known american film, house of rothschild, shows an equally blurry deployment of logic. first the film is denounced as having been made by jews; then it is apparently used by hippler to verify the deceptiveness of jews (the aforementioned pretense of poverty by ghetto jews, shown as a means of avoiding taxation, although the rothschild character's "spin" is that jews are taxed excessively); finally the rothschild film is once again execrated for implying that the famed banking family invented the checking account. this apparent indecisiveness in whether the american footage is shown positively or negatively might become clearer with repeated viewings, but at first sight it makes for some murky moviewatching. for all of eternal jew's imperfections, i was at first surprised that the imdb viewer rating for this film is as high as it is, just shy of a "5" to date. i'd say the reason is that ej's documentary value has exceeded its original purpose, offering us, unintentionally, a look into the lives of european jews as they would not be seen a few years hence. needless to say the film's very badness also provides an historical insight into bad, or simply evil, filmmaking as a propagandist's tool. about this time i should expect director hippler to flip-flop once again, springing forward to say "that's what i meant to do all along!" the scenes depicting animal slaughter are particularly gruesome, and show same as decidedly inhumane, contrary to the intent of kosher law to prevent animal suffering. i would like for someone who has seen the film, and has some knowledge of these procedures, to comment on whether the portrayal is accurate.
