what a horrible movie. i cannot believe i wasted 90 mins of my life watching this re-make. please tell me why ving rhames and mehki pfifer starred in this film? mehki pfifer is great in e.r and ving rhames probably didn't know what he was doing. i feel terrible for them. the music background i must say did not fit at alllll with the story and it's amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no lives in creating a well and balanced film. i hope that in the future no director as horrible as this one was, could ever distroy such a great classic film. this film should not have been made in the first place. an advice to everyone who has seen it, please tell me that i'm right because i couldn't possibly be the only viewer who did not enjoy it.<br /><br />boooooo!!!!!!!! -10 out of 10.
