this isn't a movie. it is a collection of unrelated, ill-conceived and poorly assembled scenes that look like the unedited results of a dim 10 year old with a mini-dv camera. in fact, i have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor - the one with the greasy hair, dead-pan stare, ipod and nervous tic - probably shot it herself in a creative phase.<br /><br />if you made it further than the ten minutes i did, don't bother trying to fit what you saw into the context of the european artiste mentality praised above. this is a true and complete waste of time, money and film that would have made william one-shot beaudine cringe.<br /><br />the unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuum-packed characters is representative of what now passes for much of humanity.<br /><br />what's next? six directors shooting social intercourse at the wal-mart snack counter?
