i got a dvd of "bogeyman" and this stunker was an extra feature. i assumed that it was "boogeyman ii" because it was paired with the original. but you know what they say about those who "assume": it makes an "ass-" out of "u-" and "me." i had read before viewing that bii contains a lot of footage from the original and that it starred actress love. while watching "return of the boogeyman," i decided to stick around through the original footage to see the notorious death-by-toothbrush scene. before i knew it, the film was over. rip-off. i think that i thought this was bii because this has a similar title to one of bii's alternate titles. oh well, at least this was just an extra feature, right? <br /><br />let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about the movie's mistakes. many, many, mistakes. who does this guy ulli whatever think he is? does he really think the same movie will sell in different forms. there is nothing original holding part iii up. it is basically a flashback of the original through the eyes of a psychic, who is giving us a gruelingly boring play-by-play as everything happens. that's the movie. oh, and one death-by-stereo scene, but you can read that off someone else's review. my interest in "boogeyman ii" is forever lost.<br /><br />final note: this is not a series of films to watch back to back.
