after seeing the trailer of this film in the cinema, i thought that it was an original concept for a thriller, setting it in the competitive world of computer companies. the all star cast was another message that this film would probably be good. but when i didn't go to watch it in it's first week of release then it disappeared by week 2 i feared something was a miss. patiently i waited for it's dvd release, then bought it rushing home for an enjoyable evening's viewing. the anticipation on the way home was far better than the film. for a start the direction is appalling. there's no thought gone into it at all and the director just makes up a part for himself, so he can appear in the film. i wouldn't be rushing out to employ him in the future. secondly the lead role is completely miscast as ryan phillipe. phillipe normally the cool character as in cruel intentions and way of the gun but in this he's supposed to be a bumbling hero which he attempts to portray by slipping when he's running and having geeky friends, but he just doesn't look right. the female stars, rachel leigh cook and clare forlani don't feature enough but when they do neither of the performances are close to their bests. the only highlight of the film is tim robbins in a role that could have been made for him and it's his fiery temper and mysterious ways that drag the film along. the final point is that this film is another one which fills the trailer with scenes you don't see in the film and instead feature only in the deleted scenes section of the dvd. causing even more disappointment as although some of these scenes are crude they do fill in important gaps in the story.
