the three stooges in a feature length western comedy-musical? perhaps "rockin' in the rockies" was meant to combine the stooges comedy short with the western musical, in a matin'ee; if so, this was a pleasant way to break up a saturday afternoon. jay kirby (as rusty) is a handsome young hero; and, mary beth hughes (as the blonde june) and gladys blake (as the brunette betty) are pretty women. the hoosier hotshots are a harmonious group; their songs are quite tuneful; however, this is the 1940s, not the 1950s, so the film doesn't exactly "rock". there are a few laughs; but the stooges' brand of humor is more subdued than usual. the talking horse is also underutilized. <br /><br />**** rockin' in the rockies (4/17/45) vernon keays ~ moe howard, larry fine, curly howard, mary beth hughes
