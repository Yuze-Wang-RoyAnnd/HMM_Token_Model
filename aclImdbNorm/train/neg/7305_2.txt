the premise of cabin fever starts like it might have something to offer. a group of college teens after finals (in the fall?) goes to a resort cabin in the woods where one by one they are attacked by an unseen flesh eating virus.<br /><br />unfortunately, the first paragraph is where any remote elements of film quality stop. cabin fever is little more than college kids looking for sex, booze, talking non-stop about nothing, and seeing how many f-bombs they can get into 1:40 minutes or however long this mess is.<br /><br />the kids act and react stupidly to everything around them. one of them for instance discovers that the skin virus has infected her legs, so what does she do? she keeps shaving her legs failing to take proper medical attention for her wounds. the scene is little more than a gross out. in another scene, rider strong from "boy meets world" gets bitten on the hand by some kid who only says "pancakes" and likes to do karate kicks on those who sit next to him. if you can figure out the reason for why the "pancakes" kid was included, i'd love to know. anyway, rider pets a wild dog and goes off to wash his bitten hand in a most likely contaminated creek. another kid likes to drop f-bombs in reacting to everything around him and shoot squirrels. why? your guess is as good as mine!<br /><br />rider strong is the only kid with any recognition in this movie. he tries to calm people down in-between the yelling and screaming and f*** y**! bombs that people are throwing around. when the kids aren't yelling, they are having or talking about sex or talking nonsense to the other adult characters who are even more (if that is possible)idiotic than the kids! the idiot cop with an iq of 60 at best may be one of the worst acting jobs i have ever seen in a movie. you talk about people not playing with a full deck, this dork doesn't even know how to find the cards! lol! i was like, "will you please shut up already?!" he makes the kid actors look like geniuses! the only part that i sort of liked was rider's scary story (although gory) about the deranged bowling alley guy. in interviews, rider said that he had a great deal of respect for director eli roth. but the problem is that mr. roth appears to be going for little more than shock and gore. there are far too many bad things about this movie for mr. roth to get any credit. i wish i could agree with rider and find something likable about this movie. maybe the fall scenery in the beginning? actually, rider strong just saves this movie from being a 1! hopefully, he was compensated for this junk!
