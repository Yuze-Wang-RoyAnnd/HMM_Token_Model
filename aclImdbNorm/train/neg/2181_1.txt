i saw this movie thinking that it would be one of those old b movies that are fun to watch. i was so wrong! this movie was boring and obviously aimed at males who like looking at corpulent women. the story was so ridiculous and implausible that it lost my interest altogether. it seemed to be in the same genre as the ed wood films - bottom of the barrel.
