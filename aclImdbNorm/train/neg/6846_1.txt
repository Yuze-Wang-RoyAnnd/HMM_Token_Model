i am a big fan of karishma kapoor and govinda. i watched this film after i had seen fiza, which was absolutley brilliant.<br /><br />there are films that are bad, and there are films that are cr*p. but this film just takes the biscuit.<br /><br />we were so annoyed that we were conned out of paying our money expecting a decent film.<br /><br />avoid at all cost, dont even rent it.<br /><br />1/10
