i would rather have 20 root canals than go through this film again. the prince of annoying, myles berkowitz, has wasted nearly two hours of my life with this piece of cynical pseudo-cool. the only amusing thing in this whole mess is mr. samaha's obnoxious off camera patter about tits and ass. berkowitz takes a great concept and grinds it into the dust. it is choppy and badly done, in an apparent effort to make it seem edgy or funny. it is neither. i seldom feel that a movie was a waste of film (or tape), but this one qualifies for that distinction. if a date suggests seeing this film, run.
