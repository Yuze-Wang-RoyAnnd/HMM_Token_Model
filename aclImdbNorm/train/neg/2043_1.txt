awful, awful, awful.<br /><br />a condescending remark at the start and a few nasty autopsy photos does not a good movie make. once again i'm amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a movie production and yet they don't have the pride to realise that what they have made is an utter pile of crap.<br /><br />i sat and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that i could at least balance my criticism but the only one i could think of was that the opening track by pink was pretty good....i wonder if she has seen this?<br /><br />watch this at your peril, the boredom may kill you.
