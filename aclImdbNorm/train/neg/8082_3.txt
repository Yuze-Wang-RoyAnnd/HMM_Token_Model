it was one of those late night "it's there" i saw it things. sometimes they are great. this one was awful, but it really shouldn't have been.<br /><br />the movie had a really good cast. how can you fail when you have charlsten heston and jack pallance? we're talking oscar winner turf here. it had good special effects. it even had some really good tits! and i mean nicely shown, full breast with full nipple and at one point even some beaver. but it didn't compensate for the one missing ingredient - a story! the plot was ludicrous. i don't mean the "solar crisis" sun exploding stuff, but that was bad enough. it was the rest of the stuff - the oh so stupid and totally predictable evil corporation stuff. man that just stank! no amount of good acting or cool space ships or fight scenes could get around that one.<br /><br />i have seen the same cast members be incredibly good. i have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets. all the difference is in the writing.
