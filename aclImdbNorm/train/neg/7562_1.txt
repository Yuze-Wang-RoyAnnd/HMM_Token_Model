i haven't seen the original, but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who happens to scroll down this far: wicker man is the worst movie i've seen this year. maybe even in two years. i wish i could ask the theater for my money back or turn back time to warn myself not to see it.<br /><br />i'll give it two positive nods: the sarcasm of cage's character at least got some laughs from me and the scenery of the island was beautiful. sorry, that's it. here come the jeers. the movie's plot is only propelled forward because other characters won't give cage any straight answers--and he puts up with this!!! how this could go on for over an hour of my time(much less days in the movie) is beyond me. <br /><br />not to mention that the plot is full of holes. you leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library. how anyone could read this script and think, "yes, people should pay $11 to see this shady outline of what a film should look like" is beyond me.<br /><br />do not go see this flick. or even rent it on dvd.
