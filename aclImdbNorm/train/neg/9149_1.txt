there is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the tiniest scrap of talent. nobody in it has ever tried acting before, even the extras in the coffee shop look as if they've been glued in place. nothing looks rehearsed.the film quality is terrible. most of the 'action' takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman crammed in as an afterthought, swinging some cheapo camera backwards and forwards between 'actors' as they deliver their lines. no tripod and no proper microphone either, there sound quality is terrible. even 'manos' fares better than this, at least they had proper equipment. what plot there is simply gets lost in the production mess.<br /><br />stick to home videos, preferably made by some 5 year kid trying out the video feature on daddy's new camera phone. you will be in for a long search to find a movie more inept than this.
