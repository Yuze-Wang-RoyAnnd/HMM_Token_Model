there is a lot of talk of torture these days. that's all this movie is. it's about a good person who makes a bad decision. because of his kindness, he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. from then on its a just-for-kicks assault on him. i don't know at what point you do something about it. there is a wife and child out there somewhere; he has great feelings of guilt and fear. but there should have been some times when he could have acted. the movie seems to be somebody's joke. i suppose in the wake of the manson murders, we had a bit of a fixation on the likes of these two. nevertheless, why would someone make a film like this? what appeals does it have except for sadism. the conclusion is totally unsatisfying, but that could have been remedied with an obvious plot twist. oh, well. another hour and a half of my life.
