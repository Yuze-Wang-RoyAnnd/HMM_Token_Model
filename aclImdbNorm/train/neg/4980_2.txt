i just read a review defending this film because it had a low budget, now my take on things.<br /><br />the cgi monsters was reasonable well animated but was implemented in the worst possible way. the fight scenes weren't even fights it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all. when the monster did interact it looked like it was done in paintshop pro. in my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets. they may not look as fancy but at least they interact, just look at peter jacksons early films.<br /><br />as for the acting beowulf did an descent job but the rest of the cast were either not trying or they forgot where they where.<br /><br />the script seemed confused to me. one minute they would be talking as if it were a modern day setting the next you get drama club shakespeare speech. i'm not say it should be all 'ye' and 'that it be' but you need to find a cohesive balance so the lines sound like they come from the same person.<br /><br />i did notice one part near the start when beowulf was quoting the old testament which would have been find had he not spent the rest of the films talking about the gods and portents.<br /><br />in short, this film is a very slightly polished turd, but a turn none the less.
