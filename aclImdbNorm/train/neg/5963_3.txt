this movie starts out with an execution of a practitioner of witchcraft and his mistress. his head is chopped off and buried separately of his body...sounds like "the thing that wouldn't die" doesn't it? well it does play out a little like that, but once the body is reunited with the head, all the interesting and gruesome deaths are done and the movie moves very slowly. i mean the movie is only 88 minutes long and i kept thinking "when is it going to end"? the characters in the movie are idiots for the most part and they pretty much deserve to die for being really stupid. the villain is also very bad as he is slow moving and really you wonder how he manages to do anything considering he is afraid of jewelery. the only thing to keep you watching after the head is reattached is the fact that there are so many boobs being flashed that you really begin to lose track. still i want to see a horror movie, not a soft core porn flick and as a horror movie it is way to slow moving with way to many slow stretches to be even somewhat enjoyable. and don't read the back of the box as it made it out like there were flesh eating zombies attacking the town, there isn't...only a small scene where three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily repelled they are not a factor in the movie at all and their scene is rather pointless. so for the most part i say you should avoid this movie unless you come across it for really cheap.
