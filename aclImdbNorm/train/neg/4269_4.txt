sometimes a premise starts out good, but because of the demands of having to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention-deficit disorder, it devolves into an incongruous mess. and for three well-respected actors who have made better work before and after, this is a mortal shame.<br /><br />so let's see. premise: a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop. interesting to say the least. make the encroaching cop a little disturbing, why not. it was well done in the hand who rocks the cradle and single white female, and it's a proved ticket to a successful thriller.<br /><br />now herein lies the dilemma. create a disturbing story that actually bothers to bring some true menace into its main characters while never going so far as to look ridiculous, or throw any semblance to reality, amp up the shock factor, and make this cop so extreme -- an ultra bad variation of every other super-villain that's hit cinemas since the silent age.<br /><br />the producers, and directors, chose the latter. thus is the resulting film -- badly made, with actors trying their darnedest to make heads or tails in roles that they've essayed before, and nothing much amounting to even less.
