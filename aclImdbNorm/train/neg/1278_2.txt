imagine a woman alone in a house for forty five minutes in which absolutely nothing happens. then this goes on twice more. the writing is flat and lifeless, and jokes unfunny, and the bad acting keeps you from caring about any of the characters, even when they battle wolf packs and get beaten up by fraternity goons. anyone that ranked this movie higher than a two is not fully sane.
