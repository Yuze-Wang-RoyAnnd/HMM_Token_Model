** here be spoilers ** <br /><br />recap: mia (helin) is returning home from capital stockholm to rural r"attvik to celebrate her fathers 70th birthday. she is by far the youngest child, and has two sisters eivor (ernst) and gunilla (petr'en). eivor has a family and still lives in r"attvik and gunilla has divorced and moved a town away. mia is still single and is focused on her career. there are a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and conflicts arise all around as they confront each other and each have personal problems they have difficult to handle. as the party goes on (and alcohol consumed), more and more secrets become unveiled and more and more conflicts arise...<br /><br />comments: to be the work of a new writer/director it was disappointing to see this movie to follow in the exact same tracks that older swedish comedy/dramas has been following for years. there are really no new elements or ideas. this movie draws upon three basic areas. 1) embarrassing humor only based on characters making a fool of themselves. 2) sorrow and 3) anxiety. this move has the focus on the last one, almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along. no loss though, since the humor that is there is not funny. the performances from the cast are good i guess, though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten. i had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences, but there were none. to conclude, there are better ways to spend one's time than watching this.<br /><br />3/10
