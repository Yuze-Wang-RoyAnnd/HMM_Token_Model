spanish horror icon paul naschy stars in this, one of his weakest werewolf films... but bear with me for a moment. most people will be familiar with it under its most common television title, the fury of the wolf man, and there have been many home video versions of it over the years. if you want to be serious about giving it a fair shot though, the most workable edition i've seen of it goes by the title the wolf man never sleeps, and it's an unedited and complete european version which restores a couple of disturbing scenes and contains the original nude shots which are missing from fury's print. it is also letterboxed.<br /><br />naschy plays waldemar daninsky, returning home from a trip to tibet only to find out that he's contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife has been having an affair. he takes care of her and her lover while in animal form, but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy woman doctor and her female assistant. apparently, the doc attempts to "tame" the werewolf, and there is a very strange sado-masochistic love scene between her and the hairy and fanged daninsky who is under her trance, at least in the original version. ultimately we get two werewolves for the price of one as daninsky battles a she-wolf! <br /><br />the biggest problem with the movie is that the director (according to naschy's claims) was often drunk, and the results are indeed rather incoherent. when watching the wolf man never sleeps copy, it's not quite as difficult to make out what's going on, though the editing remains atrocious in spots. worst of all is occasional non-matching footage of naschy's ravenous werewolf swiped straight from another previous film (la marc del hombre lobo, aka "frankenstein's bloody terror") and mixed into this one without any sensible reason! the wolf's clothing changes from black shirt to white and back again, as does his demeanor; one moment the wolf is walking around lethargically in a hypnotic trance from fury, next he is growling and running around savagely from bloody terror. really bizarre.
