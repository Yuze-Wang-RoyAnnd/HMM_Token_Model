for some strange reason the film world is driven by fashion . someone makes a film about a killer shark then all of a sudden the film world`s oceans are awash with giant squids , killer octopusses and sea monsters of every ilk . a man is stalked by an erstwhile lover from hell then every film character is stalked by a cop from hell or a flatmate from hell or a babysitter from hell . then when a major hollywood company produces a big budget fx laden blockbuster about tornados then other film producers jump upon the bandwagon , the fact that they don`t have the budget to pull it off doesn`t stop them. night of the twisters is a case in point . what struck me about this made for television film is the fact that it tries to hide its lack of budget by cutting to the ad breaks . everytime a tornado appears the camara locks onto the horrified expression of the actors as they scream things like " oh my gawd it`s heading this way " and " run for your lives " then the screen fades to black saving the producers the need to up the special effects budget . unfortunately night of the twisters budget should have been upped to include better actors . the cast are by no means bad but they are unimpressive and lack the skill to carry a film which is character driven . where`s josh hartnett and elijah wood when you need them ?<br /><br />and the last word on this being a twister clone ..... yes nott was released a couple of months before twister but twister had been hyped for several months as being the summer blockbuster of 1996 and nott has a rushed feeling to it which leads me to believe that it was made and released to tie in with the hype surrounding twister
