i was so disturbed by the real footage at the beginning of the film that i felt sick to my stomach and ended up shutting the movie off. how any can give this film more than a rating of 1 baffles me. i know that the intent of the movie is to shock, but showing actual footage of a dog that had been skinned alive (holding back vomit as i type) - please! i shut it off after the scene with the decomposing baby. i had had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point. no wonder this movie was found at the bargain bin in hmv. i really have no desire to see any other movie by this uwe person. anyone who enjoyed this needs therapy. period.
