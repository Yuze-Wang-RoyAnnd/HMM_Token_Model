when i borrowed this movie from a friend (thankfully i did not buy it) on the package (which truly looked bad and ugly) was printed "the ultimate vampire horror". after watching it i thought that the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the film itself. the "story" begins when a teenager (surprise!) is chased by some vampire/zombie-creatures.<br /><br />lighting, sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a holiday-video on a ten year old vhs-system if not worse. i gave the movie a 2 out of 10 and only because the promo-t-shirts looked kind of cool. i don't want to dis' film-students or splatter-movies generally but i've seen braindead and i've seen a 20-dollar-budget movie from students that was ten times better than this crap.
