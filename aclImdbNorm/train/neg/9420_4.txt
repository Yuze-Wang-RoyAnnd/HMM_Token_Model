follow-up to 1973's far better "cleopatra jones" has statuesque black actress tamara dobson returning to her signature role as chic, super-tough narcotics agent, here busting a heroin ring in hong kong. cross-pollination of blaxploitation action-flick and kung-fu b-movie is fun at the outset but eventually flags. the shoot-out finale is right off the assembly-line, and dobson herself seems less energetic than before (she's still sexy, and she puts a unique spin on her comically-stilted dialogue, but these surroundings may have been too much of one thing for her--she's jaded). stella stevens plays the villainess this time; she's good, but can't match shelley winters in the predecessor. ** from ****
