wow, could have been such a good movie,starts of with brittany daniels tied up, im thinking cool we are going to get a flash back, but nothing, movie starts anew with the kid filming. this movie probably would have been better if it wasn't for the acting. i mean the acting was mostly horrible.. although with the lines the poor actors had to deal with i guess they did the best they could..still it really ruin the movie for me.. the twins were the only ones that seem to have some acting skills.. the movie drags to long for the supposed shocking conclusion.. all in all i have seen worse low budget movies but considering this was hype with the 8 films to die for i was very disappointed.. by the way, were did some reviewers say there was gore and stuff. did i see the same movie.. well this is 4 out of the eight, and so far only one has been any good..
