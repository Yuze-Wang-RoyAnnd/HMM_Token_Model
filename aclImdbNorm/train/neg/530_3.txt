i saw this in a sneak two days before the official opening, and i must say i was extremely disappointed. and i have to put the majority of these problems on the decision to cast claire danes in the lead role. depending on what you think about danes, she was either horribly miscast, or is so far in over her head that she should be the early favorite for the 2007 razzie for worst actress. i think we were supposed to be sympathetic to her. instead, she is completely unlikeable. the other "great" actresses do an ok job, but certainly don't light up the screen. out of all the "great" actresses in this movie, i'd say the one who did the best job was natasha richardson. streep is barely in the picture, and only appears near the very end.<br /><br />horrible screenplay as well. it comes off more as them reading lines than truly being "in character."
