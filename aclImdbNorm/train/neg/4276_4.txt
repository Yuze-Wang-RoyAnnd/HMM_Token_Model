this overrated, short-lived series (a measly two seasons) is about as experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a strip bar. i am not quite sure what they mean by "ground-breaking" and "original" when they fawn all over lynch and his silly little tv opus. what exactly is their criteria of what is original? sure, compared to the "bill cosby show" or "hill street blues" it's original. definitely. next to "law & order" tp spews originality left and right.<br /><br />fans of tp often say that the show was canceled because too many viewers weren't smart enough, open enough for the show's supposed "weirdness", its alleged wild ingenuity, or whatever. as a fan of weirdness myself, i have to correct that misconception. there is nothing too off-the-wall about tp; it is a merely watchable, rather silly whodunit that goes around in circles, spinning webs in every corner but (or because of it) ultimately going nowhere. the supposed weirdness is always forced; the characters don't behave in a strange way as much as they behave in an idiotic way half the time. there's a difference...<br /><br />whenever i watch the "weird dream" sequence in "living in oblivion" in which the dwarf criticizes the director (buscemi) for succumbing to the tired old let's-use-a-midget-in-a-dream-scene clich'e, i think of lynch. you want weird? "eraserhead" is weird - in fact, it's beyond weird, it's basically abstract. you want a unique tv show? watch "the prisoner". you want a strange-looking cast? felini's and leone's films offer that. tp looks like an overly coiffed tv crime drama in which all the young people look like fashion models. the cast gives tp a plastic look. kens & barbies en masse.<br /><br />in fact, one of the producers of tp said that lynch was looking for "unique faces" for the series. unique faces? like lara flynn boyle's? sheryll fenn's? like those effeminate-faced "hunks" straight out of men's catalogs (or gay magazines)? don't get me wrong; there is nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially with beauties like fenn (the way madonna would look if she were 1000 times prettier), but then don't go around saying you're making a "weird show with weird-looking people". and i have never understood lynch's misguided fascination with kyle maclachlan (i should get a medal for bothering to spell his name right). he is not unlikable, but lacks charisma, seeming a little too bland and polished. his character's laughable "eccentricities" were not at all interesting, merely one of lynch's many attempts to force the weirdness, trying hard to live up to his reputation - him having completely lost his edge but that time. everything lynch made post-"elephant man" was very much sub-par compared to his first two movies. what followed were often mediocre efforts that relied on lynch's relatively small but fanatical fan base to keep him in the public eye by interpreting meanings into his badly put-together stories that don't hold any water on closer scrutiny. in other words, lynch is every intellectual-wannabe's darling. <br /><br />so laura palmer was killed by her dad...? he was obsessed by the devil or some such nonsense. that's the best this "great mind" could come up with... you've got b-movie horror films that end with more originality. <br /><br />lynch is neither bright nor hard-working enough to come up with a terrific story.<br /><br />go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~fedor8, and check out my "tv & cinema: 150 worst cases of nepotism" list.
