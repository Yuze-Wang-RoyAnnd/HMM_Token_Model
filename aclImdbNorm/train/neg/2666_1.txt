honestly, if anyone has a brain, there's not 1 positive thing<br /><br />to say about this movie what so ever. <br /><br />i lost my $1 renting this. i'd rather laugh at will smith saying "if you got a dream, you got to protect it". <br /><br />all the actors must've been bored or had no fame at the time. even matthew mc conahay *however you spell it* was better then all the actors in this movie, when he played a psycho in texas chainsaw 4. if you see this movie, and have anything good to say, you iq, must be extremely low, with such bad taste in movies, it hurts. thank you...and the truth, has been spoken!<br /><br />save yourself from the misery. <br /><br />get devil's rejects, now that's a classic.
