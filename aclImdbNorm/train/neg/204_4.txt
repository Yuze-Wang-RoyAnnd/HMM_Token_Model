the perfect murder is foiled when a wife(played by mary ellen trainor, once the wife to director robert zemeckis, who helmed this episode), who murders her husband with a poker, has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside..an escaped insane madman dressed in a santa claus suit(played by a deviously hideous larry drake). she fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband's corpse. she decides to use an ax, once she downs the santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman's head, to frame the killer for her husband's murder. santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman's daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child.<br /><br />this episode of tales from the crypt just recycles tired material involving the old "santa kills" theme while also adding the oft-used(add nauseum)woman-murders-her-husband-for-a-man-she's-been-cheating-with routine. it's essentially trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac. there's nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions. not one of the show's highlights.
