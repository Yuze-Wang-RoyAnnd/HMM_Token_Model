quite typical for swedish movies of this type. strange that the acting was soooo bad, these actors usually give a good show. the casting was poorly done, it made you expect something (i won't tell you what). the lead character was awful... i don't know where they find her. anyway, stay away from this and go see "den tredje vagen" instead, this is swedish action in is prime.
