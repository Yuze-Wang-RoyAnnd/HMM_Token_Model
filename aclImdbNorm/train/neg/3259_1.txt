fantastically putrid. i don't mean to imply above that only a few people should avoid "doc savage." almost every demographic group would be bored by this trivial, tv-movie-quality production. it's a little like the 60's "batman" tv series, except it's not funny. even accidentally. you're better off taking a nap.
