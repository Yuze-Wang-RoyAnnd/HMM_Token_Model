okay, i seriously can't think of anything worse than the pr series. there are many bad things in life...traitors, liars, etc. but seriously, power rangers has got to be at the bottom of this list. can you think of anything more stupid than five-six teenagers (who don't even act like a normal teen) dancing around in identical suits with different colors so that you can tell them apart? fans, have you ever come across a real person who gets flung against a mental wall and gets up almost immediately and continues to fight without getting injured? power rangers are for five-year old boys, and believe me, i never liked this show even when i was five.<br /><br />i guess you can say dino thunder is an exception. the teens actually act like teens, and tommy oliver actually acts like a mentor, or no, a teacher. it's got teen-humor, though the fighting is lame, i don't hate dino thunder.<br /><br />many people say power rangers are crap, but i wouldn't. it would be an insult to crap. so face it, five year old boys, power rangers is rubbish.
