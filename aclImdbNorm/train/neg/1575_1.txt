this movie is so bad it hurts. the car doing 30 mph when it's supposed to go 100... the shift lever that's stuck (in park!), the nurse that drives for almost 2 hours with the cell phone on the shoulder...can't any of the 2 morons take this damn phone? there's nothing credible in this crap. i would be ashamed to be seen in a movie like this!
