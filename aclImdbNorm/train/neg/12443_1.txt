- let me start by saying that i understand that invasion of the star creatures was meant to be a parody of the sci-fi films of the 50s. i understand that none of it is to be taken seriously. the problem i have is that none of it works. a parody should be funny and this one just isn't. not once during the entire runtime did i so much as crack a smile. in general, i am easily entertained, but i couldn't find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in invasion of the star creatures.<br /><br />- i knew i was in trouble right from the beginning. the two "stars" make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable - a water hose they can't control that gets them both wet. these two come off as bowery boys wannabes. why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the bowery boys is beyond me. after the less than illustrious beginning, the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences, dancing indians, vegetable men, decoder rings, and other assorted unfunny bits. it's all just a complete waste of time.<br /><br />- i bought this on the double feature dvd with invasion of the bee girls. that movie is academy award winning stuff in comparison with invasion of the star creatures.
