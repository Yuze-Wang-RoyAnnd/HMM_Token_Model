i am wanting to make a "holmes with doors" pun but i can't quite string it all together. suitably grubby and over edited wonderland gives kilmer a role that channels morrison at the same time....but how coy is this film about the famous 14 inches! australian crime films flash it all the time and skip the graphic violence instead.....as someone famous said once about us cinema double standards: "kiss a breast and it's an x, stab it and its an action pg 13"... wonderland is 14 minutes too long too, and at the end the tawdry spiral we were all glad to escape the cinema. how many films called wonderland are we going to get? there must be six in the last decade. the pixilated violence and muted color sets the seedy tone but the wobble-cam gets tiresome, as if we are gawking at their nostrils all the time. taking a few cues form the doors and taxi driver it all becomes forgettable the next day.
