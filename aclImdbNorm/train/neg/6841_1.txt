i'm hearing rumors of an upcoming "leonard nimoy demonstrates the blu-ray disc". with advances over the past 25 years ranging from steady-cam to cgi, it'll be interesting to see if the franchise can be reinvigorated. i just hope it helps to remove the bad taste left in my mouth by that whole magnavision demonstration fiasco.<br /><br />and yes... "leonard nimoy demonstrates the betamax vcr" was a brilliant milestone in entertainment history. after the tentative "leonard nimoy demonstrates the compact cassette" and the downright tacky "leonard nimoy demonstrates the 8-track tape", who would have expected such a glorious piece of cinema? i'm weeping right now just thinking about it.
