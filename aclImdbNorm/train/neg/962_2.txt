chances are if i watched this again i might get physically sick, the film is so annoying.....unless you believe in psychics, re-incarnation and the other hocus- pocus which this promotes big-time. the "re-cycling of souls," they call it here. puh-leeze.<br /><br />this story has been done several times before with such films as "heaven can wait." it's also been done a lot better. too bad they had to waste the talents of robert downey jr., cybill shepherd, ryan o'neal and mary stuart masterson.<br /><br />at least it's a pretty tame film, language-wise. that's about the only redeeming quality of this movie.
