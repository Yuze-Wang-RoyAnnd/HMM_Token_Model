first off, i really loved henry fool, which puts me in a very small pool of movie goers. parker posey is one of best actresses on-screen today. but this film was a full-out travesty. watching hartley and the actors talk about the film in the extras - so full of pride, and making pointless analogies to star wars - was stomach-turning. this was hype on the producers part (hdnet) realized to the max. a true example of the emperor and his new clothes. mostly i feel that hal has spoiled henry fool forever. i don't think i can ever see it again in it's pure, innocent light.<br /><br />remember hal, you can fool some of the people some of the time... etc. the director would be nowhere today if all he did was churn out meaningless garbage. sadly, it's a pure example of the lesson taught in the film adaptation. the story must be exciting and active, or its box-office hopes are dim indeed. never mind a decent story. for the actors, it was like trying to act in a straitjacket.<br /><br />the score, i believe hartley's, is tasteless. with drum hits walking all over dialog. there was one apple soundtrack loop i recognized that gave me a smile.<br /><br />when i saw the trailer, i thought, oh, they're just trying to grab a new audience. but it's really this ridiculous ride. i'd be happy to spoil this movie for you, but it's been done. it's rotten. the fool franchise is dead. long live henry fool.
