who ever wrote the two or three glowing reviews were either involved in the making of this film, term used loosely, or bank rolling it, and should the latter be the case, i would want my seven dollars back! the actors, again term used loosely, are awful, in fact almost none of them did anything ever again which is a relief. the scenery and everything about this screams, we had 7 dollars to work with and a day to do it in. was this filmed in someones back yard? everything about this project says, low budget. the actors at best were d list. do not waste your time, unless of course you want to take it back and try to get the rental back. the lead bad guy looks like that punk from the 70s show that ended up marrying his grandmother dummee moore. my local blockbuster video store lists this as the movie most returned with sad commentary attached. even as a 99 cent rental this flick gathers dust. someone really must have owed some favors. this is a super stinker and i give it 10 turds.
