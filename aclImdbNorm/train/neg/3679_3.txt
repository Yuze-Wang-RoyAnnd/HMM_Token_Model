this is a japanese film but there is quite a bit of english also spoken in here. it's a pretty film, with nice visuals, featuring the scenic beauty of hawaii.<br /><br />however, that was the only redeeming quality for me. the story was generally boring. who wants to watch a young woman sulk for 90 percent of the film because her "picture" husband is a lot older than he advertised he was? granted, that could be a bummer......but get over it!<br /><br />only in the last 10 minutes does she do an about-face and become fond of him. by then, for most viewers, it was too little-too late. we'd fallen asleep by then.
