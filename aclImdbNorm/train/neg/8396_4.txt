...but i've seen better too.<br /><br />the story here is predictable--a film crew trying to film a horror movie in a place where murders occurred. three guesses what happens. this isn't a total bomb--the cast is fairly good with pros john ireland, faith domergue and john carradine giving the best performances. it's reasonably well-made--for a low budget film. just don't expect any nudity, swearing, blood or gore (the film has a very mild pg rating). i was never totally bored--it's ok viewing on a quiet night. i saw it on video--it was a horrible print--very dark and some scenes were impossible to see. still i didn't hate it and it does have a cool ending which surprised me--basically nothing happens up till then so it catches you off guard. worth seeing but only if you're a horror film completest.
