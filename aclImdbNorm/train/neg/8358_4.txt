this isn't one of arbuckle's or keaton's better films, that's for sure. fatty's wife is tired of all his heavy drinking, so she takes him to a sanitarium where a psychiatrist (keaton) claims to have a guaranteed cure! well, once there, arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and is taken to surgery. then, he escapes and is chased about the place where he meets a cute girl who also wants to escape. finally, despite staff chasing them about, they escape at which point it becomes apparent that the girl is crazy and arbuckle is soon recaptured. however, he awakens and everything after the surgery has all been a dream--there was no sexy crazy girl and dr. keaton isn't as big an incompetent as he seemed in the dream.<br /><br />a lack of humor is the biggest problem with the film. sure, making fun of mentally ill people is pretty low, but in its day it was guaranteed laughs. i'd laugh, too, if there was just something funny to respond to! a lot of energy and that's all.<br /><br />fyi--during one of the chase sequences, fatty wonders into a race for men over 200 pounds (wow, what are the odds of that?). and, shortly after this, he backs into a post on which the number 5 was just freshly painted. as a result, the five is now on the back of fatty's shirt and he looks like a regular participant. however, the number should have appeared backwards on fatty's shirt but came out front-ways--a mistake, as they should have realized the mirror image would have been a backwards 5.
