having the in-laws over for the weekend? then this is the film to hasten their departure, failing that it will induce a catatonic state to bring a welcome relief from constant nagging.<br /><br />the film is supposedly set on board a luxury cruise ship, which is more superannuated car ferry; the plot has more holes than the average colander and a cast dredged from the depths of the celebrity d list. an interesting piece of added amusement is playing "spot the villain" as passengers join the ship. you won't be wrong!!!! with a script that sinks faster than a brick, clich'ed set pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubling as blood this film attempts to encompass the genres of thriller, action movie and gore-fest and simultaneously fails to fulfil any of them.<br /><br />a must watch film, if only to laugh at how bad it is.
