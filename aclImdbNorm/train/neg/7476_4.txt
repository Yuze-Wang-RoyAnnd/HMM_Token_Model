evil aliens owes a huge debt to peter jacksons early films bad taste and braindead.i must confess to never enjoying those films particularly and i say the same about this.jake west is a director who clearly lacks inspiration of his own and chooses to steal from those whom he looks up to.i lost count of the amount of times a major hollywood film was quoted most notably james camerons aliens.the amount of blood and gore on show here isn't funny either,the latter end of the film becomes tired and dragged out.maybe it would have worked better as a short film.the actors a poor,the direction is weak and the plot is non existent.i can see what the director was trying to do,the homage he was trying to pay,but others have done the same thing a lot better than presented here. 4/10
