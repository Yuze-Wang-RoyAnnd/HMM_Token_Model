complete drivel. an unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical, toxic culture of a decade ago. in this movie, pedestrian regrets for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist subtexts (the annoying redhead feeding shaka rice?). forget historical reality too. didn't most western slaves comes from west africa? an american slaver easily capturing shaka with a handful of men?. finally, david hasslehoff could not have been any more obnoxious. one can only ponder, how would he have fared in the miniseries? (promptly impaled most likely). the miniseries was superb, and it is unfortunate that dh should have gotten his hands on something unique, and made it mundane. (i tend to think that he had hand in creating this fiasco).
