yes, in 35 years of film going i have finally viewed the stinker that surpasses all other ghastly movies i have seen. beating 'good will hunting' baise moi' and 'flirt' for sheer awfulness. this is pretentious blige of the first order... not even entertaining pretentious bilge. the effects are cheap, and worse - pointless.<br /><br />the script seems to have been written by a first year film student who doesn't get out much but wants to appear full of portent! the acting is simply undescribably bad - tilda swinton caps a career filled with vacuous woodeness with a performance which veers neurotically between comotose and laughable 'intensity'. apparently, some fool out there has allowed the director of this film to make another one... be warned
