why, o' why! ...did i pick this one up? well... i needed a no-brainer in the summer heat, and the cover looked cool.<br /><br />of course i should've known better. this is a really, really bad movie. and it gets embarasing when the makers know it's bad, and try cover it up by adding some sexy/beautiful women, and some sex-scenes to it. well, folks... it does'nt cut it, does it!<br /><br />if you would like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very, very good, well-played and funny: go rent lake placid! (that is an order)
