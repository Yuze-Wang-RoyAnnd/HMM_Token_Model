well...i was going to wait till this came out on video to see it, and i wish i had, i actually caught scary movie 2 on cable the other day, and it made me yearn for more of the same, what i got was airplane on crack... i mean if you like airplane or any other leslie nielsen vehicles, then you'll probably be in heaven, but if your used to the usually wayans comedy, then you will be dissapointed, there was alot more eye candy in this one which will keep young hormone raged teenage boys happy, which is probably why it was a box office hit the first week it came out. i enjoyed scary movie 2 ten times more then this fodder, and part one 5 times as much. odd that the better of the 3 is part 2, but then again i always liked halloween 2 better then the original as well..maybe its just me. the funniest part of the movie has to be the way the aliens say goodbye. but that wasnt worth the 11 dollars i spent to catch a matinee of this with my fiance. save yourself cash and catch part 2 again on cable till this is released on video tape, and then rent it, dont buy it.
