though the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments, it is a definitely incorrect assumption. this is an adaptation of 9 seemingly unrelated stories from giovanni bocaccio's 14th century "decameron" story collection.<br /><br />set within a medieval italian town's largely peasant population, it is a diatribe on the reality of sex (and its consequences) within that world and time. a realistic view of life within this world, it sometimes feels like a journey back in time.<br /><br />given the depicted human element of its time, one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists - as well as the ironies of life, at times. or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the catholic church's rules.<br /><br />nothing terribly special, but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions.
