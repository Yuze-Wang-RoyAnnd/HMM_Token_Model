... to not live in montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century.<br /><br />"a river runs through it" certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic stand-point. great landscapes, redford acting well.<br /><br />unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story at all).<br /><br />i felt sorry for the narrator / author, who is as dry, narrow-minded a character as his father, a preacher. being driven, not driving his own life, he is left to watch his brother, who is also caged in the small town environment, losing his life. the author never even comes close to undestand his brother's motivations, but at least realizes, that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour / fun. all there is, is fly-fishing, where he follows even as an old man the style of his father.<br /><br />the end is not surprising, it is forseeable from the very beginning.<br /><br />definitely not a must-see (3 / 10)<br /><br />
