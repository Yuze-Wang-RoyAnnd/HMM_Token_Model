although bette davis did a wonderful job as mildred, i felt that the film wasn't the best i had seen. at the end of the movie i was left feeling like there was something missing in it.<br /><br />bette davis did a perfect job, though, and she made me hate her and pity her all the while. leslie howard did very good as the lovelorn philip carey, and i so pitied him throughout the movie for being in love with such a horrible dame. it's such a sad thing when one finds him/herself in love with a bad seed. and especially if it's someone like philp carey, who is a sensitive person, though pathetic.<br /><br />in the end, the acting was what came through and not the plot. the ending scene was particularly good, but i am not one to give it away. although others may find this movie good, i was one who found it so-so. i should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what may happen to them if they find themselves in love with that horrible person.
