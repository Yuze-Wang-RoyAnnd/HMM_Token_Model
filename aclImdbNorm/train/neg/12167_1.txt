despite being a sequel to the more potent original, this is more of a comical remake of friday the 13th concerning the further antics of psychopathic angela, killing more nubile teens for their "immorality" at a camp.<br /><br />pamela springsteen (sister of bruce) looks great. there are some pretty darn funny sex scenes with some pretty darn attractive girls, but the movie's so (unintentionally) comedic rather than suspenseful, it's a stinker.<br /><br />* out of ****.<br /><br />mpaa: rated r for graphic violence and gore, nudity, and for some sexuality, language, and drug use.
