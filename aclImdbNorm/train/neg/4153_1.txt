i really have no idea how to comment on this movie. the special effects were lackluster, the acting was terrible and if there was a plot to it all, it was on the back of the box. i don't think i can remember a movie being this bad in a long time, and i'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies!! ;) even that couldn't save this movie from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand (or lay in this case) in front of a camera.<br /><br />i was pretty much let down by the overall "zombie" effect. since apparently in this movie, zombies are so commonplace that running over a couple here and there, and casually talking about it at a gas station (one with an in-house windshield repair but no interior bathroom), the zombie-movie genre isn't even a factor until the end. even then, a cameo by a dozen zombies ripping off a girl's clothes doesn't really constitute being a zombie movie.<br /><br />on to the vampires: apparently all the zombies are male and all the vampires are female, which is ok by me. i'm not sure how vampires are out in the daylight, or the why/how of a soldier vampire came to be standing in the middle of the road, still holding his gun with a stake through his heart, just waiting for the queen of the vampires to flick it all the way through. the last segment in the old nunnery made no sense, and when one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire "do you think we did the right thing?" by killing the two apparent heroes in the movie, that about put it over the top.<br /><br />the acting and special effects were at an all-time low also. you could almost see the hoses that the fake blood was pumped out of during the closeup of the zombie who got ran over by the general. speaking of the general, where did they find this kenny rogers look-alike anyways? no idea what he was the general of, aside of generally confusing and misplaced.<br /><br />all in all, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong urge to waste $3. just my $0.02.
