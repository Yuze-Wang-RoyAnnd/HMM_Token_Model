this movie is one of the most unintentionally bad action films ever put to film. dolph friggin' lundren with a japanese accent is funny enough, but add really corny buddy-buddy action to the mix, an eccentric and over-the-top villain, a clich'ed love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time, and you've got yourself quite the little suicide-inducing cure for people who enjoy their life and, up till watching "showdown," had never contemplated killing themselves with a blowtorch.<br /><br />i don't know if it's just me but the whole homosexual subtext is none too subtle. there are constant references to male genitalia, and not by females, either. brandon lee and dolphin talk about each other's manly parts, and in fact before going on a suicide spree, brandon says to dolphy, "in case we don't make it, i want to tell you, you have the biggest d--- i've ever seen."<br /><br />now, is this what a normal man would say to another man? in an action film no less? and would you want those to be your _dying words_??<br /><br />later, there's this gem:<br /><br />dolph (regarding the villain): "i would like to cut off certain parts of his anatomy." brandon: "man, you've got a fixation." <br /><br />as the guy at ruthlessreviews.com pointed out, "unfortunately, dolph doesn't respond with, 'i've got a fixation? i've got a fixation?! you're the one who decided that his last words should be about my privates! i was just gonna chop of his ears and his nose, man."<br /><br />this is relentlessly silly stuff and great fun if you're someone who enjoys receiving root canals from unlicensed dentists, without novocain. it's about on par. great fun for the whole family!
