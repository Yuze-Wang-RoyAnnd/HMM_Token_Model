as seems to be the general gist of these comments, the film has some stunning animation (i watched it on blu-ray) but it really falls short of any real depth.<br /><br />firstly the characters are all pretty dull. i got a hint of a kind of laputa situation between agito, toola and the main antagonist shunack. however maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking (laputa being my favourite anim'e, original engilsh dub). the characters are not really lovable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly, leaving poor old minka jealous and rejected (she loves agito, who seems oblivious of this). however she promptly seems to forgive toola at the end with no explanation for the change of heart other than it makes the ending a little bit more "happy". <br /><br />there is also a serious lack of explanation. like who are the druids really? are they people? and who are the weird women/girls who seem to hang out with them and run the forest? there is nothing explaining why they are there and how they can give regular humans superpowers. the plants coming from the moon still does not fill in the blanks about this. it is almost like a weird version of the day of the triffids.<br /><br />and who does call toola? why bother with this if it wont be explained?<br /><br />i really wanted to like this film but i found the plot no where near as deep as a film like ghost in the shell or having any real character like those of miyazaki. i do not resent watching it but i do sort of wish i hadn't bought it. my advice? give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare, but borrow it, or buy it cheap! perhaps if your new to anim'e films and don't have much to go by you will enjoy it. it certainly is visually pleasing.
