put aside a dr. house repeat that i had missed, and a desperate housewives (new) to watch this one. i don't know exactly what plagued this movie. i never thought i'd say this, but i want my 15 minutes of fame back.<br /><br />script, direction, i can't say. i recognized the stable of actors (the usual suspects), but thought herbert marshall was a class addition and sat myself down for a good cheesy flick. boy, was i wrong. dullsville.<br /><br />my favorite parts: where the "office girl" makes with the 029 keypunch and puts the cards into a 087 sorter. lol @ "the computer". i'd like someone identify the next device - a 477 ? it's before even this dinosaur's time.<br /><br />and we dinosaurs don't have that much time to waste.
