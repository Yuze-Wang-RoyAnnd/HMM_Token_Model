the fight scenes play like slow-motion jackie chan and the attempts at wit are pathetic (worst pun by far: "guess what? this time i heard you coming"). the stars are a mismatched pair: brandon lee, despite the terrible lines he has to say, actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm - things that dolph lundgren is completely free of (at least in this movie). note to the director: in the future, please stay away from any love scenes, especially when your main actress won't do any nudity and you have to rely extensively on a body double.
