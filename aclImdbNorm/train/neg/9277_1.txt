i saw the omen when i was 11 on tv. i enjoyed the trilogy. so when the chance to finally see one at the cinema came around i didnt pass it up. i went in to the cinema knowing that what i was about to see wasnt a cinema release but a made for tv film. however being a fan i couldnt resist. but this omen movie which i saw at a midnight screening didnt bring chills it brought laughter. risible dialogue such as "it is written that if a baby cries during baptism they reject there god". what nonsense.no decent set pieces. faye grant so good in v is wasted with this script from hell. no suprises and no fun. however i did laugh out loud several times at our bad it was.truly pathetic.1 out of 10
