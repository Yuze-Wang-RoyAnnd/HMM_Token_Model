i went to the movie as a sneak preview in austria. so didn't have an idea what i am going to see. the story is very normal. the movie is very long , i believe it could have cut to 1/2 without causing any problems to the story. its the type of movie you can see in a boring night which you want to get bored more ! ashton kutcher was very good . kevin costner is ok. the movie is speaking about the us coast guards, how they are trained , their life style and the problems they face. as there aren't much effects in the movie. so if you want to watch it , then no need to waste your money and time going to the cinema. would be more effective to watch it at home when it gets on dvds.
