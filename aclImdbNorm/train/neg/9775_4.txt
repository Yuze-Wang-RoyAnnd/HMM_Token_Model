fine performances and art direction do not a good movie make. this movie is so grim and depressing, i could feel absolutely no joy at the "happy" ending involving the union strike. the attempts at humor involving lake's pregnancy are absolutely disastrous, and any movie involving a baldwin brother already has a strike against it. on a positive note, lang is still one of america's great underrated actors, he alone almost makes this worth keeping in the vcr. i give this a 4.
