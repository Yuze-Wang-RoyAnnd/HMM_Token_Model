i've seen enough of both little richard in interviews and in performances and enough of poor leon pigeonholed into these 50s/60s musical bio pics to know that leon was not the right actor for this role. leon was so right as david ruffin in the temptations, but fails utterly to capture the essence of little richard in this film. <br /><br />actor miguel n'u~nez who played little richard in "why do fools fall in love?" was a much more suitable choice, having pulled off the musician's powerful but effeminate persona. <br /><br />if the performances are unconvincing then the film will be as well. and this is what has happened here. glossed over or missed entirely are lr's forays into homosexuality and voyeurism. what "the temptations" did so well in capturing the rise of the group, warts and all, this film misses by a wide mark.<br /><br />what is going on with director robert townsend who started off so well with "the hollywood shuffle"? he's a talented, funny guy but hasn't delivered anything near that first effort.
