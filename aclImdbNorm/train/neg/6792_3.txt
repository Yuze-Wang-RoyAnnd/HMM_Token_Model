here's a movie with a good cast and nice looking location work but it just don't have it. director richard brooks must have been a little bit tired at this stage of the game; how much better his the professionals was! the horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the non-slow motion scenes. this film needed to be sped-up, if anything. that horse lather sure looked awful phony to me and the obvious tire tracks in those desert tracking moments- just lazy. sloppy work. too bad. the actors did ok, but i've certainly seen all of them do better. ben johnson's always a joy, though. i first saw this flick almost 30 years ago; was disappointed then and remained so upon second viewing 30 years later.
