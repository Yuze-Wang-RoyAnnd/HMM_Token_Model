roy rogers and company try to bring "sintown" back to life - it's a ghost town which may go boom if silver mining is successful. andy devine (as "cookie") slapsticks around. jane frazee (as carol) loses a piece of her bitches to mr. rogers' sharp leer. foy willing and the riders of the purple sage stand-in (or, is that sing-in?) for the a.w.o.l. bob nolan and the sons of the pioneers. james finlayson (from the laurel and hardy films) adds to the "slapstick" look of "grand canyon trail". a loose floor board delivers the winning comedy performance. mr. devine's mule kicks its heels. there are energetic human performances, too - but, the material isn't grand. <br /><br />** grand canyon trail (1948) william witney ~ roy rogers, jane frazee, andy devine
