now, i won't deny that when i purchased this off ebay, i had high expectations. this was an incredible out-of-print work from the master of comedy that i so enjoy. however, i was soon to be disappointed. apologies to those who enjoyed it, but i just found the compleat al to be very difficult to watch. i got a few smiles, sure, but the majority of the funny came from the music videos (which i've got on dvd) and the rest was basically filler. you could tell that this was not al's greatest video achievement (that honor goes to uhf). honestly, i doubt if this will ever make the jump to dvd, so if you're an ultra-hardcore al fan and just have to own everything, buy the tape off ebay. just don't pay too much for it.
