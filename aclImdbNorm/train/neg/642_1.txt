first of all, if you'r a fan of the comic, well, you'll be very disappointed i'm sure ! low budget movie !!! largo is supposed to be serbian in the comic, now suddenly he becomes croatian, pfff! chicken producers, it gave some spice and guts to the comic ( by the way, in the film, his father speaks serbian and he speaks croatian... lol ). the striking n.y. winch building becomes a common average-small yacht in h.k. the good looking largo becomes some unshaved tzigan/turkish looking guy. freddy the cool 'scarface' pilot becomes some fat, out of shape, sad, average guy. simon, largo's good buddy, does not exist at all !? he gave some pepper ! largo doesn't throw knifes at all, but just some snake stares... the whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious tv-film. french directors and producers, if you don't have the money, the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic, please stick to some romance shooted in paris. very very bad film, good thing i just rented it, don't count on me to watch the sequel ( if there is any ! ).
