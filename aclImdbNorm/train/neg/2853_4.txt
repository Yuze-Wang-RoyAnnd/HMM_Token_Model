vic (richard dreyfuss) is a mob boss, leaving a mental institution, back to his world of gangsters. how can a director have a cast with richard dreyfuss, ellen barkin, jeff goldblum, diane lane (very gorgeous), gabriel byrne, gregory hines, kyle maclachlan, burt reynolds, billy idol and a make such a waste of time? this movie is a comedy that is not funny, having a constellation in the cast. my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil):' prazer em matar-te!' ('pleasure in killing you!')<br /><br />
