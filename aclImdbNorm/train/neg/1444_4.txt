the movie is very lengthy and unfortunately pretty different from the novel. if you want to see the movie then don't read the novel first as it will shock you. however, cinematography was ok and if you are a person who loves adventure genres which explores africa then go for it. acting performances are adequate, however, many important events that were present in the novel are omitted. in the novel, sir henry curtis was in search of his missing brother rather than a lady in search of her father. gagool was cunning and was killed in the cave whereas here she was shown to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.
