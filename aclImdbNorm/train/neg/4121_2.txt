some fraud girl tries to compete in the big leagues of motorcross by swiching places with her brother. she gets to the top by lying and manipulation. she should have been disqualified. the movie promotes lying and cheating to win. also the idea of a 9 yr old mechanic is absurd. it takes many many years to get good. go back to the tonka toys.
