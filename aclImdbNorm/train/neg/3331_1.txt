dreck about three beautiful women in california who go to cover some festival (or something). all the hotels are booked so they have to spend the night in a creepy old house. what they don't know is that there is a creepy inhabitant there who likes to kill...<br /><br />yawn. boring, pointless, utterly stupid "horror" film. bach and her two buddies are certainly beautiful but the movie itself is dull dull dull! bach and her friends are no actresses--their faces are blank all the way through. the final "revelation" is laughably predictable and there's no blood or gore to keep you interested along the way. there is some expected gratuitous female nudity but that's not enough to save this. boring, pointless and unknown (for good reason). a 1 all the way.
