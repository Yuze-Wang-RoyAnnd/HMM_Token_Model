a killer, wearing a plastic white mask and black overcoat, is killing the friends of hollywood producer shawn banning(danny wolske)who inherited his position when someone sliced open his former employer from crotch to chest. perhaps the psychopath is newly hired maddy(dabbie rochon), an attractive, raven haired beauty with a troubled family past, plagued with nightmares. shawn and his friends play a practical joke on maddy, concerning a supposed murder club they started where each member randomly selected a victim to kill. when maddy accidentally murders a woman in a parking garage because of a dent put into her car by this person, she finds that shawn's pals were jerking her chain. but, shawn and his comrades are concerned about maddy's admittance towards committing the murder and contemplate turning her into the proper authorities. deciding to wait on a definite decision, each member fall prey to the white-masked psycho with maddy a suspect considering the fact that she already has killed before. or, is someone else behind these murders? low budget slasher, executive produced by charles band, with gore murders that fail to convince. plenty of tits on display and allen nabors goofy character chris might entertain those with low expectations. the murders include a stomach being opened with intestines showing, a neck sliced, an electrical cord thrown into a pool frying a female victim who had all day to escape, an ax buried into the back of a male victim, and, to top it all, a couple are strangled by a rope during their sexual climax(..for added effect, the killer uses the breaker bar of a socket wrench as extra leverage to twist the rope as tight as possible snapping their necks). there are enough plot holes to drive a truck through, such as why maddy has nightmares of murders she didn't commit, how she could murder someone so violently(..with blood all over her)winding up waking in her bed without leaving something at the scene of the crime that would easily implicate her, and how shawn could go so long, allowing her to continue working at the company despite what she told regarding the murder she committed, and a continual desire to join the supposed club that doesn't exist.<br /><br />what bothered me the most was the film's desire for having us somehow sympathizing with this female protagonist who wanted to join a club after killing someone, later proclaiming it to be an accident. the film builds maddy as the potential psycho throughout because of her past. her family disowned her for an abortion. she has black-outs and always appropriately winds up at the scenes of crimes after the fact. in a lot of slashers, the one who seems the most likely killer is often the red herring, but this film goes out of it's way to point the finger at maddy. when the twist occurs, we're left rooting for maddy, yet we know she's not right in the head. it's a tough sell caring for this chick. she does look great in a man's army shirt, though. and, rochon isn't afraid to let her puppies breathe, either. low budget horror fans will get a kick out of seeing cult favorite brinke stevens as a religious fanatical mother who preaches against what maddy did, calling her a murderer as beloved troma producer lloyd kaufman is the aloof father who can not get in a word edge-wise to protect the daughter he truly cares about. cult siren julie strain has a minor cameo, showing her tits(of course)as the opening murdered male's girlfriend getting her head crushed by a hammer. oh, and check out the office for which shawn works, you'll see a lot of full moon posters and art-work spread throughout the walls.
