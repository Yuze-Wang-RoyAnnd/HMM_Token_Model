i downloaded this movie yesterday through an internet site the quality was kinda good! i was watching the movie with high expectations (though i knew it was a flop), especially as the film has superstar amitabh bachchan playing the role of a villain.i though at least actors like him would have done some worth to their roles.but unfortunately mr bachchan failed to impress as villain this proved that nobody can compete amjad khan's magic rgv's trial to re-kindle the past backfired royally! sholay, the old one is a milestone in indian cinema with an all-star cast, cult dialogue, stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack which is still a hit with present generations too.a good actor like ajay devgan's talents are wasted and his performance was average.prashant raj, a newcomer doesn't know what acting is . nisha kothari proved she is one of the worst actresses we have i don't know how she is still in rgv's crew urmila & abhishek seen in a song with no excitement and passion mohanlal tried his best and susmitha sen's work was good i somehow liked her work in this movie it was a total carnage of the original sholay
