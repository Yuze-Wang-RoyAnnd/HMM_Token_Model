c'mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode. it's just an old 60's tv show ! this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe (yeoman barrow's) ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location. unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages.<br /><br />this use of an outdoor location (and babe) gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show.<br /><br />except a few notable exceptions i.e "the city on the edge of forever" , "assignment earth" and "tomorrow is yesterday" the old series of star trek needs to be seriously moth-balled and put out of it's boring misery. half a dozen good episodes from 79 is quite a poor batting average.<br /><br />this is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually, contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on, he actually made a lot of rubbish! he doesn't deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for example.<br /><br />just look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view. they used wobbly plywood for the floor, cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels. you can clearly see the folds in the paper ! every expense spared or what !
