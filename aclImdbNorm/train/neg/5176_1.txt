when a film is independent and not rated, such as the hamiltons, i was expecting out of the norm, cut out your heart violence. i know that good movies don't always contain blood and violence, but i read reviews, i visited the website, and i even convinced a few of my friends to pay $9.50 to see this god awful movie with me. when there is a festival called horrorfest, i am expecting horror, not dawsons creek with incestuous undertones. my expectations were extremely low for this film, yet the little expectations there was for the film were shot to hell once i saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood come out of someones finger. there were too many plot holes and left too much to the imagination. i regret not seeing happy feet. i think there might have been more violence and gore in that movie than in the hamiltons!
