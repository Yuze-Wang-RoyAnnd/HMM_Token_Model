the oscar season has arrived so this means a slew of these deep, engaging, powerhouse ensemble films are all over the movie theaters in hopes of gaining an audience and having the opportunity to earn best picture in the big show. among them is this film that is based off a very popular and well-acclaimed play. the original playwright was actually the writer and director of the film adaptation; which comes as a double-edged sword. on one hand, who better to translate the play than the original writer? on the other hand, who better to not see the mistakes and drawbacks of the play and fix upon them than the original writer himself? doubt mixes excellent acting and plenty of tension and suspense; with a frustrating ending, unnecessary dialogue, questionable directing, and of course, the inability to provide substantial answers. it is a growing trend among these "high-caliber" films to not answer all questions it provides, and this has to stop.<br /><br />doubt is like a joke without its punch line, like a book with the final 20 pages missing, like losing reception while watching the fourth quarter of a hotly contested football game, and like not having the 50 cents to continue playing the arcade game and see what happens next. doubt, just like the previous best picture frustrationfest no country for old men, doesn't really end; it doesn't provide us with considerable answers nor does it deliver enough for us to figure out the ending. yes, that was the intent, but this isn't a test of humanity, it's a cop-out. i do not pay money to see an unfinished work, i pay money to see a beginning, middle, and end, and pray that i don't fall asleep during the three acts. we are forced to become the "writers" of the movie by filling in the blank ourselves as to what happened before and what will happen to the characters we saw screaming at each other.<br /><br />this little drama is about a nun (meryl streep) who seems very sure that the well-beloved priest (philip seymour hoffman) is making sexual advances towards a child that goes to the church; the first african-american boy in the catholic church. the church is secretly torn as to whether or not he really is committing heinous sins behind everyone's backs. the plot thickens as some of the kids begin behaving differently, which attracts the notice of a young teacher (amy adams). the story is set right after the assassination of john f. kennedy, which shook the nation for quite some time and questioned their faith in humanity and in each other.<br /><br />doubt's strong points come in the acting ensemble and also the ever-engaging suspense that builds slowly and never boils over. streep seems to be oscar-worthy in every role she's in, and here she is no different as her sternness and cold-hearted behavior places a blanket of fear in all the students and with some of the staff in the church. hoffman excels yet again as the priest, by successfully meshing suspicion with a charming personality and a friendly aura. the seemingly hypocritical personality is tough to pull off, especially when we are suppose to like him and also ponder about him at the same time; but hoffman steps up to the plate against one of the best actresses of our generation and fantastically delivers. when these two argue, you can hear the fireworks fly without ever seeing one launched. but let's not forget amy adams (enchanted) and viola davis (law ad order) for their superb job either. doubt's casting ensemble is among the best in 2008.<br /><br />yet, like previously stated it's the writing and directing that ruins this film, especially when dwindling down the third act. questions pop up, but they aren't answered. characters pop up, but provide no real enhancement towards the plot. kids behave different, but we never truly find out why. there are awkward angles in the camera-work
