i agree with everything people said on this one but i must add that the soundtrack is probably the worst one i have ever heard my entire life! there are actual vocals during times when you are supposed to be listening to the actors talk! and the vocals are like a broadway version of danzig singing, "the darkness of the forest! oh the darkness of the dark, dark forest!" or something else so unthreatening. the singer has a terrible vibrato and has been recorded with a treble-y microphone over some synthed-up string section and fake drum beats. it's horrible!! <br /><br />yes, the male leads are awful. so are the female ones. this is one bad case of gender stereotyping - it's so bad! everything they say revolves around being a male or a female, just playing up the stereotypes to the max. makes me sick. soooo boring!!! <br /><br />the children were so echoey in their lines, you couldn't understand them. and why do female ghost children always wear cute little bows in their hair, pretty blue dresses and long hair? and ghost boys always wear clean cut slacks with cute little shiny blond hair? not scary - stupid.<br /><br />daddy's face was way too blemish free and clean to be that of a man living in a cave. nice beard and bangs, pa. did you perfectly cut those with a knife yourself or did you stroll into town and go to the salon?<br /><br />stupid movie.
