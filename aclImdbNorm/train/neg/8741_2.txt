five minutes into this movie you realize that you have seen it all before. it is boiler room. it is the firm. and it is the devils advocate. and there are no new elements here. except for the all-to-clear bill gates-allegory. conpsiracies are always good stuff for movie-making, but why does it have to be so extreme ? boiler room is a good movie, because it - for a while at least - seems realistic. in antitrust everything is wrong. how realistic is it for example that your boss pay an impostor to be your girlfriend in order to make you work harder and control you ? i'd give it 1, but the soundtrack is ok, so 2/10.
