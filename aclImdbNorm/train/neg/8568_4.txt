dead husbands is a somewhat silly comedy about a bunch of wives conspiring to bump off each others husbands`. it`s by no means embarrassingly bad like some comedies i could mention but it never fufils its potential . imagine how good this could have been if we had the farrelly brothers directing ben stiller in the role of carter elson .<br /><br />oh is carter based on jerry springer ? just curious because the catch phrase on dr elson`s show is " look after each other and keep talking "
