i don't know if this is one of the syfy channel original movies, but that's exactly what it feels like. a cheap, low budget action movie that was probably made very quickly, it contains laughable effects, lame dialog, and one vaguely faded star to give some name brand recognition to it (funny how many of the kids from 90210 are doing cheap tv movies now).<br /><br />ian ziering plays cortes, who we know from history as the explorer who wiped out entire populations of native people while conquering parts of north america. here, he is not played as a hero or even sympathetic, but as a slimy opportunist; his character would probably be killed off if this weren't loosely based on a historical figure. in this story, cortes is on a brief surveying mission, trying to find something of value to prove he deserves financing to further explore america. he and his men find a small tribe of aztecs plagued by dinosaurs.<br /><br />the actual hero of the story turns out to be lt. rios, who proves to be honorable, resourceful, and wise. he knows the right thing to do in every situation, which puts him at opposition with cortes, as well as with the young, ambitious aztec shaman. of course, the native girl who is supposed to marry the headstrong, scheming shaman falls for rios, furthering his anger towards the spanish outsiders. so it's all pretty clich'e. the dinosaurs are dispatched with relative ease. despite taking place in an area that seems wide open, the story pretty much takes place in either the woods, or the aztec village for 95% of the time, so it isn't visually exciting either.<br /><br />i didn't even recognize ian ziering. they gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent, and somehow he disappeared into it. he doesn't look or sound spanish for a second, however, making the casting choice wrong in every way. if this movie had been released theatrically, he would have been singled out for a razzie, no question.<br /><br />overall, forgettable.
