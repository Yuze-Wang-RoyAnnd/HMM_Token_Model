um... okay, i guess i get the whole shaky-cam, gorilla-style filming technique but unfortunately i think a gorilla could have made a better movie... this thing was just a complete mess from the get go. bad acting, bad directing, bad story and horrific cinematography. how this piece of garbage was released i will never know, but it has and unfortunately i watched it. filmed on location in tennessee by the directing team of greg swinson and ryan thiessen (harry and lloyd), "five across the eyes" i'm assuming is supposed to resemble a "blair witch" type film but falls short... okay it nose dives off a cliff. i was actually embarrassed for these young women, whom i'm sure were promised hollywood stardom, but ended up in this dung heap. the dialog is ridiculous, and actually aggravates you as you listen to it. how this is supposed to be a horror flick is another mystery, as there is nothing even remotely scary about it, except for the fact that i watched it... try this one on for size: there is 5 of you and 1 of her, do the math and beat her ass... "the end". saddly it went on (and on) for 95 more minutes of mind-numbing stupidity...<br /><br />i saw it for free, and wanted my money back.
