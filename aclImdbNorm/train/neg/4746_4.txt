there are several things wrong with this movie- brenda song's character being one of them. i do not believe that the girl is a lousy actor- i honestly don't. i believe she is given poor lines. she is just supposed to be, "that vain, rich girl", and while it is funny in the tv shows she plays in, it can't even get a dry laugh from me here.<br /><br />either way, i really should have known what to expect when i sat down to watch this film.<br /><br />the movie was not that terrible...initially. wendy's reaction to shen was completely natural. i mean, how would you feel if a man, claiming to be a reincarnated monk, chased you around commanding you to wear a medallion and insisting that you were needed to fight "the great evil" and save the world? which brings me to another point. i know this movie is entirely fiction, but it is still has a founding in chinese culture. it seems like all of the "warriors" in wendy's family line were women. correct me if i'm wrong, but i doubt that the monks would've just been okay with that. sure, maybe they could've worked it in somehow, but they offered no explanation whatsoever. by doing so, they just contributed to the many cheesy attempts at female empowerment made by hollywood and the media.<br /><br />nevermind that, however- let us continue.<br /><br />wendy's character becomes more unbearable as the film go on. yes, she is a teenager, and it is near homecoming- i mean, who wants to fight evil during homecoming? the problem is, when "the evil" starts to manifest himself, wendy does not seem as freaked out as she should be. she is extremely careless- even for someone like her. she continues not to care about her training. i will use this conversation as an example, shen: "if you do not win this battle, evil will take over, and everything good will be gone." wendy: "whoa, talk about pressure. well...let's talk about something else." yes, let's wendy. let's also go dancing when you should rightfully be training. of course shen lets her, but his character has an excuse. better that he cooperate with her, than that he not, and she not train at all, and get them both killed.<br /><br />oh, speaking of which. shen also told wendy that it was his destiny for him to die for her in battle, as he had for her great-grandmother (i am assuming that part).<br /><br />this makes wendy's actions more unforgivable.<br /><br />as the script-writer would have it, wendy's homecoming and this "great battle" are on exactly the same day. do you know what wendy does? do you even have to guess? yes, she does end up going to the battle, for when she tries to leave for homecoming, the monks, (who shen had trapped in the body of her coach and teachers because she "felt weird fighting an old man") inform her that shen has gone to battle alone, so she goes to save him.<br /><br />we initially see some half-decent fighting, that is actually entertaining. until finally, the great evil comes out of wendy's rival-for-homecoming's body, and creates the actual embodiment of himself out of the broken pieces of the bodies of his ancient warriors.<br /><br />don't ask.<br /><br />anyway, wendy gets all "panicky." then shen goes and defends her from this guy- forgive me for forgetting his long chinese name- and manages to get himself killed.<br /><br />wendy catches shen as he makes his long descent from being thrust uncomfortably high into the air.<br /><br />she screams title of said article out.<br /><br />now...it was bad enough that wendy became powerful far, far too fast. no, i will not let it be excused because it was her "destiny" and she had "the power within" her.<br /><br />since when, though, did she learn healing? no, worst...since when could she resurrect people? so shen is raised from the dead. then, wendy and he fight the guy.<br /><br />he loses way to easily. the worst part, is when they jump together, and kick him at the same time, and he is banished forever. then the monks commend wendy on her sacrifice.<br /><br />two things, #1: don't the script writer and director know a battle needs a little more "finesse" to it? #2: what sacrifice? the fact that she didn't go to homecoming? because the girl did not break a sweat, or even bleed. i mean, come on now, this movie was tv pg, i wanted to see somebody get hurt.<br /><br />ah-hem...moving on.<br /><br />i know it sounds like maybe i should have given the movie a one, based on my comments. part of critique, you must know, though, is breaking a thing down. you don't necessarily try to look for the bad, but if it's there, you bring attention to it. this movie has a lot of bad, but something funny happens when you never really expect something to be all too great in the first place.<br /><br />so, i suppose it was all right. not that me not saying it wasn't all right would've stopped anybody from watching it.
