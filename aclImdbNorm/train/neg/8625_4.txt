in the unlikely case that some aspiring directors are reading these comments, i'd like to offer some advice (free of charge!), from a viewer's perspective. if you want to make a serious exotic adventure film, do it. if you want to make a spoof of exotic adventure films, go ahead. do not try to make both at the same time, it doesn't work. for example, having a goofy "comic relief" character killed and beheaded and following it up with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a coconut on a cannibal's head just makes you look like you had no idea what kind of movie you wanted to make. this one is boring, meandering, cheap, racist....you get the picture. a couple of smart moments and a few glimpses of nudity from kathy shower (way too prissy here) are hardly worth your trouble. there is a reason everyone has forgotten about this film's existence.
