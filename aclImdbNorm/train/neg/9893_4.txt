i only hope that no classicists/ancient historians saw "cleopatra", or, if they did, that they took it as a laugh. the movie is horrendously inaccurate, more laughably, even, than "gladiator" (which is at least a well-written script whose historical errors are articulate and correspond well to the story). most blatant is octavius, caesar's heir, in the senate before caesar's assassination: at the ripe old age of 19!<br /><br />besides this, the acting is mediocre. timothy dalton has more than a hint of james bond in him when he says, "caesar. julius caesar." billy zane is a laughably dense marc antony. and leonor varela tries her best to be the seductive pharaoh (who in real life was not good-looking at all) but comes off as unbelievable.<br /><br />so this is a warning for all historians--this movie is not true to life!
