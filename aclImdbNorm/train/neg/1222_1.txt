this is one seriously disturbed movie. even though the boys deserved some of what they got.....the sadistic gruesome executions were "slightly" over the top. the only character showing some conscience early in the hunt was killed off before he could offer some help to the sad plot.<br /><br />at the beginning of the movie, there looked to be some promise of a mediocre affair, but this was just a ploy to lull the viewers into a false sense of security, before the joy of what was to come. <br /><br />the only thing that could have saved the movie for me was if jack nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and yelled, "and, where is the batman?". kim basinger could have screamed. <br /><br />now that would have been cool!
