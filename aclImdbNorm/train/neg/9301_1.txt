spoilers ahead if you want to call them that...<br /><br />i would almost recommend this film just so people can truly see a 1/10. where to begin, we'll start from the top...<br /><br />the story: don't believe the premise - the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and people finially understanding what the mysterious happenings are. it's a draub, basic, go to cabin movie with no intensity or "effort".<br /><br />the screenplay: i usually give credit to indie screenwriters, it's hard work when you are starting out...but this is crap. the story is flat - it leaves you emotionless the entire movie. the dialogue is extremely weak and predictable boasting lines of "woah, you totally freaked me out" and "i was wondering if you'd uh...if you'd like to..uh, would you come to the cabin with me?". it makes me want to rip out all my hair, one strand at a time and feed it to myself.<br /><br />the characters: holy crap!!!! some have described the characters as flat, i want to take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse character arch.. they actually start working on a parallel universe and almost start acting backwards...<br /><br />the actors: worse than the characters are the actors. they take already poor written characters and add in terrible high school drama acting. the "woah you totally freaked me out" was said so monotone and slow - like it was dumbed down. i could complain for hours on the actors alone.<br /><br />technical: lighting: an eight year old would be disappointed with lighting on this movie. too shadowy in areas, too bleached in others. the director shouldn't use light as an emotion until he learns how to light a basic scene properly. baby steps! sound: how many sound guys does it take to make a really shotty sounding movie? 9. with that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has occured. there is one scene in particular that really sticks out, these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle....weak! camera: learn to use it.<br /><br />anyway, i'm running out of complaining space.....rent it - i dare you...rent it and learn from it...give it a 1 rating..it deserves it.<br /><br />signing off... amanda christmas
