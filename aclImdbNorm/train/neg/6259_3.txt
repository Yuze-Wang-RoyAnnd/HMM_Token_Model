well, maybe the pc version of this game was impressive. maybe. i just finished playing the ps2 version and it's pretty much a complete mess.<br /><br />there are a couple elements that are okay or promising. i'll mention those first because it will be over quickly. first, the idea of a historical gta-like game is a great one. the game gun was a historical gta-like game and unlike mafia, gun was excellent. i'd love to see a game set during mafia's era done right. next, the storyline is well written. the story makes sense, it has dramatic arcs, it uses an unusual device (with much of the game being a backstory) and it's interesting. finally, some of the graphics--especially those used during cutscenes--are impressive. mafia's designers seemed to focus on getting the graphics right in the places where gta skimped on that effort, especially the characters. unfortunately in many other areas, the graphics kinda stink, and i'd much rather have excellent gameplay than impressive-looking characters.<br /><br />the gameplay is what sinks this title so low. first off, the controls and camera absolutely suck. that has to be the first focus of any game developers. you can't release a game where the controls and/or camera suck. number one, there's no reason that the player's character, tom, can't have his full range of motion controlled by the left analog stick. unless it's absolutely necessary, and it hardly ever is, i hate the set-up where the left stick moves the character in a "strafing" way and the character can only turn using the right analog stick. here, it's not only unnecessary, it makes most of the simplest actions a challenge. for example, tom has to climb on a couple missions. but the game is designed so poorly that you have to frustratingly keep manipulating both the right analog stick and the camera, and then press l1 every time you need to climb, or tom will descend instead.<br /><br />next, i've never seen a worse fighting system. the first problem is that you can't auto-aim or lock on to any targets. at one early point, the game seems to tell you that you can use l2 or r2 to lock on to targets, but that never worked. so to focus on any enemy, you have to struggle with the stupid right analog stick and try to keep adjusting both the character's orientation and the camera, which tends to drift to the wrong angle or make tom disappear all the time. by that time, you're probably getting pummeled or shot to death.<br /><br />next, if you're touching or almost touching an enemy--and that's certainly going to be the case for hand to hand combat or when using melee weapons, the fighting system--which primarily consists of tapping or holding r1, is completely useless. enemies can pummel you almost in a bear hug, but you just can't move unless you back off. so close fighting tends to consist of you yanking on the left analog stick, yelling at the character to move away, which it won't do 50% of the time, then tapping r1 as much as you can before the enemy gets too close again and makes r1 useless. and if the enemy changes their angle to you in the meantime, you're also going to struggle with the right analog stick to get your character oriented in the right way and to get the camera in position so you can see anything. by that time, you're probably getting pummeled or shot again, and your only option will be to try to move the character away again. my fights often consisted of making tom run circles around an area like a comedy film, hoping that i could gain enough time to struggle with the analog stick and get a couple shots in before being at the ai's mercy again. so much for realistic fighting.<br /><br />and the same problems and more exist when trying to fight with guns. if you're touching someone, half the time the controller just won't allow you to fire off a shot, yet they can still riddle you full of holes. additionally, there's no auto-aim, and the aiming system is ridiculously sensitive, even with the sensitivity set to zero under options. gunfights tend to consist of you hopelessly trying to aim or move away while the enemy puts shot after shot into you. luckily or not, damage seems to be recorded almost randomly. it can take one to ten shots or more to incapacitate any character, and there's no rhyme or reason to it. you can put five shots into an enemy's head and near point blank range and they'll still return fire and hurt you. yet, the game designers seemed to care enough about realism than they built a recoil into your aiming system, so after shots with powerful enough guns, your aim will float off target, and you'll have to fight with it again.<br /><br />as for the celebrated graphics, except for the characters and textures that you're close to, they're actually pretty disappointing. the distance always seems mostly empty, and there are often expanses of flat colors and textures nearby when you're driving. the city wasn't very well designed. it's not varied enough, and there aren't many interesting things to see or do. the cars seem slow and they're difficult to control. they also all drive about the same. some have mentioned the music, but that was also pretty nondescript. a much better job could have been done on that end. also, as many others have mentioned, the load times are ridiculous and constant. they tend to be over a minute long, and they occur between and in the middle of everything--even races.<br /><br />overall, the mafia port to ps2, at least, seems to have been very rushed. the game feels and plays like an incomplete hack job.
