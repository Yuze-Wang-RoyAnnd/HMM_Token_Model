i am very open to foreign films and like to think that i grasp what they are trying to accomplish although some things are lost in translation. but the simplicity and "intelligence" of this film were boring. i've often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time period that really had no point. now that i've seen a movie like that i will no longer be thinking along those lines. there's tones about society, racism, and some desire...but south park has that. and when i watch south park it actually moves me to feel an emotion. the closest thing i felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn i experienced after the first five minutes. i rate the typical movie a seven or above because i love most every film. i gave this film a one.
