i actually saw this movie at a theater. as soon as i handed the cashier my money, she said two words i had never heard at a theater, before or since: "no refunds!" as soon as i heard those words, i should have just waved bye-bye to my cash and gone home. but no, foolishly, i went in and watched the movie. this movie didn't make anyone in the theater laugh. not even once. not even inadvertantly! mostly, we sat there in stunned silence. every ten minutes or so, someone would yell "this movie sucks!" the audience would applaud enthusiastically, then sit there in stunned, bored silence for another ten minutes.
