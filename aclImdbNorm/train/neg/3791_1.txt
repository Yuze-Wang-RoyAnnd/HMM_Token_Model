i cannot vote on this because i wouldn't watch garbage from these people. they got my money with another movie (mr. jingles) and i swore it would never happen again. i feel it's my civic duty to help people stay away from this trash. go to the forums on this film and read where cast members try to act like they are seeing the movie for the first time. one guy even responds to himself ...using the same name! there are shills in the forum that say it's as good as shawshank redemption and citizen kane...not even close (by no means). if this is the company's 2nd movie, it should be better than the first. that means the 3rd movie should be a lot better. not so, i've seen it. all i want to know is how you distribute this trash using the same names all the time. having fun with friends and making a movie over the weekend is fine...but don't try to market that trash!
