ok, don't let my summary fool you. this movie sucks hard. but the worst movie ever? this movie was terrible in ways people shouldn't have to rack their brains to describe. but it is in no way worse than manos: the hands of fate, hobgobblins, horrors of spider island, or a small handful of movies. as a review the movie sucks, it's terrible. don't see it with out mst or you may develop health problems. but there are worse movies.
