i saw and liked the first two a lot, really. especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first. and it's a story standing alone. you don't have to know the first movie. i liked that in the "free willy" movies, too.<br /><br />but... the third, here is absolutely useless! i tried it with a friend of mine, because we both liked the first two. we decided to stop after a good half an hour. the movie is okay, there are funny parts in it alright. but what for? timon and pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies. what lion king 1 1/2 is for me is: a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already, plus telling the story from their point of view. but what for? i'd really like to know. you know, the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one, is really nice. but what comes after is mostly unnecessary. i guess many people liked timon and pumba, and so do i really. yet, for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny. no chance, most of it wasn't funny at all, at least for me. btw. what was the movie about anyway? was it a) about timon and pumba or b) an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie? i tend to choose option b and i'm very disappointed about it.<br /><br />if you like to see stories like: "the story behind xy", you should see "rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead" by tom stoppard with tim roth and gary oldman. that's really funny and no try to get more out of "hamlet" then it has.
