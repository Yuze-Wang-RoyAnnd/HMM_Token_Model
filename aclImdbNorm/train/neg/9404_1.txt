this absolute trash is based so closely on the friday the 13th series that is practically a carbon copy, accept for it being an australian film with people who can't act.<br /><br />once upon a time a young boy got burnt up accidentally during the filming of a music video at lake eildon. now, a number of years later, the boy is all grown up and taking revenge on anybody who comes to the lake to film a music video. it is cliche-ridden and a waste of time and money, see it only out of curiosity, or if you're an aspiring actor trying to learn how not to (not be able to) act. lead role alan dale used to star in the television soap opera neighbours, but ended up in the x files - how did that happen?
