i thought this was one of the most depressing holiday movies i have ever seen--the others being the christmas wife and jack frost. all three movies are about death. if you like being thoroughly depressed, then by all means watch this film or any of the others. in this film, the acting is good and some of the scenery (apart when people are dying) is lovely. but, i am worried that a clinically depressed person might accidentally see the film and do themselves in! despite a "happily ever after" ending, the major portion of this film is one awful disaster following another. and, for some crazy reason, i don't want to be depressed when i watch a christmas movie (i know this sounds crazy folks--after all, isn't bawling your eyes out and feeling miserable what the holidays are all about anyway?).<br /><br />for a more uplifting viewing experience, try the forgotten house without a christmas tree, george c. scott's christmas carol or a christmas story instead--unless of course you like being miserable.
