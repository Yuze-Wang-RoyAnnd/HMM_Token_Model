i should have known when i looked at the box in the video store and saw lisa raye - to me, she's the female ernie hudson a.k.a. "le kiss of death" for *any* movie. its almost *guaranteed* the movie will be bad (e.g. congo)if hudson is in it (with the exception of the ghostbusters films, which were intentionally campy and bad). despite my instincts, and the fact that i just saw civil brand, yet another cinematic "tour de force" starring lisa raye, i rented it anyway. after all, i ignored my "hudson instinct" on oz and ended up watching a very quality series so i figured i'd give this movie a chance.<br /><br />if you are a lover of bad movies, this is a definite must see! this has got to be the most unintentionally funny movie i've seen in a loooong time. the plot is fairly straightforward: racheal's (monica calhoun) sister is killed by a band of brigands (led by bobby brown!) and, like many an action movie before this, she straps on her guns one last time and vows to avenge her sisters death. to do this, she reassembles the titular gang of roses (supposedly based on a true story of a female gang) and they go out and exact revenge and, along the way, there's some subplot or something or other about some gold that might be buried in the town. one nice thing i will say about this movie is that from what i could tell, the stars did their own riding and they looked great galloping.<br /><br />the funniest (albiet unintentionally funny) scenes? look for when they introduce stacy dash's character or when calhoun's character rescinds her vow not to strap on her guns (replete with a clenched fisted cry to the heavens) or lil' kim's character joking with lisa raye's character or stacy dash's character being killed or lil' kim's character convincing lisa raye's character to rejoin the gang or the asian chick or macy grey's character talking bout "the debt is paid", etc. with the exception of calhoun's racheal and bobby brown's left-eye, i can't even remember the names of the other characters cuz i was laughing so hard when they were introduced.<br /><br />if the director had gone for parody and broad comedy this would have been a great movie. unfortunately, he tries to take it seriously seemingly without first taking exposition, sound design (in his defense, hip-hop is notoriously difficult to work into a period piece), set design, script writing nor period historical research (was it me,or were these the cleanest people with the whitest teeth in the old west?) seriously. usually when i see a movie that's not so good, i ask myself "could you have done any better?" this is the first time in a long time where the answer is an unequivocal "yes!"
