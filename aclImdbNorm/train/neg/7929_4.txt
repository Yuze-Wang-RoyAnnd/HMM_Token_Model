i guess if you are into the sci-fi and horror stuff it might be interesting. the acting was okay but not great. the two pregnant girls are supposed to be fifteen but are played by obviously older actresses who turned out to be twenty and twenty-one at the time. the plot is okay, but the story does jump around a bit, leaving one guessing whether you're in boston or pennsylvania. the priest seems to use warp speed between the two. the catholic church is portrayed as having a secretive sect for investigating events which only happen to those of that faith. what if the two girls had been protestant? would the catholics of cared? therefore some what contrived. who knows, some day the catholic church might even learn what the bible teaches. if you miss this one, don't feel you've lost anything.
