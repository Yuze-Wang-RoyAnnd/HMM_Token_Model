it's amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all. it is by far the number 1 worst movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />not only have i ever been this bored before (luckily not for more then 1,5 hours), the pre-adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted. after the first very awkward part, you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better. you hope in vain, it only goes downhill from there.<br /><br />the movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this non-story three times. one can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and trent harris never lays his hands on a camera again...
