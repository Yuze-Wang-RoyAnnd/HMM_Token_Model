whoever made this movie must have done it as a joke. i mean, this was the stupidest movie i think i have ever seen!! a killer snowman terrorizes a small town? give me a break. love it when he takes off driving the cop car. more like a comedy than a horror movie. if you want a laugh, rent this. if you truly want a horror movie, stay the hell away from this one!!
