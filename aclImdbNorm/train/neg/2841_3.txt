sakura killers (1+ outta 5 stars) maybe in 1987 this movie might have seemed cool... if you had never ever seen a *good* ninja movie. cheesy '80s music... cheesy dialogue... cheesy acting... and way-beyond-cheesy martial arts sequences. the coolest scene is at the beginning... with an aged chuck connors playing golf on a beach... several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks like he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice... suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and... naw, i won't spoil it for you... if you ever have the misfortune of seeing this movie you'll thank me. the story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen videotape or something. a bunch of dim-bulb caucasian heroes are trained in the ways the ninja because "only a ninja can fight a ninja" or something like that. strange, these guys don't seem to fight any better after their training than before... oh well, the movie does move along pretty briskly. the fight scenes may not be great.. but they are plentiful... and the overdone sound effects are good for a few chuckles.
