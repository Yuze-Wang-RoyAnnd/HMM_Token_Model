the story at the outset is interesting: slavery in the (late) 20th century from west africa to the arab middle east. the problem with it is that it intentionally castigates two of director richard fleisher's favorite enemies: arabs and germans. to make us believe that very arab-looking men would be free to roam around and easily catch blacks in west africa is as believable as whites hunting for slaves in "roots". obviously both trades are/were run by locals and involve(d) much more sophisticated networks. while arab countries are complicit in today's child and sex slave trade, israel is one of the worst violators according to amnesty international. so why only point out arabs and then choose a german as the only european buyer? it's obvious bias and hatred of those people by a jewish director.<br /><br />the acting is above average, especially by peter ustinov (suleiman) and kabir bedi (malik). michael caine (dr. linderby) is good as always.
