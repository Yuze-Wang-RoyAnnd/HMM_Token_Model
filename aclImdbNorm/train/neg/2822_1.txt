omg this is one of the worst films iv ever seen and iv seen a lot i'm a film student. i don't understand why angelina jolie would be in this movie? did she need the money that badly? i love aj and have seen almost everything shes ever been in so i watched this 2 tick another one off. it was soo bad! not even good bad, just bad bad. it had 1 or 2 funny little moments but all in all it was bad n a waste of 101 minutes. i cant even say aj looked good in it because well she didn't. the plot is predictable unless you r expecting a re-telling of romeo and juliet then its not. all round disappointing. maybe if your 12 this could be a good film otherwise i really don't recommend it.
