i hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input. i know they're going for realism, but to be frank i just don't want realism. realism is boring. if i want to see daily life, i'll uhm, live. tell me an interesting story and we'll talk. i can deal with the low production values, hell i'm a sucker for low production values, but at least work in some good ideas. the direction only goes as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking around a bit, but obviously i'm supposed to dig that because it makes stuff so much more realistic. hitchcock used to say drama was essentially life with the dull bits cut out. i can only conclude this is not drama, not by a long shot. we get to see rosetta walking to someplace, rosetta working in a bakery, rosetta eating a waffle, rosetta carrying around bags of far, rosetta walking back home, rosetta walking someplace...it's just not that entertaining. there isn't really a deeper meaning either. i got so bored i started looking for some reflections on life in this movie but it's just plain realism, the most overrated quality in the business. i guess i'm supposed to love this, but come on, there's nothing in there.
