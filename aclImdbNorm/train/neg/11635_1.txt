okay this is gona be short and sweet review...something the movie should have taken a practice ina nd made its life shorter and sweeter than it was.<br /><br />this movie is $^@%. there's a good reason there was a petition with over 40,000 + signatures all demanding uwe boll stop making movies from franchises people liked. blood rayne being a biggie there.<br /><br />the jokes are good...if you've never heard them a thousand times before. the acting is descent but u can really only blame the script for that. i even a few moments wonder if they're even using a script.<br /><br />the movie has little to nothing to do with the original games. hello if you've played the games u know the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal urges like mass murder because he stubbed his toe or simular. there's way too much story for such a stupid movie. like i said. i wouldn't even steal this movie. and for the person who says this is ' funniest movie of 2007'..........need to take a look around, the news is better than this.
