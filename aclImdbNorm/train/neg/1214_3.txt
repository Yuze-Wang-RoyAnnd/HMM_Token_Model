a friend once asked me to read a screenplay of his that had been optioned by a movie studio. to say it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts i'd ever read would be a bold understatement. yet i never told him this. why? because in a world where films like "while she was out" can be green-lighted and attract an oscar- winning star like kim basinger, a screenplay lacking in character, content and common sense is no guarantee that it won't sell.<br /><br />as so many other reviewers have pointed out, "while she was out" is a dreadfully under-written woman-in-peril film that has abused housewife basinger hunted by four unlikely hoods on christmas eve. every gripe is legitimate, from the weak dialog and bad acting to the jaw-dropping lapses of logic, but basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise. here are a couple of things that struck me:<br /><br />1) i don't care how much we are supposed to think her husband is a jerk, the house is a mess with toys. since when did it become child abuse to make kids pick up after themselves?<br /><br />2) racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except hollywood, where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on screen.<br /><br />3) sure the film is stupid. but so are the countless "thrillers" i've sat through where the women are portrayed as wailing, helpless victims of male sadism. stupid or not, i found it refreshing to see a woman getting the best of her tormentors.<br /><br />4) i loved the ending! <br /><br />5) though an earlier reviewer coined this phrase, i really do think this film should be retitled "the red toolbox of doom."
