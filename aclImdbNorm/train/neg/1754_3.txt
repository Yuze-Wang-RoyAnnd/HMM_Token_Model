why did the histories of mary and rhoda have to be so dour? divorced women with indifferent daughters. and why very little reference to the original show and characters? the daughter characters were silly and uninteresting. why can't there ever be daughters who like their mother's on tv? it makes sense that mary would leave minneapolis, and rhoda would return to nyc, but why couldn't phyllis or sue ann nivens be guest stars? it just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters. it was good to see mary and rhoda together of course, but it could have been better, much better. well, there has been a mary tyler moore show reunion, a dick van dyke show reunion, hopefully mary will do better next time if she revisits her old mary richards stomping grounds again.
