i love horror movies. i can even appreciate most cheese (face it, 9 out of 10 horror films these days are cheese), but this was just ridiculous. terrible acting, terrible writing, completely hollow and unbelievable characters (no meisner actors here!) and a total lack of sufficient body count. i wish i could salvage the 79 minutes of my life i just wasted. at least the crook brothers are aptly named. the only good thing about the whole film was watching the alicia silverstone wanna-be get punched in the face. how this ever made it to sundance is completely baffling to me. most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic, even by slasher film standards. i mean, come on! who would rush out to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after a creepy stalker guy just left their doorstep? lame.
