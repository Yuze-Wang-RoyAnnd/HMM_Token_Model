i have walked out of very few movies before they end, but i couldn't finish this piece of garbage. this was the biggest load of racism trying to pass as legitimate film since "birth of a nation". the characters were little more than cardboard cutouts. i don't see how any actor would want their name associated with this film. lee must have better things to do that put out garbage like this. i know that i and anyone with a brain have better things to do.... like watching paint dry. i wish that someone would make a film about interracial relationships that dealt with the topic realistically. there is a lot more depth to this subject the shallow ranting of a bitter director like lee.
