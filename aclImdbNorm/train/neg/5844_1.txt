this film is easily one of the worst ones i have ever seen. and i don't mean that in a good way. we wanted to see a crappy horror/thriller, so we picked the one that seemed to be the lousiest in the store. for once, the film was everything we'd expected. and more! (or should i say less?)<br /><br />the actors look like they are reading their lines from posters behind the camera. the so-called special effects are created by putting red see-through plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are seeing through the eyes of the killer rats. and the script? don't even get me started on the script... and just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, it turns out that the first part of the film was oscar-material compared to the ending.<br /><br />take it from me, this film is hilarious if you're into crappy horror-films, but if you want a good film, keep on looking. this is not for you.
