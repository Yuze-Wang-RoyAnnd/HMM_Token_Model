they played this on the july 4th twilight zone marathon and this is, hands down, the worst twilight zone episode i've ever seen. it's completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone. even though twilight zone is a pretty uneven series and many episodes end up being groaningly predictable, this one was completely out of place. compare this to legendary episodes like "a stop at willoughby" or "midnight sun", and you realize there is no comparison.<br /><br />buster keaton did what he could with such terrible material, and frankly it surprises me that someone of his historic comedy stature would stoop to the level of this episode. even though he seemed to be giving it some effort, he must have needed the money... there's no other explanation.
