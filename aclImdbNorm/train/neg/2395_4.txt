could this be by the same director as don't look now or bad timing? poorly<br /><br />acted, clunkily edited. you only have to compare the various accident scenes in this with similar ones in don't look now to see how much roeg has lost his<br /><br />touch.<br /><br />even the generally reliable teresa russell (looking a bit chunky these days, i'm afraid to report) cannot save this one. the plot is pure pseudo-religious hokum, the acting is wooden and roeg's attempts at his trademark dislocation of time are pitiful.<br /><br />avoid this one like the plague.
