james bishop (matt stasi) goes to a `mental illness facility' for a medical residence assignment with dr. mccort (bruce paynes). there, he realizes that many interns are being killed by `the ripper', who takes their souls to the devil, in a cult promoted by dr. mccort. this story is so absurd and imbecile that it is impossible to write a summary. the dialogs are so ridiculous, specially when the character of helen, the blonde fianc'e of james bishop arrives in the asylum, that it is almost unbelievable that a writer has had the courage to include them in a screenplay. and what about the return of james to the hospital to bring the files of the dead patients? and the cast, composed of ham actors and actresses? honestly, i do not know what or who is the worst in this film: the screenplay, the director or the cast. the correct answer certainly is all of them. i saw this flick on cable television, and i am astonished how can a producer spend money in such a garbage. this horror movie becomes very funny considering the absurd of the plot. my vote is three.<br /><br />title (brazil): `dem^onio' (`devil')
