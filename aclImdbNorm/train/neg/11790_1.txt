deep sh.. is more like it! the eels are just cartooned in over the film. think "the incredible mr. limpet" meets "leviathan". very tacky.<br /><br />no character or relationship development. so called "romantic" scenes very corny and predictable. an interesting idea, but a poorly written script and lousy special effects make this a definite must-miss!
