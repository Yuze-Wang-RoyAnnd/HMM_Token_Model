i just sat in the theater bored as hell, i wanted to leave halfway through the movie. the plot is simple 4 samoan guys wreck weddings. so they have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding. yawn.<br /><br />the thing that peeved me off the most was the so-called crude jokes... they were highly unfunny, clich'ed and thrown in your face, to make you get into the already dull movie. the acting was below-average and i felt this movie just went on and on about nothing but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot.<br /><br />all in all, one of the worse movies i've seen of 2006, unfunny, bad acting, just ugly.<br /><br />well thank god a friend shouted me. <br /><br />avoid.
