i often feel like scrooge, slamming movies that others are raving about - or, i write the review to balance unwarranted raves. i found this movie almost unwatchable, and, unusual for me, was fast-forwarding not only through dull, clich'ed dialog but even dull, clich'ed musical numbers. whatever originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical, lots of fantasy, some animation -- is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought-provoking plot development. individually, june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice people, but can't carry a movie as a team. neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal. they're both bland. i like billy gray, but his character is pretty one-note. the best part of the film, to me, are june haver's beautiful costumes and great body.
