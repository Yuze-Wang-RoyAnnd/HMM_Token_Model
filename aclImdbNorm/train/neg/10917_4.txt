i'm a fan of columbo, especially on a rainy saturday, and it was fun to see oskar werner after fahrenheit 451, but this episode was very lacking. the original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed way in advance, even years before the modern detective shows of today. but it was amusing to see the crazy couch patterns and "modern" electronics equipment and, of course, the mandatory suburbanite humor poking fun at modern art for sale. the high-tech home is a jetson's or disney version of tomorrowland, and fun to think of writers inventing those "way-out gizmos".<br /><br />if its sunny outside, go play, as there are much better columbo episodes. still, we should be thankful for cable tv that these episodes are being broadcast.
