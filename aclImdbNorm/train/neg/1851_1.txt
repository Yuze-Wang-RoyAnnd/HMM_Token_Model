a "friend", clearly with no taste or class, suggested i take a look at the work of ron atkins. if this is representative of his oeuvre, i never want to see anything else by him. it is amateurish, self-indulgent, criminally shoddy and self-indulgent rubbish. the "whore mangler" of the title is an angry low budget filmmaker who murders a bunch of hookers. there is a little nudity and some erections, but no single element could possibly save this from the hangman's noose. the lighting is appalling, the dialog is puerile and mostly shouted, and the direction is clueless. i saw a doco on american exploitation filmmakers during the recent fangoria convention. atkins was one of those featured. he spoke like there was something important about his work, but after a viewing of this, i see nothing of any import whatsoever. there is no style, either, and the horrible video effects (like solarization) only enhance the amateurishness. not even so bad it's fun. avoid.
