first and foremost, zorie barber (zeke), might be one of the worst actors i have ever seen. as a character that's supposed to be a hip, village writer into the martial arts and proud of being mysterious, why is he so hyper, over-dramatic, and plain horrible? did he know anything about his character before they started filming? did the director? don't the martial arts teach discipline? aside from that, this film misses the target with its lame jokes and seen-it-already gross-out humor. hand in toilet? <i>trainspotting</i>. masturbation? hmm. <i>fast times at ridgemont high</i>, <i>american pie</i>, the list goes on.. .bad dialogue: in one sequence, eric says "it's none of my business <i>but</i> . ..." and 30 seconds later mia says "why is this any of your business?" bad editing: at least five minutes worth of film are wasted on nyc traffic shots. <hr>it's also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a tight-knit group of friends in any world. i can't comment on what makes everyone laugh, but if you enjoy low-brow, basic bathroom humor and insults, by all means, enjoy. if you want something a little smarter but on the same lines, see <i>boomerang</i>. if you want a solid what-goes-around romantic comedy, go for <i>the tao of steve</i>. but anyone who thinks <i>whipped</i> is witty and an accurate portrayal dating, well, i cannot agree at all.
