after watching this on the mst3k episode, i have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from. it seems to combine elements of logans run, farenheight 451, final sacrifice and at least several others. at one point i was really expecting cris makepease to call lee majors rowsdower. <br /><br />i wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot. like the fact that, even though gas is unavailable, there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations, and the stations are located close enough together to keep an f1 race car going all the way across the country.
