my god, was this the "run, lola, run" adaptation of persuasion? it was horrible. bad enough that the "screenwriter" (and i use the term very loosely) cut and pasted dialogue from one character onto another, often completely out of context and to rush the story along: but anne elliott running from location to location in pursuit of wentworth near the end of the piece was an abomination! austen must be spinning in her grave. no respectable young woman would have acted in such an atrocious fashion. and the actress that played mary? horrors. needless to say, if the rest of the austen remakes are this bad, they will be turning off a new generation of watchers.<br /><br />if you want to see an impeccable version of this (otherwise) wonderful novel, get the 1995 roger michell directed version starring amanda root (whose expressions alone can speak volumes) and ciaran hinds. it is superb.
