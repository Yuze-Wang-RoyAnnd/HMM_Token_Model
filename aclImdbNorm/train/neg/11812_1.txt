...however i am not one of them. caro diario at least was watchable for two thirds of the time, but the boring and self-centred third section of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinarily self-indulgent mess. moretti says he feels a need to make this movie, but doesn't want to, whereas the viewer feels that he should stick with it, but really doesn't want to either. a film about italian politics and elections could be fascinating, but this is not that film. at one point, moretti and his friends are standing outside the communist party headquarters, discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with party leaders inside, but it's characteristic of this film that we never get to see anything of them. interposed with moretti's political ravings are the events leading up to the birth of his son, and subsequent home movie shots of him with the baby and later the infant pietro (the film drags us through several years and more than one election period). we keep expecting to see some definitive sequence or cogent argument, but they never come. i for one doubt that i could have the patience to ever sit through a nanni moretti movie again. he succeeds in making an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity.
