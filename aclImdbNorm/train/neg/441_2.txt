we don't have this on television in england but i walked it over the internet on youtube. it's dumb, immature and boring! this is from the creator of "earthworm jim" douglas tennapel, i never got into that cartoon but i must admit it better than this. the cartoonist hasn't done anything for years since now. for doug tennapel, this is a comeback travesty and an all time low! the story is about three cats who inherit a house and lots of money off their dead old lady master. they are argumentative and keep on disagreeing on what their want to spend their money on. "boring"! the animation is dreadful. the main characters are meant to be cats, right? but they don't look nothing like cats! just weird animal monster-looking creatures with big mouths, pointed teeth and bulgy eyes! the human and other animal characters are also drawn real ugly! the theme song is terrible and irritating! also the stories are lame and are most probably copied from older shows. it surprised me how this show got 7.5/10 votes of other imdb viewers. television really isn't what is used to be! but now most of them is dumb, cheaply made and boring. some of you on the website might not agree with me well i'm sorry but this is a total waste of money and a complete and utter waste of your time and feel glad that britain don't have too tolerate this crap (oh yeah, if you have digital you have to) but i don't, so it not my problem! loser! 2/10 (and it's very lucky to get that because i've given other shows worst!).
