2 stars, and i'm being generous. (minor spoilers) look, this is a low budget zombie movie set in gangland oakland. as the plot goes, a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a drive-by.<br /><br />the main problem with this movie: what zombies?! all the "zombies" do is growl (which doesn't sound even remotely scary) and drip fake red blood from their mouths! no scary eyes, no decaying flesh, just a bunch of people growling pathetically and running around like idiots.<br /><br />the cover is also misleading. there are only about 6 zombies in the whole film, so it's not like the whole "hood" is plagued with zombies or anything, it's just a few, and is contained in no time.<br /><br />the acting actually is so bad it's hilarious. no one can act at all in this movie (except maybe one of the gang members) and it really seems like a bunch of friends got together, decided to cast their family, and made a movie one weekend.<br /><br />final note: since when do doctors wear tracksuits?! skip this one, please!
