start with the script. i have seen cartoons with more depth than "envy". anytime characters keep repeating what you have already seen, and was not funny the first time, a movie is in deep trouble, which "envy" certainly is. a movie that relies on one joke had better have somewhere to go with it. here we have a film that goes absolutely nowhere. christopher walken especially would like to forget this bomb, because his character is so weak. ben stiller has been in some pretty good black comedies, "flirting with disaster", and "duplex", immediately come to mind. be certain that "envy" is not a black comedy. there are no double meanings, just total nonsense. "envy" deserves it's low rating, because like it's subject matter, it stinks. - merk
