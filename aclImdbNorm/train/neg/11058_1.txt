disappointing and undeniably dull true-crime movie that has poorly cast character actor jeremy renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of jeffrey dahmer, who was easily one of the last century's most recognizable degenerates/serial killers. released straight-to-video back in early 2003, "dahmer" is an overtly talky, boring, badly acted and virtually bloodless snore-fest of a true-crime drama that never truly delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do! what it does, however, attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely, nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simply lookin' for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold, calculating and depraved sicko and madman that he was! overall, 2003's "dahmer" is one that true-crime buffs everywhere might as well skip because i'm not kidding when i say that it's one of the worst serial-killer biopics ever done! it's even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight-to-video trash like "gacy", "bundy", "ed gein" and "the night stalker"!
