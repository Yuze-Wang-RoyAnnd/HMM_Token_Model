spoiler alert ! ! ! personally i don't understand why pete did not help to save williams life,i mean that would be great to know why william was motivated,or forced.i think secret service members are every day people,and there is a rumor the writer was a member of the secret service,now he's motivations are clear,well known.but as a rental this film will not satisfy you,cause the old but used twists,the average acting -these are just things in this film,only for keep you wait the end.clark johnson as the director of s.w.a.t. did a far better work like this time,and i still wondering how the producers (for example michael douglas)left this film to theaters.
