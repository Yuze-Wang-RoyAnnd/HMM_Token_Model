i admit to liking a lot of the so-called "frat-pack" movies. no matter how bad they are, i can find something to like about ben stiller or owen wilson or vince vaughn or will ferrell or jack black. but "envy" just left me about as cold as the white horse that ben disposed of. this time, it's ben and jack black as a couple of nutty neighbors, one of whom (black) discovers a aerosol spray to make animal poop disappear and becomes incredibly wealthy while the other (stiller) writhes in envy. that's supposedly the plot, but then it veers off in other directions that don't really make much sense.<br /><br />i guess the 'vapoorize' thing is sort of amusing at first. the problem is, they try to sustain the gag for the whole picture (black has a license plate that reads 'caca king') and it gets fairly tiresome. but even ben and jack are used poorly; the energy level for both of their performances seems significantly dialed down. the two best performances by far are rachel weisz and chris walken. walken's neo-hippie-dippie guy is so offbeat and so well-modulated a performance that it really never suggests any of walken's other familiar nutcase characters. it's completely unique, yet comes across as unmistakably walken. and weisz is about the best actress in the business that nobody knows about. even with limited screen time, she still dominates every scene she's in.<br /><br />the whole crux of the so-called drama is that ben, in a jealous drunken stupor, accidentally shoots jack's prize white stallion, and then goes to ridiculous lengths to cover it up, fearing his best friend will find out and cut him dead. but the plot twist isn't believable because there's nothing about jack's character to indicate that he would do such a thing. he plays such a sweet guy that it renders the whole excruciating horse chase null and void. you discount it completely. it's all filler. and what's the point of the out-of-control merry-go-round, except that barry levinson wants us to know that he's seen "strangers on a train"? the screenplay is painfully bad and the acting of the two leads poorly directed. someone with levinson's track record should know better. maybe someone will invent something to make this film disappear. oh, wait, they already have.
