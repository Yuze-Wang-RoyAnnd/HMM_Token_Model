the comment by "eliz7212-1" hits the proverbial "nail on the head" for this turkey of a program. but it is a hoot to watch william shatner "cavort" and "dance" (yes, the " " marks on the word dance are necessary for what bill does). this show would be a great skit on snl or mad tv - and it does rate a few stars for one viewing, or so, to see shatner, who seems to have taken "camp" to new heights - whether in a role or as himself. but the guy is funny.<br /><br />the girls who are in the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls, will be pretty much out-of-luck when this turkey is canceled - unless there is a revival of the whiskey-a-go-go genre, with a resurrected demand for shapely young women to dance in elevated cages once more.<br /><br />i watched the first contestant, who was annoying, and literally "dumber than a :post," yet through sheer luck, walked away with a quarter mil or so. the second contestant, somewhat more intelligent, but who'd be lucky to gain $1,000 on jeopardy!, got zonked by the card which requires answering a special question - which he didn't know, and thereby left with zilch.<br /><br />this plethora of game shows, which dangle, and sometimes award, large sums to everyday individuals, are admittedly a cheap effort, overall, to attempt to woo viewers. even if the host is well-compensated, and they give away six figures in an average episode, i suppose that the revenue versus costs can be favorable - since you don't have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures, per episode, with some big residual deals as well.<br /><br />but i suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long. this one has already pretty much reached this point. i think his offerings, especially with james spader, and the others on "boston legal" should give us a satisfying quantity of bill shatner's offerings.<br /><br />again, the above rating is simply appropriate to view bill hoot and prance, perhaps one time; that should be sufficient.
