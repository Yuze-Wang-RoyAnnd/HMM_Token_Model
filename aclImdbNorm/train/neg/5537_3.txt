what? you were not aware that scooby-doo battled zombies? well, you might also not be aware of this little film that was directed by victor halperin, who had also directed white zombie four years earlier. that would probably make it the second zombie film made.<br /><br />no, don't go looking for dorothy stone to expose her breasts as you would expect in most zombie films, and don't even look for any brains being eaten. this is 1936, you know.<br /><br />so, what you will see is typical of the period - lots of talking.<br /><br />you do get to see dean jagger (twelve o'clock high ) and bela lugosi's eyes, but that is about it. zombies in cambodia, indeed!
