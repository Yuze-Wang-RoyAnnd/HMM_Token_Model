i would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for jason (herb) evers constant harping on experiment. many early reviewers of the seven samurai accused toshiro mifune of overacting. yet, as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done. jason evers is obviously not toshiro mifune, and his overacting is exactly that.<br /><br />most of the actors in this b classic were rather good actors, minus evers and the showgirls. if you watch this movie, you would have noticed evers shouting almost every line, that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose. <br /><br />the special effects were par for the course in a b movie such as this one. in hindsight, there isn't much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie.
