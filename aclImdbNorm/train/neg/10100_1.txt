usually i support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant...i tend to support everybody, because their efforts are worth...<br /><br />but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits!<br /><br />imagine the following situation:<br /><br />1. think about the really worst horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far.<br /><br />2. think about some great, attractive art for that movie's dvd box...and a promising plot...<br /><br />3. voil`a! you got zombie nation.<br /><br />see it only if you really don't have anything else better to do. anything is better.
