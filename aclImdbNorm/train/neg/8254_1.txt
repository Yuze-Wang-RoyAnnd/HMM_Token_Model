i've seen better production quality on youtube! i pity the actors, as the writing was terrible and the direction shocking, not sure how they could get the lines out - i really doubt any actor would have been able to salvage this movie no matter how good they were. the characters were not developed at all, and there was no real cohesion in the plot which just seemed to go nowhere much. it's a shame really, as the premise for the movie was good and with better production quality, direction and script it could have been a decent movie. it certainly was not a comedy, unless you laugh out loud at the dubbing - which was amateurish, even the english actors sounded weird.
