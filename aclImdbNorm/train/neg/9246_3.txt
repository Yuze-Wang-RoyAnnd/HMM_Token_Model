i refused to watch this when it originally aired, treasuring the memory of the late, lamented 1960s series with mike pratt and kenneth cope, but i can never resist a challenge. i should have known better. not quite a remake, and more of a parody than a homage, this show didn't quite know how to play it, and plumped with infantile comedy and cartoon plots and characters. the three main characters were little more than caricatures of the actors, and only emilia fox could act (bob mortimer is painful in a straight role). the supporting cast were merely comedian-acquaintances of vic and bob's wanting to be part of the in-joke, and far too aware of the situation to be convincing. and the cgi, though the effects couldn't help be an improvement on those available 30 years earlier, merely dazzled the viewer with lights and camera work, and did little to mask the poor quality of the scripts and dialogue. all style and no substance. (and whereas the 1960s show is mocked for being very much of its time, this 'update' is now also very dated, with 'matrix'-style fashions, obligatory 'girl power' scenes, and less than subtle tension between the two living leads.)
