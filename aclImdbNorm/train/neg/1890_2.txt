the problem i find with this title is that i am not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or movie. a blend of the two genres just doesn't work and that leaves the whole thing hung in the middle of nowhere. this is more so as the director has picked the most extremes of what is supposed to be happening around our everyday life making it an unconvincing documentary. if it is meant to be a thriller/drama this is too dull and monotonous. in either case, what is the moral or the message which the director is trying to convey to the audience? that around us there are people who ill-treat others who are willing to be ill-treated? that there are many crazy lunatics around us? so..........so what?
