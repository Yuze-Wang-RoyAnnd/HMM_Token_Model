hello. i am paul raddick, a.k.a. panic attack of wtaf, channel 29 in philadelphia. let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on adam sandler's film career but was digitized after a short time.<br /><br />going overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails...or so i thought. sandler encounters babes that like history of the world part 1 and rebound. the babes were supposed to be engaged, but, actually, they get executed by sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known. adam sandler fared bad in going overboard, but fared better in big daddy, billy madison, and jen leone's favorite, 50 first dates. man, drew barrymore was one hot chick. spanglish is red hot, going overboard ain't dooley squat! end of file.
