just saw this at the chicago film festival - avoid it at all costs unless you have sleep problems. it is a film filled with pretensions - it opens with a minor quote from "hiroshima mon amour" and it's all downhill from there. camera work - imagine a child trying to imitate wong kar wai. story line - smokey robinson and the miracles' "the love i saw in you was just a mirage" expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours but filled with repetition. for butt numbing pain this film ranks with the benches at the methodist church my parent dragged me to when i was a kid. i want 2+ hours of my life refunded. julian hernandez's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was "controversial" - that is true only for the film's narcotic effect.
