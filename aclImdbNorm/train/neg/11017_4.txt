a woman's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive.the cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement.of course b-horror movie queen brinke stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature.the only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is michael berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with delia sheppard.and the last twenty minutes of brinke's bloody rampage are quite fun to watch.the special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful.better watch "scalps" or "alien dead" again.of course i ain't expecting classy entertainment from fred olen ray,but "haunting fear" is too dull to be enjoyable.
