today, bea arthur died so i was cruising around the imdb web site and somehow wound up on a show called "gloria." "all in the family" was a brilliant show for its first four or five years and i bet i watched every episode more than once. however, i swear that i did not know a show named "gloria" existed. maybe, that's a good thing. maybe, it means i had a life as a young adult rather than watching television.<br /><br />on the other hand, it is pathetic that the "all in the family" franchise had deteriorated so much that it begat a show i never heard of -- and one that is rated very poorly by the previous reviewers.<br /><br />i rated the show a 1 for two reasons -- the system did not allow me to register a no vote and writers and tv execs should be condemned for starting a show that had no business being on the air and besmirches the memory of one of the greatest shows in tv history.<br /><br />shalom, zwrite
