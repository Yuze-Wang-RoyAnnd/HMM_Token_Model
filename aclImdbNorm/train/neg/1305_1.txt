"demons iii: the ogre" is not related pre-sequel are on "the demons" and "the demons 2 are cool hip horror 1980 classic."demons iii: the ogre" is very stupid, bored, cheap monster. i am very confuse about the writer is "demons iii: the ogre" (lamberto bava and dardano sacchetti are poor quality writer and stupid who the bored william shakespeare ghost or demon's egg from spider's web or what huhuhuhuhu make the girl dream). i am very sorry, very very very very boring movie. i bought the special dvd box called "demons" on the 3 different movies called "demons iii: the ogre", "the other hell", and "black demons" don't have closed captioned and subtitles is cost $ 14.99 from best buy store in the city of downey. why the lamberto bava and dardano sacchetti are poor quality writer who make the stupid movie almost like "halloween iii" don't have michael myer monster but the people wear halloween. i am very confused. i really love "the demons" and "the demons 2 are better the boring stupid "demons iii: the ogre" is not part for "the demons" and "the demons 2" are same demons.<br /><br />thank you juan antonio de la torre
