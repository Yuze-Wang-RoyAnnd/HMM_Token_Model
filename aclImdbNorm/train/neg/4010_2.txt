when i first watched the show, the first few episodes seemed promising. bill compton introduced himself as the stereotypical "mysterious" vampire and sookie presented herself as an independent woman. however, the show went downhill from here and the once interesting characters are as entertaining as a cardboard box.<br /><br />as the story progresses the main characters lose their original personalities, along with their acting abilities. by episode 5, bill's furrowed eyebrows are so low that his face just consists of a forehead. sookie, or rather the actress, is even more dead than her vampire lover. all these tragic events are surrounding her and she only reacts to how enjoyable it was losing her virginity. personally, i think they made the main characters sleep with each other too early in the show. the way they teased each other was something that had me hooked and could easily be toyed with a bit more. as soon as sookie loses it she struts around like a total ditz, only thinking of bill's libido and the size of his appendage. bill also loses his debonair attitude and well, he just gets plain silly. his actions are never really explained except he does it for sookie. why? their love for each other is never delved into, if there is any love. so far it just seems to be sex that is the core of their relationship.<br /><br />yeah, yeah, vampires usually equal sex but come on. every five seconds i see some sort of humping going on. it wasn't that much of a surprise, since hbo always tries to pass of a soft core porno as a decent tv show. bill popping out of the dirt and just getting it on with sookie with no reason what's so ever? i laughed so hard i almost peed myself.<br /><br />the plot is just a stream of consciousness. the characters never go into detail about anything. all the events that happen are usually left unexplained. the only thing that is constant is the sex.<br /><br />the only thing i can say that i do like are the minor characters. tara and her drunk mother are far more interesting than the major characters. the only reason why i continue to watch the show is for the development of the minor characters. <br /><br />minus the sex and the main characters the show would be much more worthwhile.
