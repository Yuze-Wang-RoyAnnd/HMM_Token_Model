the plot is so manipulative, counting completely on the most uncredible and unthinkable decisions of the adults in each and every parenting decision. the children are super as far as charm and delivery of the lines but as i say, the whole plot depends on each and every adult being complete idiots, and therefore in that case, making more sense out of their actions (and at the same time being the only way to explain the boys actions of total mistrust). why would sweey charming little boys take a baby from the shore? how did the baby get to the shore and at the same time account for it being the last place to be searched? why would the 2 boys never be informed an instead at the same time a baby is missing nobody gives a fig about them running around with food and diapers with all that commotion going on and literally every other place it searched? there is just no possible justification to ask the audience to believe this. asking to believe it would then do to trial (even the informal setting) is too insulting to bare.
