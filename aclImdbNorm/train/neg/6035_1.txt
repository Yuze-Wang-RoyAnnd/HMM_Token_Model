i really wish i could give this a negative vote, because i think i just wasted 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie ever put to film. the acting was just god awful, i mean realllyyyy bad, the dialog was worse, the script sounded like it was written by.... i can't think of anything horrible enough to say. and the day "outside" and the night "inside" shots make you think the events took over several days. terribly acted, directed, written, etc etc. all the way down to the gofer how gets lunch for everyone. stay away from this one at all costs. if my only saving grace to stay out of hell is by doing one good deed, it is to tell the world to not watch this crap. this movie is the exact reason why horror movies are never taken seriously.
