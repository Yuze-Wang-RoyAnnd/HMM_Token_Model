if i were to create a movie thermometer, this movie would be absolute zero. out of ten stars, i would rate it as follows:<br /><br />plot: zero stars video quality: zero stars sound quality: zero stars acting: zero stars<br /><br />it is as though high school students got together one afternoon with a camera, made up a plot and shot a movie. it is so lacking in any artistic value that i'd rather watch kids walking around a high school than watch this movie.<br /><br />however, something is to be said for the abysymal depths. the "shootout" in the staircase is one of the most train-wreck funny scenes ever. first of all, the combatants simply wave plastic guns at each other, jerking their arms back and forth to simulate recoil. the pair actually "duck" each other's non-existent bullets. no squibs, no sparks, no blanks, just waving spraypainted squirtguns around. if you want to see two grown men play "actor", give it a spin someday... after you have cleaned the fridge, combed the carpet, polished all of the doorknobs, raked the gravel, straightened the books on the shelf, etc.
