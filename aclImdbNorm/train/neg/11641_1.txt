although i am generally a proponent of the well-made film, i do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries, and more often than not i do enjoy and admire films that successfully "break the rules." and it is quite true that director pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema. but it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual point.<br /><br />pasolini's work is visually jarring, but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed, and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography. this is true of decameron. pasolini often preferred to use non-actors, and while many directors have done so with remarkable result, under pasolini's direction his non-actors tend to remain non-actors. this is also true of decameron. pasolini quite often includes images designed to shock, offend, or otherwise disconcert the audience. such elements can often be used with startling effect, but in pasolini's hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film. this is also true of decameron.<br /><br />i have been given to understand there are many people who like, even admire pasolini's films. even so, i have never actually met any of them, and i have never been able to read anything about pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me. judging him from his works alone, i am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not "break the rules" so much by choice as by lack of skill--and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day for " existential boldness," thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a film maker. i find his work tedious, unimpressive, and pretentious. and this, too, is true of decameron. it is also, sadly, true of virtually every pasolini film it has been my misfortune to endure.
