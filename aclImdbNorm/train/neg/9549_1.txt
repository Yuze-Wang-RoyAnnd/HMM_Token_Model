i wondered why john wood was not playing dr. falken until i watched the film. bad plot, bad science, bad acting and overall a bad film. please don't watch this film. rent the original "war games" if you are feeling nostalgic.<br /><br />i didn't like the bending of the plot to beat-the-terrorist-threat idea either. in the first film w.o.p.r was built because russia had 1000s of warheads pointed at the u.s.a. in this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat. politics aside, one of the good thing about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end. no such insight is offered in this film.
