i have never commented on imdb before, but i feel i have to after watching the batman animation. its absolute rubbish! warner brothers had the perfect animation series in batman in the early 90s so what the hell are they doing trying to mess with the winning formula? i feel like writing a complaint letter to wb. the original animation was dark and brooding, exactly the way batman was intended to be. wb had to mess this up with some tripe batman of the future. now they produce this drivel. the joker doesn't remotely resemble the joker from dc comics. dc should sue. i urge everyone who agrees with me to email or write to wb and use people power to get back the original formula
