this low-grade universal chiller has just been announced as an upcoming dvd release but, intended as part of a collection of similar movies that i already had in my possession, i decided to acquire it from other channels rather than wait for that legitimate release. which is just as well, since the end result was not anything particularly special (if decently atmospheric at that): for starters, the plot is pretty weak
