and the oscar for the most under-rated classic horror actor goes to - dwight frye. seriously his name should be stated with the same awe as karloff, lugosi, and price, and this movie proves it. his character herman was one of the 2 reasons i can give to watch this movie. dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed misfit a lovable yet creepy demeanor that led you hoping for a larger role the entire movie.<br /><br />the other reason is the comic relief of m. eburne. being in the medical profession myself i have to give kudos to the expert performance of a self-pity prone hypochondriac. though other "medical mistakes" did give a brief chuckle especially when the good doctor samples his fellow physicians medication... "well continue giving it to her" unfortunately these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake through 3 attempts of sitting through this unbearably slow movie. the plot is predictable with only few minor twists. the filming while pulling off a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive at making me yawn - yes you can use too much shadow.<br /><br />my recommendation - watch this once to see frye and eburne - but only when wide awake and with lots of caffeine.
