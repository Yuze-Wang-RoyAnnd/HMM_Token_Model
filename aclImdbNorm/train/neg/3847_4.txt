there's a lot the matter with helen and none of it's good. shelley winters and debbie reynolds play mothers of a pair of leopold & loeb like killers who move from the mid-west to hollywood to escape their past. reynolds, a starstruck jean harlow wannabe, opens a dance studio for children and winters is her piano player. soon winters (as helen) begins to crack up. it's all very slow going and although there are moments of real creepiness (nasty phone calls, a visit from wino timothy carey), the movie is devoid of any real horror. nevertheless, it's still worthy entertainment. the acting divas are fine and the production values are terrific. a music score by david raskin, cinematography by lucien ballard and oscar-nominated costumes contribute mightily. with this, a place in the sun and lolita to her credit, does anyone do crazy as well as winters? directed by curtis harrington, a master at this type of not quite a-movie exploitation. in addition to carey, the oddball supporting cast includes dennis weaver, agnes moorehead (as a very aimee semple mcpherson like evangelist), yvette vickers and miche'al macliamm'oir (the irish orson welles) as hamilton starr, aptly nicknamed hammy.
