up until the last 20 minutes, i was thinking that this is possibly jackie chan's worst movie (excluding his pre-1978 work, which i am not familiar with). the final fight sequence changed all that: it is long and good and intense - indeed, one of the highlights of chan's career. but to get to it, you have to sit through a lot of "comedy" that might amuse five-year-olds (oh, look! someone threw a tomato at that guy's face) and endless "football" scenes. not to mention the dubbing (which includes the line "how can i turn it off? it's not a tap" - watch to find out what it refers to). "dragon lord" is worth renting for the final fight alone, but the rest of the movie is only for jackie collectors, and even then only for those who've already seen at least 15 of his other movies.
