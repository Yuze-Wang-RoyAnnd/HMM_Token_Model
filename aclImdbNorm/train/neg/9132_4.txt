the fiendish plot of dr. fu manchu starring peter sellers in a spoof of the characters created by sax rohmer is an injustice to the end of sellers' career. the plot was very simplistic, and if done the right way could have been handled nicely, but instead it was poorly executed. part of the reasons why this film wasn't that good was the poor dialog, cheap laughs, choppy directing, and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete.<br /><br />the acting, on the other hand, was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed up picture. i found sellers portrayal of diabolical manchu brilliantly done, with the occasional lines that will be remembered. for example, there is the scene where fu manchu is confused which henchman is which in which he says "ah, you all look the same to me." i hate to admit it, but i laughed out loud with that line.<br /><br />then of course a fistful of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with the likes of helen mirren as the backstabbing constable, david tomilson as sir roger avery (his last film as well, not a way to end a career), and sid ceasar (who gives a rather whimsical performance of al capone's relative who works for the fbi). these characters also kept me watching.<br /><br />the sets were also nice. oriental designs and english society in 1933 was depicted with elegance in this dud-of-a-picture.<br /><br />in all honesty, my advice to you is to watch the film if you are a peter sellers or sid ceasar fan. otherwise, you're better off settling on chewing aluminum foil.
