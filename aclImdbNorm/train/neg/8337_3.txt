millie is a sap. she marries a rich guy named maitland and they have a child. she then catches him cheating on her and divorces him...but lets him keep the kid she claims to love. back then in the early 1930s, she would have been entitled to hefty spousal and child support but lets the guy off amazingly easy...with no support...what a sap! later, when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good, he turns out to also be a cheat! wow, does she have a hard time picking men.<br /><br />as a result of these bad relationships, millie changes. now she's a wild party girl--doing everything she can to distract herself from her hard luck. suddenly, many years pass. millie's daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and oddly fashions haven't changed one bit. an old friend of millie's (yes, it's another evil man!) is now pretending to be the daughter's friend, but he has lecherous designs on her. millie promises him that if he touches the girl, she'll kill him. take a wild guess what happens next! <br /><br />overall, the film is a confusing and often bizarre mess--a bit like "madam x" but much, much less focused. so often millie's motivations and actions seem to make little sense. and, the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into it--so long as it substantiates the notion that all men are pigs. unusual but not particularly good.
