allen goes to the country (somewhere he hates going in real life) and has a weekend with his friends - which are the usual successful white middle-class bellyaching types that feature in many of his films.<br /><br />i usually find something to amuse in woody allen comedies, but here he really falls totally flat on his face. even the one-liners seem to have deserted him. the really is no plot (bar bits and pieces of cod shakespeare) - but allen seems to use the location to allow a semi-mystical air, which just makes the thing even more witless and half-baked.<br /><br />it just doesn't work at any level and is just a giant bore. the best thing about this film (apart from the end credits coming up) is that the bad reviews seem to get him to wake up and realise that simply throwing together a slapdash script and casting your mates in it doesn't make for entertainment.
