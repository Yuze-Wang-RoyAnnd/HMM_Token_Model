i've seen thousands of movies and have never written a review, but the red eye i witnessed is so at odds with the glowing tributes posted here that i'm compelled to offer my two cents in protest- and vote the lowest score possible just to bring the average closer to reality. <br /><br />this is a dull, boring stinker of a film that is memorable only for its apologist depictions of the terrorists' target (a john bolton-esquire bully diplomat who's really a great guy, don't you know) and of the oh-so-handsome and popular dr. phil (whose bestselling book, one learns, is read by frequent fliers worldwide). the only real red eye i experienced was from rubbing my eyes in disbelief.<br /><br />before you fork out $10 or so dollars for this b movie, read the selected 'quotes (from trailer)' above, and ask yourself if you'll really enjoy a movie in which these were the cleverest lines to be found. unfortunately, nothing else in this film is any better. the basic premise is goofy as hell; the acting is bland and uninspired, completely lacking in pro/antagonist chemistry; the potential for suspense is thwarted at every turn- except during the last five minutes- by poor directing and anticipatory editing; the script is riddled with incongruities like: early reveals of the heroine as a university lacrosse star are called into question when she later battles the antagonist with a field hockey stick; and the plot holes are wider than first class (while character development is strictly coach).<br /><br />and then there are the moments of extreme ridiculousness, like when the daughter of a high level public servant does not head straight for airport security, at her first opportunity, to warn them of an assassination plot against the both the head of homeland security and her father. or when that same woman runs hell-bent-for-leather along slick airport linoleum, arms pistoning and veins in her neck bulging, while wearing 4 inch stiletto heels. or when her pursuer chases likewise with a sucking wound in his trachea. or when terrorists use a fishing pole to bring up their weapon from the freaking harbor bottom. i'm always willing to suspend disbelief, but i'm not going to leap from 30,00 feet without a parachute.<br /><br />the one good thing i can say of this movie is that it portrays women who are capable (even in bimbo form) of handling the most extreme emergencies- the kind of gender imaging sorely lacking in american movies. other than that, this movie never really takes off, and is no more thrilling than the red eye flight from boston to ny. remember the last time you got suckered by deceptive trailers and glowing tributes- in this forum or elsewhere? this is one of those times. wait for the red eye video, and don't watch it then, either.
