this piece of crap might have been acclaimed 60 years ago, but it is one of the most racist movies ever made with the native american indians played by white men. the right-wing republican james stewart was a huge racist in real life, just like his close friend john wayne. in 1971 stewart had actor hal williams fired from "the jimmy stewart show" (a short-lived series that mercifully flopped) just because williams was black. as if that were not bad enough, this film is very dated and boring. watch "dances with wolves" instead for a less racist view.<br /><br />stewart was in his forties when this awful movie was made, and even with his ridiculous wig he still looked like a paedophile chasing after 16-year-old debra paget. i'm surprised it was even allowed.<br /><br />0/10.
