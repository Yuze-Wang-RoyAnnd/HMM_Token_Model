suffice to say that - despite the odd ludicrous panegyric to his soi disant "abilities" posted here - the director of this inept, odious tosh hasn't made a film since. well that is excellent news as far as i'm concerned.<br /><br />dead babies has all of the bile of its creator, but lacks the wit and technical proficiency that make martin amis the novelist readable.<br /><br />when will the british film industry wake up and realise that if it wants to regain the status it once had it should stop producing rubbish like this and make something real people will actually want to watch?<br /><br />avoid like the plague.
