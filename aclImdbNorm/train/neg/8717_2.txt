this is one of the most hilariously bad movies i have ever had the privilege to see.<br /><br />i watched this on dvd with a bunch of friends one friday night and we just couldn't stop laughing from start to finish.<br /><br />the story is simple enough: terrorists hijack a convoy they think is carrying weapons grade uranium, but it's actually carrying a bunch of man-eating dinosaurs. easy mistake to make. cue a startlingly incompetent team of army special forces to tackle the prehistoric beasts. they are led by colonel rance, played by scott valentine; a man who seems to have perfected 'smell the fart' acting, as advocated by joey in friends.<br /><br />there's plenty of gore and an awful lot of shooting, but unfortunately rance's team seem to have a problem aiming their weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant, lumbering monsters. also, the lights always seem to flicker and go out whenever a velociraptor attacks (preumably so we can't see how bad the creature effects are).<br /><br />having said all that, we all had a great deal of fun betting on who was going to get their head bitten off next.<br /><br />as a jusassic park / aliens style action adventure this movie stinks worse than a dinosaur's crotch, but as ludicrous, tongue-in-cheek entertainment it's a roaring success.
