feeding the masses was just another movie trying to make a little money off of the zombie craze that is going around, mostly due to the popularity of movies such as land of the dead and the resident evil series.<br /><br />it starts at a television station, which is guarded by the military, and are reporting that the lazarus virus (zombies) are close to containment and the city will soon be free to do their business again. the problem is, this is totally false. zombies are running rampantly and only a small minority of people are aware. among them are torch (william garberina), the camera man, sherry (rachael morris), the lead anchor woman (who for some reason is listed as playing shelly on this website) and roger (patrick cohen), their military escort. torch and sherry are against lying to the people but the station is being run by secret service (or some other government agency) and they are heavily censored.<br /><br />this movie gives itself a pat on the back on the box-cover saying "we hold feeding the masses on a higher level than any o the three 'of the dead' films by george a. rombero." the source of that quote has lost all credibility with me.<br /><br />let me just say that this movie is bad. i don't mean bad like i was expecting more (i obviously was, though) but i mean bad in that i could not find any redeeming qualities in the film, whatsoever. the acting in all parts are either over done or too wooden. did anybody remember their lines or are they reading off of cue cards? i can't even think of what the best part of the movie was or the best actor/actress. there really was not one. if i had to give a nod to someone, i would say roger, the military escort was probably the most interesting character but that is really not saying much.<br /><br />i would have to recommend to pass on this movie, despite the box-cover looking pretty good (it's what originally drew me to the movie). 3/10
