"wild tigers i have known." it will only be showing in big cities, to be sure. it is one of those films so artsy, that it makes no sense what so ever, except to the director! i hate those! and all of those oh-so-alternative/artsy people try desperately to find "metaphors" in what is evident horseshit.<br /><br />there was no plot, no story, no moral, no chronology, and nothing amusing or even touching. to me, it was a bunch of scenes thrown together that had nothing to do with one another, and were all for "show" to show how "artsy" and "visual" they could get. it was an attempt at yet another teen angst film, but missed the mark on every level humanly possible. then the credits roll! i was waiting for it to make sense! i was waiting for "the good part." i own about 60 independent films in my dvd collection, many of which could arguably be called "art house" films. this will not be amongst them. you will be very angry at yourself for paying to see this film, much less ever buying it on dvd.
