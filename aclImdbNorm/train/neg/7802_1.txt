a chemical spill is turning people into zombies. it's up to two doctor's to survive the epidemic. it's an andreas schnaas film so you know what the par for the course will be. bad acting, horribly awful special effects, and no budget to speak of. the dubbing is ridiculous with a capital r and the saddest thing is that i feel compelled to write one word about this piece of excrement, much less the ten lines mandatory because of the guidelines placed on me by imdb. my original review of merely one word: crap wouldn't fly so i have to revise it and go more in to how bad it is. but i don't know if i can, so.. wait i think i may have enough words, or lines rather to make this review pass. which is cool, i guess. so in summation: this movie sucks balls, don't watch it.<br /><br />my grade: f
