so, back when herbie made his first appearance, i was perfectly happy watching dean jones mug away. i only wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat overly buttered popcorn. now, unfortunately, i have expectations of a riveting/delightful story whenever i watch a movie, if i'm not on some sort of medication. and this is another good movie for the medicated. there are no major laughs, no complex plot lines, no difficult twists. herbie fully loaded is great for the fully loaded.<br /><br />this was the first time i had seen la lohan on the screen since she swapped places with jamie lee curtis (i thought she was excellent in that), and i can't say i was terribly impressed this time around. aside from her constantly changing and distractingly unnatural hair color, she just didn't ring true as the kid next door who had spent a lifetime hanging around road racers. her 'need for speed' wasn't portrayed consistently in the film - perhaps it was elsewhere - she looked older than her part, and seemed to always be looking for something (a party? designer togs? new place to spend money?) off set. i couldn't see any chemistry with justin long; that romance seemed obligatory at best. the only time lindsay appeared engaged was when she was interacting with matt dillon, who i thought was appropriately over the top as evil bad guy trip murphy.<br /><br />it was great to see herbie again, and i loved the movie intro with material from the old movies. if disney had popped out with some car 53 jewelry, i might have worn some just to be loyal. his new feature (?) was a little inconsistent (does he channel the thoughts of his driver? does he now skateboard?) but whatever. we all knew how it was going to end, but i do wish he had ended up with someone a little less dopey than maggie. and my head still hurts from that lesson maggie and we viewers had hammered home. <br /><br />what would have made the movie worthwhile? have the old herbie in a real story with a real plot - at the very least, herbie's as good as lassie - but clearly that's asking too much. why is it that disney always goes back to the same well as "herbie goes bananas" and "the computer that wore tennis shoes" when it comes to innovation? <br /><br />i'm sure this was a great movie for kids and those with no expectations. for the rest of us....it's for when you have the 'flu and just can't take the suspense of rear window.
