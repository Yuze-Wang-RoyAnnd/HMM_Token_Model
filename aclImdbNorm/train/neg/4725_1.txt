a great opportunity for and indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of stardom. it could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with john livien's traumatic past and how it is torturing his psyche. instead, it is a ridiculous attempt to identify john livien's life with john lennon's. john livien's suicida mother's hero was john lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as lennon himself. instead of focusing on john lennon's musical brilliance, and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life, it showed lennon's legacy to be that of a confused, drug addicted soul, who should looked upon as a god instead a man. i am a huge john lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another "crazy" person obsessed with lennon, lennon's killer , mark david chapman. lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with lennon. do we need to be reminded of that? john lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and i was repulsed to see another disturbed person, as the main character in this movie obsessed by lennon, and not show his beautiful contributions to the world. yoko ono graciously honored john lennon's memory,by making the memorial in central park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects, and remember john. instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide. i found this so disturbing and disrespectful to lennon's memory. he was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death, and to see such violence near this site felt like a revisiting a terrible wound for any lennon fan. it ruined the movie completely for me . it could have been a decent movie, but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. let john lennon, and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder by this irresponsible movie.
