mark hamill should have felt mighty embarrassed with corvette summer! this time, he uses a new kind of "force" to regain the possession of his dream machine, a bright red 'vette. it looks like another sour teen-age flick the first half-hour and does a u-turn in heading for the wrong direction. the writing and directing jobs are dreadfully done, with a few scenes you can't hardly take. you're expecting this to happen anyway, and you're also sniffing the smell of late-70s hodgepodge. only a former newcomer like annie potts would easily steal the show and save this poor movie from the repo creeps! her impractical but delightful personality holds on to your interest for good, and this is the finest chance to see her in a swimsuit. hooray for annie! sorry, mark! i guess the force wasn't with you this time around.
