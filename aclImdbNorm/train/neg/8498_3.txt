this movie bewilders me. it may be that i'm just a stupid american, but i really just don't get 400 blows. everything i've read about this movie has been a total rave, but i just couldn't stay interested. i'm sure that it was as revolutionary in film-making as all the critics say, but when it boils right down to it, it's just really really boring. maybe it's the language barrier, may i'm just not "sensitive" or "artsy" enough, but whatever the case is, i hated this movie. the story itself isn't bad; it's about a young french boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers, and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility. that in itself ought to be interesting, and it was, at first. there was nothing wrong with the dialogue, but then again it's hard to say because half of the conversations weren't subtitled and for no apparent reason, so i didn't always know what was going on. but for the dialogue we could understand, it made enough sense. the actors were believable enough, but it's hard to say what a real person would do in these situations. so you feel for the main character, but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think, well that sucks. the plot isn't even your typical plot. each time he gets in trouble, he gets into more trouble than the last time, but the reasons never vary too much. and through the entire film you realize that there's nothing the main character can really do about it. so it's more like just waiting to see how it ends. the ending, by the way, was completely over my head. it's way too artsy for me, and i just didn't get it. leading up to the end was easy enough to follow. the structure was certainly there, and it made sense as well, but everything was really drawn out. for the amount of dialogue and significant moments, the movie could have been an hour shorter. it just didn't end. part of it was the unnecessarily long shots, none of which were especially memorable; for example, the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds. now, i'm sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere, but for the average viewer, i'd rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time. or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running, like doing my laundry, or taking a nap. <br /><br />final verdict <br /><br />the feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson, if i could only get what the director was trying to say by his
