i do get irritated with modern adaptations of shakespeare when the director can't make his mind up whether to use the original or to update it. if it's using the original words in an updated setting, that's particularly tricky if set in the 20th or 21st century although it can work ok in period styles, eg the trevor nunn twelfth night set late victorian very effectively. it could work with the 30's setting if only there had been far less of the song and dance and far more of shakespeare's text. unfortunately, it just ends up being a pretty trivial though very pleasant show. <br /><br />another problem is branagh himself. i agree he's far too old to play one of the students but more important, he's such an experienced shakespearean actor that in spite of all his efforts to be just another student, his strength of acting shows all the time. of course he should have played the king - no problem in having a mature student king surrounded by younger students. instead we had a pleasant but unimposing actor for the king, thus an unimposing so-called king with no kingly attributes. <br /><br />the amount of song and dance, which i found tedious in spite of the nice songs and pleasant enough dancing, unfortunately meant the great shakespearean dialogue had to be cut down drastically. so the whole thing ends up a trivial and mild confection, and i got very bored, including with the comic turns, and was glad when it ended. branagh has not done shakespeare justice in this production.<br /><br />accolades however to richard briers and geraldine mcewan, absolutely splendid as the older couple.
