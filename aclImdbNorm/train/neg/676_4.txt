i wanted to see it because of two reasons. one, it was the remake of high sierra with bogart, two, the bogart part was played by jack palance, whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility, as in the big knife.<br /><br />but now i wonder why they decided to shoot this remake. the film follows the same plot as hig sierra; only here, the actors don't care, the director is lost in his thoughts, and who knows what the producer was thinking. jack palance is getting bored looking at shelley winters and shelley winters is asking herself what she's doing in this film. i don't even want to compare her to ida lupino in the same role. and of course, they had to use the dog story again! they surely could have come up with some different ideas. perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot high sierra, but that definitely doesn't add any quality to the film.<br /><br />it's a waste of time if you've seen high sierra before. otherwise, why not see a pseudo-film noir. as for me, i'd rather die than see it one more time...
