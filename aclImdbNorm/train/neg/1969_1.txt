just saw this film and i must say that although there was shown in the beginning some effort to produce a decent film, this was absolutely horrible -- but not in the sense that was intended i'm sure.<br /><br />it was like a child was directing this insult to intelligence with the belief that all would-be viewers are morons or extremely hard up for entertainment or both.... thank god for fast forward! i can't imagine the type of viewer the producer had in mind when making this film. i mean, you have actors trying to be serious, albeit barely, and a script that cries for a total rewrite,.... i just can't say anymore. if harlequin romance decided to do horror films, this would be a good effort.<br /><br />if you found this movie to be entertaining, then i strongly suggest that you seek out some guidance as to the purpose of movies. there is much better fare out there. join a club, read reviews, but above all, avoid crap like this.
