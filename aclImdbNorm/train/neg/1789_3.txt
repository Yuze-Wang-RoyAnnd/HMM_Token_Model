although i have enjoyed bing crosby in other movies, i find this movie to be particularly grating. maybe because i'm from a different era and a different country, but i found crosby's continual references to the good old usa pleasant at first, trite after a while and then finally annoying. don't get me wrong - i'm not anti-american whatsoever - but it seemed that the english could do no right and/or needed this brave, oh so smart american visitor to show them the way. it's a "fish out of water" story, but unlike most movies of this sort, this time it's the "fish" who has the upper hand. to be fair to both myself and the movie, i have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time.<br /><br />(i watched another crosby movie last night - the emperor's waltz - and that, too, produced the same reaction in me. and to my surprise even my wife - who for what's it's worth is american - found the "in your face" attitude of american crosby to be irritating. one too many references to teddy roosevelt, as she put it.) <br /><br />as for the premise of the movie, it's unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good. the scenery and the music is also good, as are the great costumes - although i agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on william bendix looks horrid (picture moe of the three stooges).<br /><br />all in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of bing crosby but because he is in virtually every shot it's pretty hard to sit through this movie.
