i rented this film purely on the fact that the cover appealed to me. however as soon as the film began i had regrets. it seems they used a home video camera to shoot this film and let a young child do it. they also used inappropriate ghostly faces and shapes to try and scare people but i found myself laughing, i could have put that together myself and done a better job of it.<br /><br />as for the plot i felt that it had some really good ideas but because of dodgy lines and in some cases acting they were overshadowed. it had no direction.<br /><br />i didn't want to sit through it all because it caused me physical pain to watch it but i always finish what i start so i took a deep breath and let it carry on. definitely 98minutes of my life wasted.<br /><br />i would save yourself the embarrassment of knowing that you have watched 'haunted boat' and find something that is more entertaining. i'm a fan of low budget horror films but this was a major disappointment i thought nothing could get worse after 'terror toons' but this made me reconsider. a let down to its genre.<br /><br />* out of ***** (the star is for the ideas of having their worst fears coming for them)
