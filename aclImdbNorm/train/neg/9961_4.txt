amelia and michael are a married couple that are cheating on each other. amelia has a long-time lover in the hospital and michael hires a prostitute that doesn't satisfy him. the two smolder with their infidelity but manage to connect to each other in the end.<br /><br />there's not a whole lot to this particular short. the direction is straight-forward and dramatic, which is good, the acting is sincere, but the story leaves a little bit to be desired. why, exactly, do we care about these two people? it's a little hard to see how this story sticks out from any other infidelity story except that it's much more pared down and doesn't search for meaning in it (a welcoming change of pace if anything).<br /><br />i don't know, it's possible i don't connect to these stories because i've never experienced them. but i have noticed that the blocking in these narratives are typically the same, i.e., a couple talking together while avoiding eye-contact by pretending to be immersed in magazines, etc. the nice things about short films is that they provide a bit more room for trying something different, and i'd like to see a different take.<br /><br />--polarisdib
