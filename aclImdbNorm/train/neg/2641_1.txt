almost every plot detail in this movie is illogical and implausible. it carries no semblance of a genuine human story, dead and dull. it is a parody of hollywood, with trumpet musical bits that remind you of a denzel washington movie, wobbly camera shots and focusing, racist stereotypes, absolutely unnecessary and comical shots and gestures of famous people in clothing catalogue poses. it is made to cater for the multitude of zombies whose meaning in life derives from watching celebrity names. the only good thing in the movie is the end credits and funky song that accompanies it. i feel like an idiot for watching this, save yourself.
