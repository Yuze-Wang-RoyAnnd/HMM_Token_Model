the dudes at mst3k should see this dog of a film. it's basically about a dopey hack actor in hollywood who can't land any acting gigs. and he has this strange obsession with the movie taxi driver. so what does this dumb actor do? he dyes his hair blonde and starts acting like a l.a. surfer dude in the naive hope this will get him acting roles. you'll laugh yer head off at so many of this movie's inadvertently funny scenes. like when the actor dude's girlfriend is heart broken and sobbing and saying lines like, "how could you do this to me?" and why is she crying? cos he dyed his hair blonde and became a surfer dude to get acting gigs. this movie makes no sense at all! the actor who played the governor on benson is in this too and he plays a stereotypical right wing politician with lotsa dumb funny dialog. this movie will crack you up, trust me. you talking' to me?!
