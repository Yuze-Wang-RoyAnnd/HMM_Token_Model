this is pretty much the first jason scott lee film i've seen. i say pretty much, because i have also seen soldier, in which he plays the villain... but from what i've heard, it's not considered a jason scott lee film. this, however, is. and if this is any indication of the quality of such films, i won't be seeing any of the others. lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist... as the lead, he's awful. he gets in a fight with random no-name characters every few minutes of the film, probably because the script writer couldn't figure out how else to stretch out the film to the minimum required running time for a feature film. the villain is the only character with even a hint of personality, and aside from the fact that he's certifiably insane, he barely seems like a villain at all. the majority of the film is basically lee chasing the villain through time... or maybe it's the other way around. i can't say for sure... and i definitely wouldn't watch it again to make sure. the effects are not completely horrible... but it's close. the title comes from the popular idea of using a time-machine to go and kill hitler. somehow, the film screws up that interesting idea as well. the plot is too complicated for its own good. the pacing is poor. i can't think of one positive thing to say about this film... i really can't. it's simply too formulaic and pointless. if only i had a time-machine, so i could go back and prevent this film from ever being made... no, never mind. i just hope as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible. listen to the negative reviewers. avoid this turkey. i recommend this to fans of lee, and no one else. if you're looking for a quality film... well, this isn't it. that's for sure. 1/10
