original claymation rudolph: pretty good. original frosty cartoon: needs a little work, but could be worse. but frosty and rudolph together on the fourth of july? c'mon! give me a break!!! this was one movie that shouldn't have been made. it was bad. it didn't really go for any holiday in particular, except july 4. that made it especially bad since frosty and rudolph are usually associated with the christmas season. and any movie can be ruined by too much singing. the frequent songs made this movie seem a lot longer than it really was. the movie tried mixing two familiar chirstmastime characters with an american traditional holiday (which almost seems to "limit" it to america), too many pointless songs, and a lousy plotline. the result? a bad movie that can't really be watched at any time of year. i would suggest you forgo this movie even if you like frosty and rudolph.
