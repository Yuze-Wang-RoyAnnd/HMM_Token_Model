seriously, i'm all for gooey romantic comedies and will get sucked into miss congeniality as easily as goodfellas...but this movie? it doesn't make any sense!!!! and i'm not even talking about the willing suspension of disbelief kind of not making sense. why does her family live in england? or, at the very least, why doesn't she have a british accent? she's sure cozy with her dad and he's surprisingly forgiving of her not being around for the last two years. (on that subject, no one ever makes much of a deal about her being away for so long). and what was with the goofy outfits at the bachelorette party? i'm not even going to get into the fact that the escort she paid for falls in love with her--that could've been overcome by better movie-making. i'm just saying that the characters, the setting, and the plot aren't fleshed out enough to make an even somewhat cohesive story. oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is the filmmaker's consistent use of the most unflattering angles on deborah messing's nose--i'd have sued the filmmakers if i were her! i mean, honestly, i'm all for women being who they are, but why, in seven loyal years of will and grace viewing, have i not ever noticed how incredibly odd her nose is? oh! because those producers are kind to her! this movie, like my other least favorite movie ever, armageddon, is the fault of the filmmakers, not the actors. i can see both messing and mcdermott in these roles with a better writer, director, and producer.<br /><br />this easily gets my vote as one of the worst movies i've ever wasted time on. i'm just glad a friend loaned me her dvd, so all i wasted was time. if there were a way to make this review zero stars, i'd do it.
