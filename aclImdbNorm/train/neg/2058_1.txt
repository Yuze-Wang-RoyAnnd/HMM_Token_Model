i can find very little thats good to say about this film. i am sure the idea and script looked good on paper but the filmography and acting i am afraid is not the standards i would expect from some very talented people. i would doubt that this features highly in their cv filmography. michael caine appeared wooden at times in his role as the doctor, and at no time no did i actually believe in his character. the plot was unbelievable especially with regard to the victims son. some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films, that at times i wondered if it was actually a spoof thriller. the lighting at times was dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big named stars, wondering why i bothered to watch it at all.
