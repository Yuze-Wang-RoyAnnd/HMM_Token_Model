just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water...<br /><br />another computer generated mutant croc on the prowl for human lunchmeat, let loose by another one of those facilities conducting mad science. gereco biotech company is fooling around with growth hormone research, accidentally releasing a baby crocodile which is evolving at an accelerating rate.<br /><br />b-movie cast add a deal of fun to this run of the mill "genetic mistake monster movie". costas mandylor evokes mick dundee, aussie accent, hat, big ass knife, the works, as a croc specialist hired by gereco executive joanna pacula(..wasted in the stereotypical role of corrupt administrative executive who denies any involvement with the gigantic beast her facility let free on innocent people). charles napier is the local sheriff whose town is in danger and jane longenecker is his hot daughter, who works at the animal shelter. soap opera star matthew borlenghi is longenecker's love interest, a local artist who welds sculptures(..his brother is a victim of the croc). of course, this skill will come in mighty handy when our heroes set up a created trap for the croc, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide.<br /><br />the croc itself is never the least bit convincing as it rampages through a reserve looking for food, the special effects of a low grade variety. in regards to roger corman productions dealing with renegade dino-monsters, i stick with carnosaur. the monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on it's hind legs, often upright as it pursues potential victims. i felt mandylor and the filmmakers were spoofing crocodile dundee with his croc hunter, and this imitation might amuse where the monster itself fails. borlenghi and longenecker actually have pretty good chemistry together on screen. as expected, pacula gets her commuppance in hilarious fashion(..gulp).
