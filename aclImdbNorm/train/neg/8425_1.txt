truly a disgusting, vile film, with only a small amount of real humour.<br /><br />the character of the father in particular is vulgar in the extreme (intentionally so, obviously), and portrayed in the most pathetic, seedy manner.<br /><br />my wife and i found this film horribly upsetting, with absolutely no redeeming features at all. frankly, i wish i had never seen it.<br /><br />i consider this british effort to be a sick and gross embarrassment.<br /><br />those who enjoyed this film have an ability i totally lack: that of rejoicing in a display of deep depravity and squalor.<br /><br />the producers should be ashamed of themselves.
