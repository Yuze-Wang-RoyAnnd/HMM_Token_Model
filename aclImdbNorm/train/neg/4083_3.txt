i saw this movie when it was released, and my distaste for it has stuck with me all these years. <br /><br />here's why: <br /><br />greenaway's goal seems to be to take every literary image in the tempest and make it literal. if a character were to say, "my heart takes flight," we'd be shown an actual human heart, with pigeon wings attached, flapping across the screen. <br /><br />this process makes for some lush tableaux, but ultimately it's a facile exercise. and it becomes deadly boring.<br /><br />i don't begrudge the pleasure other viewers found in this movie, but it's worth knowing that not everyone in the audience was enraptured.
