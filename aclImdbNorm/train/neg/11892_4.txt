sadly, the print of the film we were going to watch burned in the fire at universal studios last week, so we were stuck with video. that could even be a metaphor for this second-rate king kong movie from toho studios' stalwart director ishiro honda. essentially it's a warm up for "king kong versus godzilla". it even uses the idea of a mecha-kong, like mecha-godzilla. of course the movie climaxes with king kong fighting mecha-kong on top of the expo tower in tokyo, but if you didn't know that already then maybe you're in the age group that this movie was intended for.<br /><br />the cast is headed by a guy named rhodes reason who we had never heard of... glancing over his list i see mostly a lot of scattered american tv credits, so it's interesting that they dragged him all the way to japan so that they could have a nominal american hero. the real hero of the movie is the more sensitive japanese commander played by akira takarada, who i recognized from hiroshi inagaki's iconic version of "chushingura" (47 ronin) and also from the original godzilla films by honda. i'm sorry rhodes reason whoever you are, but this guy has way more screen presence and you can bet that everyone wants him to end up with the cute little blonde, played by linda miller. we laughed at the way reason would always find a way to interject himself between miller and takarada, who it seemed like she kind of preferred. of course like all kong leading ladies her primary relationship is with the king himself. she discovers a nice trick: if you talk to a giant ape really..... really.... slowly..... he'll understand what you're saying. and if you're a blonde gal, that means that he'll do whatever you tell him to do. that fact is not lost on dr. who (eisei amamoto) and madame piranha (mie hama) -- representing a "nation which shall not be named" -- who plan on using her as bait to get kong to dig up mineral deposits that are trapped at the north pole.<br /><br />yes, this is truly the plot of the whole movie -- apparently only a giant ape is going to be capable of digging out these minerals which can be used to make super powerful weapons. dr. who builds mecha-kong to get it but the circuitry gets in the way, so they decide to go for the real kong. kong himself seems momentarily infatuated with mecha-kong, a story element that might have made the film more interesting but wasn't followed up on.<br /><br />by the end of the movie, the cute blonde has shouted "kong" or "king kong" in her chirpy voice so many times that when the two heroes tell her to let him go at the end they're speaking for all of us. basically this movie squanders whatever majesty was possible in the kong character by making him a heroic and friendly figure much too early, just like the newest version of the story. kong is just a guy in a suit in this movie, and they show quite a lot of him to the point where the goofy face becomes impossible to take seriously. it's a nice looking movie, i'm sure it satisfies the demands or desires of fans of this type of thing, which is really more of a wrestling film than a monster film in a lot of ways. the monsters don't ever really scare in these films, they just jump around and push each other around a lot. it's not a worthless movie, but it's extremely predictable and formulaic so for anyone under the age of 10 or so it probably will only be entertaining as comedy.
