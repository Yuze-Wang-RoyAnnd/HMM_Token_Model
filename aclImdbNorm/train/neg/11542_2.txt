an unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and horribly assaulted by a group of two-dimensional psycho thugs during a night-time encounter on a forest road in shropshire, england. the man and woman who were assaulted plan and carry out a revenge attack on their attackers...<br /><br />utterly repellent piece of voyeuristic trash, somehow masquerading as 'thought-provoking' drama, whilst actually coming across as sub-michael winner cr*p (you just know that oliver reed and susan george would have been cast had it so easily have been made in the 1970s). what happens to alice (gillian anderson) and adam (danny dyer) is appalling and devastating, yet dan reed somehow manages to rub the viewer's nose in every last glob of its sexual nastiness. his camera lingers hungrily on anderson's naked body both during and after the assault, whilst the script leaves almost all the characters floundering in a turgid sea of two dimensional clich'e. his script forces his characters to behave in such a way as to alienate the viewer further from the 'victims' by shoving more ghastly situations into their faces (adams's attempted post-incident assaults on both sophie and alice; alice's assault on heffer after his suicide-attempt confession).<br /><br />the quandary comes from the central protagonists' performances - dyer is a horrible actor, incapable of light and shade as the young male victim of the initial assault (he'll end up in eastenders, mark my words), but anderson is extraordinary. even as the atrocious script forces her character to behave in depraved and ludicrous ways, she somehow delivers an extraordinarily compelling and complicated characterisation as a self-indulgent, arrogant hedonist who encounters such horrors and needs to retaliate.<br /><br />a vile and pointless film then, almost but not quite rescued by a compelling central female performance.
