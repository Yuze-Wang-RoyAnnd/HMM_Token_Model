i read some gushing reviews here on imdb and thought i would give this movie a look. disappointed. on the plus side the male leads are good, and some interesting photography but as a whole this movie fails to convince. seems to be full of its' own self indulgent importance in trying to say something meaningful but falls way short and all in all the picture is an unconvincing mess.<br /><br />it is one of those films classified as a film noir which can be defined as follows:<br /><br />"a film noir is marked by a mood of pessimism, fatalism, menace and cynical characters".<br /><br />well that is the story here: 3 losers stumble upon each other with their collective problems that include mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, indebtedness etc and together they conspire to kidnap a child and outwit each other.<br /><br />would have been a much better movie if the story was confined more to the kidnap instead of the character failings of the kidnappers. i thought the female lead was way out of her depth and came across as an amateur actress.<br /><br />whilst some good moments, i finished up feeling i had wasted my time.<br /><br />4/10.
