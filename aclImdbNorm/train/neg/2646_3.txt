when anyone comes into a film of this type of film it's not without saying that an overdose of that great over-the-counter brain-medicine, suspension of disbelief, comes in mighty handy.<br /><br />jeanette macdonald plays two roles: anna/brigitta, the woman who nelson eddy has ignored since the beginning of time, but who also is -- an angel sent to earth.<br /><br />my reaction when i saw this was a mute gasp of "hunh?" where have i seen this before? it turns out, i have seen it before, but in a movie made much later than this one. date with an angel, a forgettable pile of dreck made in 1987, cashed in on the ethereal beauty of one emmanuelle beart who had no speaking lines, also wore a blond wig, and made life hell for soap-actor michael knight. much worse in every conceivable angle with ultra-low 80s values but more than likely an updated version of this 1942 turkey.<br /><br />anyway, not to elaborate, this is not a memorable film and stands as a doorstop of information because it was the last time macdonald and eddy, neither very good actors but terrific singers, would be together playing up the "innocence" and "clean-cut" romance that they were known for. after that you may need a cold shower, not because there are any steamy scenes here, but to get rid of the memory.
