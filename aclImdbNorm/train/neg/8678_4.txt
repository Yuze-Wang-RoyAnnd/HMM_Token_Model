after watching "the bodyguard" last night, i felt compelled to write a review of it.<br /><br />this could have been a pretty decent movie had it not been for the awful camera-work. it was beyond annoying. the angles were all wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during the fight sequences. the closeups were even horrible.<br /><br />the story has sonny chiba hiring himself out as a bodyguard to anyone willing to lead him to the top of a drug ring. he is approached by judy lee, who is never quite straight with chiba. lee's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than chiba thought, as the mob and another gang of thugs are after her.<br /><br />the story was decent, and despite horrible dubbing, this could have been a good movie. given better direction and editing, i'm sure this would have been a classic kung foo movie. as it is, it's more like another cheesy 70's action movie.<br /><br />note: the opening sequence has a quote familiar to "pulp fiction" fans, and then continues to a karate school in times square that is in no way related to the rest of the movie.<br /><br />rating: 4 out of 10
