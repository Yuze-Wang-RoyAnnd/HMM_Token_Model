absolutely trash. i liked halloween and from then on johnny's been in a downward spiral. this is about the pits. we get it john. pro-lifers are scary! you don't have to make a shitty film that bores the hell out of me to 'tell' me.<br /><br />the pacing is way off here. it feels like john didn't have much to work with here. to his credit it looks like he did not write this junk. there are countless times where the camera just sits and waits for the actors to look dumb or say something dumb. i love the long cut. too bad carpenter doesn't know how to employ it. he needs to bunk up with herzog and fassbinder 30 years ago. please john, stop making a fool of yourself and boring me to death!
