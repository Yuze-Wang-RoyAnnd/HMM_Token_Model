bonjour tristesse covers similar ground as 'the member of the wedding.' to wit, a possessive daughter tries to prevent a relationship from forming between a beloved family member and an interloper. while critics love 'member of the wedding,' i find julie harris to be a jumbo-drag and an adenoidal, scenery-chomping thespian in everything she's been in. this portrays irritating, rich idiots as in last year at marienbad, but this time it's a travelogue.<br /><br />in this preminger movie sequences develop, but characters do not. for the first 30 minutes he's content to blur the father-daughter relationship between seberg and niven, making uncomfortable sexual readings possible. once the conflict is introduced, seberg can't deliver the depth the part requires. kerr pulls rank and turns the film into 'endless love.' seberg's vacuous narration, is like something out of strange interlude - it is not good. i really wish someone other than niven was in his role. he spends so much time normalizing orthodox british behavior in all his movies, he never gets around to the character.<br /><br />in the most memorable sequence, an evening out dancing becomes a free-for-all in a harbor. bertolucci steals the entire scene for his empty exercise, 'the conformist.' kerr is on board to clasp her hands and portray another major pain (as in black narcissus, night of the iguana, king and i, heaven knows mr. allyson, tea and sympathy, etc. etc.). really, kerr was a horrible actress. i wish every movie with her could end with a fatal car crash, or even better, start with one.<br /><br />people uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this.
