seemingly intended to be a thriller of a movie winds up being almost laughable. it prompted me to exclaim "oh my god!" more than once at the convoluted contrivances of plot that were just plain silly.<br /><br />fanciful or absurd locations just for the sheer novelty or dramatic situation and improbable, near impossible, human reactions and circumstances are too much to be comprehended as to why they exist.<br /><br />if you have the time and wish to discover just how bad a picture can be then you will want to see this one. otherwise dedicate some time into watching some paint dry for a more productive investment of time!<br /><br />(that a film released in 2003 is already being shown on tv in july 2003 might give an indication of the film's quality)
