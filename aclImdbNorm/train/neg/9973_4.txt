"problem child" is one of the goofiest movies ever made. it's not the worst (though some people will disagree with me on that), but it's not the best either. it's about a devilish 7-year-old boy who wrecks comic havoc on a childless couple (john ritter, amy yasbeck) who foolishly adopts him. this film is too silly and unbelievable because i don't buy for one second that a child could act as unrurly as the kid does in this film. it's asinine and preposterous although i did laugh several times throughout (i really don't know why). but i can't recommend this film. i know i'm being too kind to it. if there is one positive thing about "problem child" is that it's better than the sequel which was just awful. <br /><br />** (out of four)
