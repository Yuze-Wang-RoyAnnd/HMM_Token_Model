"nada" was the most inadequate follow-up to "les noces rouges" which,with hindsight,appears now as the last good movie of chabrol's golden era (1967-1973) "nada" is chabrol's first real attempt at a wholly political movie;its previous work "les noces rouges" had also political elements but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual look at society in french provinces."nada" includes terrorists,ambassador,hostage-taking,a lot of blood,not really chabrol's field.a heterogeneous cast gives the movie the coup de gr^ace :only duchaussoy,who had already played with the director ,and maurice garrel are up to scratch.viviane romance ,one of duvivier's actresses ("la belle equipe" "panique") ,is wasted as a madam (gabrielle).italian actors (fabio testi,lou castel)are awful.<br /><br />with "nada" this a second period of barren inspiration for chabrol .it would be "violette nozi`eres" before he was again at the top of his game.
