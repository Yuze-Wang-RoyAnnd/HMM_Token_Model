despite what a lot of other people thought about the first movie, i really liked it. this one however. how to sum it up in one word?: this movie is (and here comes the word): crap!<br /><br />but let's look at it part by part: here is the plot: finally the old queen has been removed from her castle, but her successor: snow white has problems of another sort: the court-jester, father of her son, has gone astray, as the super, spliss, goes to the extreme, to battle his gray hair and sells the royal offspring for some blond and full hair. in her desperation snow white seeks the help of bubi (otto walkees),who must first find his other six dwarf companions and then try to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name of rumpelstiltskin.<br /><br />the whole plot seems to have been written on a weekend, where the writers were very drunk but were just under pressure from the studio to write the screenplay. <br /><br />yes, there are some good jokes. even for fans of the first part, or for fans of any of the other actors, it's really not worth buying the the dvd. believe me. <br /><br />the only thing, that at least kind of saves the movie from complete oblivion, are the performances of some of the actors. that's why i gave the move 3/10. sadly, the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them combined can make up for the bad story.<br /><br />for example, at one point, they even cross over in our reality, and sadly.. they don't do anything funny while being here. <br /><br />still, a lot of great actors in this movie: otto waalkes, ralf schmitz, martin schneider, nina hagen, cosma shiva hagen, (especially funny): r"udiger hoffmann as the mirror, helge schneider and many more but sadly all these comedians aren't able to bring this really bad script to life. <br /><br />maybe it is a treat for some hardcore fans but for regular movie goers or by now dvd renters or buyers it's not worth the money. <br /><br />i even regret renting the movie.
