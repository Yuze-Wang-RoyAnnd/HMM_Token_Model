i wanted to love this movie. how could i not love it? cary grant, jayne mansfield, stanley donen; all icons in their own way. however, the train wreck that was suzy parker ruined the entire experience for me. her acting was so appalling that i sat there with my jaw hanging open, not believing my eyes or ears. i could barely make it through one viewing, that's how hideous she is in this.<br /><br />cary? gorgeous and in fine dramatic form. jayne? adorable, endearing, and obviously having a ball. the supporting cast does alright, and the city of san francisco is captured in all its stunning, retro elegance.<br /><br />then you see suzy parker attempting to speak her lines with a woodenness, a deadness, a cluelessness that simply defies belief. who told this creature she could act?? oy vey, people.
