recap: full moon. a creature, a huge werewolf, is on the hunt. not for flesh, not for blood (not that it seem to mind to take a bite on the way though), but for a mate. he is on the hunt for a girl. not any girl though. the girl. the girl that is pure (and also a werewolf, although she doesn't know it yet). three, well check that, two cops (after the first scene) and an old bag lady is all that can stop it, or even knows that the thing killing and eating a lot of folks around full moon is a werewolf. this particular powerful werewolf, darkwolf, is closing in on the girl. if he gets her, mankind is doomed. now the cops has to find the girl, convince her not only that there is someone, a werewolf nonetheless, that wants to rape her, and perhaps kill her, but that she is a werewolf herself. and then they got to stop him...<br /><br />comments: this is one for the boys, the teenage boys. a lot of scenes with semi-nude girls more or less important for the plot. mostly less. well i guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is (expectedly) thin. and unfortunately there is little besides the girls to help the plot from breaking. one usually turns to two main themes. nudity. check. and then special effects. hmm... well there are some things that you might call effects. they're not very special though. in fact, to be blunt, they are very bad. the movie seems to be suffering of a lack of funds. they couldn't afford clothes for some of the girls ;), and the effects are cheap. some of the transformations between werewolf and human form, obviously done by computer, are really bad. you might overlook such things. but the darkwolf in itself is very crude too, and you never get to see any killings. just some mutilated corpses afterwards. and there is surprisingly little blood about, in a movie that honestly should be drenched in blood.<br /><br />i'm not sure what to say about actors and characters. most of the times they do well, but unfortunately there are lapses were the characters (or actors) just looses it. a few of these lapses could be connected with the problems mentioned above. like the poor effects, or the poor budget(?). that could explain why there is precious little shooting, even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in plain sight (and not moving). but hey, when you're in real danger, there nothing that will save your life like a good one-liner...<br /><br />unfortunately that can't explain moments when the cop, steve, the only one who knows how to maybe deal with the problem, the werewolf that is, runs away, when the only things he can be sure of, is that the werewolf is coming for the girl, who is just beside him now, and that he cannot let it have her. but sure, it let the makers stretch the ending a little more...<br /><br />but i wouldn't mind seeing none of the lead actors/actresses get another try in another movie.<br /><br />well. to give a small conclusion: not a movie that i recommend.<br /><br />3/10
