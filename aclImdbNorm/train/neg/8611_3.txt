when rodney dangerfield is on a roll, he's hilarious. in my 5 wives, he's not on a roll. the timing of the one-liners is off, but they're the best thing going for the movie. the five women who play the wives don't add up to one whole actress between them. the plot is very weak. even the premise is pretty weak; there are a few jokes about having multiple wives, but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie. most of the movie could play the same way even if rodney's character had only one wife, so the premise seems more like an old man's fantasy than a key part of the comedy. another old man's fantasy: we're supposed to accept that rodney's character is an athletic skier.<br /><br />jerry stiller seems to be phoning in his role just to do a buddy a favor, and the rest of the name actors must simply be desperate for work.<br /><br />the odd nods to political correctness later in the movie don't really do anything for the movie. for those who like their movies politically correct, the non-pc humor is still there in the first place, and the seeming apologies for it still don't get the point. for those who hate seeing a movie cave in to political correctness, the pc add-ins are just annoying digressions.<br /><br />this has to be the mildest r-rated movie i've ever seen. there are some racy jokes, and the bedroom scenes would have made shocking tv 40 years ago, but that's about it. maybe it was the topless men (kidding).<br /><br />the dvd features interviews where the cast members seem to find depth and importance in this movie and in their roles. i kept wondering if they were serious or kidding. they seem to be serious, but i kept thinking, "they must be kidding!" there's also a peculiar disclaimer suggesting that since the movie never actually names the mormons or the church of latter-day saints, that somehow it's not about them. never mind that the movie features a polygamous religion in utah, and makes reference to brigham young.<br /><br />in short, my 5 wives was a disappointment. i was hoping for rodney on a roll, but the best i can say for the movie is that rodney was looking pretty good for a guy who was pushing 80 at the time.
