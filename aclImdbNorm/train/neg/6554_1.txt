i wouldn't give this movie a rating, it's not worthy. i watched it only because i'm a pfieffer fan. i love her and would watch anything she made. even in this dud, she didn't disappoint. every scene with her in it, kept the viewer watching...waiting...for something to happen but nothing ever did. it had some good story lines but they ended abruptly as soon as it started. some of the other characters had potential but nothing became of it.<br /><br />pfieffer was 29 when she made this film and at her most lovely. the wardrobe and set was surprisingly good. <br /><br />i can watch mostly anything and rarely come across a movie i can't find something to like about it, but this was a dud. i don't understand. <br /><br />the worst thing about it all, it had a big cliff hanger at the end. it had an ending scene that woke you up and say wow, this film is finally going some place, then the credits roll. good grief. <br /><br />i agree with the review that said .99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and watching my cat eat would have been more exciting. well said. actually, that comment was more entertaining than the film because it sums it up so well. i too wasted .99 cents on this dud.dud.dud.
