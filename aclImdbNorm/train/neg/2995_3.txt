only on a very rare occasion does an episode of the x-files fail to generate any excitement or does the episode contain anything which is just totally boring to watch.a detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstances.the deaths are linked to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths took place.mulder has devised a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues has come back reincarnated as the little girl and is exacting revenge.now for the bizarre bit.the little girl has no connection at all and seems to just a random person chosen as the reincarnation.i think this was slightly lazy writing by the writers and this episode ranks as one of the worst in x-files history!
