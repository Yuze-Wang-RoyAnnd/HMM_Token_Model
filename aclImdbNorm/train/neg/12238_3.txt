a concept with potential, and it was fun to see these two holiday icons together, but...<br /><br />rudolph's glowing nose didn't require the "explanation" offered in this film - much like the force in the star wars films didn't need the explanation of "medichlorians in the bloodstream." but mainly, the film left me cold because of winterbolt's over-complicated plot to destroy santa. he's got the power to put suggestions into people's minds, so why does he do things in such a roundabout way? breaking the magic of rudolph's nose, framing rudolph, threatening to melt the frosty family...the comedically exaggerated plots of pinky and the brain and "phineas and ferb's" dr. doofenshmirtz (which are done that way on purpose and played for laughs) seem simple and straightforward compared to winterbolt's, which we're expected to take somewhat seriously.<br /><br />there is a particularly (and amusingly) strange moment when a character throws her two guns at the bad guy, like boomerangs. i understand if they don't want to have guns being shot in a family film, but then why have guns in the first place?
