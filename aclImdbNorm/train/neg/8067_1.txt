first off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies. nothing, and i mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling. most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just wish it would end!! some people want a movie that makes them "think" through the entire thing, to which i say..."more power to you"!! i on the other hand just want to be entertained. which brings me back to this stinker, entertainment it is not. this movie is stupid and a complete waste of time. seems that most here agree also. most of this didn't make any sense, and by the time you think you have one scene figured out another lame scene comes around and....well i guess you see where this is going. avoid, this one sucks....bad!!
