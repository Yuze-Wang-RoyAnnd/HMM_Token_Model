looked forward to viewing this film and seeing these great actors perform. however, i was sadly disappointed in the script and the entire plot of the story. david duchovny,(dr. eugene sands),"connie & carla",'04, was the doctor in the story who uses drugs and losses his license to practice medicine. dr. sands was visiting a night club and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded customer and was assisted by angelina jolie,(claire),"taking lives",'04, who immediately becomes attracted to dr. david sands. timothy hutton,(raymond blossom),"kinsey",'04, plays the big shot gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections. timothy hutton seems to over act in most of the scenes and goes completely out of his mind trying to keep his gang members from being killed. gary dourdan,(yates),"csi-vegas tv series", plays a great supporting role and portrays a real cool dude who is a so-called body guard for raymond blossom. angelina jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby red lips which draws a great deal of attention from all the men. this film is not the greatest, but it does entertain.
