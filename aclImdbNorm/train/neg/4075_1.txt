i'm a horror/gore movie freak and this flick was so bad, i felt embarrassed for not only the "actors", but also the director and the poor sap of a producer who actually put his money up for this schlock.<br /><br />from the title, you'd expect some great carnage, somewhat of a storyline and at least some direction or dialog. instead, you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual three stooges episode. at least i laugh at the three stooges. while watching this crap, i turned another tv on and started watching howard stern until something interesting happened.<br /><br />needless to say, i kept watching stern.<br /><br />watching this "film" i realize that i could produce a film with three monkeys, 2 dv cameras, $50 dollars in loose change and a broken pc. this film is my inspiration to get into no-budget film making. watch this movie if you dare, but be warned...there is a lot of nothing in here but a whole lot of talking and very little action. this makes "kazaam" look like a meryl streep film.<br /><br />i'm sure germany didn't ban it due to sex or violence. other countries need to take heed.
