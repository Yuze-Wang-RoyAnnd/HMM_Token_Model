the only reason i even watched this was because i found it at my local library (and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it), and despite the plethora of tits and ass, it didn't take long to realize that the fast-forward button was my friend. terrible direction, pedestrian camera work, sporadically bad-to-nearly-passable acting, chintzy effects, and one of the worst screenplays i've had the displeasure of seeing brought to life (such as it was, horribly crippled and mutilated) in a long, long time. best laughs actually come from the "making of..." featurette, in which the poor saps involved with this hdv mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special, instead of something that won't be utterly forgotten next week. wait! except for the fact that somehow someone lured tippi "the birds" hedren, of all people, into doing a bit part, along with kane "friday the 13th" hodder! how this came to pass, i'll never know, and to be honest, i don't really care. watch at your own risk, and don't say you haven't been warned. this is film-making at its pretentious, craven worst. it only gets a 2 from me for having some good-looking naked women, and even then, just barely.
