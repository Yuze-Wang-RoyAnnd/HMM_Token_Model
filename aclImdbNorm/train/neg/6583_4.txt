interesting idea and storyline which didn't quite work.<br /><br />when you see the film, maybe you will feel as dissatisfied with the ending as i did. i didn't really know who to root for in the movie, taye diggs looked bored as the detective, the rest of the characters seem so one-dimensional and unpleasant.<br /><br />if the victim alicia(mia kirschner) had been more of a nice girl, we might actually have enjoyed seeing the plot unfold and the perpetrator brought to justice. the problem was that she was as bitchy as the other girls, turning from sweet girl to conniving opportunistic cokehead. i can't understand the moral message of this film, and as a detective story and thriller it doesn't work.
