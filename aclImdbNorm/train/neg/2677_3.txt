it's a really cheesy parody of tomb raider and some indiana jones, the humor's cheesy, and so is the acting. but after all it is a soft core movie, which is expected and doesn't matter because what you really want is the sex. which gets me to the biggest problem of all, there barely is any of it. which makes you feel like you're watching tv at 3 am and the independent movies are playing and the one that is on was made by some college kid that's going nowhere in that industry. you're left a very long time waiting for an actual sex scene, a lot of times you are thinking something is going to happen, then just left hanging. the one(maybe two, or one with two parts)that actually goes somewhere is very pleasing though. i personally can't recommend this unless you found it in a clear out bin for a dollar or two. if you lucking for a good movie with a plot and good acting, you don't want this. if you looking for a good soft core lesbian film, you don't want this either.
