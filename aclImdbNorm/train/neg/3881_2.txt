a few days ago, i watched a documentary called the fifty worst movies of all time and this is where i first heard of the incredible melting man. being a lover of schlocky films, i am making it a point to try to find some of the films from the documentary--not just including the incredible melting man. in fact, melting man is the first "bad film" i have seen since then and i must say i am rather disappointed. while it truly is a bad film, it comes nowhere near close enough to make inclusion on this list.<br /><br />now before seeing the documentary, i have enjoyed "bad films" ever since i read the book "the fifty worst movies of all time" by harry medved. despite the same title, the book came out long, long before the documentary and the makers of the documentary never credited medved with the concept. from the medved book, i have seen about 35 of the 50 films but have come to an impasse--the rest of the films just aren't available on vhs or dvd. so, i thought i'd try the film by the same name.<br /><br />the reason i was most disappointed with the incredible melting man was that there were a few good elements to the film. first, the melting guy special effects were generally really cool and disgusting. it's obvious that a professional (the famous rich baker) was involved in making this look realistic. however, i should also point out that there were also more than a few cheap and cheesy effects as well--such as the floating plastic head and the way the monster ran around after his left arm was cut off--you could see it "cleverly hidden" under his clothes! as for the story, it's just stupid. a group of astronauts miraculously penetrate the rings of saturn without being crushed. then, they comment about how beautiful the sun is--as we see closeups of it. this is odd since saturn is so far from it--it should not look this way--it should be a large speck. regardless, immediately the scene changes and we're told that one of the surviving astronauts is in a hospital. what happened between the last scene and this one? yep, it's anyone's guess. well, soon after, the survivor escapes and engages in a murderous rampage as his entire body melts.<br /><br />now considering they have a psycho running about who looks like a melting popsicle, you'd think the government would pull out all stops to find and stop him, right?! wrong. a general engages one lone doctor to find him!! no army, no police--just some dopey doctor. even after bodies begin stacking up, at no point do the doctor or general do anything to organize a meaningful search or get backup.<br /><br />now, given the stupidity of the film, you also wouldn't be surprised to find the following: <br /><br />when the melting dude is running around near the doctor's house, the doctor gives his wife a powerful sedative and leaves her in the house.<br /><br />when a cute old couple is driving late at night, they naturally stop in an orchard to pick fruit and are killed.<br /><br />when a lady sees melting dude, she barricades the door to protect herself. this would be smart if she didn't have the back door of the house next to her! instead of just leaving the house and escaping, she just waits! <br /><br />when a photographer and his model are taking snapshots, the guy grabs his assistant and yanks off her top. why? well to give the audience a cheap thrill and make it a rated r flick.<br /><br />when the melting dude is finally located and the sheriff has a clear shot at him, the doctor stops him--even though by now the monster had killed about a half dozen people.<br /><br />so, as you can see the film abounds with stupid plot elements. it is a very bad film. but, given the occasionally good special effects, it just wasn't a horrible film like i'd hoped. sure, it's good for a laugh, but no where near plan 9 from outer space in badness and never should have been included on anyone's worst film list.
