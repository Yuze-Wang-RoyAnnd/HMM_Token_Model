a man wakes from a nightmare about bats. he and his wife go out into the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon. he seems to hear a strange noise, and she is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling across their picnic blanket. he wants to go on a tour of a cave, which has something to do with some kind of work he is doing, but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon. she relents. they go on the tour, but leave the group to make out. she falls down a slope, where she is disturbed by insects. he follows her. he hears the strange noise again, and seems to know a bat is approaching; one does, and gets in her hair. he fights it off her, and it attacks him, biting his forehead.<br /><br />they get out of the cave, but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort, he starts having seizures in which he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people. he becomes angry when this happens. he's unable to drink alcohol without spitting it out. his wife worries about rabies, and he starts a pasteur treatment for that, but reacts violently to the injection.<br /><br />and then some people are killed. we see parts of the man's transformation into a bat person. it seems it is not just in his mind. whether the bat bite causes these transformations is not clear, since he already was having some symptoms prior to the bite.<br /><br />while the title seems inappropriate, the implication at the end is that the same thing is happening to another person. not a very good movie, but i liked the variety of the desert, cave, and ski-slope locations, and some of the weirder scenes. i didn't think this was as bad as other people do, and i didn't think the 1999 movie bats was as bad as others think either (i rated that one a 5/10).
