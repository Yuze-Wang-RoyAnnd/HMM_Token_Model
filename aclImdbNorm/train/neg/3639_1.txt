this movie sucks from beginning till (especially) the end. you probably don't get 'm any worse, acting, storyline ,photography, camera work, etcetera it's all bad, very, very bad.<br /><br />but that's what makes it a 'great' watch, it will give you more than enough good laughs. the worse, the better! <br /><br />i really have no clue what so ever of what these people were thinking making this movie. a serious viking movie? the story is goddamn ridiculous, it's more like a comedy in disguise, kinda like mafia, also pointless but damn funny.<br /><br />and look out for the very very end of the movie... uhum.
