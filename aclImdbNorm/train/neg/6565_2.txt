this movie is chilling reminder of bollywood being just a parasite of hollywood. bollywood also tends to feed on past blockbusters for furthering its industry.<br /><br />vidhu vinod chopra made this movie with the reasoning that a cocktail mix of "deewar" and "on the waterfront" will bring home an oscar. it turned out to be rookie mistake.<br /><br />even the idea of the title is inspired from the elia kazan classic. in the original, brando is shown as raising doves as symbolism of peace.<br /><br />bollywood must move out of hollywood's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously.
