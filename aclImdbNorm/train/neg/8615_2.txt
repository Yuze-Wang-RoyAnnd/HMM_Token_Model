this movie was so bad, outdated and stupid that i had rough times to watch it to the end. i had seen this rodney guy in natural born killers and i thought he was funny as hell in it, but this movie was crap. the "jokes" weren't funny, actors weren't funny, anything about it wasn't even remotely funny. don't waste your time for this! only positive things about this were the beautiful wives :) and molly shannon who i'm sure tried her best, but the script was just too awful. that's why i rated it "2" instead of "1", but it's definitely one of the worst films i've ever seen.
