this movie is s-l-o-w. spent most of the movie actually waiting for it to 'begin'.<br /><br />the setting was bleak, the script was bleak, the cinematography was bleak, the plot was bleak, the budget was low (not that all low budget movies are bad, but this one had no redeeming features).<br /><br />the plot was more consumed with a vengeful, slightly deranged hunter than the actual wendigo which made a very brief appearance toward the end of the movie. this in itself was disappointing as this 'wendigo' was just a bizarre mix of a tree and a stag. everything about the movie was uninspiring.<br /><br />the parents of the little boy appeared to be rather aloof and at times seemed completely detached from their son. whether this was down to bad acting or a bad script i'm not sure, but it only heightened my disappointment and boredom levels.<br /><br />there was no food for thought, nothing to pique an interest. with no real intrigue or chill factor, this movie creaked along so painfully, you just couldn't care less what happened by the end.<br /><br />wendigo's ambiance reminds me of the dull movie shown at the awards ceremony toward the end of 'mr bean's holiday': a movie which is artistic and nonsensical, trying too hard to to be deep and meaningful, but coming across as pretentious and boring.<br /><br />i would never want to watch this again. i only watched it to the end in the vain hope that something interesting might happen ... but it didn't.
