this film is too skeletal. it's a fairly low-budget film (i hope!) which excuses it somewhat, but the lack of a decent cast and a fleshed out plot hurts it too much. phillips is quite believable in his role as a torn-apart son of a well-off family who's searching for himself (though his family is...er...well, a little too white...), but the rest of the cast is grasping at straws. every moment that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama, and there are *way* too many sub-plots (which is an obvious sign of plot-deficiency. they needed filler...) i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who isn't either a hard-core phillips fan, or who has absolutely *nothing* to do. 4/10.
