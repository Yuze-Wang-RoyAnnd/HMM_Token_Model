trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation you've heard about semi-devout mormons, and you'll see they've all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film. finally kurt hale's fortunes have changed (thank goodness) and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theaters.<br /><br />the cinematography was amateurish (i think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes). the plot was limp and very unfunny. you really didn't understand why anyone did anything. it was like i had sand in my eyes, and a 300-pound lady was sitting on my face, it was that painful.<br /><br />the only reason i didn't give this movie a negative rating was because the scale won't let me.
