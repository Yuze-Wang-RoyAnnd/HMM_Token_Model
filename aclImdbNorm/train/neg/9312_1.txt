worst movie on earth. i don't even know where to begin but i hope i can save another person from punishing themselves with this movie. when it comes to acting and lighting, this movie is similar to a bad porno without the sex. the actors are some of the worst i've ever seen, and couldn't have been worse even if they were trying to make a complete mockery of this movie. the movie must have had a record breaking low budget which i'm sure was wasted almost solely on the movie's cover. this movie has now become a running joke with friends of mine and has become the standard for comparing other garbage movies. i would like to point of that no other movie even begins to compare. i feel personally responsible for suggesting a friend and me watch this movie and am surprised she still considers me a friend after the torment i put us through. don't see this movie!
