as i was watching this movie i was thinking,ok it'll get good any moment...i was wrong. the real best part of this movie was when it was over. a complete waste of 92 minutes. all seriousness aside the best part was when the wendigo finally showed up which was at the end and you couldn't really even see him that good. and the tail end was really kind of dumb as well. there was too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen but was a let down. the worse part is there was more talk of the wendigo then there was wendigo. for the creature to be so bad,you definitely couldn't tell it by this movie.
