this movie has such inexorable b class cheapness to all its scenes, effects etc as to make you think they spent 80% of their budget on connery. it's like watching some wing commander stuff after star wars (quite apart from content).<br /><br />story can be described in one word: flat. and oh my god i can't remember a villain so uninteresting since long long ago. we're given neither a reason he's so wicked (an inborn defect, we're lead to think:) nor any real convincedness or flair to his wickedness.<br /><br />if you're out for connery rather go rent `hunting forrester'.
