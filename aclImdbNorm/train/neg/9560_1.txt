thank god i watched this at a friend's place and did not pay for it. the plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a tv show. if you have any knowledge of computers or electronics, watch out. you will feel feel like the movie is an insult to your intelligence. <br /><br />also, actress turned much music vj amanda walsh displays the worst acting i have ever seen, excluding porn. she's lucky that matt lanter is actually decent. he's the one that carries the movie. <br /><br />i hate that i wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie! it's a shame that they got to call it a sequel, because i was a fan of the original, which was actually pretty good.
