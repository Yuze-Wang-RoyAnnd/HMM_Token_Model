in all of low budget history. this movie has to be one of the worst. true ther are some humorous sides to the movie, but in general it was just plain awful. i just can't understand what person could not out run a bunch of slugs. i mean they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. the only part worth while in this movie is the close up of a slugs attempt to bite the finger of a man. this was rather amusing.
