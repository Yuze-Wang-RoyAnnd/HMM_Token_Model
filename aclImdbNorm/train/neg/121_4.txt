whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about lucille ball, especially her autobiography. i've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in celoron and jamestown to her later years with desi. i could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. in all, i believe that lucille ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. if i were lucie arnaz and desi, jr., i would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. the filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.
