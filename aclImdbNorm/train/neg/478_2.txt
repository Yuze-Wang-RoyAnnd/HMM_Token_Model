the competition for the worst warner bros kay francis movie is stiff. i've only seen perhaps eight of them, but comet over broadway is the worst so far. the very best thing about it is that it's short. oh, and the orry-kelly gowns (of course) are fine. james wong howe's cinematography is not. kay francis throughout looks fat-faced and far less attractive than she normally does. minna gombell whom i don't know otherwise is good as a semi-tough "burlesque" dancer (it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque). the closing shot - kay francis and her child (when did the child learn that kay francis was her mother? did i doze off?) walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous. the whole film is so cheap, so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it: warner bros tossing garbage to dolts who don't know, in warner bros' cynical estimation of them, that what they're getting is garbage.
