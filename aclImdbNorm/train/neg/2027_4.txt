unlike endemol usa's two other current game shows (deal or no deal and 1 vs. 100), the pacing in this show is way too slow for what is happening on the screen.<br /><br />dond and 1 vs. 100 can get away with slow pacing because the games can change pace--or end--at any moment. there is risk involved in every action the player takes, the rewards are wildly variable, and it is difficult for the players to leave with a significant amount of money. suspense is usually put to good use.<br /><br />show me the money, on the other hand, is just too slow-paced. when a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer, you can rest assured that absolutely nothing exciting will happen in the next few minutes. it would greatly help the pace of this show to reveal the correct answer first, and then have the player select a dancer, instead of shat wasting time talking about what will happen if the player gets an answer wrong when we all know they're right. the random dancing is filler that actually feels like filler. too much time is wasted while not enough is happening... and the fact that players cannot choose to quit the game early guarantees that there will be a lot of time wasted.<br /><br />oh, and i have no interest in watching shat shake his groove thang, especially right after i've eaten dinner.<br /><br />i am a lifelong game show fan, but even i had a lot of trouble sitting through an hour of this. it either needs major changes or early retirement.
