another cult strikes again. this isn't a spoiler, because the real ending comes after you research the folks who brought this overly-long, pseudo-scientific infomercial...ramtha's school of enlightenment.<br /><br />when any religion/philosophy needs to hide behind an oz-like screen of deceit, i walk away. thank ramtha i watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a "friend"...to have wasted precious resources on this new-age lobotomizer would have been tragic. i can only hope that they "truly believe they can walk on water" enough to take that guidance to it's "logical" conclusion...in other words; walk, drown...or shut up :-) as a movie...it deserves a strong "1" on it's entertainment value, especially for creating the most dislikable character in film history (the photographer's roommate...eeeeeek!). if you must see this film, borrow it from one of the brainwashed folks who recommended it.
