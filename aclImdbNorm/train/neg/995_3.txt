rosario dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge. while its clear why dawson took the role, its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent, decidedly un-hollywood film, its also clear that aside from stunning good looks, dawson seems out of place in the role. forgive me i simply couldn't find her. thats not a mistake, thats how i felt, i had no idea where she was. yes i know she's on the screen but even though i spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever. i blame the script for this since other than the ending, not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense. the people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didn't seem to fit together. forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film, other than the end (which i would love to talk about but can't cause it would spoil it), and the image of rosario dawson as nothing more than an image, stayed with me.what can i say, this may click with you, it may not, for me it's time i can't get back. for rosario dawson fans only, though be warned there's several real reasons why this is nc17. (and rosario- please, you're a better actress, pick better scripts)
