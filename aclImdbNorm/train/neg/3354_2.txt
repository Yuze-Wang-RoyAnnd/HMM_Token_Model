it's my opinion that when you decide to re-make a very good film, you should strive to do better than the original; or at least give it a fresh point of view. now the 1963 robert wise telling of shirley jackson's remarkable novel "the haunting of hill house" is worth the price of admission even today. now fast forward to 1999 and the re-make. i was left shaking my head and asking, why? the acting is wooden, the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects computers can generate. i had heard that this update was bad; but couldn't believe it was that bad, considering the source material. i was wrong. after watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was, she said; "well they got your money!" she's right, don't let them get yours. if there's no profit in making lousy re-makes, maybe they'll stop making them or come up to a higher standard that doesn't insult their audience
