i am puerto rican and this is one of the worst documentary of i've ever seen of any type. you can see that the people on it are clueless. they don't know much about puerto rico and its culture. they claim to be puerto rican because they are from puerto rican descendants, but they probably know less than others who are not from there. you can see while they are talking that they are contradicting themselves. if you would like to see a real, and i mean a real, genuine documentary from puerto rico, then you must see "mi puerto rico". that's a serious, real documentary. not like this piece of junk. rosie perez based this documentary on herself. i thought it was suppose to be about puerto ricans. they keep repeating i didn't know. well, that's about the only thing they got right on this so called documentary. i hate to see such a piece of garbage being done using the name of the island. it brings down the standards.
