i look around in the video store still in shock how steven seagal with his track record of bad action movies can still have 3 movies hit the shelves in less than a year.attack force being the 3rd no less promised the first-time entrance into the sci fi genre for our ever widening seagal.visions of bad movie entertainment flashed before my gullible eyes.sadly this is not the case one bit with no entertainment and a movie as bad as they come.<br /><br />seagal rebounded a tiny bit with the trashy-but enjoyable shadow man last time we saw him.however attack force has to be his absolute worst movie ever!don't argue for out for a kill,ticker,or even black dawn folks.this is the bottom of the septic tank here.<br /><br />anyone who says this is steven seagal's return to form should be forced to write a 100 page essay on the word taste. <br /><br />seagal is yet another agent/i'm a supreme bad-ass yet again named lawson wants revenge for the killing of his team that leads him to a nefarious plot to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public.not to mention the dealers are not from around here.<br /><br />the whole production from directing to the acting is poor.was this movie shot in the dark?its gotta be the most poorly lighted movie since howling 2.the action is terrible and very badly done.<br /><br />the producers have also unwisely decided to do what the fans hate the most:throw in stunt double after stunt double and horribly dubbed steven seagal.who seems to show little enthusiasm here.can ya blame him?<br /><br />while it has been said that attack force was not the movie stevie signed on for(originally harvester)and surely has to be better than attack force.the post-production tampering has not made it more coherent and made seagal look worse.i feel bad for directer michael keusch and writer joe halpin as they are gonna be judged forever for the ill-advised production re-shoots.<br /><br />so now this leaves seagal in the impossible position to come up with something to atone for this mess.but after seeing how bad attack force has turned out do we really want him to make another movie?
