why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain, they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie? burt reynolds peaked, then started making dreadful hal needham car chase flicks. arnold schwarzenegger became the hottest property in hollywood, only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling last action hero. and here, loquacious eddie murphy erases memories of trading places and 48 hours with this "family" adventure flick, which is an unbelievably tedious, childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see charlotte lewis's great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire film.<br /><br />the story is pure humdrum. it concerns social worker murphy, contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the chosen one. chosen for what, i hear you ask. his job is to rescue a tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world. as the main demon, classy actor charles dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film, but hey, i'm sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents. of all murphy's films, this is easily the worst. i've read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see murphy in an atypical role, in a non formulaic kind of film, and while both points are loosely true there's no forgiving the fact that the film - however atypical and non formulaic it might be - is an absolute load of garbage.<br /><br />
