dd films were damn corny, damn stupid and had a plot which seemed wafer thin but those days they was a plot at least<br /><br />this film isn't just a comedy but a mix of melodrama, romance everything<br /><br />every drama scene is blown out of proportion<br /><br />the comedy is funny but corny too yet the film keeps you entertained, those days govinda films were loud, crass yet they had some funny moments people enjoyed<br /><br />david dhawan does a okay job music is okay<br /><br />govinda acts well in comedy and drama karisma is decent in parts and annoys in parts kader is as usual gulshan, prem chopra are typecast shakti is hilarious
