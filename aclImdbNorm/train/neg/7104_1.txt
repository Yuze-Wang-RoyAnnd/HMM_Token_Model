the producers of this film offer to pay funeral expenses for anyone who dies of fright while watching this movie. they should have offered intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really enjoyed this stinker. a young couple moves into a house, where a woman who looks like the woman from the couple lived. extremely boring, and very predictable. in the end i ended up not caring about anyone in this movie.<br /><br />avoid this one at all costs.
