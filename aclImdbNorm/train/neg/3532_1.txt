its like if you took the general themes of the usual suspects and fightclub, take away all their style and class and mixed them together with a lot of pretentious new wave "i'm intellectual so my movie must be hard to make sense of" film maker rubbish, mashed in a few extra styles for good measure, chopped off the ending, there you have revolver.<br /><br />yes, i did think about it for a little bit after watching, and yes it did kind of make sense, however that doesn't stop it being garbage.<br /><br />waste of money. waste of time.<br /><br />up there as the worst movie i have ever seen, with not even a bad movie novelty value to redeem it a little.
