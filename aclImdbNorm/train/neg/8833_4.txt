with no fault to the actors (they all put on great performances), the overall story was not very well executed. the movie opens with a great zinger: a crazy old guy forces a young aborigine girl's car off the road. but then, we're forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with an entirely new group of characters ... and we don't know why until the 40 minutes are up. it turns out that they are the ones who eventually discover the girl's body ... and the story progresses from there.<br /><br />while the story does pick up at that point, it really goes nowhere. after 2 hours, i asked myself: was there a point to this, or was it just to see the characters struggle with accusations of racism and stupidity of how they handled the discovery? the story was ultimately unsatisfying and felt unfinished. while it is well acted, there's not a strong enough backbone in the film to warrant recommending it.
