a nightmare on elm street: the dream child, the fifth installment in the nightmare on elm street series and the worst sequel ever in the series, even worse than a nightmare on elm street 2. i was lucky enough to get the nightmare on elm street dvd box set for my birthday and i watched all the sequels. the dream child was the worst without a doubt, i was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels. but i guess they just lost the charm, the story was just ridicules and i wasn't happy with where it went. alice just became more annoying, she's not nancy or kirsten, so her carrying this film on her own didn't work for me. freddy is also loosing his scare, this was just getting a bit silly.<br /><br />alice is back and she's carrying a child, she couldn't be happier with her life. but freddy is also back and he's not going to be too light on her since she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie. but anyways, he wants her child and to be born into the world again. did you ever wonder if freddy had parents too? well that's what a nightmare on elm street: the dream child investigates and alice soon finds out what freddy's childhood was like and that maybe that's the one thing that can defeat him.<br /><br />a nightmare on elm street: the dream child is just all in all a bad movie and an insult to the series. i don't think anyone could be happy with this sequel. just the story was really silly, i mean it could have possibly worked, but once again, it was just executed the wrong way. i know that if you're looking to see the sequels for the nightmare on elm street series, you should watch it, but i really wouldn't recommend it, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />3/10
