"welcome to collinwood" is kind of a disaster. considering the people involved, it should've been multiple times better.<br /><br />watching it, if you're at least somewhat attached to the faith that it'll get better, will probably make you cry. it's one of those movies that had potential, but was robbed of this potential thanks to a terrible script and some bad acting, not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary george clooney character and the guy who reminds me of richard dreyfuss but about whom i care so little that i don't even want to know his name.<br /><br />the film's only saving grace is the weird con vocabulary it introduces. i found myself thinking of it time and time again as i watched more crime capers. this is the only reason i gave the film a 3. the plot is boring, the characters are neurotic, needlessly offensive, and highly unlikable. they are in a constant state of agonizing stress and they're all so irritating that i celebrated their obstacles. they yell at each other and swear crassly. the dialogue is insipid at best and insultingly stupid at its low points.<br /><br />i find that steven "traffic" soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and george clooney are to blame for this. they should be tried for war crimes, if anyone actually remembers this crap long enough to care.
