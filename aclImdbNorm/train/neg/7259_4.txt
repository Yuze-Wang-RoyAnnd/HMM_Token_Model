this is definitely one of the weirder 70's movies out there, and it's most notable for kicking off a decade of bigfoot hysteria. it is also notable for the little touches of insanity throughout the movie, especially when the dark, moody first half is replaced by a musical interlude of all things (as another user pointed out, one of the songs is dedicated to a character, travis crabtree, who paddles around in a canoe for a while, then... leaves, never to be seen again). although it's painfully dated now, i's still a fun scary movie to show to kids, and anyone who enjoys either bigfoot lore or 70's hillbilly culture is bound to get a kick out of this. my favorite part: a guy gets so scared that he jumps headfirst through a door (!?) and the narrator explains he went unconscious from "shock." uh, i'd say breaking a door with his head is more likely why he went unconscious, but whatever.<br /><br />4/10 stars, or 7/10 if you like bad americana.
