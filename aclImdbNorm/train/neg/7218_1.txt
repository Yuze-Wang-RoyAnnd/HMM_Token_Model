there is a scene near the beginning after a shootout where horses are running. if something red catches your eye it is because a white van is parked behind a bush by the trail. i thought i had seen bad but this is it. a white van in a western. did they not catch this? oh well, and i paid top dollar at the rental. it will make you want to grab your buddies and have them all put in 10 grand and make a better movie. the talking was so so slow, the acting was mostly ok but couldn't be taken seriously due to the poor nature of the filming. there is a door at the sheriffs that looks like a door today with the particular trimming. i say watch this movie, and move cabin boy into #2 on the worst of all time.
