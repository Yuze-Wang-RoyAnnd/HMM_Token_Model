i am not so much like love sick as i image. finally the film express sexual relationship of alex, kik, sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness, frustration and jealous, at last, alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and future.ending up was sad.<br /><br />the director tudor giurgiu was in amc theatre on sunday 12:00pm on 08/10/06, with us watched the movie together. after the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of romanian were kind of complicate.<br /><br />on my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere, i don't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie. the love proceeding of alex and kiki, and kiki and her brother sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story.<br /><br />the two main reasons i don't like this movie are, firstly, the film didn't told us how they started to fall in love? sounds like after alex moved into the building which kiki was living, then two girls are fall in love. it doesn't make sense at all. how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. too much fragments, you need to image and connect those stories by your mind. secondly, the whole film didn't have a scene of alex and kik's sexual intercourse, that 's what i was waiting for
