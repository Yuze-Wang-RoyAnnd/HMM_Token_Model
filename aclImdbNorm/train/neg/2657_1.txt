i waited for this movie to play in great anticipation. assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie, "the christmas box" based on the book by richard paul evans. i sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show, hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my "new" life. after seeing this movie i was so disappointed. as a mother who lost her only child in november 2003 and really knowing the pain, i had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who "think" they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child. this movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of diane keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child. it was very unrealistic from start to stop. i had a few calls after the movie, each call the same, "that was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back" what a bunch of bull! it is clear that the director and keaton have never lost a child because neither would have ever made the movie to be so off the mark. i guess that's hollywood.
