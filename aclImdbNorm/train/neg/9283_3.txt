i don't know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site! i'm a big vonnegut fan and am very familiar with the story this showtime original film bastardized beyond belief, but even if i wasn't, the poor acting, very poor casting (sean astin as the brilliant, athletic, and all around individual, harrison?? the guy's completely generic!) and sub-standard writing rendered this tripe barely watchable. someone pointed out how cute that maculay culkin line was. if you read that and thought that was pure comic brilliance (sadly, it probably was the most intentionally funny part of the movie), maybe you'll like this movie. but if you're a vonnegut fan or not completely insane, don't see it. please.
