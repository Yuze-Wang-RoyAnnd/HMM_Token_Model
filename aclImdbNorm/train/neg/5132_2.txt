i found out about this film because jewish ben chaplin from game on was in it. game on is a funny british sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into hollywood and star in this film. he failed thank god.<br /><br />the film is a very simple romantic comedy with janeane garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour uma thurman to date ben chaplin because she thinks ben chaplin won't like her because she's ugly. the film is just bad for so many reasons. the plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits: ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit. those two scenes made me cringe! janeane's character is sickeningly arrogant (and guessing from her role as stand-up "comedienne" and arch-feminist is in real life too). she claims that the film is "anti-feminist" when in fact it's just realistic. men more often than not go for looks over personality. it's interesting to note her hypocrisy too. she'd been a feminist and "comedienne" for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad. i imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film. i mean come on! she acted in it for heaven's sake! what this film was really was anti-men if anything. it portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of uma thurman's character noelle.<br /><br />there are other bad things about this film too like ben chaplin's character being the british man every american girl finds cute and jamie foxx being the token black best friend of chaplin and of course foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure. is that the best the script writers could come up with? blimey they've never done that before except with every hugh grant and dudley moore film ever made. there's also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is. the other comments on here all say how janeane garofalo isn't ugly but is actually beautiful. erm was i watching the same film as they were? she's certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one. although having said that, i fail to see the appeal of uma thurman as well: she's lanky and gaunt looking.<br /><br />i guarantee three things about this film if you've never watched it:<br /><br />you will know what the ending will be;<br /><br />you will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and;<br /><br />you will be bored after ten minutes.<br /><br />watch at your own peril.
