to make a film straddling the prequels and the "real" star wars trilogy would tax even a great film-maker....mr lucas is not that film-maker.<br /><br />to portray the fall of a good man into darkness needs a good actor...mr christensen is not that actor.<br /><br />the first 60-80 minutes are overwhelmingly boring with only a few pockets of yet more light sabre fights but there is a lack of edge because you already know which main characters survive to the original star wars.<br /><br />count dooku (christopher lee) has a very fleeting role here and about the best idea is to have jar jar binks silent! <br /><br />no the film only picks up with the chancellor turning on the jedi and has one great (overlong) sequence at the lava falls
