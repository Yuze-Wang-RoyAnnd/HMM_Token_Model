this film is totally garbage. some imbecilic intellectual comforting himself by making all his best to claim superiority of aristocrat over working class. nothing more than a piece of self-complacence catharsis. disgusting.<br /><br />if this kind of a movie is set in us, it will sure make itself a big joke. and simply because it comes out from 'the other side', it makes itself a masterpiece, a wonderful amusement for certain brain-washed and/or brain-washing westerns (some george w. maybe:). a typical cold-war sequelae, some kind of joke anyway.<br /><br />i would say, if this -- like expressed in this film -- is all what soviet intellectuals had been thinking about all those years, then maybe they deserve all the miseries they claim they had gone through. but no! 'cause like many others, i've read and watched real masterpieces made by real outstanding soviet intellectuals. for example, something also relevant with dog, "white bim black ear" -- both gavriil troyepolsky's book and stanislav rostotsky's movie -- is a real masterpiece. real life, real tragedy, real sad, real pride and dignity, one of the real best of the soviet era.
