remakes (and sequels) have been a staple of cinema from the beginning of the media. it is pretty much a hit or miss venture though. if you take what's good of the original and build upon it and update key features too current standards, you can have a success. note, such films like the thief of bagdad (1924/1940) or king kong (1933/2005) succeeded in their attempts. others like king kong (1976) fail, miserably.<br /><br />brief encounter (1945) is the template for this film. it is as perfect as could be made on such a subject and we rate it imdb**********ten. the story is simple, love, innocently found by accident and tragically lost. why, it just happened for the two (2) principals involved at the wrong time. these are portrayed in a convincing and sensitive manner by trevor howard and cecilia johnson. neither are conventionally leading star material, but quality character actors. for the details watch the film.<br /><br />now what went wrong? a t.v. movie, remade practically scene for scene with name actors richard burton and sophia loren should have at least scored imdb******six. both actors though appear disinterested, just showing up to punch their time-clocks and pick up their checks. neither are involved with their characters or with each other. you do not believe they are in love or when they finally separate it is any great loss to either of them. that should not be and that's why it fails in its intent. sometimes it is just better to leave things alone.
