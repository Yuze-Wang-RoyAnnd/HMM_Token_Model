ok. i know that the wanna-be john hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally flat, so the expectations for this film ran pretty low.<br /><br />still, after sitting through this crap there's one key thing i can't seem to get out of my head:<br /><br />i just sat through an 80s rob lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints of sex in them.<br /><br />the acting is awful, the characters boring and flat, the portrayal of oxford an absolute insult, and the rowing scenes unexciting, uneventful, and inaccurate.<br /><br />unless you've got some wierd ally sheedy or amanda pays (or i guess, rob lowe) fetish, there's really no reason to see this one.
