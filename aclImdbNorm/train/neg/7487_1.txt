unfortunately, this movie is so bad. the original out of towners was manic and very funny, of course they used the script written by neil simon. for some reason neil simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again. even the audience i was with never laughed. the direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i.e. the couple having sex in the park. they announce it is a lighting ceremony for new york, well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging goldie & steve do a bit of slap stick. the whole movie winds up being like this...a joke is set up and given away. why isn't goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie. you will also notice every close up of goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). i suggest you rent the original with jack lemmon and sandy dennis, that's if you want to laugh.
