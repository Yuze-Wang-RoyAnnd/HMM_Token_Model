watching this last night it amazed me that fox spent so much money on it and got so little back on their investment. it's the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />i'm sure that the first morning of filming raquel welch dusted off the shelf over her fireplace to prepare a spot for the academy award she would surely win for this daringly original movie. oops. that's not what happened.<br /><br />the infighting on the set was detailed in print by rex reed and this helped the movie attain a reputation before it was even released. when it was finally released there wasn't the usual three ring circus of publicity. if i remember correctly, in houston it opened at drive-ins and neighborhood theatres and never played any of the big venues.<br /><br />i lay most of the blame on director michael sarne, who was hot after having directed (the not all that good) joanna, a film with music about young people in swinging mod london.<br /><br />if i recall correctly, fox wound up firing him and piecing the film together the best they could. that's why scenes play out in no particular sequence and characters appear and then vanish. an impressive supporting cast (kathleen freeman, jim backus, john carradine, andy devine and others) is wasted with nothing to do.<br /><br />to expand it to feature length there are numerous clips from fox movies featuring stars like carmen miranda (in amazing footage from the gang's all here) andlaurel and hardy, who never dreamed they'd be playing in an x rated movie.<br /><br />the x rating is due to occasional language numerous sexual perversions; however, none of the characters seem to be having any fun. maybe somebody involved with the film had a warped puritan sensibility and figured that if they could make these things unappealing it wasn't bad to exploit them.<br /><br />this was one of the "youth" pictures that nearly bankrupted hollywood in the 1970's. one writer joked that easy rider (which was made for pocket change) was the most expensive movie ever made because so many films followed which tried and failed in the worst way to duplicate its success. sixtyish, once honored directors like stanley kramer and otto preminger made movies like rpm and skidoo in an effort to attract a young audience. white directors and writers attempted to make films to attract a black audience. those movies are locked somewhere in a vault and the two named and many others from that genre have never, as best i know, been out on home video or cable. they're the studios' deep dark secret.<br /><br />raquel welch's performance in this is, all things considered, very good. with the right direction and script she could played the type of sassy liberated women rosiland russel and barbara stanwyck specialized in. she looks great and has awesome costumes. mae west is the liveliest seventy-something actress i've ever seen. on the one hand it's kind of heartbreaking to watch her attempt to capture her glory from years gone by, but i'm sure she needed the money.<br /><br />if you want to see a big budget x-rated movie from this era check out beyond the valley of the dolls (also from fox) because it doesn't take itself seriously. it's crazy kids playing with the equipment at a major studio. myra breckinridge tries to say something. there just wasn't anyone who wanted to listen.
