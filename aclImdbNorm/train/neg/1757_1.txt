don't get me wrong, dan jansen was a great speed skater. if there was one guy who deserved his gold medal at the olympics it was dan.<br /><br />but how can it be possible that bill corcoran has made such a bad movie about the incredible dan jansen story, because the real dan jansen story is truly incredible! especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of a sportsman everything is wrong, the way matt keeslar and the other actors skate, their technique, the dimensions of the speedskating oval, it is all wrong!<br /><br />shame on you, bill corcoran, dan jansen deserves better, a lot better!<br /><br />1 out of 10
