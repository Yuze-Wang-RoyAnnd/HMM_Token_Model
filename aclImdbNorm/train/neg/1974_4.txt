some people have made a point of dissing this movie because they question the plausibility of black people in the old west, asian people in the old west or women with guns in the old west period. get a grip and read a book. there were quite a few asians (chinese), there were quite a few blacks (freedmen) and everybody outside of the gentile class had ready access to guns; it is the second amendment you know. and as far as the use of modern language goes, none of those westerns people have waxed nostalgic about actually used language that was consistent with the era depicted. americans had different accents, used different inflections, spoke at a very different pace and used plenty of words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today. don't blame historical inaccuracy for the fact that you just didn't dig it. be honest. maybe you're just uncomfortable with what you're seeing.
