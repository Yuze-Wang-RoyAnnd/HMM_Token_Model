after a series of power-outages on a remote island zoo, genetically engineered sabertooth tigers are on the loose and mauling residents of the island. man, the sci-fi channel has made some bad "original" movies, but i think this might possibly be their worst so far! this badly written and directed "jurassic park" rip-off offers all the usual clich'es (mad scientists who thinks people killed by the monsters are "expendable losses", characters walking down long dark hallways alone, brain-dead teen characters who's only function in the film is to die a horrible death, etc.), and, unsurprisingly, no suspense whatsoever. the special effects are atrocious
