i think that elisabeth rohm, though she may try hard, is not very good at all. i guess it was because of budget that she may have been the only one they could get for that price. i mainly watched it for the performance of myron natwick, whose work i know very well.<br /><br />he was the most believable and without doubt the most compelling to watch. when he wasn't on the screen, the thing went dead. this was filmed in vancouver. he gave me the creeps, but be assured that in real life he is a kind, funny compassionate man. he even said playing that role gave him the creeps.<br /><br />i'll watch anything with him in it, but elisabeth rohm - never again. she was as exciting as lint on law and order. maybe a very nice person, but no actress.
