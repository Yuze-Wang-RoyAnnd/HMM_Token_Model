contrary to most other comments about "syriana" on the imdb web-site, i and my family found watching this film on dvd at home a complete waste of time and space.<br /><br />in short, this was a film based on a script whose writer was being too clever by far. rather than trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear manner, it was assumed that constantly throwing mostly vague and hard to connect with each other 30-second vignettes of different story-lines from a dozen or so "story-lines" at the audience made for great and clear viewing. no, sir, it does not. what does make for great viewing is total clarity, precision, plots and story-lines - and characterisations - which have a beginning, a middle, and an end.<br /><br />this kind of cinematic presentation - akin to the dim sum experience in a chinese restaurant - is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme.<br /><br />thank goodness, then, for the tv and dvd presentations of the hollywood and british film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers, director, and actors knew the value of clear story telling, diction, and acting that meant something.<br /><br />this is one dvd that this family will not be sitting through again.
