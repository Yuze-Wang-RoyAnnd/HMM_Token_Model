does anything at all happen in this movie. there are only the bizarre short scenes where i didn't know what the hell was going on so that doesn't count. this movie is sooo boring it hurts, and this is coming from a person who likes it when movies are about making movies. confused?, well i was after watching this crap. what was donald sutherland on, because he missed it with this one completely. and what's with the "pedofile" scene at the beginning of the movie. can put anyone to sleep! 4/10
