labored comedy has i.r.s. agent tony randall investigating eccentric farm family in maryland who have never paid their taxes; debbie reynolds is the tomboy farmer's daughter who puts the squeeze on the not-so-disinterested tax-man. debbie certainly made her share of inferior theatrical sitcoms during this period--and this one's no better or worse than the rest. picture begins brightly but flags at the halfway point, becoming frantic and witless. randall isn't a bad match for reynolds, but the vehicle itself defeats the chemistry. based on the novel "the darling buds of may" by h.e. bates, with a poor sound-mix causing all the actors to sound as if they're stuck in an echo chamber. ** from ****
