i watched this film because i noticed that it had kari wuhrer in the cast. i have long had a theory about her, that she is a talented actress, but never seems to get to prove that, because she is always in this sort of low-budget b movie. she is still beautiful, and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material i always see her in. this is no different. the film is often ugly and disturbing, but that doesn't make it good. george wendt played against type, and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role. another note about ms. wuhrer. her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since i saw her last. perhaps reduction surgery, or (more likely) removal of implants. this not a bad thing. she still looks great. i would like to see her in a better movie.
