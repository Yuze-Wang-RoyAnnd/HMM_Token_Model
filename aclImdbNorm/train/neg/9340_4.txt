what a wasted cast.<br /><br />this is one of the most disappointing films i've seen.<br /><br />usually roger ebert does not let me down, but i feel cheated after seeing this movie.<br /><br />the only thrill is seeing elizabeth banks in her bra. that is a sorry statement about this movie. it held so much promise, but it was like dry humping a transvestite.<br /><br />this is self absorbed tripe.<br /><br />i cannot express deeply enough my bitterness at having sat through this movie, and hope i can forewarn you of the same disappointment.
