that's what i found myself saying time after time in the remarkably inept 3rd act of this sorry excuse for a film. first off, the computer effects are absolutely mind-blowing! those computer wizs' really deserve a pat on the back. the rest of the movie, though...<br /><br />none of the characters act in a realistic manner, especially in the aforementioned, despicable 3rd act (i promise i won't give it away, but trust me, it's not worth keeping a secret!). a lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally, like when they try to explain that an invisible man's eyelids don't work. please, give the viewers more credit than that!!!<br /><br />some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. what would you do, after all, if you were invisible? no one could catch you! these issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic the invisible man from 1933. there is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous, and is not mentioned once later on. if more attention had been paid it, kevin bacon's mad scientist might have made a little more sense. <br /><br />the movie would actually be much more successful as a porno, since the premise could actually be carried out in a unique and interesting manner. but this piece of work... go see something else. or don't, and live with the consequences!<br /><br />3/10
