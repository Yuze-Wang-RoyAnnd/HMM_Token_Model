they had such potential for this movie and they completely fall flat. in the first cruel intentions, we are left wondering what motivated the lead characters to become the way they are and act the way they do. there is almost no character development whatsoever in this prequel. it's actually a very sad story but this film did nothing for me. it was as if they left out good writing in place of unneeded f-words. and the end makes absolutely no sense and doesn't explain anything. the writing was just terrible. another thing that bothered me was that they used at lease 3 of the exact same lines that were in the original. such as "down boy", or the kissing scene, and a few others i can't remember. i was not impressed at all by robin's acting, but amy did a great job. that's about the only thing that reconciled this movie.
