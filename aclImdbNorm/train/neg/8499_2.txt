this is the sort of thing that only now thrills the film eggheads. after all, feierstein's flex crush will have you know that real men don't watch anything by truffaut. <br /><br />it might have been interesting if truffaut had anything to -say- here. the camera-as-voyeur motif was nothing new. have we all forgotten de sica's "bicycle thief"? or anything by hitchcock?<br /><br />so all we get is the extended metaphor of the juvenile as truffaut, who spends all his free time 'screwing up his eyes' at the movies, who wrecks schoolroom discipline, gets accused of plagiarism(the many petty thefts), and ultimately escapes societal confines to make 'his own movie'. sorry...been there, done that too many times for this to matter.
