....because if i was, i may have wished it was me being crucified on a wooden cross! i'm still trying to determine the plot of this movie - and i'm being "generous" that there was even a plot to begin with. as previously mentioned, it's a misnomer on the cover of the dvd that richard dreyfuss is actually the star. he was barely in the movie. and if he was indeed "frustrated" as the back cover indicated he was, well, that's probably because he said yes to be in this disaster of a movie and couldn't get out of it! the movie really seemed to focus on jared martin, and what his role in the movie was supposed to be, other than the extreme close -ups, was not as big of a mystery as to what gene barry's role actually was - or wasn't. and speaking of "big"...whomever had the bright idea to fit gene barry in the humpty dumpty attire, which showcased his trousers literally pulled up to his chin, should be sentenced to hard time by watching this movie stoned sober. i could go on and on about how horrendous this movie was, from the dialogue not matching the "actors'" mouths (think clutch cargo), to the erratic jumping from scene to scene (again, being generous even calling the frames of pictures "scenes"), to the lack of a plot.... however, if you're into bad early 70s genre and if you're in a cottage in michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of kid & cat pictures, i recommend having a good bottle of wine before you embark on this weird ride of a movie because you'll be thankful that you may not remember it the next day!
