i think i've seen worse films, so i'm giving this a 3, but it's a struggle to remember what they could have been!! possibly xtro (nasty & dull) or possibly creep (just plain dull), but it is a struggle to think of something worse. it's difficult to know where to start. let's just say it's a poor man's under siege, starring an even poorer man's jean claude van damme. the only redeeming feature was seeing casper van dien - i always wondered what happened to him after starship troopers. yes, he was johnny rico, if you really want to know.<br /><br />judging from this site, he's been stuck in tv movie hell.... casper, be more selective.... please!!!!!!!!!!!! arghhhhh, i've just turned over and there's a half decent film on called criminal law...... now i'm beginning to get really resentful about the last 1.5hrs!!!
