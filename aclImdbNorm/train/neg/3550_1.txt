i run a group to stop comedian exploitation and i just spent the past 2 months hearing horror stories from comedians who attempted to audition for, "last comic standing." if they don't have a good agent, then they don't even get a chance to audition so more than 80% of the comedians who turn up are rejected before they can show anyone that they have talent! if they do make it to an audition, i was told that it's "pre-determined" if they get a second chance. so what the tv audience sees is not the best comics in the us.<br /><br />if the comics do make it to the show, then most of them don't get imdb credits. i know this because i did the credits for all 6 seasons of, "last comic standing" and i don't get paid for doing the producers' job. it's really a disgrace. a month ago, i asked, "last comic standing 7" on facebook why the producers aren't giving imdb credits and i was banned from their facebook page!!! i am not a comedian so i do not have a personal stake in this. i just want people to know the truth. i don't like seeing anyone getting exploited and that's why i've been helping the comedians. comedians get exploited on hbo, bet, tvone and other cable networks but nbc is a big three network so those in charge should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this exploitation to happen.<br /><br />please watch this video of a comedian who was victimized: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmb4-hyet_y
