i will spend a few days dedicated to ron howard before i swear off his work entirely. having, unfortunately, dealt with lucas at such a young age, howard is now caught up in so many of lucas' traits. how else do you explain his rampage of disasters? his only useful film, of course, has been 'willow'. everything else, including this, is too reliant on superficial junk.<br /><br />some spoilers.<br /><br />he can't even have semi-intelligent focus like peter weir. no, poor howard so stuck on his spielbergian knockoff qualities that he will be quickly forgotten. <br /><br />here we have the old adage: "love conquers all, even disease." too bad for howard that lynch already got through the whole subtext with more skill. heck, even disney did better than this. ron even goofs up on the possibilities presented by imagined realities.<br /><br />howard's commentary track is just awful. don't even rent the dvd.<br /><br />final analysis = = cinematic dud
