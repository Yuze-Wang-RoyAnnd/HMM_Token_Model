i have seen and liked the original film, and expected more from a remake than this.<br /><br />good: effects and makeup are good. no complaints about the score and visuals, they are adequate, and the performances were okay (tim roth was excellent, the other principals were fine, and a handful of the "supporting supporting actors" did very well with extremely limited roles). the action scenes were exciting and fun.<br /><br />bad: the escape from the ape city was terrible. the characters are going in circles, then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape. plus, what escape route leads through everybody's bedroom?<br /><br />the story was pared down to include as much action as possible. i like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respect.<br /><br />finally, the ending was completely nonsensical as presented. without seeing the inevitable sequel, there is no justification for it.<br /><br />
