professor paul steiner is doing research in matter transference. he has developed a machine that he can use to make an object like a wrist watch or rodent disappear, only to have that object re-materialize in a different location. but there are those at his research facility that do not like or approve of his experiments and will do whatever it takes to see that he doesn't succeed. after a failed demonstration that might have saved his funding, professor steiner decides to test his machine on himself. as expected, things go horribly wrong and he is transformed into a heavily scared madman whose mere touch will kill.<br /><br />in hindsight, maybe it wasn't such a good idea to re-watch the projected man in the same week i watched the fly, return of the fly, and curse of the fly. there seems to be only so many movies about matter transference and the potentially horrendous effects it can have on the human body that one person should be made to endure in a three or four day period. i'm not sure what those responsible for the movie list as their source material for the projected man, but much of it is so similar to the fly movies that it cannot be mere coincidence. however, the projected man isn't even nearly as good as the worst of the fly trilogy.<br /><br />besides being terribly unoriginal, the projected man has several other problems that really hurt the enjoyment of the movie. a big issue i have is with bryant haliday in the lead. he's such a horse's ass that, not only do i not care about his suffering, i actually root for it. supporting cast members mary peach and ronald allen are almost as bad. they're so bland and dull they hardly matter. in fact, there's very little to get excited about while watching the projected man. the soundtrack
