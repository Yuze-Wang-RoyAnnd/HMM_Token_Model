with a title like "attack of the killer tomatoes!", anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a) a bad science fiction movie or b) a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies. it's supposed to be a mix of both, with a dose of parody splashed in. unfortunately, it falls flat very soon.<br /><br />you're never supposed to take this movie seriously, i realize that, but you're supposed to think it's funny, right? i found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny (i.e, the side-by-side phone conversations, the russian olympic spy eating steroid cereal, superman walking by lois, etc.). "attack of the killer tomatoes" strives to be a cult classic, but it doesn't make it. a cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it (or a similar description). "attack of the killer tomatoes" could be enjoyed by any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor, so therefore, it does not qualify as a cult film.<br /><br />there is one good actress in the entire thing: sharon taylor as lois fairchild. she is a thin, gawky reporter, but has an endearing personality, loves to overact, and is a natural comedienne. unfortunately, she is put to bad use here.<br /><br />"attack of the killer tomatoes" is not as funny as, say, "amazon women on the moon" or "kentucky fried movie", but it does have a few hilarious moments, so i would still recommend seeing it once. avoid the director's cut, it has interruptions by the producer of the movie and some supposedly "lost" footage dubbed in a pretend african dialect (it can be found in english on the out of print tape).
