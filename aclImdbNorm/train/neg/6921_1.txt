i went to a prescreening of this film and was shocked how cheesy it was. it was a combination of every horror/thriller clich'e, trying to comment on many things including pedophilia, satan worship, undercover cops, affairs, religion... and it was a mess. the acting was pretty washboard; the kid and the jesus dude were alright, but apart from them.... anyways. i admire the effort (though slightly failed) on the attempt at showing the christian people in a different way...even though they did that, the way it presented the gospel was a bit stock and kiddish. but then again, it may have to be since he was talking to a little kid... no. actually, i've decided it's just all around bad. music... oh my gosh... horrible... toooo over-dramatic. okay. i felt bad for the people who made this movie at the premier; it seemed like a poor student project. i'm going to stop ranting about this now and say bottom line, go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on crap. there you go.
