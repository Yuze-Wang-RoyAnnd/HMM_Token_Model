this movie wasn't that bad when compared to the first two sequels to the original. it's directed by martin kitrosser of friday the 13th fame. the acting is very bad indeed, but the gore and special effects help make it interesting. thats one thing i like about screaming mad george (make up effects artist for the film), his effects are so off-the-wall and bizarre that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy they're gonna get. the movie isn't really all that gory, but there is an extremely nasty eyeball-munching scene in the middle involving a toy maggot (what!?!) mickey rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably wasn't too enthusiastic about but needed the money at the time, possibly? if you liked the weirdo 4th installment (my favorite of all 5), you'll probably like this one. i liked it better than the matrix! enjoy.
