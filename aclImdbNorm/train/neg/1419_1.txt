this is a horrible little film--and unfortunately, the company that made this short made several others. the short is essentially a one-joke idea that wasn't funny to begin with and may also offend you. it certainly made me uncomfortable watching very young children (most appeared about 2 years-old) cavorting about and pretending to be adults--in this case, a dancehall girl and bar room patrons. it's the sort of humor that you might be forced to laugh at from your own kids if they pretended to be adults, but i can't see anyone wanting to see this--especially when a very young shirley temple is dressed in a rather slinky outfit and acts like a vamp!! and then, other kids act like adults in some rather adult situations. at the time, i am sure they were not trying to appeal to pedophiles, but when looking at it today, that is what immediately comes to mind! because of this, this boring film also creeped me out and i hope to never see it again!! pretty strange and pretty awful.
