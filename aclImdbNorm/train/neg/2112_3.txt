bela lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife looking young and beautiful. to this end, he drugs brides during their wedding ceremonies to make it look as if they are dead so he can steal their bodies. i'm not exactly sure what he does with the bodies. i don't remember it ever being fully explained. all i know is that he extracts something from them and injects it in his wife. (i'll just guess that it's spinal fluid. spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 40s.) you can pretty much guess the rest from here.<br /><br />there are a couple (well, really more than a couple, but i'll only write about two) of problems that i have with this movie. one is the way bela is used. sure, he does a decent enough job in his own overacting sort of way (btw, the rest of the cast is simply abysmal). but, to have him hiding in the back of a hearse or having him creep into the female reporter's bedroom to do nothing is just silly. also, why have him beat and/or kill every henchman he has? is it to make him look evil? well, someone who is kidnapping comatose brides doesn't really need to be made to look more evil.<br /><br />the second problem i have is the idea of drugging brides. why brides? wouldn't any female under the age of 20 do? watching bela go through these gyrations to get his victims, i was reminded of the idiotic fisherman in i still know what you did last summer. in each case, there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective than employing a seemingly impossible plan that depends way to much on circumstances out of your control. (btw, an alternate title for this movie is the case of the missing brides. i guess that partially explains the need for 'brides'.)
