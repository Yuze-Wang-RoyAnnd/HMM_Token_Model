since this picture is classified a "pure entertainment" work and since there are already many comments on it, i'd like hereby to address something relevant to the abuse of humour. we can see that marlon wayans is playing the joker role in this film. certainly as long as he has been involved in the casting job, he has always been acting as a little man-an actor can change his customary dress but can hardly change his physical appearance-and the latter one can be an advantage when necessary. however far away from what i expected, i saw an image very disguising, pretending to expose different aspects of the baby life by mistake of a forty-year- old criminal. and with a ridiculous happy ending. so what is the point? many elements are mixed up, some principal ones are violence, sex and criminal activities, amongst which the story is badly composed and to some extent, lack common sense: where is vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and her husband's life being pursued? in addition the diamond is even bigger than the world's no.1 cullinan! but the most sickening facet is the continuous attempt to make up the little man as a superman by showing his physical weak points. and they call it humour. a diamond is precious, hard and fragile; it cannot be cut by any other material but only be conquered by the hot blood of a male goat. hence it's no more a diamond but pieces of debris.
