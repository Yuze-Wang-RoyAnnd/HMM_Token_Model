there are two kinds of characters on the shield: people who try to do the best they can and do the right thing, and people who relentlessly pursue their own self interest and commit every mortal sin they can while telling themselves and everyone else that they are heroes, and everyone's only hope. more than any other show, the shield is about hypocrisy and self-delusion. unfortunately, the hypocrites and self-deluders are the shows heroes, and as such have the typical genre-fiction heroes' improbable immunity to getting defeated or caught and they come out on top over and over again, making fools out of all of their peers.<br /><br />the show boasts excellent camera-work. the lead ins and the fade outs are always superb. it really is a work of art to see. unfortunately the story is a cartoony, overwrought wish fulfillment scenario of gratuitous violence, rape, and lies.<br /><br />the hero, who drags everyone down with him in failed scheme after failed scheme, is wiley like a warner bros cartoon character, always escaping and making fun of all the elmer fudds (anyone who does not support him in his lies and crimes), automatically attracting any good looking woman supporting character to come on the show, always surviving any attempt to bring him to justice, and always scraping your ears with his excruciating self justifications. if another cop detects something wrong with something he's doing, and someone gets hurt because of his actions, he always blames the suspicious cop, regardless of the fact that his schemes and elaborate lies and doomed plans are always the cause. every time.<br /><br />like 24, this show relies on contrivances and innumerable delays to drag its story out for season after season. boring, unbelievable long term stories are injected into the storyline every season to provide a skeleton on which to hang the bloody, perverted chunks of meat that are the characters' corrupt acts and the inevitable cover-ups.<br /><br />most disappointing though, is the writers' hubris as they try to change the viewers' sympathies back and forth, to and away form the characters on whims. sometimes, they want us to see shane as the enemy. sometimes they want us to see him as a poor misunderstood soul. sometimes they want us to see vic as a dangerous, sexual dynamo. sometimes they want us to see him as a poor guy with a heart of gold. sometimes they want us to see mara as a low down vile jezebel. then they think that if they show her sitting and talking over her dreams with shane, that we will find her to be sympathetic and tragic.<br /><br />none of this manipulation is adequate to obtain the kinds of sympathies they want. once they've shown these characters ruin other people's lives for their own ends, that's it. it is nonsense to keep trying to flip back and forth. but then, it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these bumbling clowns drawing every super model in existence to their beds and running a crime syndicate right out of the police station, right under everyone's noses.
