most college students find themselves lost in the bubble of academia, cut off from the communities in which they study and live. their conversations are held with their fellow students and the college faculty. steven greenstreet's documentary is a prime example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members.<br /><br />the documentary focused on a small group of individuals who were portrayed as representing large groups of the population. as is usual, the people who scream the most get the most media attention. other than its misrepresentation of the community in which the film was set, the documentary was well made. my only dispute is that the feelings and uproar depicted in the film were attributed to the entire community rather than the few individuals who expressed them.<br /><br />naturally it is important to examine a controversy like this and make people aware of the differences that exist between political viewpoints, but it is ridiculous to implicate an entire community of people in the actions of a few radicals.
