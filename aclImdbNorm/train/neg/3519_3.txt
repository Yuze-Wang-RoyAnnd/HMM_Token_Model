there are some stallone movies i like, but this movie didn't meet my low expectations. i found this movie hard to believe. for example, a bunch of terrorists who crash land in the wilderness are prepared to survive for at least two days. also, in all this wilderness stallone and company keep running across bridges and ladders that provide convenient short-cuts or plot devices. also, the treasury cops don't seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people. also, bad guys who couldn't hit the side of a barn with really high-tech looking automatic weapons.<br /><br />i liked john lithgow's villain initially, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesn't care at all about any of his own bad guys, or all of them getting killed. eventually i just couldn't believe the character anymore.<br /><br />not worth the price of a rental, not even worth taking the time to watch.
