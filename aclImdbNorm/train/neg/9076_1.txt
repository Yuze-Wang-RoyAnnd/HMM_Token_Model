this was surely the stupidest, crudest, most repulsive film i have seen in quite some time. i was tempted to turn off the vcr, but, as in the fascination watching a horrible car accident, i literally found it compulsively hateable in every conceivable way and slugged it out through to the end. i am by no means a prude who objects to the comedic portrayal of sexual antics on the screen. animal house, porky's, there's something about mary, both american pie movies, and even the notorious freddy got fingered i have found highly enjoyable on their own crude terms. mamie van doren's breast-baring sponge bath is the most horrifying appearance by a naked geriatric since the shining. ineptly edited and shot, with incredibly annoying performances from devon sawa and jason schwartzman, the film ended, without the benefit of having made me giggle once. the only useful purpose for the film is as a textbook example of how not to make a gross out picture. oh, and it would also serve nicely as a lawn fertilizer.
