some nice scenery, but the story itself--in which a self-proclaimed egyptologist (lesley-anne down) visits egypt and, in the course of doing egyptologist things in the most un-egyptologistic of ways (e.g., flash photography in the tombs, the handling of old parchment, etc.), uncovers a black market turf war and somehow (in the span of two days, no less!) becomes that war's jumpsuit-wearing epicenter--is more puzzling than any riddle the sphinx ever posed. down is simply awful as the visiting british scholar (that she seems to know absolutely nothing about the culture of egypt and even less about antiquities is the fault of the writers, certainly; but that she's annoying as all get out is her own fault entirely), and the rest of the cast, including sir john gielgud and frank langella, seem as downright confused by the proceedings as i was. in short, not what you'd expect from schaffner (planet of the apes, patton) and co.<br /><br />worth watching for a laughably dated scene in which down rails against all male scholars, blaming them for her failure as an academic, while bathed under the softest light hollywood could muster. to top it off, she spends the next hour of the film shrieking and harried and running into the arms of any dude she can find. wow, talk about your performative irony!<br /><br />*note to would-be egyptologists: take a year or two of arabic in grad school. it'll really help out in the long run...
