with nothing better to do i decided to check out "aztec rex" (as it was being billed) for the hell of it.<br /><br />the silly story might have played better if the dinosaur effects were convincing. they actually looked like animatics (those rough designs that artists later use to finish the cgi effects, adding more details, smoother movements, etc.) absolutely awful-looking dinosaurs, which is the only reason you'd probably want to sit through this anyway.<br /><br />the one redeeming factor was the lovely dichen lachman as ayacoatl. she kept my interest; if only the budget had been ramped up and some convincing dinosaurs could have been used.<br /><br />disappointing. at least the cast and crew got a free trip to hawaii, where the movie was filmed.
