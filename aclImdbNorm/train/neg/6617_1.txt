truly shows that hype is not everything. shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife. amitabh as always is solid. ajay devgan as always is shitty and useless and the new guy is a joke. the leading lady is such a waste of an actor. such pathetic movie from such a revered director and from such a big industry. with movies as such i have decreased the amount of bollywood movies i watch.<br /><br />rgv has been making very crappy movies for a while now. time to get different actors. hrithek anyone? bollywood needs madhuri and kajol back. every other leading lady is a half-naked wanna be. pffffft.
