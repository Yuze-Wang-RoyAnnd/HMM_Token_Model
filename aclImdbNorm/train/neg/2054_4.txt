in cold blood was one of several 60s films that created a new vision of violence in the hollywood film industry. capote coined the phrase "nonfiction novel" to describe the book on which this film is based, and the spirit of that form was carried over into the film script, which he co-wrote. despite the fact that we were well into the era of color film, richard brooks elected to present this film in black and white to underscore both the starkness of the landscape and the bleakness of the story. this is the first problem with the tv remake --color changes the tone of the story. in addition, the confinement of shooting a film for tv makes reduces the options of how the shots are framed and focused. as a result, we lose the dramatic clash which makes the second part of the original film (police interviews, trial, imprisonment, and execution) so claustrophobic. on the small screen, it's just another version of law and order spin-offs. <br /><br />hollywood's search for scripts continuously takes it back to movies that were successful in another age. usually, that's a mistake, and this is no exception.<br /><br />all of the actors are competent. the script is ok. the directing doesn't get in the way. it's just that the movie doesn't work as well as the original precision instrument. it doesn't hook the viewer into the ambivalence toward smith and hickock that the original film provokes. at the end of the tv version, we are left with the feeling: "ho hum, who cares?"<br /><br />see the original first, on as large a screen as you can, then watch the tv version simply to understand why the first one was such an important film in 1967.<br /><br />wouldn't hurt to also go on line and read a bit about capote and the original book. it will help you to understand the extraordinary effort he put into the material, and also some of the controversy surrounding both the book and the movie.<br /><br />i actually only gave this a 4 because i save the bottom 3 rankings for true bombs--the kind that enrage you about having been sucked into spending an
