i never actually thought that a film could be so atrocious, but alas i was wrong. terrible acting, terrible plot, terrible effects. the crocodile was awful and as for the stupid sex/killing scene all in one, that was a bad move from the word go. it was truly shocking and that is not a compliment! how can someone make this film, watch it back and then actually say "yeah, thats a good movie. people will watch that" if you haven't seen it i beg you don't bother :-(
