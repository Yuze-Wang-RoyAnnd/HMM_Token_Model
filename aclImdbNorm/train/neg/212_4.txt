closer to reality and containing more depth than "breakdance", stan lathan's "beat street" is still a pretty dull show. again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in queens, new york. each has their own unique talent. one is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer.<br /><br />lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though, and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters. therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day.<br /><br />choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, but this alone is not enough to lift ""beat street" to greater heights. unfortunately the film really falls flat late on, after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting.<br /><br />sunday, august 25, 1996 - video
