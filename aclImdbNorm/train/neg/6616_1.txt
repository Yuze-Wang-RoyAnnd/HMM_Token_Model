i must tell you right up front, i am certainly not an authority on bollywood films and have only seen a handful. however, if you've never seen one, don't start with this one! i have greatly enjoyed the ones i've seen up until this one, but i just couldn't stand this one. i also must tell you up front that i could not finish this film--it was that annoying. so why was it so annoying? <br /><br />1. there is a character named 'rambha' in the film. he is even more annoying than jar-jar binks--which i never would have believed would have been possible. he is so #@^!# annoying!! he spoke in a falsetto voice and i think was meant to be comic relief. instead, he just grated on my nerves and wanted him to die...slowly! his voice, his mannerisms and his obnoxiousness--he just didn't seem to shut up and dominated every scene he was in--and he needed to die! <br /><br />2. the heroes had the amazing ability to dodge ak-47 bullets with ease. i kid you not--there was a scene where several unarmed guys took on a small army of guys with these assault rifles!! and, again and again, they avoided taking a single bullet and beat up the ruffians!!! this made stallone's actions in "rambo ii" look mundane!! <br /><br />3. the film was so gosh-darn loud, in your face and intense--it practically made my brain bleed!! it was as if the film were made by people under the influence of meth!! crazy camera angles, intense music and action, action, action...this movie is clearly designed for someone who can't take a movie with plot and wants nearly 100% action.<br /><br />4. the two main characters and their actions and motivations made zero sense...none whatsoever! <br /><br />perhaps if you are the most ardent action and bollywood fan you can stand this film, but as for me i can see why it's on imdb's infamous bottom 100 list. wow...this film is bad and intensely bad!!
