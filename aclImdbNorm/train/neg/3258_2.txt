doc savage: the man of bronze (1 outta 5 stars)<br /><br />dreadful, dreadful movie... based on the pulp magazine/paperback series by lester dent/kenneth robeson... about a super-heroic adventure hero in the '30s and his five assistants, all experts in some field of endeavor that allows them to combat evil. it was a pretty hokey series... but kinda fun to read when i was a teenager. i knew they made a movie version in the '70s, starring ron (tarzan) ely... but i never got a chance to see it. it never played in theaters where i lived and was never shown on tv. now that i have finally seen the film i can understand why. the plot and characters are never treated seriously... it's all kind of tongue-in-cheek and campy... kind of like the old batman tv series... only without the benefit of being funny... or having any visual flair. corny dialogue, cheesy special effects, dumb stereotypes, crummy action scenes and bad, bad acting. actually, i find it kind of fascinating in its badness... what could they have possibly been thinking? arnold schwarzenegger was rumoured to be starring in a modern-day remake... but i don't imagine that would have turned out to be much better.
