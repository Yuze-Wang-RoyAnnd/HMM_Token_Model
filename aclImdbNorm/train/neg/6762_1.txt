this is the kind of film that everyone involved with should be embarrassed over. poor directing, over the top acting and a plot that rambles on with no point other than to show violence. i thought when i first saw it that it would be perhaps a satire of the media and how it shows violence but it's not. i'm not sure what makes the film worse. oliver stone does his worst directing ever. from scenes where woody harrelson's face morphs for no reason or robert downey jr's dreadful performance as wayne gale who is a reporter who seems totally bonkers, this movie is simply a mess.
