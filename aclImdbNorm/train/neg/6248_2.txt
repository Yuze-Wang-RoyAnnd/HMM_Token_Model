something very strange happens when you talk about global warming: science goes out the window and "belief" and "consensus" becomes the topic of discussion.<br /><br />it's because of that fact that i give a failing mark to al gore's documentary.<br /><br />instead of promoting intelligent discussion, he kept the debate at the level of "belief" and "consensus".<br /><br />of course, when you're trying to sell the world into spending trillions of dollars to "stop global warming" you may thing it's a problem to tell the scientific truth: we don't know how much of the current warming was caused by humans. maybe none of it, maybe some of it, or maybe it has over-ceded the next ice age and we got really lucky not to have boiled the planet.<br /><br />but the fact remains that we don't know.<br /><br />so we're asked to "believe" in the "consensus". never mind that any scientist that strays from the "consensus" is ostracized. never mind that scientific inquiry is about straying from the consensus. einstein didn't "believe" in the consensus, neither did copernicus or galileo.<br /><br />so why so much scorn placed on those very researchers who would advance the field by asking the tough questions? if global warming is so incontrovertible, surely a few people testing that theory can't be so threatening.<br /><br />what is going on here? that's the movie i was hoping al gore would have made. istead, he chose to shore up his support with the true "believers" of the "consensus".<br /><br />sad, really.
