after reading some very good reviews about this film i thought i would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film i thought i would give it my own review. this is my first ever so bare with me.<br /><br />first of all i would scratch horror from the genre as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest (with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me.) i would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as i wasn't particularly thrilled either! the film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times. during these times she visits a house which she has been drawing, after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality. as she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in. until she adds her constantly away father to the house, due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches.<br /><br />think its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of a nightmare on elm street but is more like a trip to the beach.<br /><br />in conclusion my generous 3/10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab!
