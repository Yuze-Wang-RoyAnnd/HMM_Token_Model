unbelievable!<br /><br />this film gets a 7 out 0f 10. this has to be one of the worst films i have seen in years. not only was the acting incredibly bad, the storyline (if you can call it that) was just as bad. offcourse everyone knows what's going to happen within the first 5 minutes. which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience during leading up to that moment. that however, is not the case. there is no action, no suspense, not even a spark between the 2 leading actors. it was unfortunately a waste of my time, and certainly a waste of my money. <br /><br />and the 2 of merely for trying
