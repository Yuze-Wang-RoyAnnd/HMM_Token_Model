this movie was awful and an insult to the viewer. stupid script, bad casting, endless boredom.<br /><br />in the usual tradition of hollywood, the government of the us is shown as always evil. the communist-sympathizer nitwits in hollywood, most of whom are as dumb as a box of rocks, love taking the lone nutcase eugene mccarthy and picturing him as the leader of a vast movement. the truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the soviet communists for political gain.<br /><br />oh yeah, and the us brought over all those evil nazis. like werner vonbraun, without whom we would have no space program. he actually loved being american and became a great asset to the country.<br /><br />and yet the irony is that the fools in hollywood, an uneducated lot who live a fantasy existence, still believe that the government should run everything and give us all what we want. and yet, this is the same government that they continually portray as a consummate evil in films like this.
