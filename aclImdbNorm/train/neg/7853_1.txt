no plot, crappy acting, and pointless gore....<br /><br />this is supposed to be a horror movie? there's no fear, or suspense, just boom bang gore, then done. some kinda marines are in the desert for some weird, crappy reason and they get hunted down by those mutated beasts from the first movie, which was good, and should have been left it at that.<br /><br />this is just another excuse for money, and use of pointless violence, just like the "saw" sequels. they know no matter how pointless the plot is, and the more gore they can add, people will see it. i miss good suspenseful horror movies. come on hollywood, you can do much, much better.
