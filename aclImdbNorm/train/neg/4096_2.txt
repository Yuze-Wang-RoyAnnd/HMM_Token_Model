this was a classic case of something that should never have been. gloria was now a single mother, her husband had left her because she wouldn't live in some commune with him (he was mad that reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society). right then and there i had problems with the series - come on, i say to myself, is this the same noble michael stivic that countered archie bunker's right winged philosophies? the series went on, but it just didn't have any pizazz. whatever momentum sally struthers gained from all the family was long gone. maybe, if the series had been given another name and presented as being totally independent of all in the family, it might have worked out. ah well, that's show business.
