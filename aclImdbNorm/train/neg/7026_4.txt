on his birthday a small boys tells his mother he is not her son, and that he wants to go home to his real mother.<br /><br />in some ways comedy de l'innocence feels like it comes from a different time of movie-making, perhaps the 60's or 70's. certainly it reminded me of losey's secret ceremony (1968), and richard loncraine's full circle (1977), both of which deal with loss, grief and relationships between parents and 'lost' children (curiously both films star mia farrow).<br /><br />all three films are populated with unsympathetic characters who behave in strange and unexplained ways. all three films have a chilly feel, both emotionally and literally. all three films focus on mother-child relationships, and ultimately all three films pose the question - 'what is real, what is imagined?' <br /><br />beautiful but flawed, it offers no easy answers and leaves much hanging, unexplained and strange.
