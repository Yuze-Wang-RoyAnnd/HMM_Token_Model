this film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities, it's like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula 1 grand prix (not i might add, the us grand prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win), that is how far short this film falls. now don't take this the wrong way, i love b-movies, around half my collection is made of b-movies but i don't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film is.<br /><br />first of the story (for a b-movie) isn't that bad, it has potential there to make a b-movie brand, were not talking friday 13th potential, but potential none the less. but what really lets this film down is the acting, at not one second do i believe anything, it's like watching qvc except the presenters on qvc tend to have a heavier tan.<br /><br />in summary i'd like to say i've seen worse films, but i can't.
