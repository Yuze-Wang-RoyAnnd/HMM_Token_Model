towards the end of the movie, i felt it was too technical. i felt like i was in a classroom watching how our navy performs rescues at sea. i liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers. i guess i should have figured that out before, but i never thought about it. using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic. the acting was pretty good, since they're mostly seasoned professionals, but if you're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen, it should be more like a fantasy, comical, etc. everything was taken too seriously. at least the movie had felix ungar as pilot, with buck rogers, the night stalker, and dracula also on board. the movie was filled with well known faces. i understand that hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama, but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature. that's why i said it should have been more comical. my pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about. they walk around with drinks, setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later, just as if they're in a building or something, and acting as if turbulence just doesn't exist. also, i know it's a disaster movie, but suspense doesn't have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something. anyway, the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after it's first screening. i like lee grant, but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked...:)
