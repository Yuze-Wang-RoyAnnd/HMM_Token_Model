when i saw the previews for this movie, i didn't expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie. but wow, this movie was absolutely awful. and that's being generous.<br /><br />first of all, the casting for the movie was terrible. you feel no sympathy (or for that matter any morbid feeling) for the characters. the acting was so terrible that i was just simply waiting and hoping for the god-awful thing to end.<br /><br />secondly, there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever. can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts screaming "pancakes!!!" at the top of his lungs while going into jackie chan moves i've never seen before, and even further biting the guy who has the virus? why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus-infected guy, and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him? i was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that i literally said out loud, "where the hell did that come from?"<br /><br />i just simply couldn't believe what i had seen. i really thought i had seen some bad movies, but i have to say that cabin fever tops them all. this movie made me want to puke and then puke again. then blow my brains out.<br /><br />please, save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive. watching grass grow, perhaps, is a proper alternative.
