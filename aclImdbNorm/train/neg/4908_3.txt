this movie is supposed to be taking place in and around seattle. the, why is porteau cove p-r-o-v-i-n-c-i-a-l park shown? provincial parks are in canada, and not the united states. the inspector uses a palm pilot complete with stylus to 'read' that someone has hacked into the computer of the bridal shop. i did not know that this was possible using a database storage device. a woman appears in the movie without any introduction and is never introduced. we learn half-way into the movie that this woman works in the district attorney's office. then, in the correctional center a guard actually precedes jenks through a door and keeps his back to the offender!! this would never happen in a real correctional setting. the director really messed on this one -- this doesn't happen in real life. the acting is adequate. the plot is good. the cinematography is good. however, the many errors found in the continuity lead to a 3 out of 10 vote.
