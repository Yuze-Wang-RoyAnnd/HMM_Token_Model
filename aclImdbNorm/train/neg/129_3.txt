i am curious is really two films in one - half of it is the sexual experimental side of lena and the other half is her curiosity with political/socialism. whatever the director's intention, the two don't really mesh together. the director should have just stuck with the romantic side of lena and made a separate movie for the politics. there is a bizarre mixture of political/war rallies, dr. king, serious political interviews, flopping breasts, and pubic hair. the film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie. other than the interesting sex scenes, you'll be bored dry watching this film. unlike many other reviewers, i think the nude/sexual scenes are overdone for what it is. if you want to see real porn, i'm sure there are better choices. the pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is. i think the cast did a fine job however. they played their parts believably. there is little of the over-the-topness i'm so used to seeing in the american films during this time.
