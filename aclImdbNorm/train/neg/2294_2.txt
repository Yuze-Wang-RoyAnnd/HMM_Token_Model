poor paul mercurio. after landing the role of scott hastings in strictly ballroom, the best film in history, he managed to find himself doing a lot of rubbish. none of the characters in this film is very unlikable, or even hateable, but mercurio's lead is the sort of person you prefer to ignore - completely unloveable and he wears overalls. big mistake in costume design, that one.
