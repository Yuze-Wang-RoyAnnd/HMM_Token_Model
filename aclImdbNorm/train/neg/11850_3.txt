"rival reporters pat morgan (ginger rogers) and ted rand (lyle talbot) are always trying to out-scoop each other on stories. the latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment. the two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />this said-to-be follow-up to "the thirteenth guest" has little to do with the earlier movie; it is not a sequel, as has been inferred. ms. rogers continues to develop her skills. mr. talbot adds a little humor to his characterization. they are a pleasant team, the plot is interesting and mysterious; but, the resulting film is very dull. the opening and closing are startling. a long-winded wrap-up of plot development points follows the climax.<br /><br />*** a shriek in the night (1933) albert ray ~ ginger rogers, lyle talbot, harvey clark
