despite the excellent cast, this is an unremarkable film, especially from the aviation perspective. it may be somewhat better than the egregious "von richthofen and brown" but not by much. "blue max" remains the best of a small market over the last 35 years while "darling lilli" is fun if not taken seriously. it's interesting to speculate what ilm could do with zeppelins and gothas in a new, high-quality ww i aero film.
