i had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on danish television yesterday. first of all, i wanted to see gina lollobrigida - and here i wasn't disappointed. she looked gorgeous. second of all, through reading about the film i had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in philippe de broca's films. on this account, however, i was sadly disappointed. i found the jokes predictable (apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war) and the characters completely one-dimensional. also, the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion, with no sense of drama at all. i kept watching until the end, but i got bored very quickly and just sat there, waiting for the scenes with lollobrigida.
