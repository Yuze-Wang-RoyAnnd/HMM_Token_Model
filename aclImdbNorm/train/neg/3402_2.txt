here's why the jane show won't work. once again canadian bonehead producers and writers can't create a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it. i guess these people don't watch a lot of t.v. from the u.s. which has the sitcom model down pat. no, here we have to do something different, we have to make the a story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful b story to try to make up for it. the characters are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top: forklift races??? give me freaking break. here's a little advice for the writers of the show, don't write funny situations, find the funny in situations. and remember, you have to be born with a sense of humor to write truly funny stuff, not just be an improv monkey.
