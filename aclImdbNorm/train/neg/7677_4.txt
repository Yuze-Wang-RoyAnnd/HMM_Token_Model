i stopped watching lost at this episode because i thought ana-lucia and libby's deaths were unnecessary and really depressing. then i found out that they kept libby around just to die in the next episode! gah! i can't handle it.<br /><br />i liked this show for the first season, but it definitely declined in the second season, i found jack and locke's little religious feud to be annoying. the deaths of rodriguez & watros' characters was the final straw! <br /><br />i give this episode a 4/10, for being the end to my viewing of this formerly great series created by alias legend j.j. abrams. i hope his series in the future will improve on this one.
