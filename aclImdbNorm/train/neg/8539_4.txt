this engaging (which it shouldn't be) low-grade spanish exploitation (quite tame i might add) looks good, but huh? let me phrase that again 'huh?'. actually the word 'huh?' would be going through your mind quite a lot. nothing makes sense, nor does it try too. i just don't know if its complicatedly cryptic or just a convoluted muddle, but there's no denying how laconically uneventful, strange and wordy it feels.<br /><br />unrelated sequences tied (like that nasty opening involving a little girl, dead cat and fire) in to a sparse story involving photographer mario (played by a chest-puffing john caffari, who's mustache is a dead ringer for nintendo's iconic mario. what's the odds?) that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady (a gorgeously fixating patty shepard) who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment, where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witches.<br /><br />look past the unhinged plot structure and wallow in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease. raul artigot directs few jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages, but for most part seems sporadically non-existent and unfocused just like his writing. ramon sempere's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away. however there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on. fernando garcia morcillo's hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created. the leads are capable, but there's also a sturdy bunch (the pick being v'ictor israel) of secondary performances.<br /><br />slow with little in the way of interest, but this dreamy set-up (that seems to go on and on) manages to keep you watching until its closing.
