i am ashamed to have this movie in my collection. the most redeeming factor to owning the dvd is the short film in the bonus features. my vote for this movie is a big fat zero. don't misunderstand, i'm a horror girl. but i want some meat behind the story, not to mention i prefer the evil to happen to humans, not to be tricked in to watching, what seemed like forever, clips of animal snuff. acts of brutality interrupt achingly long silence and poor acting. if i was forced to make a comparison to another film, the only one that comes to mind is cannibal holocaust. bad, boring, pointless and a wholly uncomfortable watch.
