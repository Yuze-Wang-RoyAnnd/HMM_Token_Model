star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning <br /><br />mcbain (played by gary busey, before the name became synonymous with the character in the simpsons) is a (typically) unorthodox cop who gets results but winds his superiors up something rotten. avoiding the clich'e of his partner being killed at the beginning of the film, the plot instead takes a different turn and sees him assigned to travel to mexico where a top secret american super tank with incredible firepower and imaging capabilities has been smuggled through, only to be taken hostage, along with the crew, by a gang of terrorists.<br /><br />this cheap looking (even by 80s standards), boring little action film was a bizarre career move for gary busey after making an impression as the flame haired villain mr joshua in lethal weapon. he just goes through the motions with his cardboard character here, edgy and zany as ever (with 'butthorn' being his trademark put down for the bad guys), but without the material to back him up. henry silva has presence as a screen villain, but he's totally miscast here as an arab leader (in a red beret!) and the awful script gives him some really clunky lines of dull dialogue that make his performance come off as laughably wooden. he's just one of a host of action film character actors, including l.q. jones and lincoln kilpatrick, who pop up but fail to add anything to the mix. after a dull first half without much exciting action, things do pick up a bit at the end, but it's too little too late and none of it manages the task of being any fun. *
