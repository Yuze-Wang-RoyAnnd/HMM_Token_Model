this movie is pretty awful but i have some interesting information about it:<br /><br />it was filmed in 1976 at northern arizona university in flagstaff, az, as well as at oak creek canyon near sedona, az. a good bulk of the extras in the film are then-drama students from nau. i was a freshman there that year, minoring in theatre, but for some reason i didn't get involved with the production. i did however know several people who did and can supply this rather odd fact:<br /><br />there is a scene in this movie where two of the principals, as part of their hazing ritual, have to run naked into the woods. they are seen from behind in the movie, doing just that. the thing is, those aren't the actors at all but two guys i knew from the theatre department. the identity of these "stunt posteriors" will remain anonymous, at least to this website, unless they decide to, um, "reveal" themselves!
