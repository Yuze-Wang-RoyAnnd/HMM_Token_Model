please, someone stop ben stiller from acting in any movie. write the studios, hell, write your local congressman even. i've gotten more laughs going to a funeral then i have watching any stiller flick. jack black tries to make something about a comedy about disappearing dog crap, and christopher walken, perhaps on of the greatest actors of his generation, simply looks embarrassed to be there. stiller is his unfunny self,but now even with someone to bail him out, proves that he is way overrated as a comic. it's no wonder why this movie tanked badly, and was available of the dollar movie theaters after only a handful of weeks. i warn you, and you must warn your friends, do not watch this flick, it is just awful, worst then gothika (personally, i'd never thought i'd say that), worst the plan 9, worst the ishtar, worst then the golden child. please hollywood, quit allowing ben stiller in your movies, he's not funny, he's a god awful actor, and he's bringing others down with him. the following film was ranked 1 because there are no negative scores allowed, so while the board says one, i'll give it a zero.
