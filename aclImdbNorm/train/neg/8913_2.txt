when i first tuned in on this morning news, i thought, "wow, finally, some entertainment." it was slightly amusing for a week or so... but we have to face it, these news reporters (if one can even call them that) have way too much "playing around" time.<br /><br />at first, i thought jillian was a breathe of fresh air. but seriously, this woman has got not the least bit of journalist in her. she is very unprofessional. she keeps on interrupting steve when he starts informing the viewers about a certain news report. it's just really become annoying to the point that i can't watch it anymore.<br /><br />jillian is not a good journalist. hell, she's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity. hence, she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she's supposed to be interviewing. she's not very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rightfully insatiable journalist- and that's all i can say about her.<br /><br />also (disappointingly), this show has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world, the government, the us, or something that will benefit and/or serve the public's best interest. they're too focus on sensationalism that everything they talk about comes off as a commercial product. on the other hand, their field reporters are interestingly tolerable...<br /><br />i believe "good day la" is for young teenagers and celebrities, and it is definitely not for people who actually care about the news.<br /><br />side note: (i'd really rather watch ktla. however, they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes. they're still a bit dull though. oh well, i'll stick to nbc's "today." abc's "good morning america" is also okay... as long as diane sawyer doesn't become way too serious.)
