i quote oedpius rex because it is a tragedy that this film was even made!!!<br /><br />this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen! i am in no way an uwe boll hater like most of the humourless people on imdb! <br /><br />uwe boll movies like postal and tunnel rats are hilariously bad and therefore entertaining. but honestly, this movie was just horrible. i hated it so much that i'd give it a zero star rating if i could. the story is just crap! it spends four fifths of the film building the plot and then they have the middle which is just scenes of grizzly horrible tastelessly done murder! the finally end it with a "villan wins ending" which is totally acceptable but surely it could have been more tasteful than this! <br /><br />i am not against uwe boll (like i said earlier) nor am i against violent movies! i f**king love violent movies! i loved the saw movies, the hostel movies, tokyo gore police, the new york ripper, the 28 movies, dog soldiers, my bloody valentine, last house on the left, watchmen, wolf creek, every tarantino movie, every sam peckinpah, even cannibal f**king holocaust! but this! omfg!!! <br /><br />this was just cruel, sadistic and perverted! and look at the movies i just listed! if i liked cannibal holocaust and not this then it must be bad! uwe, don't go all dark again! you're funny when you are light hearted, just like ed wood. this was just an awful experience! i felt horrible all over after seeing this!<br /><br />do not watch!!!! avoid at all cost!!!!!
