as a veteran of many, many pretentious french films i thought i'd taken the worst the industry had to offer and was able to stomach anything. but not this. pointless, relentless, violent, unpleasant, meaningless ... the film has nothing to offer and is random hatred and aggression dressed up as pretentious art. avoid at all costs.
