if you make it through the opening credits, this may be your type of movie. from the first screen image of a woman holding her hands up to her face with white sheets blowing in the background one recalls a pretentious perfume commercial. it's all downhill from there.<br /><br />the lead actress is basically a block of wood who uses her computer to reach into the past, and reconstruct the memories of photographs, to talk history's overlooked genius, ada, who conceived the first computer language in the 1800s.<br /><br />the low budget graphics would be forgivable if they were interesting, or even somewhat integral to the script.<br /><br />poor tilda swinton is wasted.
