the actors did a really good job playing their roles--particularly the mom. however, as the movie progressed i found i was watching it more for their acting and not because i cared in the least for the people. and, at times, i felt irritated by the irresponsible and hands-off approach to parenting displayed again and again. the daughter is a 17 year-old shallow skank whose main ambition in life is bedding famous men and becoming a dancing nyphette (complete with lots of "booty shaking"). the son is a guy with low self-esteem that seems very desperate for a relationship and friends--so much that he throws a drug party late in the film. the husband and wife are both bored, but rather than put energy into their stale relationship would rather seek out new partners (though the wife picks poorly, as the man she "throws herself at" happens to be gay---oops!). i just felt that all the characters needed to grow up and had a hard time caring for such shallow jerks. i think the author's attempt was to demonstrate the utter banality and hollowness of the capitalist system. however, given that these characters are not typical of the average western family, it seems disingenuous.
