lame movie. completely uninteresting. no chemistry at all between indiana jones and the guy from black hawk down. the car chase scene just goes on and on and on ad nauseum. they manage to switch vehicles a few times, but always end up right on the tail of the baddies. the scene where hartnett grabs the family's car with the crying kids in the back was just as stupid as could be. he is telling them about eastern philosophy and how it is all right to die, which i imagine the writers thought was funny or even witty. it just came off as moronic, totally unbelievable and even cruel.<br /><br />some subplots weren't even explored, they were just used as filler. why does hartnett get sick seeing dead bodies yet keeps ordering burgers at crime scenes? why, and on what grounds, is the bad ia guy suddenly arrested out of the blue by the chief? why can ia pick up the buddy cops and then just let them answer their phones or pretend to be indian mystics and then just let them waltz out of there without so much as a slap on the wrist? for some reason, even though ford is uncovered as a cheat and a fraud when acting as a realtor, (he makes up the prices when he is trying to sell the producer's house to jack up his own commission), they keep coming back to him anyway! they knew he lied to both of them! yet there they were, coming to terms that both said they would never go for. stupid, just stupid. this is also one of those cop movies where they just fire wantonly on public streets with no care in the world for innocent bystanders. there they were, just standing on the sidewalk blasting away while people ducked for cover. amazing that they didn't hit a single person after having fired about 60 rounds each....<br /><br />the scriptwriting was terrible, the action sequences were boring, the plot just a sidestory to a very pathetic attempt to have us root for ford and hartnett. it fails miserably. and ford's phone! turn the damn thing off! how many times could it ring in a 2-hour movie? 50? 60? it was frustratingly aggravating by the midpoint in the movie! every 30 seconds, that stupid tune would play! and if it wasn't ford's, then hartnett's was ringing! it was incredibly annoying!<br /><br />complete waste of time, ford's worst movie since 6 days 7 nights, which was without a doubt, the lowest point of his distinguished career.
