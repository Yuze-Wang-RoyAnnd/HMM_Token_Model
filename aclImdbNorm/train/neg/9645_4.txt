it's a bad season for bollywood with all the big releases with a massive hype surrounding proving to be duds at the box office. london dreams is no exception to that. let's dissect it... it's all about chasing your dreams and how far will you go to achieve it. sounds impressive right? but unfortunately the film is not.<br /><br />arjun (ajay devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to make it big someday. his dream is to perform in wembley stadium in front of a cheering 90,000 audience calling out his name. he is joined by two brothers, zoheb & wasim (debutants aditya roy & ranvijay) and a ravishing priya (asin). together they form "london dreams" their dream band. after impressing the chief of a record company, they become overnight sensations. arjun is secretly in love with priya which he doesn't want to reveal till he achieves his goal. arjun then brings his childhood friend manjit khosla aka mannu (salman khan), a carefree flirtatious guy who has got no ambitions in life, to join their band. mannu is a trained musician and a real talent for whom later arjun become envious for mannu's superior skills and his affair with priya. arjun with the help of zoheb plans to blight mannu. what happens next forms the rest of the movies.<br /><br />coming to the technical aspects, we feel only the shadow of vipul amritlal sha whom we have admired in namaste london. felt like he simply visualized the screenplay. to cut it short, a glorified cameraman. screenplay by suresh nair dulls even though it has its moments. defined in a predictable fashion, the screenplay bore you to stiff. camera work was awesome in capturing the beauty of london. it's the only entertaining part while watching songs.<br /><br />few songs are hummable while others are passable noisy fare. ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character. salman is monotonous and he irks you. asin is forgettable and i don't that she will make it big in bollywood. aditya roy is impressive while ranvijay is strictly ok. brinda as the bitch is what we have seen in innumerable movies. ompuri is ongoing with the proceedings. i don't want to pen down about the flaws as it will be a herculean task.<br /><br />finally let me put it simple and straight, london dreams is a soulless movie which you may better enjoy on dvd.
