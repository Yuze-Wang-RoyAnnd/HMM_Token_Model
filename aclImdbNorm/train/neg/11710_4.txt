there is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer: actress nichole hiltz. she is the show in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge. directed by simon gornick, the film stars joyce hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to seek revenge on her cheatin' spouse. oh, but not by conventional means. she plans a total guerrilla war and recruits bad girl nichole hiltz as her weapon of choice. she wants nichole (as tuesday) to get close to her ex (the handsome but dull stephan jenkins, who should stick to music) to embarrass him and ruin his life. david deluise is good in his few brief moments, and former "crime story" star anthony dennison is given virtually nothing to do but scowl. hiltz on the other hand comes off at various times as sexy and playful, then evil and devious. she also handles vulnerable and "maybe a bit psychotic" well. she's also quite hot (though there's no naughty bits show) so you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy she is aimed at. but the performance is kind of wasted in this movie, which is just not edgy or interesting enough to recommend.
