there are a number of problems with this movie, but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little. the base story is quite good, but the money just wasn't there to do the story justice. the non-existent budget really killed this movie. stuart gordon (the writer/director) has writing credit on 'honey, i shrunk the kids', which was a box office smash. however, that movie had some serious cash backing from disney. honestly, this is a good example of when to not make a movie. had he waited a few more years, technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects. (not to mention he could have found a company with money.)
