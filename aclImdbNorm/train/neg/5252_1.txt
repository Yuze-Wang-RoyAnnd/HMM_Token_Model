i read some comments on the internet about this film like "...harder then hostel...", "the camera never screens of when it's getting really brutal...". but none of them is true. the camera never screens of, because there is nothing to screen of. the same scene is repeated hundred and hundred times again. women lies on a table, killer rapes women a few times, killer cuts women into pieces (you never see this during the whole film!). police come and arrested him. killer fools the jury. film over. in germany we would say :"viel l"arm um nichts". all in all, one of the most boring films i ever see. absolutely non-recommendable.
