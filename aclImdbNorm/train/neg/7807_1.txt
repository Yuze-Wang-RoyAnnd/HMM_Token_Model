i picked this dvd up at the dollar store. the dvd was on the 2 for $1 rack, but since it had michael madsen in it, i thought that since i had never seen the movie, i bought it anyway.<br /><br />i must say that i didn't like the movie. the movie played more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else. i found that the director's use of flashbacks did not add to the story line for me. i would have preferred to view the story line in chronological order.<br /><br />i won't throw it away like one of the other commentators, but it may be quite awhile before i would consider watching this movie again.<br /><br />who knows, since it was michael madsen's film debut, maybe it might have some archival value at some future date.
