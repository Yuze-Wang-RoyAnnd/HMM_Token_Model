i'm a big fan of camp, but when every plot 'twist' is predictable and bad, while obviously not trying to be, even i lose interest. i was going to rate this a 3, but the ending dropped it a point easily. its only saving grace is that i hated other movies more. not enough beer in the world for this one.
