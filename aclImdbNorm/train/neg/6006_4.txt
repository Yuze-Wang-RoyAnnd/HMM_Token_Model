i didn't agree with any of the theology in the left behind series, but nonetheless i found the books gripping and i read 8 of 12 of them. undeniably good writing and interesting story. however, i didn't have very high expectations for the movie. there was no way mainstream hollywood would have taken up a christian series and produced a big-budget movie. so it was done independently... and it just felt like i was watching a really long tv show. it just didn't feel like a movie; it didn't have that movie "experience" to it, if anybody knows what i'm talking about. so the movie suffered because of that, and the low-budget, poor special effects were another detraction for me.<br /><br />on top of that, i feel that gordon currie was woefully miscast as nicolie carpathia. reading the book, my impression of nc was that he was supposed to be this charming, dazzling, amazingly handsome guy who spoke english with almost zero trace of an accent. so i imagined somebody like pierce brosnan in the role. instead, they found some clay aiken pencil-neck who looks like an employee of the month from best buy, and gave him a really bad fake accent. so that lost a few stars for me right there. a movie is just not convincing when the major villain doesn't look or sound the way he's supposed to.<br /><br />the acting was okay, but nothing to write home about. some of the scenes - like one of the conversion scenes (can't remember which one) - were real seat-squirmers for me. and some of the christian rock music or whatever it was, was really out of place for some of the scenes, like in the one with kirk cameron praying in the bathroom.<br /><br />in short, it wasn't a bad movie, but it just didn't do it for me. stick to the book, folks, it's much better.
