this would be a watchable hollywood mediocre if it had a good editing. it relies on the typical american thriller plot - "who is going to outsmart everyone". acting is below average, but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises. film was completely suffocated by blank video and sound shots and most of it looks like raw film material. all in all, if you don't mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project, this is a film to watch. i guess that would be enough to say on this film, everything else could really spoil the tension that is probably low enough.
