yet another movie about a group of less-than-intelligent individuals on a road trip who wander off their original travel route for either a short-cut or, in this case, to visit a run-down side show attraction. the results, as expected, are not at all good, as this particular side show is home to a bunch of lunatic, in-bred residents who were escaped prison inmates from years before. the father, who is apparently a professionally photographer, just has to stop and take pictures of the place, only to find that it still inhabited. the various members of the family wander off to view the various attractions, only to be scared away. thinking they made it safely on their way, the van tire explodes (surprise!), leaving them to seek refuge and accommodations in the small town, which we find out is inhabited solely by the freaks (surprise!).<br /><br />this film plays out as expected, with the family being stalked and killed by the freaks. there is some fighting back on the families part, but these are probably among the worst scenes in the film, as they are badly executed. there is nothing remotely original here, unless you count the totally inappropriate soundtrack that is played during particular scenes that completely ruins the atmosphere and mood of the film. the acting is about as bad as i have seen in quite some time by everyone involved (it is pretty bad when your cast is out-acted by the cast of "camp blood). the special effects are lousy and the ending made me want to punch my television.<br /><br />still, though, despite all the negatives, i somewhat enjoyed this film. it definitely has a "so bad it's good" vibe to it. i made it through the entire movie and was even pleasantly entertained once i got past the ridiculously clich'ed plot, terrible acting, and cheesy special effects. though the ending left me feeling cheated and angry, particularly because the film is not that great to begin with and the ending makes the entire film pointless.<br /><br />bottom line, i can list countless films that if you have seen them, you have seen this. the difference is most of those film are better. though not a complete waste, this film is pretty bad and not remotely scary.<br /><br />my grade: d
