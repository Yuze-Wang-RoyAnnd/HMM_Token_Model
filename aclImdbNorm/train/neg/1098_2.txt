i got this movie in the $5 bin at walmart. i would not recommend watching this move. i might give it to one of my friends if i am angry at them and want them to suffer for 2 hours.<br /><br />i looked at the cover and skimmed through the summary and thought it was a war movie. i wish i would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on. it was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie. it's just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another. the drill sargents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in vietnam.<br /><br />okay, here is my rant about this movie: to me, this movie is slow and hard to watch. it was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end. it doesn't. after the movie was over i through it behind my t.v. because i was angry that i wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching it, and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it.
