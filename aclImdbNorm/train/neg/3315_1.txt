bah. another tired, desultory reworking of an out of copyright work never designed to be filmed.<br /><br />on the plus side, toni collette is superb as always (being an actual actress, you see), and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between scenes. there are even a few genuinely funny lines, and the filmwork, score and editing is competent, apart from a bizarre lapse into voiceover and speaking to the camera towards the conclusion.<br /><br />but, ah, but. much of the cast seems to be on autopilot, and they are almost all very clearly too old (and in one case too young) for their declared ages. worse, they are all speaking "austinese", that peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that couldn't be further from the way people actually spoke in austen's day (think yosemite sam, i kid you not). this is particularly sad, considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally farcial "fakespearan" that olivier and his cronies were so fond of bellowing at the top of their lungs.<br /><br />and worst of all is gwyneth paltrow. she's only ever played one character in her films, and she stays true to form here, running through her entire range (smirking to sulking) in the first ten minutes, then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film. there is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers, nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart.<br /><br />in short, there is very little reason to watch emma. it's an amiable enough adaptation, but if you're going to pack a film full of anacronisms (i.e. an appalingly thin lead who can't shoot a bow or handle a period accent) then you might as well do it properly, as with the vastly superior "clueless".
