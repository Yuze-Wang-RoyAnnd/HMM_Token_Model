parasomnia has an interesting premises, but the story is poorly done without any tension or even a logical approach. the cast in unconvincing, even patrick kilpatrick, who played great roles in movies like scanner cop 2, open fire, under siege 2 and eraser. the rest of the cast is unknown (and not very good) with the exception of jeffrey combs. (herbert west from the great re-animator trilogy). but he can play roles like this in his sleep (which is a little what he does here). the main problem is that the actions of the characters make no sense at all. the story is rather dull and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some gory scenes, especially at the end.<br /><br />this could have been so much better, i do not get the good reviews on this one. it is below average really.
