you know what kind of movie you're getting into when the serial killer main character is being transported to the electric chair (in what seems to be a bakery truck), only to have the prison vehicle collide with (and i'm not making this up) a genetic engineering tanker truck. the goo which spurts forth melts him, and fuses his dna with the snow, creating our protagonist, the killer snowman.<br /><br />my favorite portion of the movie, however, is an over-the-shoulder shot of the snowman thrashing some poor schmuck, in which his hands look suspiciously like a couple of white oven-potholder gloves.<br /><br />mmmmm, schlock...
