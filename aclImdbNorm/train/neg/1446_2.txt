the movie is an extra-long tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original adventure's spirit. the quite horribly american patrick swayze is cast as the british hero allan quatermain despite the obviousness of his nationality.<br /><br />the movie continues throughout to "hollywood-ise" the story by changing both the plot and the characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold. the movie manages to be predictable throughout, even to those who are not familiar with the story and is plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing fight sequences.<br /><br />all in all, a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of movies based on the legend of king soloman's mines and allan quatermain.
