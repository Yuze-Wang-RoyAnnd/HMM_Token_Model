movies like these are to the originals what album oriented rock stations are to what music used to be like - repetitive, boring, and drained of all the original energy by a committee of corporate drones. i am glad that aragorn wasn't typecast as an expectant psycho by this p.o.s. go back and watch the 1971 version, count the things that would never be included in a modern version, and thank whatever deity you worship that someone somewhere in the distant past had the balls to write and shoot an original concept movie that wasn't based on someone else's ideas, and wasn't passed through a corporate board before it saw the light of day.
