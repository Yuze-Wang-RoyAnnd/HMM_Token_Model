i commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a "thumbs in the middle" review, remarking that i'd give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode. i've seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in june 2006. and as a lifelong batman fanatic, i can say without hesitation: this show is utter crap.<br /><br />everything's wrong with it. everything. getting past just the lousy animation and design, the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories.<br /><br />and for god's sake...is it just me, or is the joker in every episode?? is gotham that much of a revolving-door justice system? or, again, is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains (see "no character development", above).<br /><br />and to make matters worse, every single joker tale is the same 3-part formula.<br /><br />1) joker gasses people.<br /><br />2) joker sets out to gas the whole city.<br /><br />3) batman saves the day.<br /><br />pfeh.<br /><br />there was one episode i saw that wasn't a joker story. the title escapes me, but the villain was that nefarious cluemaster...the "think thank thunk" episode with the quiz show. that was the single-worst batman story i've ever seen, heard or read. yes, worse than "i've got batman in my basement." <br /><br />i can't really say what i feel this show is because it's probably against the tos, but it starts with "b" and rhymes with "fastardization". thank goodness for the existence of the timm/dini/etc. era of bat-entertainment, back from the fox and kids wb days. stuff that good, and i should have known this, just couldn't possibly have lasted forever, unfortunately.
