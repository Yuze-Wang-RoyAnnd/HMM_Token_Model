i'm not sure quite why i clicked "contains spoiler", because quite honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough of what is supposed to be going on to spoil it.<br /><br />visually it mostly delivers. well, apart from some 80's throwback rubber-mask monsters. i'll say now that before watching this i had never seen the band lordi, nor knew anything about them bar that they won eurovision. apparently the monsters in this are members of the band, pretty much in their stage personas. whatever. anyway, i didn't know this while watching. i just thought the monsters/demons were mostly passable. just about.<br /><br />i'm almost sure there is a semi-coherent explanation behind what we see on-screen, but it may actually be better not to know it. it probably would actually have been incredibly lame come to think on it. the action keeps it rolling along pretty much well enough to keep the viewer mostly entertained, even if half the entertainment factor is joking about wtf is supposed to be happening in this movie exactly.<br /><br />i gave it a four mainly because i got a good laugh out of it, especially out of how it explains pretty much nothing. must have been the mood i was in, but i found that hella funny for some reason. then i look up the movie on the internet and find out that nobody knows what the hell it's supposed to be about. that amused me further, and raised my score an extra half point to a 4/10.<br /><br />it's not scary, or particularly coherent, but it's pretty nice visually and sonically. overall, far from essential, but watchable. don't expect too much and don't expect it to make any sense and it might entertain you if you are in the right mood.
