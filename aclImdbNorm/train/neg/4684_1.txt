this movie is an insult to all submariners. it was stupid. it appeared to have been written by monkeys. the acting was absurd. if this is the view most people have of the navy, then i weep for our defense. this movie was awful. i put it below "voyage to the bottom of the sea" as far as submarine movies go. gene hackman must have really needed rent money to do this crap. denzel washington must have been high. little in the plot makes any sense. and the ending. for a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime? only hollywood would think of this garbage. if you haven't figured it out yet, i didn't like it. and if it wasn't for all the pro comments, i would not have bothered to post.
