guys who-ever even thinks about watching this movie has already got some disturbance going through their heads.. this movie has nothing to do with jack the ripper (incase you thought) its another b, i mean e-grade movie comprised of a bunch of horny teens in certain sex scenes being watched just before they get their spleens splattered on a nearby tree. its not scary, funny or amusing. if you really feel like gory stuff with no plot, then watch cabin fever, at least the director did not fall asleep midway through directing this crap.only watch this if you absolutely have nothing to do in life & the only thing on tv is oprah winfrey crying on the tv set.
