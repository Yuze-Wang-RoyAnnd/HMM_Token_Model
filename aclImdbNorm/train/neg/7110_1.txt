well, one has to give the director credit for how gutsy he was. gutsy would be the right term. not only did he use a total cast of five people (no extras at all), but he also decided to use sub-par special effects with a confusing and boring plot, he also, and i am not kidding, put a warning at the beginning of the movie that you might die of fright!!! however, they do promise a freeeeee coooofffffffiiiiinnnnn. to have a creepy limping gardener is always a good move. yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn....<br /><br />if you watch mystery science theater 3000, you might've seen this. they like to showcase horrible movies, just to let you know.<br /><br />a good gift for someone you hate.
