like many others have commented before me here, i have to say that this movie is bad, but not the worst i've seen. there will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment, because i hate spoilers.<br /><br />i got a feeling i was watching an episode of a tv show or something, where they had gotten a hold of some extra $$$ to spend on cgi (i've seen worse of those)... all in all, it is quite an insult to the viewer, at least if you have any knowledge about computers and/or technology at all. there are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable, and i found myself just begging for it all to end - fast - halfway through. in addition, there are countless "easy way out" scenarios, which also is an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being...<br /><br />this movie absolutely fades in comparison to the old "wargames", and i think it's a damn shame they even got to call it a sequel.<br /><br />two stars from me, because of one thing and one thing only: the actors' performances aren't half-bad, considering the regurgitated crap of a script they had to work with. still, they should never have signed on to this movie. not really a career-move, but i guess we all have bills to pay.<br /><br />to those of you who gave this movie top score...you have to be on the studio's payroll or something, that's my only explanation.<br /><br />to all who haven't seen this one: by all means, watch it and make up your own mind. but lower your expectations to the floor (and then some).
