here's how you do it: believe in god and repent for your sins. then things should turn around within the next day or so. <br /><br />until the last fifteen minutes, this movie just plays as a bad recap of a drunk's crappy life. his mom dies. his stepmom's a b_tch. his dad dies. he drinks. he gets married. he has kids. he drinks some more. his wife gets mad. he disappoints his kids. the wife threatens to leave. he calls up a reverend late night b/c he wants to kill himself. then after the recap happens, that's when we get the "left behind"-like subtle message.<br /><br />"he needed a paycheck". this is the phrase i had to repeat over and over once credits started to roll so i wouldn't lose my respect for madsen.<br /><br />madsen drops to his knees and begs christ's forgiveness. once he does, he walks outside and actually says that he sees the world in a different way. he tells his wife that he's found god and that's good enough for her. flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church. end the movie as madsen walks by the bar and gives a soliloquy about how happy he is with christ and without alcohol. final moment? he gives a little dismissive wave to the bar (i.e. sin house) and give a gay, miami-vice, after-school special congratulatory jump in the air as the camera freeze-frames. see why i had to repeat the phrase? "he needed a paycheck".<br /><br />man this movie is bad. the b-grade 80's production values don't help much. the script could have easily been a "touched by an angel" episode. it could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials. the acting is wooden and never believable. even madsen, of whom i'm a big fan and is the sole reason i sat through this, makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he doesn't know his a$$ from his elbow yet on camera. 45 minutes into it i started to get discouraged. this thing was like homework. i just wanted to put it away and say that alright, i saw half of it. that's good enough. but no. if i sat through cheerleader ninjas, i could sit throughout this.<br /><br />the only reason i'm not giving this thing a 1 is for two points: 1) i love madsen. i know it's not fair. but it's great seeing the opening title "introducing michael madsen". sue me. 2) some of the dialogue is so bad that it's classic. i'll stick some quotes at the end of this so you can enjoy them too.<br /><br />that's about it. to wrap it up ,this thing is a piece of crap that should stay flushed with the rest of the turds. but hey! look! michael madsen! (see also tilt, executive target, my boss's daughter, etc). now i've gotta rewatch reservoir dogs and watch madsen torture a cop to get my respect back for him. see ya, kids.<br /><br />"this stuff's gonna make me go blind, but i'm gonna drink it anyway" - madsen's first taste of cheap alcohol<br /><br />"i don't understand! everything seems so beautiful!" - madsen walking outside after confessing to god<br /><br />"i'm going downtown later and pick up a bible and i'm gonna get a haircut too" - madsen after converting at the dinner table, because satan lives in your hair
