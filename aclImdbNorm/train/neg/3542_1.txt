having read the comments on the site i feel compelled to write in for the first time. it seems this movie is like marmite and has split the audience. i have to say that while i agree films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see mulholland drive) they still have to engage you with the characters. now while i was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in lynch's opus, i have to say i couldn't give a turd about mr green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world. <br /><br />also, while so many people seem to try and say you didn't enjoy because you didn't get it i would have to disagree - i didn't enjoy because i was bored. i wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help. call it clever if you will - i think it's repetitious.<br /><br />however, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film i saw. just music over black. did i watch a dud print or is this evidence of gr's pretentiousness? or, did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed???
