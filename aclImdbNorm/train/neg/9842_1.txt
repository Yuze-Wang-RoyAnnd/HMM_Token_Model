seems everyone in this film is channeling woody allen. they stammer and pause and stammer some more. only for really die-hard denero fans! it tries to appear as edgy and artistic - but it comes off as looking like a very, very low budget film made by college students. the most often used word in the whole film is "hum". the film does peg the atmosphere of the late sixties/early seventies though. if you like films where people are constantly talking over each other, horrible lighting (even if it is for "art's sake"), and makes you feel like you are sitting in on a lame political meeting, then you might like this - but you need to be really bored. i found this cd in the dollar bin and now i know why.
