incarcerated train robber near yuma breaks free his chain-gang and heads for the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (as well as a hidden stash of gold which remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). attempt to bring the western genre up-to-date with 1970s-style violence and brutality isn't even in the same league as some of the new-fangled westerns which came out of the late-'60s. it is impossibly simple and square, with the female characters merely around as punching-bags and possible rape victims. as the former sheriff back in command, charlton heston gives one of his laziest, least-inspired performances ever (he has one good moment, attempting to read a letter and fumbling for his glasses). james coburn, as the half-mad half-breed, is pretty much on auto-pilot as well, but coburn has a way of turning even the hoariest dialogue and situations into something prickly and unnerving. it's his show all the way. *1/2 from ****
