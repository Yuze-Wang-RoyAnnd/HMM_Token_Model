what a mess!! why was this movie made? this, and other movies of its "caliber" should be teaching tools on how not to make a movie. children may like it, but anyone over 10 may or will disapprove. to make matters worse was the fact that such great talent like whoopi goldberg and armin mueller stahl were entirely wasted in a film unworthy of any notice.
