growing up with the beast wars transformers, i wasn't very familiar with the original transformers, and now that i have seen the awesome movie, and now that i have seen the older cartoon on which it's based, i have to say i like the original cartoon and the live action movie more than beast wars.<br /><br />not that i don't like the bw characters, i just think that characters like optimus prime are better than optimus primal.<br /><br />i mean, "autobots transform and roll out!" sounds a lot better than "maximals maximize!" the voice of the original optimus prime still makes me a strong believer that he's a real commander, more so than optimus primal.<br /><br />besides, powermaster optimus prime is a lot more powerful than optimal optimus. just look on the web! <br /><br />megatron in the bw character seemed more like a humorous version of the more evil version of him in the original series.<br /><br />besides what's cooler, robots changing into animals or robots changing into vehicles and spaceships? gimme the original transformers any day over beast wars!
