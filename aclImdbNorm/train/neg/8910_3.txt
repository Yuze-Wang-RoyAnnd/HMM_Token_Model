this film has a very simple but somehow very bad plot. the entire movie is about a girl getting sucked through a gate to another dimension then years later it gets opened again by a witch while a group of friends (including the lead actor who is having trouble getting over his ex girlfriend who is one of the other campers along with her new partner... another girl... that's right they're lesbians and there is some nudity of course for no particular reason). unfortunately demon follows the now adult girl back through. also unfortunately, none of this is ever explained. where exactly were they? where did the demon come from? how did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? who the hell trained her and made her a gladiator type outfit? the acting is terrible i think but it's hard to tell because the writing is so bad maybe there was just nothing they could do with it. i give it a three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty fun even though they were very cheap. i would not recommend it, it wasn't quite bad enough to be funny.
