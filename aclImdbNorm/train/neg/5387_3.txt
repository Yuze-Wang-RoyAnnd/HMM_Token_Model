in one instant when it seemed to be getting interesting, it never got there.<br /><br />the people are going from one point to another point, with really no point (if there was one it was very dull). there was no action, suspense or any horror and the characters were pretty heartless, so there was no caring what happened to them.<br /><br />all together the movie was pretty boring.<br /><br />i give it a 3/10.<br /><br />i like that it wasn't shaky choppy camera-work and if there was music it didn't annoy me like some really bad movies and the acting was not horrendous.
