this was a waste of 75 minutes of my life. the acting was atrocious and the plot was ridiculous. it revolves around an evil lesbian who gets rich married men to have sex with her, and then blackmails them for money. one of the victims is a candidate for da, which is causing problems in his relationship with his wife. another is a plastic surgeon, also married, and the evil lesbian happens to seduce this guys wife too! meanwhile, the evil lesbian's girlfriend doesn't really like her sleeping around. it ends in a happy ending where all is forgiven. the women get naked a lot too, mostly in situations that stretch reality. bad bad bad.
