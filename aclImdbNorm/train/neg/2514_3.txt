i loved dewaere in series noir. his talent is trivialized in "the waltzers" aka "going places". okay, it's a couple of guys flaunting convention in the most absurd and irredeemable ways; many folks find such behavior amusing. this was a boring, pointless exercise designed to shock. i find the smirk on blier's face, the face behind the camera, annoying. series noir was a valid expression of personal liberty and licentious behavior. from the first moment when we see patric dewaere prancing in the abandoned lot we get an idea of the bewilderingly beautiful anti-hero we'll be spending time with for the next couple of hours. when we see him chasing the hapless middle aged female with his buddy depardieu in "going places" we have fair warning that two hours spent with these chaps will be soul-draining. i have trouble eking even a "3" for this annoying distraction.
