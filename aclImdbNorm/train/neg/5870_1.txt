i didn't like this film at all! first of all,i don't know why, but everyone here says, that cl'emence po'esy's play is excellent, which in my opinion is absolutely wrong! she is not like natasha: another appearance, another character... what's worse, she is a very unexperienced actress and that's why she wasn't able to play this role! she disfigured the heroine completely! that was really disgusting to watch her play! to my mind, that would be much better to give this role to a russian actress, because that would be much easier for her to understand the russian soul for a russian person. unfortunately, kutuzov looked like a drunk man, who hasn't shaved 2 weeks and defeated a battle in which he lost his eye...( thank's god, in this film there're some actors, whose play was awesome! i suppose, that alessio boni coped with his task very well! i was pleasantly amazed! he is one of the few people who's read the book, which is very important for the play. in addition, i liked plays of our russian actors, that was really wonderful to watch them)) the only thing i liked in this work was very beautiful views and amazing dresses! my advice is to read the book and to understand a real sense, the aim, with which leo tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and maybe realize the whole idea of the book... 1 from 10
