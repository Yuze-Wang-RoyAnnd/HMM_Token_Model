this film was very well advertised. i am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months. while i was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be, my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it. then i went and saw it, i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had paid for this movie. i made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood i was in, plus i wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie! i always go into a movie with an open mind, not trying to go into them with too many expectations, but this movie was not that funny. now it wasnt the worst movie i've ever seen, but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo. if you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it, but for true comedy fans id say pass. maybe even check out the kings of comedy again. something told me to go see meet the parents instead!!!
