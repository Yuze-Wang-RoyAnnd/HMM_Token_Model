before watching this film, i could already tell it was a complete copy of saw (complete with the shack-like place they were in and the black guy wanting someone to break his hand to get out of the cuffs). mjh's name on a movie would typically turn me away (ugh, can we say gross?!), but i still wanted to give it a try.<br /><br />starting out, i was a bit interested. the acting is absolutely horrible and i found myself laughing at almost each reaction from the characters (especially the man that played "sulley"). mjh was even worst, but i continued to watch.<br /><br />however, the ending was the biggest joke of them all! i seriously sat in shock thinking "that was the ending?! is this a comedy?!".<br /><br />i thought this pile of crap was funnier than the "scary movie" spoofs and that is really saying something!
