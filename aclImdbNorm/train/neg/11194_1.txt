the coming attractions to "the order" make it seem like a decent horror mystery/thriller, but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage.<br /><br />first off the whole movie consists of terrible dialogue and god awful special affects. the acting was also nothing to be proud of, but keath ledger (i think i spelled that right.) saved the movie in this category.<br /><br />for heaven's sake: don't see this movie!
