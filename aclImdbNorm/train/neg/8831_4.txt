having heard so many people raving about this film i thought i'd give it a go. apart from being incredibly slow, which i don't mind as long as the wait is worth it, but it just isn't. as many others have said there are so many inconsistencies and so much of this film just doesn't ring true. the reaction of the 4 men switches from shock, horror on finding the body to complete indifference whilst they fish. surely if they were the type of men that would go on happily fishing, then they would have just reported the body and said they had only discovered it after their fishing trip....why on earth tie the body to a tree, go fishing and then tell everyone you found the body 2 days previously? its so hard to watch a film knowing that the behaviour of the main characters is so inconsistent. as for the rest of the townsfolk, well you'd think at least one of them might show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman! the body itself, naked except for the knickers....what scenario leads to that? if she was raped then why still the knickers? if she was raped with the clothes on, then why remove them afterwards bar the knickers? if she wasn't raped, then why take all her clothes off bar the knickers....leaving yourself with evidence to dispose of? i truly cant think of any realistic scenario that would lead to that other than killing someone to steal their clothes so you can fill up your jumble sale stall! oh well its watchable but only just and only because, despite the poor script, the acting is strong.
