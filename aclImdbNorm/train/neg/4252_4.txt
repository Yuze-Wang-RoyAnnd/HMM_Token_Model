***possible spoilers***<br /><br />when i saw this today i had some expectation of how it would be like, not too high, but not low either. this was nothing like i expected at all though, it seems to me like the movie makers couldn't make up their mind of what kind of movie to make.<br /><br />in the begining of the film it's somewhat mysterious and kinda exciting, but that'll soon change to some ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes... as i watched further i almost fell asleep a couple of times.<br /><br />the ending is the most ridiculous of all though, almost splatter/comedy...<br /><br />i'm not saying it doesn't have some good scenes it's just that the film never becomes "whole".<br /><br />4/10 movie-man
