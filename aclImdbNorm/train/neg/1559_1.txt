this may very well be the worst movie i'll see if i live to be 100. i think a group of first-graders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this. i'm dumber for having watched it, and god have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film.<br /><br />and after i finally turned it off, i actually had the urge to vomit.<br /><br />no one had a clue about photography when made this. no one had a clue about acting. no one had a clue about just about anything.<br /><br />i can't believe f/x shows this crap on occasion. the only time i had seen it was on one of the starz! channels - not even the main one. and it was on at about 3 a.m. at that.
