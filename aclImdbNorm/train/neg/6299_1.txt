this inept adaptation of arguably one of martin amis's weaker novels fails to even draw comparisons with other druggy oeuvres such as requiem for a dream or anything penned by irvine walsh as it struggles to decide whether it is a slap-stick cartoon or a hyper-realistic hallucination.<br /><br />boringly directed by william marsh in over-saturated hues, a group of public school drop-outs converge in a mansion awaiting the appearance of three american friends for a weekend of decadent drug-taking. and that's it. except for the ludicrous sub-plot soon-to-be-the-main-plot nonsense about an extremist cult group who express themselves with the violent killings of the world's elite figures, be it political or pampered. within the first reel you know exactly where this is going.<br /><br />what is a talented actor like paul bettany doing in this tiresome, badly written bore? made prior to his rise to fame and jennifer connelly one can be assured that had he been offered this garbage now he'd have immediately changed agents! avoid.
