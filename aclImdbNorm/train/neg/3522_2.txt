if you like the standard sly flicks that involve over the top action, unbelievable stunts (unbelievable is not intended to be complimentary here), and retarded dialogue; you will love this steaming pile of mountain goat dung. i had high hopes based on the trailer. i thought that stalone was going to be forced in his "has-been" days to yield to smarter people and make an action film that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where the story, setting, and (believable) action would prevail. i crave action that is at least close enough to reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that would come from such an event. my limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects rendered at least one scene laughably ridiculous. judge dredd is only better because you know going into the theater that you are going to see a comic book made into a movie. the character, setting and everything else are beyond comparison to anything we might encounter ourselves. cliffhanger on the other hand turns a mountain climbing guide into rambo before you can say "yo, adrian!"
