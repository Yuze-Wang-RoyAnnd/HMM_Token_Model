once again, disney manages to make a children's movie which totally ignores its background. about the only thing common with this and the original gadget cartoons is the names. the most glaring errors are the characters - penny does not have her book, brain has been reduced from a character to a fancy prop, dr claw is more a show-off than an evil villain, etc. but there are more than that. the horrors start from the first minutes of the film - having gadget as a security guard called john brown doesn't help identifying him as the classic inspector gadget. and right in the beginning we see disney's blatant attempt to turn every story ever into a love affair between a man and a woman - they introduce brenda, who only serves to make this movie disney-compatible. add to this the fact that the "claw" seen in this film and the classic dr claw are almost diagonally opposite and you'll see this is going to be nowhere near the original storyline. what would help would be a better storyline to replace it - but as you guessed, disney failed in that too. the whole movie is just gadget acting silly for silliness's sake and lusting after brenda. as if to add insult to the injury, disney introduced the "new" gadgetmobile - it doesn't look, function or think like the old gadgetmobile at all, it's just the canonical "comic relief" figure. disney obviously recognised that the gadget cartoons were a comedy, so they made the film a comedy too, but they took out all the clever running gags (like the assignment paper exploding in the chief's face) and replaced them with gadget being a moron, the gadgetmobile being a wise-ass, and "claw" showing off. someone should tell disney that "children's movie" doesn't imply "total lack of any brain usage". gadget should be targeted for children of 10-12 years... not children of 10-12 months like this movie. whatever this movie is supposed to be, it is not, repeat not, the real inspector gadget. because i love the old gadget, i hate this.
