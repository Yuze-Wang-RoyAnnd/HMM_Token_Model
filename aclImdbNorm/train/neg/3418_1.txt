***this post contains spoiler(s)*** <br /><br />i'm not a big fan of chuck norris as an actor, but i worship him in all other ways. he also have his own fan web site with "chuck norris facts" that is really entertaining. but this movie looks like someone was joking with the audience putting all those "facts" into one movie. i really don't remember when i wasted my time more than with this "action". i don't know what's the worst this movie can offer you: unoriginal and thousand-times-made plot of terrorists who are trying to nuke us by smuggling nuke on us soil or perhaps that "great" dialogs and chucks words of wisdom about life and everything else. someone may find the worst that terrorists actually speak english in everyday life. it's a never ending list of crap. not to mention huge amount of archive footage used in film, that is kinda annoying. the chief terrorist send his comrades message through the media when he is captured and the only guy smart enough to see the treat is: chuck norris, of course. no one else in america is not smart enough to see that! and the whole action in capturing chief is just ridiculous. one man is sent to walk through a whole terrorist camp unarmed (i'm lying, he had a knife), escapes his stalkers with jet pack and then para glides for few hundred, maybe even thousand kilometers to nearest shore (afganistan border is 450 km far away from nearest shore), where he is rescued by submarine. i hoped that at least fighting scenes will be good, but that's even more funny than the plot. if you didn't know, 85% of terrorist are masters of some martial art, but chuck and co beat the sh*t out of them. not only they kill them easily, they can kick and throw them away by a single move and the bad guys fly few meters like dolls. you may ask me did i watch this movie to the end? i did. why? because i just wanted to see who, of these two super heroes, will defuse the nuclear bomb of few hundred megatons and size of a microwave. and then i realized what fool i am. of course, it's chuck's movie after all. and not only he singlehandedly defuse nuke with tweezers, but he do it - twice!! i could write a book about all the stupid things in this movie, but i would spend my life spawn.<br /><br />so, makers of this movie made another chuck norris fact to be added on his web site: can chuck norris defuse nuclear bomb? yes and he can do it twice!
