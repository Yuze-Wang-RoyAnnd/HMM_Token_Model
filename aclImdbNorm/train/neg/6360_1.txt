may i please have my $13.00 back? i would have rather watched "hydro- electric power comes to north america". again. this is a movie with one voice. the same voice, which comes out of every characters mouth regardless of age or gender. to listen to that voice again i would have to charge at least $150 an hour. and i don't take insurance. it was eerie watching will ferrell morph into woody. but i don't think imaginative casting is enough. one should wait until they have a story before they bother making a movie. unless he's just doing it for the money. and if that's the case why not just reissue an all-rap version of "what's up tiger lily?"
