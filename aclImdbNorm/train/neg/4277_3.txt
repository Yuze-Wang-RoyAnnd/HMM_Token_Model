veteran director and producer allan dwan, whose huge string of films includes both the utterly forgettable and the recurrently shown (for example, john wayne in "sands of iwo jima") tried his hand at a big musical with "i dream of jeanie." harnessing a lead cast of singers with little past film experience and, as it turned out, virtually no future, he spun a fictional and in no small part offensive story about the great american songwriter, stephen foster.<br /><br />bill shirley is the young, lovestruck foster whose kindness to slaves includes giving the money saved for an engagement ring to pay the hospital cost for an injured little black boy. his intended is inez mcdowell (muriel lawrence) whose pesky younger sister, jeanie (eileen christy), is slowly realizing she's in love with the nearly impecunious song-smith. foster is in love with inez who is revolted by the composer's number 1 on the levee hit parade tune, "o susannah." enter minstrel edwin p.christy (ray middleton) to help launch the profit-making phase of foster's career.<br /><br />this is, by the musical-film standards of the early fifties, a big production. the sets are lavish in that special hollywood way that portrayed fakes with all the trimmings. the singers aren't half bad and the foster songs are almost impossible to ruin.<br /><br />but this is also a literal whitewash of the antebellum south. the biggest number features black-face for all on stage, an historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of unthinking racism. were these portrayals of blacks anywhere near reality, the abolitionists would be rightly condemned for interfering with so beneficent an institution.<br /><br />"i dream of jeanie" apparently sank into the studio's vault with barely a death whisper. now revived by alpha video for a mere $4.99 it's a period piece with charming songs and repulsive sentimentalizing about the victims of america's great crime, slavery.<br /><br />this was what hollywood was putting out two years before brown v. board of education. must have warmed the hearts of some moviegoers who wore their bed linen to the theater.
