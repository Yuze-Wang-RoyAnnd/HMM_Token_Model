after coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes. though i guess not. if the first one wasn't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch. with all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever. though they couldn't, they had to take all the same raunchy, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again. though the thing is i didn't laugh at it the first time. they tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level. most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes, that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to watch it and enjoy it. then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene. also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience, well i fit into the age range that it's supposed to be funny for. while people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you do find this funny then you probably aren't one of the more mature or intelligent people around. it doesn't take that much skill to write that kind of a script, though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie spaceballs. it's a movie parody that's actually good and well done and it didn't have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either.
