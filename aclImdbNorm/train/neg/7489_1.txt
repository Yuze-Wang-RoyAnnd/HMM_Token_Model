american movies about war and nazis simply cannot be good. they can not refrain from becoming idiot and following an agenda. all nazis are bad, crazy, too proud, and americans are so modest yet so capable and sensible and human. come on, stop this bullshit. the main character says something like "by this trial, we have to make aggressive war a crime". is america a peaceful nation with its world #1 $420 billion "defense" budget (#2 china with just $51b)? is it simply spent in this without any... roi? why portray america as a peaceful nation when it isn't? i deeply dislike movies with an agenda - they throw art to hell and try to persuade us into believing something. hollywood should put a label on movies, just as record companies have that "parental advisory" label. we should have a "bullshit advisory", "propaganda advisory" or a "politically correct advisory" label on some movies. this is one of them.
