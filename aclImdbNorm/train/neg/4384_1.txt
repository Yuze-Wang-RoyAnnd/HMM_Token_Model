the fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad script, is beyond me. this really must be one of the worst films, in addition to "haunted highway" i have ever seen. bad actors, and a really bad story. there's no normal reactions to any event in this film, and even though it's halloween , normal people would have bigger reactions when they're witnessing their father being killed, not to mention gutted, people with tape covering their airways, not being able to breathe (in a room with at least 50 people i might add) and some person dressed up as satan dragging dead people out of his house, even an 8 year old would see the difference between a doll and a person. not to mention the fact that no one could possibly be that naive and dumb to believe the reality of satan and jesus' appearances on the same day, like this kid does. when i was 8, i sure had more brains than that. <br /><br />but, the really stupid thing is that everyone else seems to be falling for this mute satan look-alike as well, no questions asked. the question throughout the film is, is it really satan, or is it some crazy person killing people off whenever he feels like it? well, he's got human hands, arms, built and whatever, so i guess he's supposed to be in the movie as well, otherwise they did a lousy job concealing it. then, with this person being human and all, he was able to kill an old lady, a man and his mistress, 5 (!!???) cops (all with guns and training i presume), and a few other people.....and obviously everyone was just standing there waiting for him, or what?<br /><br />the whole concept and way of telling the story is absolutely the worst thing i've seen, and i would never recommend anyone to waste 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to watch this total crap.
