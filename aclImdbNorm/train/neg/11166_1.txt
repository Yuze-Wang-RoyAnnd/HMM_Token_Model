i'm sure deep in the recesses of jack blacks mind the character of nacho libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isn't. you can tell ol jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy, slimy mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department.<br /><br />i just sat there through most of the movie thinking "is this supposed to be funny" and "this is the guy from tenacious d right?". the truth is this film has nothing to offer. at all! it's a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction. you'll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn't. i was bored stupid about 10 minutes in but though it would surely pick up. it didn't. 90 minutes later i'd barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful.<br /><br />it's like, remember years ago when you'd see anything with your fave actor in it, even some of their really early pap from before they were famous, and you'd be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop. yeah it's like that.<br /><br />i've enjoyed some of jack black's earlier movies like shallow hall and i'm really looking forward to seeing pick of destiny but come on man. if you do this to us again jack i'm gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something. at the least give you a serious talking to.<br /><br />i know it's a clich'e but this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen and for so many reasons....
