oh my, where to start... this movie was just awful. the writing was bad, acting was bad, special effects were bad. i think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh! i was in the mood for a scary movie but certainly didn't get that! i thought it would be decent enough since i'm not picky. i've watched several bad horror movies. in fact, it is my goal to see all horror movies, not matter how awful they may be. at one point in the movie i made a comment about the "corn syrup blood" and in the special features they actually admit that it was karo syrup (brand name corn syrup...) the movie had all the necessary things for a horror movie (blood, nudity, crazy killer, stupid moves) but it was just completely lacking anything to really make it good. the writer should either take some classes or just give up!
