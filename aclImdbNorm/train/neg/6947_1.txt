without a doubt one of the worst movies i've seen in recent years. the story focuses on four women driven to robbing banks who we are somehow supposed to sympathize with. it's tough to sympathize with characters who keep making such stupid decisions. oh no, the cops are on to us, they know who we are, what do we do?...let's rob one more bank then we're outta here! what!?! every character is a stereotype and it's easy to tell who's gonna end up dead.
