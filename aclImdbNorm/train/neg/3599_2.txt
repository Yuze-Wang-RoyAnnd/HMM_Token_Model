umm.. i was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film high marks.<br /><br />lets face it... tori spelling is not a great actress.. and this movie just proves the extent of her "talent". the movie's plot was weak... i bet the dork that came up with this concept was some perverted peeping tom. if there is a good thing about this movie, i would say it's that tommy chong's daughter, just for the fact that she's his daughter... and then there is that soap-opera-ish male lead who's decent good looks somewhat make him attractive, but ceases to help his dramatic abilities. *why does imdb require at least 10 lines? how many more ways can you simply say "this movie sucks"?
