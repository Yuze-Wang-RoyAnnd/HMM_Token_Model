gee, what a crappy movie this was! i cannot understand what people find so scary about "the grudge". the director plays one trick (i'd have to admit a very good one, that is brought to life very stylized) and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again. as a consequence i startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie, but once i knew the drill i practically fell asleep as the grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute. to conclude, i can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with, that the so-called predecessor "the ring" was way scarier and that buying a ticket for "the grudge" is a waste of money.
