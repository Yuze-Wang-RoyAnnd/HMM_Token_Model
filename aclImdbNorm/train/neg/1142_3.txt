you've been fouled and beaten up in submission by my harsh statements about "femme fatale" / "guns n' gals" movies! now comes another breed in disappointing rediscoveries: ninja movies! many of these i've seen before, and let me tell you, they aren't all that's cracked up to be! they usually don't stick to the point. this, among all others, suffers from no originality! what's a ninja got to do with preventing a nuclear holocaust in russia? and isn't this supposed to be a "martial arts" movie, too? does plenty of gunfire sound like an incredible action movie to you? is blood the number one reason to love this to death? will you waste some of your hard-earned cash over a lady singing in her see-through tank top? the answers to these important questions are found in the ninja mission, which should be in the martial arts section of your video store. for even more nonsense ninja fun, try checking out those godfrey ho movies put out by trans world. you get what you deserve, and that's a promise! recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts!
