i am a fan of the previous best of the best films. but this one was awful. no wonder i had such a hard time finding it. i tried 4 video rental stores, until i found one with a copy of this movie. the acting was terrible, the plot was a joke, and the action was bad as well.<br /><br />i really miss alex grady, travis brigley, and the original kickboxing characters and theme that this film had with the first 2 movies.<br /><br />john
