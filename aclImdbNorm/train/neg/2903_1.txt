oh dear. this movie could have been sub-titled "when writers go on strike!" what a stinker. i had really high hopes for this, mostly after reading imdb reviews, which makes me wonder about the whole imdb rating system, but that's a separate matter. i loved steve carrell in anchorman, bruce almighty, the office, etc so i was expecting great things. to say i was disappointed is the understatement of the year. there are so many things wrong with this movie, but i'll confine myself to (a) the implausibility of any family behaving like these people do (a mass aerobics workout? what planet is that real life on?), the clunky script (a murderer of love? please), and the fact that the character of dan is so unlikable, you find yourself wondering what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him? this movie was filled to bursting with clunky dialogue, creaking direction, ridiculous set-scenes and it was slow, slow, slow. we would have walked out after half an hour if we'd not been with my parents, who don't get out much and don't like to waste money. unlike the makers of this movie, who would have been better off throwing all the cash spent making this movie into a bonfire - that would have been more entertaining. if you like movies, avoid this like the plague.
