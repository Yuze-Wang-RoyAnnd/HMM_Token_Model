this film seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past. let the future viewer be forewarned that "art heist" doesn't add anything to the genre. director bryan goeres has no clue what to do with the film.<br /><br />william baldwin keeps reappearing in films, and frankly, one wonders if he has a great agent, or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy looks, complimented by that strange hairdo he sports in most of his movies. the only good movie in which he has appeared, is "the squid and the whale", in which he only speaks two, or three lines. ellen pompeo, his leading lady, doesn't fare much better; there is no chemistry between ms. pompeo and mr. baldwin.<br /><br />a movie to be seen at the viewer's own risk.
