i wouldn't be so quick to look at all the good reviews and say this might be a good show..this show is only good if you don't know what "talent" is..i won't even say how offensive it is (i know it can be offensive to a lot of people) because thats not really what bothers me about the show.. what bothers me is that people watch this and think it's funny..it makes me feel like our generation is getting to stupid and i'm actually scared that it will one day be run by people who watch this garbage..<br /><br />basically the plot is simple..it's about an offensive,self centered,spoiled women(sarah silvermen) getting through everyday life..<br /><br />thats it..like that hasn't been done a million times..in fact almost every joke either has been done or is racist..<br /><br />sarah also likes to sing..i like her voice..thats it..not the lyrics..the lyrics are dreadful..which she likes to sing about a lot of things..<br /><br />if you like to see a hot women put everyone else down and make them feel like crap while at the same time farting and saying crap about every race then this show is for you..
