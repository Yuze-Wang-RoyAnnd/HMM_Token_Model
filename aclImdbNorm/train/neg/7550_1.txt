ok, so i am an original wicker man fan and i usually don't like british films remade by americans, so why oh why did i put myself through the most painful cinema experiences ever? i am not a nicolas cage fan and i had some kind of moment of madness perhaps? the film was appalling! the bit at the beginning with the crash/fire had no relevance to the film at all and the female cop knew where edward was going, so the bit at the end with the two girls visiting the mainland, well it wouldn't have happened as the whole thing would have been investigated. the history behind the wicker man wasn't really explored - and i guess being set in america didn't really help the whole pagan theme. this film was slow and contained no atmosphere or suspense. i must say that the best bit was right at the end, when nicolas cage goes up in flames! i am in such desperate need to see the original again now, in order to cleanse my disappointed soul. i really can't stress how disappointing this film is, please don't see it if you:<br /><br />a) don't like american re-makes of british films b) are a fan of the original c) hate nicolas cage
