i picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. but i had no idea what i was getting myself into.<br /><br />i started the movie and soon i had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture.<br /><br />i finally know what hell is like. it's this movie. for eternity. this movie has no value. it didn't even really have a plot. there was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens.<br /><br />instead of watching this movie i suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can. you will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie.<br /><br />don't even watch it. not even to see how bad it is. i beg you. if you watch it, then it means they win.
