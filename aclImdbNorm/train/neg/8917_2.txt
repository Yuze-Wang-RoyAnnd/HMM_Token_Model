the prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of nietzche's work and personality, psychoanalytical techniques and vienna's history. take a well-know genius you have not read, describe him as demented, include crazy physicians to cure him, a couple of somewhat good looking women, have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache, have every character speak with the strongest accent, show ridiculous dreams, include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one (freud), mention a few words used in the genius' works, overdo everything you can, particularly music, and you are done. audience, please stay away.
