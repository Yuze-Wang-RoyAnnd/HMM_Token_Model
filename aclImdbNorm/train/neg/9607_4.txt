don't listen to the misleading title "werewolf woman". the europeans are well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films, but this one here is just a bit too much. "werewolf woman" seems to have a sleazy sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner. fun the first few times, but a hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly. shes not even a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. the film can't even decide its tone, with the first ten minutes (a flashback) being legitimate supernatural horror (i thought i was in for a trash classic after these) to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller. at the end, the director insists this is based on a true story. yeah, all right.<br /><br />to be fair, there are a few entertaining aspects of the production. the title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes. however, these become rather monotonous quickly. also, the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion, especially the worlds most swinging doctor (he drinks on the job). unfortunately, the film becomes pretty irritating fast. there's no actual plot or anything else really. its a shame, because reading a description i felt the film had some real potential. "werewolf woman" is far overlong, slow moving, and a bit too pointless, even by the standards of the exploitation genre. (4/10)
