i expect the same excitement as i spit on your grave but i was let down by just junk how can you even call this a movie ( its kinda of a mini porno) . it made my sick when the guy was made to eat his own business. there is no story line to it at all it jumps to quickly from each murder. if you like seeing a women naked or even mens parts then there's spots in the movie for and there's even a masturbation spot in the movie which makes it a porno and not a movie at all. i have seen some dumb movies in my time but this is number 1 . i want be watching it again at all. the actors even look bored during the movie to me so they probably were in need of money badly to make this movie.
