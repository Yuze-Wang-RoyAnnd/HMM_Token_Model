this film may have been the biggest let-down i've experienced in renting movies based on imdb reviews. overall, i simply found this to be a second-rate movie.<br /><br />leslie cheung is certainly passable as the antihero and ma wu handles his character with cheerful competence. on the other hand, ma wu's makeup (facial hair) is so obviously phony that i simply could not take him seriously. he looked like an overweight teenager dressed up for halloween, complete with the $4.95 stick-on beard.<br /><br />the special effects were so-so, though the "undead" in the cellar were pretty good. the tree-tongue looked like something from a bad 1950s monster flick, though the pov shots from the tongue's view more closely resembled sam raimi's trademark shots in the more recent "evil dead" trilogy. the pyrotechnics were ho-hum and the final battle is about as dull as you can get. (in fact, it most closely reminded me of the "lost in space" episode where the robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and....) <br /><br />the plot was not particularly original and has been told countless times in the form of european fairy tales. there was no suspense and no plot twists. in fact, you know right away as you are introduced to the characters who is good, who is bad, and who is going to survive.<br /><br />i just returned this film to netflix and then i sat down to write this review. the very first thing i did was check the production date. yep, it says 1987...not the 1967 that i thought it might be. and that pretty much sums it up: the production values and fx are typical of the 1960s. the plot and action seem much older, as hollywood was actually producing some interesting and challenging films in the 60s.<br /><br />** out of *****
