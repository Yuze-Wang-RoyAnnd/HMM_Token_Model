alicianne (laurel barnett) becomes a live in babysitter for young rosalie nordon (rosalione cole) who has recently lost her mother. but rosalie misses her dead mother a lot and continuously visits her grave (conveniently located in a cemetery right behind the house) late at night...where she also meets her "friends"...<br /><br />this starts off good with a truly eerie sequence in the cemetery...then falls apart. the story is thin and there is tons of padding to make the film 85 minutes long. the acting is terrible across the board (with cole easily being the worst). badly directed with some of the worst editing i've ever seen in a motion picture. scenes (and sound) are just cut off with no rhyme or reason. also the film has terrible (and obvious) post-production sound.<br /><br />as for blood and violence--forget it! there's very little and what there is looks incredibly fake. i've never seen such fake-looking blood--looks like ketchup! boring, pointless--a rightfully forgotten drive-in movie. you can skip this one.
