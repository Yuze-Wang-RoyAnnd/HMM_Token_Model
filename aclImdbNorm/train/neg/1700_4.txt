in film, i feel as though it should be more than just art. i think it should be more than that, a way to tell a story on screen. this short from david lynch tells a story but not much of one. i felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy. it is good film-making but there really isn't anything else to it. as i've said before, i am a huge david lynch fan but i get frustrated by some of his work because i don't see a need for it at all. this is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but i know he's still got a ton of talent and i am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future. if you like lynch, check this out but don't be surprised when you don't like it very much.
