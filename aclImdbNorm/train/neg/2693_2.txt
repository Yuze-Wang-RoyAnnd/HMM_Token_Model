<br /><br />although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful, the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story.<br /><br />one may believe that middle-class teen-age school girls in the 1950's easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30-year-old's they barely know, but i doubt it.<br /><br />one may believe that young high school teens are highly self-confident and self-assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations, but my experience has been, more often than not, teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world.<br /><br />one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of stroptomycin -- the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes -- and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake, but i think not.<br /><br />one may believe that 30-something-year-old troublemakers can enter into, and hang around inside, a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble, but i think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents, chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this.<br /><br />one final nit, throughout hey babu riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome. there is probably an explanation why the five were the foursome, but because it was never detailed, each reference distracts from each scene.<br /><br />this movie did not ring true for me.
