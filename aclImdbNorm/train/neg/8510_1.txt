when we were in junior high school, some of us boys would occasionally set off stinkbombs. it was considered funny then. but the producers, directors and cast of "semana santa" ("angel of death" in the dvd section of your local video rental) are adults and they are still setting them off.<br /><br />like the previous reviewer who wondered if the cast were anxious to get off the set and home, i doubt more than one take was done for any of the scenes.<br /><br />mira sorvino, hot in "mighty aphrodite" and other top-rated films, seems to have undersold herself to this project. her acting is non-existent, confined mostly to wistful stares that are supposed to indicate how "sensitive" she is to the plight of the film's various victims.<br /><br />but let me warn you--do not be the next victim! step away from the dvd if you find it on the shelf. tbere are not many good leg shots of mira (the only high points i could find in the film) and the supporting cast is of inferior quality, delivering a mishmash of badly-done dialogue with embarrassing "spanish" accents worthy of the best high school theatrical production.
