when i sat down to watch this film i actually expected quite a bit, as the plot takes on quite complex issues. using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach. still unfortunately, despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between muslim and western culture, adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gays/lesbians, it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film. this leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle, attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with.<br /><br />however, this does not mean that the film is directly bad, as it's rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing. the film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter, but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep. this has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts. by this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation.<br /><br />even if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama, the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when "the ball drops". this way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard clich'e that becomes ridiculous in its happy-ending. nothing is left out in the hollywood like ending. so even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages, one can't help but roll eyes towards the resolution. personally i was close to shouting "finish already!!" at the screen.<br /><br />there were some decent acting in the film, and the two young female central characters had some good moments. so did their parents and other bi-characters. however the handsome irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting, that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism. he didn't even appear very likable, but rather self involved despite his good deeds, which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained.<br /><br />i give the film a 4, as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from. the script and cast had many good believable characters, giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others. had the let-downs not been this disappointing, i'd easily give the film a 7 or 8. if you enjoyed this film, i'd recommend the film "east is east", which i think is an as good, if not better rendering of cultural conflict, as well as being amusing and engaging.
