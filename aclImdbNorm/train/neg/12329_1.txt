back in my days as an usher "private lessons" played at the 4-plex i was working. it was a sleeper hit selling out friday and saturday nights for several weeks. i never got around to seeing it but saw that it was on cable this last weekend, so i decided to give it a shot. what i witnessed for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies i have ever seen and one that made me terribly uncomfortable to watch.<br /><br />the basic story is a teenage boy lusts after his sexy maid (sylvia kristel). she, too, seems to feel an attraction towards the boy but for more sinister reasons. so we get scenes of the boy watching her undress and her inviting him in to watch. and it goes from there.<br /><br />eric brown, as the teenage boy, has to be one of the worst actors i have ever seen. his "scared" reactions to every time sylvia takes off a piece of clothing or when she touches him are horrible. i didn't laugh a single time during this piece of junk.<br /><br />and let's not get started on the subplot of the maid and chauffeur planning to extort money from the kid. let's just say it involves faking a death, burying a body.... i could go on and on but it gets more ridiculous.<br /><br />the sex scenes are the worst i have ever seen. even though eric brown was older then he looked, the fact is he looks like a baby. it appears he has no idea how to kiss a woman (if that was acting then maybe i should re-think my criticisms of brown) and it just came too close to bordering on child pornography to be erotic. i have never been so turned off by a sex scene even though miss kristel is quite beautiful with and without clothes.<br /><br />**spoiler warning** i must make mention of the last scene. to me it's just plain sick but i can remember audiences cheering as the film freeze framed and dissolved into credits. our hero returns to school and begins a flirtation with one of the female teachers. he asks her out for dinner and she gives him a look as if tom cruise has just asked her out. she nods affirmatively and he walks away, smiling at the camera in triumph. give me a break! yes i am sure teachers all over would just risk everything for a plain looking teenage kid.<br /><br />i will never understand the appeal this film had in 1982. certainly it was more then the nudity because there were plenty of teen sex comedies with nudity that bombed at the box office. and to think that these same teenagers that cheered that movie 22 years ago are now working their way up corporate ladders and possibly helping to run this country. that is a scary thought.
