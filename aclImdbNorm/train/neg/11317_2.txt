this move is about as bad as they come. i was, however forced to give it a 2 for the scenery. there are many great shots of the southwest including many in monument valley, one of the most breathtaking places in the us. it is also, starting with john ford, one of the most filmed. in fact one scene with kris and the girl was filmed on a place called john ford point.
