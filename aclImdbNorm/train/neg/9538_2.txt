when i saw the commercial for this, i was all about seeing it. now, forgive me, but it's been so long since i've seen it that i don't recall how it went. suffice it to say, the movie i saw bore no resemblance to the "movie" they sold me on.<br /><br />i was bored, annoyed, and incredibly disappointed by this movie. and if it wasn't bad enough, they had to sink it even further with that awful reggae music. not exactly mood-setting music for a horror movie, eh mon? i guess if you never saw the commercial (or trailer, i suppose) you may think this is some hot stuff. for my money, the commercial was way better.
