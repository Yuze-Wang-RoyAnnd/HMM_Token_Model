sadly, more downs than ups. the plot was pretty decent. i mean, nothing out of the ordinary, but it had a story, unlike the other modern horror flicks. the other good thing was the cast. i'm not saying that the acting was good, because it wasn't, but every actor/actress was hot and attractive.<br /><br />one of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so. the rest was quite boring. another down (or you could consider it an up if you want) is the excessive nudity. all 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the guys showed their butts for a long time. it's not that i'm against nudity, but this was a horror movie, not 'the dreamers'.<br /><br />unless you're very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl get naked for no reason, or you're a die-hard fan of debbie rochon, than this is the movie for you. but if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
