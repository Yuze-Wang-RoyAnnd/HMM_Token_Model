i didn't really know what this movie was about when i went to the theater to see it (hype about the satanism etc etc etc) as the trailers in the last movie i saw looked pretty interesting.<br /><br />oh dear, roman catholic mythology? not my idea of a good scare and honestly, i just felt like watching a really good, scary movie, not some loosely plotted religious farce that tries to score cheap thrills by having some chick getting bloody every few minutes!<br /><br />i'll try to keep away from the spoilers (!) but i found it very odd that an atheist, who gets a string of rosary beads from a deceased priest, could suddenly end up with christ's wounds (aren't stigmata supposed to be deeply religious??) i mean, she hangs out with losers, does loser stuff, behaves like a typical rebel et al, and here she is displaying the wounds of jesus christ?? come on!<br /><br />scenes of her crucified, head thrown back, screaming, blood everywhere, became rather tedious after seeing it a dozen times. it was neither frightening or scary, just repulsive. it did, however, become quite painful to watch - those flicking scenes were highly annoying...<br /><br />conclusion: if your a catholic, defintly don't see this. if you're not, still don't see it.
