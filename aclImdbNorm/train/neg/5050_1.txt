oh my, this was the worst reunion movie i have ever seen. (that is saying a lot.) i am ashamed of watching.<br /><br />what happened in the script meetings? "ooooooh, i know! let's have two stud muffins fall madly in love with the most-annoying-character-since-cousin-oliver." "yeah, that'll be cool!"<br /><br />even for sitcoms, this was the most implausible plot since ron popeil starting spray painting bald men.
