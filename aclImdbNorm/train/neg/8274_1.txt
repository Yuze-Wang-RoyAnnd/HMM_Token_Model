ahh this film had so much potential! a good cast of quality b actors, the thighs of jessica simpson and... that is about it!<br /><br />i believe some guy in some unnamed marketing department had an idea. basically, lets do a kind of legally blond film, but do it in new york. that big bright city of chances, power and money and where everyone is a heartless, power/money hungry person. let's add to this jessica simpson, small town bimbo, that brother of owen wilson and for some no apparent reason andy dick (only because of him you should ignore this film).<br /><br />basic story line:<br /><br />boy leaves girl for ny, girl follows, boy cheats, girl stays in ny with cousin, gets a job under false pretenses, mucks up, is courted by other boy (brother wilson) and together save the day and kiss.<br /><br />a few words come to mind when reflecting upon this film, i.e. dire, awful, unbearable, intolerable and xenophobic<br /><br />just don't watch this film, you will be happier. one reviewer referred to guantanamo and i definitely agree with him. this film induces shock. and i know what you are thinking... at least at some point will i see simpson naked or close too. it's not gonna happen, spare yourself the time and youtube her. you will have better sexy time!<br /><br />the films editing is flimsy, the acting is unbearable, and why do they use blue screens?<br /><br />in conclusion; this is cinematic treason which should be punished to the maximum<br /><br />another question why does willie nelson always play a kind of father figure in almost every jessica simpson flick and why are there no black, latin, asian or european people in this movie?
