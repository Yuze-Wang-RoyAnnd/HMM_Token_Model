well i must say this is probably the worst film i have seen this year! the jokes were extremely crude (wasn't expecting it from as pg movie)(rated pg in canada) and they weren't funny! with this great cast i at least expected some good acting but i didn't even get that. i am a huge rainn wilson fan and this is the first time i was extremely disappointed by his performance. neither luke wilosn or uma thurman's characters are the least bit likable and i really could have cared less what happened to either of them. i didn't expect this at all as in the past i have really liked other movies by this director (six days, seven nights for example) this movie was not worth the $10 it cost me and i strongly encourage you not to see this movie. i guarantee that you will be like me begging for this movie to be over.
