amy heckerling's second film johnny dangerously is a parody of 1930's gangster films made in the warner brothers' tradition. michael keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. keaton's mother (maureen stapleton) has continuing health problems, so keaton falls into crime at an early age via peter boyle. meanwhile, the fargan richard dimitri plays a rival crime lord to boyle and keaton eventually rises through the ranks. joe piscopo has a hilarious turn as danny vermin, yeah that's right, vermin! griffin dunne is keaton's younger brother turned district attorney, glynnis o'connor his wife, and marilu henner plays keaton's moll. the film looks notoriously cheap, making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film.<br /><br />the film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. due to the combination of dialog and gags, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. keaton chews the scenery doing his best james cagney impression. stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious, not funny. piscopo does the "once" bit one time too many. several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like danny devito, dom deluise, ray walston as a street vendor, alan hale, jr. as a desk sergeant, and sudie bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. the second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers. the closing scene utilizing the roaring twenties is an anachronism as is the call of the wild clark gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film. i think heckerling should have known better, since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of the roaring twenties' actual 1939 release date. *1/2 of 4 stars.
