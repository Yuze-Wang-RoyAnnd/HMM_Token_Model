okay. so there aren't really that many great movies around. recent gems like american dream, the straight story and even toy story 2 don't normally come so close together. but boy (!) does this film counter-balance the quality.<br /><br />i have no idea what these people thought they were doing. are the financiers in this world so easily convinced to fund such a crock of ****? i can just see it now...<br /><br />producer - "so we've got joe fiennes. he's cute as a button and was pretty good in shakespeare in love. and we've got rhys ifans, who isn't cute but was cool in notting hill. we'll mix in a really mediocre score, a few forgettable post-britpop tunes, hemlock root and lizard brains and hey presto you've got the worst film of the new millennium.and believe me, it's gonna be a hard job to make anything as bad as this in the next thousand years."<br /><br />the bank - "i like it! any unnecessary sex? bad camera movements? and what about the worst accents this side of devil's own?"<br /><br />producer - "yeah, we got plenty of those."<br /><br />the bank - "sounds great, where do we sign?"<br /><br />please.
