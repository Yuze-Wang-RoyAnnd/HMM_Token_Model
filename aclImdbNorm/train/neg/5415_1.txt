dil was a memorable movie that bring to the celluloid a great director like indra kumar. the movie followed with beta, ishq, raja & masti all of whom were superb.<br /><br />but then every successful director gives a few horrible movies alongwith some hits too. pyare mohan is one such movie.<br /><br />though the comedies are told nicely but then they fail the viewer to laugh. comparing with the kind of comedy movies being made today this is a dumb.<br /><br />if you really want to watch a movie and laugh, please don't watch this. because the pathetic comedy will make you cry only.<br /><br />in short, the movie is worth a miss.
