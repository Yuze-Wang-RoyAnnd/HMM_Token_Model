revenge of the sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting, then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series. the only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow--and i mean slow--build-up to what we know will be the birth of darth vader. and when that finally comes, it's pretty all right. not great. not even good. but pretty all right. this movie is being vastly over-praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels. instead it's just turgid, dull, and routine. but you have to say, wow, those cgi environments are really impressive at times. bu the lightsabre fights? they're all a blurry mess. i think the dark side took hold of lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed. this will make a ton of money, but thank god it's over, this once-worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough. i saw the 12:01 show, and after it, i heard a group of very small kids say, wow that was awesome! but everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing: i fell asleep in the middle. it was kind of boring. i just thought seeing the birth of darth vader would be better. so said we all.
