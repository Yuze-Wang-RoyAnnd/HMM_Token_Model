from around the time europe began fighting world war ii, until the war's end, hollywood (with significant prodding from the government) made tons of movies which were designed to try and get young men to enlist in the army, by making the life of a serviceman appear "cool." this is by far the sloppiest, implying that the life of a soldier is devoid of work, you get the best food, and you get to lie around all day listening to ann miller on the radio. i am far too young to have participated in wwii, but i think that there was more to it than that. there is the barest cat's whisker of a plot, and a bunch of musical numbers featuring some of the day's leading acts.<br /><br />i think that by 1943, even the most naive of civvies knew that there was more going on overseas than the wacky hijinks portrayed in this movie. while i am sure that it was meant to be viewed as escapist entertainment, i can't help but wonder if the family and loved ones of men fighting in the war, were amused or repulsed by this trivialization of their loved ones' sacrifice.
