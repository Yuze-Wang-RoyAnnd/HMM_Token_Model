marlon brando had long since lost interest in acting when he made this film. his performance as "the swede" is the worst of his career, and that is precisely what he intended it to be. he doesn't overact. instead, he simply acts in a bizarre fashion and pokes fun at his embarrassingly gargantuan girth. the scene where brando climbs over the toilet stall is probably the worst, funniest moment in the history of cinema. as we witness him fall head-first into a toilet, it is hard to believe that we are watching the same actor who starred in a streetcar named desire, on the waterfront, and the godfather.<br /><br />i guess the real question is why marlon behaved like this in his later years. was he sick of the movie business? did he just like making a complete and utter fool out of himself? i guess we'll never know. but this film serves as a fascinating study as to what bad acting is all about.<br /><br />on that note, watch fellow acting veteran donald sutherland as he struggles to deliver his lines, embarrassed at himself for agreeing to participate in this travesty.
