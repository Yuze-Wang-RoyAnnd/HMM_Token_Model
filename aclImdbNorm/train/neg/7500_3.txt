spike lee has to be one of the most over rated directors i have ever seen. he is the critic's darling because he supposedly makes films with a "message" or he is just so bohemian in his approach that it makes critics that are waterlogged from formula hollywood films eat his stuff up just for being different.<br /><br />summer of sam does not even do that well. the cinematography and editing style is oliver stone, and so is the narrative. the plot is a lot like "do the right thing". the portrayal of "guidos" or for the pc set italian-americans (of which i happen to be one) is straight out of eddie murphy's raw. only eddie murphy's impression of a macho italian guy picking a fight with a much taller african-american is much, much more believable than the cartoonish, broad italian caricatures shown here (the john leguizamo character being a possible exception).<br /><br />is there anybody who saw this movie that could not figure out how it was going to end up? as soon as richie came into the film i could already see the fist in his face and the foot in his stomach, i could already see him being accused of being the killer. this character had the most integrity in the whole film so, of course, lee is going to show what happens to people that stand out in a crowd (what a white bearded clique!)<br /><br />someone please, please give spike lee a lifetime pass to all the basketball games he wants. so, maybe he will be enjoying himself too much to pick up a film camera for a long time and we won't have to be subjected to his self important drivel and furthermore i won't have to see critics (some of them whom i respect) ohhhh and ahhhh to an emperor with no clothes.
