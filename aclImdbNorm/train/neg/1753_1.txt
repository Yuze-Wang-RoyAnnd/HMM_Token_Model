dietrich bonhoeffer's writings have had a profound influence on my life as a christian, and i eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life. words can hardly express my disappointment. this movie was disjointed...it gave no background about his life, no historical context, and nothing about his great writings (except a brief, passing reference to "the cost of discipleship" by a colleague at the beginning of the movie.) instead, we see him enjoying jazz (apparently in the states) and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to germany. apparently to show his human side. ok, i'm ready for the dramatic part. the part where he stands up for his faith. instead of emphasizing that, we get a very badly acted romance with a 17-year-old schoolgirl. whether or not that actually took place, it should not have been a major portion of the movie. now...still waiting for the dramatic part, or some narration explaining what his writings were all about...or something to make us know a little bit of the greatness of this man. drum-roll.....waiting..... ....waiting.....zip. nada. this is the kind of movie that gives "christian films" a bad name. all they had to do was set up a structure for the movie to follow, with some background...even some voice-overs, or flashbacks to him preaching from his works...some narrative about who he was and where he had been. but no...this is what we got. hardly fitting for a hero of the faith.
