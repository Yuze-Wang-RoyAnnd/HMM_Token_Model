the movie began well enough. it had a fellow get hit by a glowing green meteorite, getting superpowers (telekinesis, x-ray vision, invulnerability, flight, the ability to speak to dogs, superspeed, heat vision, and the ability to make plants grow large and quickly), and fighting crime. from there on it's all downhill.<br /><br />meteor man gets a costume from his mom, fights with the resident gangs, and has many aborted encounters with the gang leaders which serves to set you up for the disappointing, overlong, and stupefying ending.<br /><br />it wouldn't be so remarkably bad if it weren't like watching a boxing match where the two fighters pretend to hit each other while the audience stands looking onward while the fighters just continue to dance.<br /><br />despite all of this nonsense the movie has good points. it states clearly that if you try to take on a gang alone then they'll come back to your home and hurt you. it states that gangs & communities need to see their real enemies (the big bosses that use them for their own ends to crush honest people into a ghetto existence). it also states that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community do destroy the predators that harm them. the only message it really lacks is that the voters should ensure their elected officials (rudolph giuliani, marion barry, ronald reagan, george w. bush, & george h.w. bush) aren't crooks too.<br /><br />
