the tv productions at the 2000's start were between weak and bad. before marks like (alias, lost, prison break, desperate housewives, or monk) the tv didn't have the right hit yet, which could capture the attention and the interests of the 2000s' viewer. titles like (relic hunter), (mutant x), (the lost world), (sheena), or even (baywatch hawaii) weren't encouraging for you to watch and follow, or at least weren't that captivating and interesting all the time as what preceded them. (special unit 2) was no exception. in fact it's men in black meets the x files' spoof ! (as if these were the special unit 1). but even according to this brilliant formula; it didn't work well. it was promising; at the time there was some saturation out of the "supernatural" cases after a decade of many x files already, so the natural spirit to lampoon it naughtily too (imagine mulder as womanizer !). however (special unit 2) wasn't the strongest in this, or a strong when it comes to make a comic sci-fi show. it was highly ridiculous, where for instance every sexy situation must turn into ugly disgusting one. it enjoyed that bad taste sickeningly. (michael landes) was non-charismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian. his chemistry with (alexondra lee), as well as any supposed sexual attention, was all languid. sure the show got a funny look but overall it was unfunny work. it's clear that there was nothing more interesting than its main idea. among (evan katz)'s other works as a co-writer and a co-producer like (seven days) before or (24) later this must be a low point !. despite the distinctive personality, it managed to be a silly jest for most of the time. therefore if that was there goal, so they made one of the silliest indeed ! and truly, it would be one of the rarest times to be thankful for the cancellation of a show after 19 episodes of it only !
