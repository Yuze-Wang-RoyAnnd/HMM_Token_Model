kenneth branagh attempts to turn william shakspeare's obscure, rarely-produced comedy into a 1930s-era musical, with the result being both bad shakespeare and bad musical comedy as the actors are rarely adept at one or the other of the two styles and in some cases flounder badly in both. particularly painful is nathan lane, who seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as costard but is badly mistaken, and alicia silverstone who handles the shakespearean language with all the authority of a teenaged valley girl who is reading the script aloud in her middle school english class.<br /><br />the musical numbers are staged with the expertise of a high school production of "dames at sea," leaving the cast looking awkward and amateurish while singing and dancing, with the lone exception being adrian lester who proves himself a splendid song and dance man. the only other saving grace of the film are natascha mcelhone and emily mortimer's contribution as eye candy, but they have given far better performances than in this film and you'd be wise to check out some of the other titles in their filmographies and gives this witless mess a pass.
