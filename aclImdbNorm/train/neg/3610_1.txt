a patient escapes from a mental hospital, killing one of his keepers and then a university professor after he makes his way to the local college. next semester, the late prof's replacement and a new group of students have to deal with a new batch of killings. the dialogue is so clich'ed it is hard to believe that i was able to predict lines in quotes. this is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the '80's. despite killing the heroine off, this is just substandard junk. horrible acting, horrible script, horrible effects, horrible horrible horrible!! "splatter university" is just gunk to put in your vcr when you have nothing better to do, although i suggest watching your head cleaner tape, that would be more entertaining. skip it and rent "girl's nite out" instead.<br /><br />rated r for strong graphic violence, profanity, brief nudity and sexual situations.
