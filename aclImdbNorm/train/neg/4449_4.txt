"sleeping with the enemy" is a predictable, 'been there before' thriller that never seems to find any inspiration no matter how desperately cast and crew try. i can't believe a bunch of my friends talked me into seeing this at the movies some sixteen years ago.<br /><br />the complete lack of originality from the ronald bass screenplay (based upon the nancy price novel) does not help, nor does the stale direction of joseph ruben or the very average performance from julia roberts. the supporting cast including patrick bergin and kevin anderson do little to help.<br /><br />there really isn't a lot to say. just give it a miss.<br /><br />sunday, april 14, 1991 - hoyts cinema centre melbourne
