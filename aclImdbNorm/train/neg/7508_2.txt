i wish spike lee had chosen a different title for his film. "summer of sam" conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer, david berkowitz. it's not. it's a gritty, earthy portrait of nyc street life during the hot summer of '77 when berkowitz terrorized that city.<br /><br />the film follows several young fictional characters in an italian-american neighborhood, and their reactions to the son of sam threat. there's vinny and his wife dionna; there's richie and ruby, and several other characters.<br /><br />the problem is that these characters are not likable. they are routinely annoying, and at times unbearable. lee then belabors their high energy, chaotic lives, which are filled with anger, lust, and general turmoil. there are at least two protracted fight scenes between vinny and his wife, redundant disco dance scenes, countless gabfests ... over and over i kept wondering: where's the film editor?<br /><br />meanwhile, with all that bulk, the film passes up the chance to convey any real sense of fear or dread arising from the son of sam menace, which is too much in the background. lee is more successful at showing a different kind of menace, that arising from neighborhood vigilante groups.<br /><br />the acting is uniformly good. that, combined with 70's disco music, and lavish attention to costumes and production design, make you really feel like you are in an italian-american neighborhood in nyc in 1977.<br /><br />the film's atmospheric authenticity, however, is not nearly enough to offset a rambling, overblown script about the lives of grossly irritating people.
