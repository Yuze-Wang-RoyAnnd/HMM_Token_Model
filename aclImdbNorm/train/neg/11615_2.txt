though not a fan of sam rockwell, i was surprised when i saw his name in the credits in the opening of 'joshua.' heck, i wasn't even aware he was in 'joshua' until i started the movie. so it goes without saying, i was watching the movie on the basis of the movie, not the leads. a sort of 'rosemary's baby,' 'the omen' or any other demonic kid movie 'joshua' was billed. unfortunately, it fell flat. slow, incredibly slow, and flat. yet, i continued on to see how this would all resolve, hoping beyond belief, the ending climax would shed some light on the subject. okay, i admit, it did (a wee bit) but what a stale closing. and what a low-low budget movie, or at least that's how they designed it. a person falls
