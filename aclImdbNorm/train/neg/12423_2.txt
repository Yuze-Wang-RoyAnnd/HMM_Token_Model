cage (1989) was another one of those low budget "buddy" action flicks that were produced during the 80's thanks in large part due to the films such as 48hrs. and lethal weapon. this one stars reb brown and lou ferrigno as to former vietnam vets who happen to run a local dive bar. reb takes care of lou because he saved his life in 'nam. but lou was shot in the head and is now pretty soft. although he's huge, lou has the brain of a child. one day some ruffians throw their wait around in the bar and lou and rebb beat the tar out of them. but payback's a mother. they crash the bar leaving lou and reb with nothing. that is until these two thugs come into the picture (one of them's a real nice guy) who have a plan in mind.<br /><br />the film's a waste of time. maybe if they went all they way and made a hard core action flick instead of trying to tone down the gruesomeness of the situation perhaps it could have worked. alas, it doesn't and the audience is left holding the bag. oh well. it's too bad because you have all the elements for a great b-movie. better luck next time, i guess.<br /><br />not recommended.<br /><br />xxx
