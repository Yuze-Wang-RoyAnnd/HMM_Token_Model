this anime series starts out great: interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully rendered and executed. not everything is explained right away, dangling a proverbial carrot before the viewer, enticing the viewer to watch each succeeding episode. but imagine the disappointment to find that the sci-fi thriller/giant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psycho-babble and quasi-religious preachy exploitation. if you want to hear "you're ok. it's good to be you." after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters' negative emotions, then this is for you. if you want a good sci-fi flick that is simply fun to watch, forget this one. both the original, and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me. all that, and this movie was too preachy.
