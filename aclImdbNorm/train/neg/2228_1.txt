this movie is weak ,the box-cover says east la's toughest gang and it is really santa ana's , james cahill acts like a closet queen taking down all the tough guys in the tough chlo gang . it is fake , boring , senseless and whack , i tried to get my money back from the video store this movie was so bad . it was also on the homo-erotic tip far from what the video-box proclaims . james cahill should act in gay porno .james is in every scene , he cannot act to save his life . the film features eva longoria who is hot but james can't even score with her !!!!!!!!! i felt at times i was watching gay porn and was turned - off by the whole film . james clearly want's to be with men but rather then submit to his gay desires he beats up gang members over and over and over again . his martial arts skills are minimal at best , some real gang members would take him and his weak skills and rip him a new one .
