first of all, this is a low-budget movie, so my expectations were incredibly low going into it. i assume most people looking at the info for this movie just wanted a bloodfest, and essentially that's all it is.<br /><br />plot? there really is none. it's basically saw but in china and a whole hell of a lot worse. cast? there is none, period. special effects? absolutely awful in my opinion... there were cutaways and the blood was often completely unbelievable because of amounts, splatter, color, texture, etc.<br /><br />i believe the purpose of this movie was supposed to be a brutal, shock film. now it had some great potential on a bigger budget but poor scripting, poor dialogue, awful acting, what seemed like camcorder video shots, and just plain unbelievable "gore," made this movie truly awful.<br /><br />there are movies worth taking a chance against some reviews, even "b-rate" movies deserve some opportunities (blood trails for example was the most recent i saw against reviews that was worth it), but this was simply awful. i hope that people considering this movie read my comment and decide against it.<br /><br />i'm all for brutality and shock, but the overall unrealism and truly awful acting makes for an awful experience. save your time/money and chance something else, you won't be disappointed.
