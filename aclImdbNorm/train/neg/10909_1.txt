this is a very bad movie. i laughed once or twice, and the storyline sucks! there is maybe one funny joke, it is stupid and it is boring. through the whole short movie, i was falling asleep and wondering when it was going to end.<br /><br />no one acts human, and everyone acts stupid and ridiculous. rob schneider acting like an animal isn't something i would pay to see. it looked funny, but the bottom line: don't waste you're precious time on such a ridiculous and stupid movie.<br /><br />i was wondering when it was going to end, even though it is a short movie. in the beginning we thought it would get better; but it gets worse. stupid, all the way to the end. i walked out of the theater, and i would remember that movie as extremely bad forever.<br /><br />the writer and co-producer of this film is a simpsons tv writer, but this is nothing like the simpsons (this movie sucks!!!)
