i don't think i've ever felt this let down by a film before. after loving guy ritchie's two previous films (i don't count swept away - he was pussy blind), i was so looking forward to seeing this. <br /><br />the reviews were poor, then again, i don't trust the press anyway. more worrying was the fact that the internet buzz was that this was a bit of a stinker, so it was with some trepidation i handed over my lb4.80 yesterday afternoon.<br /><br />i'm not even going to try to explain this film, mainly because i haven't got a clue what was going on and at one point i was honestly close to standing up and asking if it was just me who didn't get it! <br /><br />unfortunately i think ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife's trap of taking himself far too seriously.it seems it wasn't good enough for him to make films with good plots, laughs, snappy dialogue and good characters. it's almost as if he had a checklist of films he wanted to rip off, here are some of the ones i noticed:<br /><br />the matrix, fight club, kill bill, the usual suspects, vanilla sky...<br /><br />i think the most frustrating thing is that the performances from the two main actors, jason statham and ray liotta, were actually very good and it was really the self indulgent story and editing / direction that let the film down.<br /><br />so a big, big thumbs down from me.
