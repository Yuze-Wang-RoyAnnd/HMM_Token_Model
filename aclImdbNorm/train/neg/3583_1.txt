if there was a scale below 1, it would get a -10, following in the footsteps of godspell. the acting (if there was such a thing) was atrocious, the plot in shambles. and rene russo was sickeningly sweet in her role, enough to make a person retch. ten thumbs down for a dumb movie. saving grace: kudos for era costuming.
