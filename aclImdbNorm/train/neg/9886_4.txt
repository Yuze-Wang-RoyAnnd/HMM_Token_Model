this is peter falk's film. period.<br /><br />i was 10 years old when this film came out; i was already a film maven at the time. of course neither my parents nor i saw this film when it came out, but i was in love with the typeface of its ads & the aura that this was an important film. okay, 34 years later i've finally seen the film--having never seen any cassavetes-directed film previously. he's a hack, overall. zero sense of timing, editing. gena's performance reminds me too much of dustin hoffman's stint in "rain man": technically on par but entirely one-note. as tom cruise stole "rain man," falk takes the cake for this film.<br /><br />i was annoyed with gena's performance, really throughout--it seemed better suited for "awakenings" (blecch!). it's not all her fault: she's a basket case from first scene to last. we never find out why?? but falk's character seems real & is performed wonderfully by falk as a seriously flawed man.<br /><br />shave off at least an hour (an editor needed!), and this would have been an arresting portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple, cro-magnon, man coming to grips with a wife who doesn't work & yet cannot deal with her three kids & her husband's long hours of work.<br /><br />i'd rather remember cassavetes for "the dirty dozen" or "rosemary's baby." he would have been a better director had he snipped his own tendency for excess--as he amply demonstrates with this film.<br /><br />bob
