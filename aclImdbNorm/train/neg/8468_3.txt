"they are among us" is poor science fiction at best. mediocre acting bogs down this film. the plot holes are numerous. aliens that somehow came to earth on a meteor and have been hiding among us for over 100 years, but need a plastic surgeon to make them appear human. in their alien form they supposedly have exo-skeletons (which is why they need the plastic surgery) but when you see them they have teeth and fingernails. the heroine's father "disappeared" after project blue book closed, but was supposedly an f-16 pilot. and on and on. if you want to see an alien invasion movie, pick "invasion of the body snatchers", and see how it is done right.
