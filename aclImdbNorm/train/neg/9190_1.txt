this is by far the worst movie i have ever watched. i've seen some pretty awful movies in my time but this ones takes the cake, no, wait, i mean the the whole damn bakery. it is so bad that i believe a word to describe the way you will feel after watching this atrocity has yet to be created. please just do yourself a favor, if you ever get the urge to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur barney, then multiply that thirty times fold and you would still only get a small fraction of the horror you would be in store for. in summation, i guess you really can call it a horror movie, but only if you're willing to be scared senseless by the worst acting in the business and utterly pointless story.<br /><br />real rating, -10 disgusting
