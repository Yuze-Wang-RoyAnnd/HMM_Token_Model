at least the seats in the theater were comfortable and i ate the pop corn as loud as possible to drown out the inferior dialogue. this is absolutely not a girls film. any blokes who like it, are the ones us ladies can be sure to stay far away from. dumb story, mediocre dialogue and an overall cheap looking film. i've seen many, many movies but this one is the new winner in the bad category. if you do happen to see it, the one thing you'll look forward to is the ending. so you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can.
