thank g_d it bombed, or we might get treated to such delights as "skate fu" where we can see the likes of brian boitano performing a triple lutz & slashing bad guys to ribbons with his razor-sharp skates, but i digress. one thing that could have helped this turkey would have been a little t & a from ms. agbayani. it's not like the world would have seen anything new (at least that part of the world who saw her playboy spread.) i truly believe that porn would have suited her 'talents' much better, although aubrey hepburn couldn't have stayed afloat in this sewer. one explanation for kurt thomas' presence could be a traumatic brain injury, possibly from coming up short too often on dismounts. it's a good thing the ioc wasn't as diligent on 'doping' as they are now, or kurt would surely have been stripped of his medals. to be avoided at all costs.
