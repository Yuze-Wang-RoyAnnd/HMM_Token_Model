this was far and away the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire life. it was slow, boring, not scary, not funny, not dramatic, not entertaining.<br /><br />sarah michelle gellar was up to her old playbook of empty expressions of fright and shock. she couldn't sell her character nor could anyone else in the picture.<br /><br />for those who thought the grudge was 'kind of alright' then don't go see this unless you get enjoyment out of wasting your time and your life.<br /><br />i saw this movie for free by the way so i don't want this to come across as a rant from a guy that lost 8 bucks on a terrible movie. it was free, it still sucked, i hated it.<br /><br />avoid.
