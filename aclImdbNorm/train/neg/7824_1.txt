i saw the movie last night and i really wanted to like it. my expectations for the movie had been going up and down ever since i heard it was being made. some days i'd see something spectacular and some days i'd be disappointed.<br /><br />yet being the kind of fan i am, i had high hopes for this movie but in the end i was sorely disappointed.<br /><br />while i love the richard donner movies i didn't like their sometimes campy nature or the changes they made to superman's character and his powers.<br /><br />singer however chose to take the worst elements of the donner movies and put them in his version.<br /><br />while his lex luthor is slightly darker he's still nothing more than a shyster, a conman and a common criminal. he's no more intelligent than when gene hackman played him. kevin spacey does his best to play luthor well but ultimately he falls victim to shoddy writing and unremarkable dialog.<br /><br />his henchmen are more two dimensional than even comic book henchmen. most of them literally have no dialog in the movie.<br /><br />****spoilers ahead**** kitty kowalski is almost exactly the same character as ms. tesmacher. she seems to be as evil and cold as lex luthor but she proves to be just an underling who melts after seeing superman in trouble and quite predictably betrays luthor.<br /><br />the biggest disappointment in the movie was frank langella as perry white. i wasn't a huge fan of the over the top perry white in the donner movies but at least he had a soul. he was after all said and done, a veteran reporter who cared about the truth and a good story. langella's perry white is nothing but a corporate stooge. he wants everyone to concentrate on the superman related stories because they sell papers even though every other paper is doing the same thing. he doesn't care about the real stories, the real mysteries like the black out and what lex luthor is up to now that he's out of prison.<br /><br />the worst thing about langella is that he's dull! some actors can be quiet and sober and yet have an undercurrent that lets you know that still waters run deep. frank langella is puddle.<br /><br />brandon routh is not a bad actor. he's ok but again there is not a single memorable line in the whole movie. not the actor's fault. his movements are clearly meant to look graceful, like even the slightest movement of his fingers effects the way he flies. but it still looks choreographed and artificial.<br /><br />lois lane while badly written was surprisingly well acted by kate bosworth. unfortunately, again, for a pulitzer prize winning journalist and writer, she is about as eloquent as any teenage on dawson's creek.<br /><br />james marsden was my favorite actor in the whole movie, mostly because he looks more like superman than even routh. without any superpowers he manages to figure out lois lane's message, flies a plane to the location, gets on board luthor's yacht and rescues lois and her son.<br /><br />the only moving moment in the movie is when they are all trapped pantry as it is flooding with water and the ship is sinking. you see them slowly going being immersed in the water. you know superman's going to come by at the last moment to rescue them but still you can't help but feel sorry for them.<br /><br />as i said before the plot is very haphazard. unlike singer has said, this is not a movie about a superhero returning and trying to find his place in the world. as soon as he returns the world welcomes him back with open arms. lois is the only one who's not happy to see him back. even luthor is happy to have superman back because it gives him a chance to settle the score with the man of steel.<br /><br />superman is shown to be probably one of the dumbest heroes in the universe. a big green piece of meteorite is stolen from a museum, lex luthor is out of prison, he now has knowledge about superman's powers and weaknesses, and yet he's still not able to connect the dots enough to know luthor would be using kryptonite against him.<br /><br />according to the movie the only thing superman is good for is lifting really, really heavy things. the action sequences are all incredibly predictable.
