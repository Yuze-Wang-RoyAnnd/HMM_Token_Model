i thought that i was never going to find a horror movie as bad as "the return of the texas chainsaw massacre", but this film compete with it.<br /><br />i'm not a person that get asleep when watching a movie, but i did it 15 minutes after the trance started. i woke up, and started to watching it agian. why did i deserve that? all the movie was a torture, i have to use fast forward to watch it complete.<br /><br />i can't stand why one of my favourites actors of all time (mr. walken) could done this thing. i have to think that he made the director a favor, or he was really in the need of money, because film after film he is doing, he is ruining himself; and so fast...<br /><br />what about the movie? it's not scary, stupid plot, characters are awful (but i really liked the one played by jared harris), effects are very poor, lack of deaths & blood, etc; in three words, it has anything. and i mean it. can't stand how a director can make a film like this.<br /><br />anyway, when i got more disappointed was when i saw in the video cover, that the film was presented by "stephen king", i think he could never present this crap, no? (i rented it in argentina). i not recommend it in a million years.<br /><br />i rate this movie with a 2 out of 10. (as i say in my "return of the texas chainsaw massacre" review, there will be always a worse movies, thats why it don't deserves a 1 out of 10)
