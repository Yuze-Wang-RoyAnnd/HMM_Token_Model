*spoilers*<br /><br />i'm sure back when this was released in 1958 it was much appropriate for its time. back then films were slower paced to allow audiences to follow and analyze the story. here a man moves into a house owned by his last wife that died mysteriously with his new wife. the gardener mickey (played by alex nicol, who also directed he film) really is an underappreciated character. he gets a skull to indirectly warn jenni that she is in trouble, since he knew that there was foul play in the first wife's death. he can't tell jenni directly what happened, so he tries to scare her off with the skull. jenni, we also find out, saw her parents die, thus causing a lifetime of mental anguish that lead to institutionalization. like many audiences today, i found the pacing to be a little too slow for my tastes. but if you like slow-paced horror without a lot of gore, this film is for you.<br /><br />
