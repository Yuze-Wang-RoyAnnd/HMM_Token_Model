without a doubt, this is one of the worst pictures i ever actually paid money to see - the kind of flick you choose out of desperation at the mall cinema during a christmas holiday when you have missed the start times for anything good but still are dead set on seeing a movie! and that is exactly how i came to see this stink bomb...<br /><br />at the distance of the better part of three decades i can still smell the rotting fish that constitute this story line. unbelievable plot - that a killer whale carries a grudge against an individual not of the sea - is laughable. and that's about all, except for a completely out-of-place "love theme" that plays over the finish of a film devoid of a love story. at least charlotte rampling is lovely (in a two dimensional role) but richard harris just chews up the scenery. he was no captain quint (robert shaw) and this is no "jaws". mercifully, i have put most of it out of mind and when i run across it on television air casts i move on immediately. "danger, will robinson!" see the current t.v. commercial showing a husband and wife whale-watching ("orca - i love orca...") - at least it is over in sixty seconds. this flick represents 92 minutes of my life that i will never get back.
