what a terrible film. it sucked. it was terrible. i don't know what to say about this film but dinocrap, which i stole from some reviewer with a nail up his ass. ahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sigh.. it's not roger corman that i hate, it's this god-awful movie. well, really? but what can you expect from a movie with homoeric computer graphics. which is another thing, the cgi sucked out loud; i hate this movie dreadfully. this is without a doubt the worst roger corman b-movie, and probably the gayest b-movie too. it's-it's--- dinocrap! i'm sorry, i must have offended some nerds in these moments. it's just an awful movie... 0/1,000
