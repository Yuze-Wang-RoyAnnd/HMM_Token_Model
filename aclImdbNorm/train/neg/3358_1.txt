the haunting. a remake, of course. the original was a creepy psychological thriller, and one that has improved with time. compared to this 1999 remake, it's a classic. there is no character development here, only caricatures (the slut, the authoritative brain, the "i'm gonna get us outta here" fellow, the oh so sensitive bookworm). but, seeing as how the were banking on the special effects being the "star", i guess characters that you can empathize with are a secondary concern. unfortunately, the effects are laughable. mewing cherubs, stretchy doors, irritating dead children that can't speak plainly ... and an idiotically sappy ending that does it's darnedest to give you a new age enema of butterflies and rainbows. ill take my skittles orally, thank you. bruce dern, i've liked you since "the cowboys". stop it.
