i always thought people were a little too cynical about these old andy hardy films. a couple of them weren't bad. modern film critics are not ones who usually prefer nice to nasty, so goody-two shoes movies like these rarely get praise<br /><br />nonetheless, i can't defend this movie either. you can still have an dated dialog but still laugh and cry over the story. watching this, you just shake your head ask yourself, "how stupid can you get?" this is cornier than corny, if you know what i mean. it is so corny i cannot fathom too many people actually sitting through the entire hour-and-a-half.<br /><br />the story basically is "andy" (mickey rooney) trying to get out of jam because he makes up some story about involved with some d'ebutante from new york city as if that was the ultimate. people were a lot more social-conscious in the old days. you'd hear the term "social-climber" as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make it life. it's all utter nonsense, of course, and looks even more so today.<br /><br />however, it's about as innocent and clean a story and series (there were a half dozen of these andy hardy films made) as you could find. also, if you like to hear judy garland sing, then this is your ticket, as she sings a couple of songs in here and she croons her way into andy's heart. oh man, i almost throw up even writing about this!
