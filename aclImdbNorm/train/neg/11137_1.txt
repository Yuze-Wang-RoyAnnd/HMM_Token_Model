all the bare chested women in the world couldn't keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish. with the derisory acting, equally terrible script plus the poor cgi fx to match; this movie is an insult to the werewolf genre. it is supposed to be serious, which in itself would be funny if this film could even make it to the level of being a bad joke.<br /><br />this is one of those movies where the people behind the camera are obviously competent but are too lazy to make something even one quarter decent. avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic werewolf movies instead.<br /><br />0 out of 10!
