saw this piece of work at a film fest in ca. my god, what was the director thinking? film professors should use this film as a case study on what not to do when making a short film. first off, this project makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. the film takes place partially in "the waystation", some stupid vapid bar in the middle of nowhere, where nothing really takes place.<br /><br />the acting is beyond bad. so bad in fact that i almost thought it was a comedy. the lead actress julia reading is a step below the acting in most amateur porn films. there is one or two decent performances, including the guys who played jacob and fenner but it's like the director had no clue on how to work or use his thespians. the only thing worse than the acting was the dialogue, which bordered on absurd. the writer (whom i assume is also the director) writes each character like they are auditioning for a comic book villain.<br /><br />the overall production value is pretty good, but to be honest, with a film this bad it's easy to overlook it. the production design is pretty good, although the waystation looks like any ordinary bar. the costumes and make-up are okay, and i understand the production was working with a low budget. it's just when the characters speak, or they try and push the plot forward, the film unravels into a muck of crap.<br /><br />as i've said, this film is god awful. it's like the director/writer watched a lot of sci-fi films and threw all the parts he liked into a blender and came up with this. my only hope is that he used other people's money on this, because if he used his own, he's a total sucker.
