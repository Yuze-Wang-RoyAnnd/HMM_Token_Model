okay, i've tried and i've tried, but i still don't get this guy maddin thing. tales from the gimli hospital left me cold, that movie about the austrian villagers and the one about the ice nymph were pretty to look but lacking in the story department...and this nudie movie about abortion and hockey is just boring. i'm glad maddin has an appreciation for silent film, but i dislike his films for the same reason i dislike the films of quentin tarantino: they're empty homages to better, more imaginative films--films that advanced the art form or broke new ground--and are all style and no substance. no amount of jump cuts and odd camera angles can disguise the fact that maddin is an unoriginal david lynch wannabe, though he does have one advantage over tarantino: he generally doesn't write embarrassing dialogue, because most of his films rely on intertitles. the bottom line is, maddin's schtick is clever clever film-making for aspiring film majors.
