there were good performances by robin williams and others but the movie was dull overall and very disappointing compared to the positive reviews.<br /><br />i thought sy might become a serial killer who bores people to death: a forlorn guy in ugly clothes trails his victims around food courts, quoting oprah and reciting his medical history until they beg him to shoot them.<br /><br />i think the movie mostly appeals to egomaniacs who think strangers are interested in their photos. i expect most retail workers want a break from the customers.
