storyline: the film spanning 4-odd hours covers in adequate details the happenings at the kargil sector near the loc in 1999 when the pakistani infiltrators had crossed the loc and had entered deep into the indian territory and the indian retaliation. to know more about the story, i would suggest readers to read the news-items pertaining to kargil.<br /><br />comment: if one is looking for a formula story in this movie, then one can be sure that it is absent. loc is a story of pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and lots and lots of bullets and blood. the movie hall where i saw this film was full of whistles and cheers when the film shows indian bravery. movie audience seemed similar to audiences like in an india vs pak cricket match.<br /><br />watch the movie as a tribute to the army's sacrifice and for the characterization of the real-life war heroes (4 pvc honoured heroes) who have sacrificed their lives so that we could see this day. the movie has made a brilliant portrayal of the army who have battled all odds in rough weather conditions. the film's negatives are that it is too stretched and the songs are extremely boring.
