clocking in at an interminable three hours and twenty minutes, "salaam-e-ishq" is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from india that regales us with six interwoven tales of romantic love (which is at least four tales too many in my estimation).<br /><br />filmed like a cross between an mtv music video and a super bowl beer commercial, the movie is a sprawling mishmash of exotic settings, dazzling colors, sexy showgirls, high-stepping song-and-dance numbers, dream and fantasy sequences, winking character asides, corny dialogue and way-over-the-top comical performances - all pretty much standard-issue stuff when it comes to bollywood happenings these days. it's an exhausting chore just trying to keep all the characters straight as they dance, prance and preen their way through the incomprehensible storyline.<br /><br />there's plenty for the viewer to feast his eyes on here - not least of all all the drop dead gorgeous women - but he'll need the patience of job to get him all the way through it.
