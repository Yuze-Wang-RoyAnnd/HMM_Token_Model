what a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject. there is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment.the dancers keep talking about their art as if it has no erotic component. they may not all be prostitutes for hire, but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered. from the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then end up hiring the "dancers" for private sessions. even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the "dancers" only playing to the women in the audience. this just isn't the reality of these clubs. it would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples. so what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients? we learn very little. instead we get filler. a gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers. a manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag acts but offers no insight into the dancers' lives and attitudes.<br /><br />the pictures of mexico city are generic. the phallic montage showing sausages roasting is ridiculous.<br /><br />this is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing. the rest of the movie is an insult to gay men.
