no cinematic achievements here, however that's not even the important question. how does it fare in its endeavour to be a competent date movie--and star vehicle?<br /><br />the formula requires the cute female lead a la ryan or aniston--check; there's a built-in tv audience!<br /><br />add thick-headed, compliant men, usually including the problem ex-boyfriend/fianc'ee--check. <br /><br />assemble a plot that maximizes the bankability of the stars. so far, so good.<br /><br />what is the male lead to consist of? he has to make all the women in the movie and in the audience (and the gay flight stewards) instantly swoon. but...he cannot be so hunky as to threaten to the male audience, and he can't outshine the star. roll cameras...<br /><br />the problem is messing thinks she's still in a sitcom...she has only one presentation: as the wide-eyed doormat that she's made a career out of. a capable actress might have pulled it off after the love scene, where things promptly nosedive into the soap suds. <br /><br />you can't help feeling good for mulroney...you can read it in his face that he sees through all of this. he's gotten all the respect of a lifetime .260 hitter. this time, he smacks one out to the warning track, and no one can figure out what to do, as he amusedly takes home plate.
