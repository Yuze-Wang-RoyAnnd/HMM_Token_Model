the screen writing is so dumb it pains me to have wasted 2 hours of my life i'll never get back (where have i heard this before). the acting is so-so. things change often enough to keep you watching and waiting for something gruesome to happen. nevertheless there isn't a single original thing in this movie. while the first cube was a nerdy horror movie, which didn't make a whole lot of sense in the end, cube zero has picked up on that and tries to retell exactly the same story, except this time it makes an obnoxious point of trying to spoon-feed explanations for every detail that the first movie didn't answer. the comic thing is, the director recycles the exact scenes of the first movie that were somewhat weird, and tries to explain them. but the scenes are just copied over, there is no coherence whatsoever. this script is sooo pointless. i can imagine it being written by some half-wit 15 year old with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project. the best part is in the end, they cripple the 'good' wunderkind guy, and he becomes the retarded fellow in the first movie, and you see him when they find him ('this room is green..') in cube 1997. goodie gooodie, clap clap, what a twist. first of all, what about if you haven't seen the first one, this doesn't make any sense you nitwit director. oh, another great idea: instead of the numbers to identify x,y,z coordinates of the room (cube 1997), this time it is 3 letters, each one giving one of 26 possible coordinate values. duh. except now permutations don't make much sense anymore..so he lets the letters disappear before anybody can use them..i want my money back.<br /><br />i guess i had to write this down since there are just so many bad, inconsistent, or just stupid ideas in this movie. directors/writers should be required to possess some talent.
