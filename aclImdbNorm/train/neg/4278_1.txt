just picked up this film for a buck at national wholesale liquidators, and after watching it, i feel like i got ripped-off.<br /><br />i don't know that i've seen a worse film than this. honestly. and i would never write a negative review of a film had i not such enormous respect for the subject matter, that is, stephen foster and his music.<br /><br />first, what is it? it's a musical biography? yeah, lot's of tunes by foster then interspersed here and there are these pseudo-broadway-jerome kern-type numbers that reek more than the mississippi delta. i mean, somebody got paid to write this drivel? secondly, the real story of foster is a fascinating one. why not even come close to it? thirdly, what did they have on the great ray middleton to get him to do this film? pictures of him with small boys?? with communists? what a waste of a great talent.<br /><br />so, friends of foster, and the truth, and good entertainment, be afraid... be very, very, afraid.
