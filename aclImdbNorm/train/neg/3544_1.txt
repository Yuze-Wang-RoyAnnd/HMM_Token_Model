vulpine massacre should have been this movies actual title. and the tag-line should have read "guaranteed to make your kids cry!" this is a nature drama telling the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region. starting with the meeting and pairing of two young foxes and the eventual birth of a large family and the trials of raising them. the only speaking is done in narrative by a tree that stands over the den, giving insight into the animals loves and lives... lovely scenery and gorgeous filming of the animals. sounds good huh? well from there things go straight to hell and then start drilling towards the core...<br /><br />*** spoilers below - or they it may be a warning!***<br /><br />almost first off we learn one of the foxes is born blind. but seems to get along well enough and there's a beautifully cheerful musical score to accompany him... and then he dies... next we have one of the siblings adventures. and then he dies... one of the sisters gets her screen-time... and then she dies...and so it goes like some horrific slasher movie as one fox after another is killed off by nature, in traps, just up and vanish, and even by a bunch of snowmobiles! by the end of the movie almost all the foxes have been massacred. though mercifully no deaths are shown on screen. (least not in the version we saw.) unlike say "tarka the otter" the deaths in this movie are almost all pointless and border on the sadistic in the way hopes are built up and then snuffed out. one or two losses would have been acceptable. it is a nature film after all. but not nearly the whole family.<br /><br />do not go to see this film deceived by the cheery box into thinking its safe for the kids. watch it with some foreknowledge that things are *not* going to go well at all and that you or your kids may be left feeling very badly depending on how sensitive you or they are. you may enjoy it. or you may not...
