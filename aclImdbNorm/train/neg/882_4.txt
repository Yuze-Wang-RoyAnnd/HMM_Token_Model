there is a reason this went straight to video- the story is smarmy, nick cage plays johnny in a sleazy way- sex in churches, and other scenes that border on tasteless(like the scene in the laundry room) taint this movie. judge reinhold as the cuckold is okay- but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done. but it is a good film for trivia contests- because so few people saw it.
