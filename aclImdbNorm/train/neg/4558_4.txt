honestly, i was disappointed in "expiration date." super clever title and interesting premise, but i don't think it delivered. what was it about? the main character's desire to reconnect with his native roots? or, more likely, it was his need to overcome his fear of death. but, he wasn't set up as someone who has lived his life in fear -- it seems as if his life was going fine, but since doomsday is approaching he should now start worrying. i didn't buy it. meanwhile, the supporting characters in the film didn't seem to have needs that blended into an overarching story. they were all just doing their thing, running parallel to the main character. also, what was treated as a "curse" looked more like a coincidence. who cursed the family? why? when? finally, why didn't he just plan on staying in his apartment all day on his birthday? those are my criticisms, but i did love the shots of seattle, cinematography was beautiful, acting was good in the times it wasn't outstanding.
