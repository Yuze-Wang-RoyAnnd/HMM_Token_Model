you already know how painful to watch this movie is. but i wonder why one of the worst movies ever should include one the most beautiful cars. why the cars should be not only the victim of violation, but also the only true actors and performers in it. so how on earth you porsche, lamborghini or whatever could allow those people to get in touch with your cars and ruin you reputation for which you give millions.stop the getting an advantage of the cars and earn money on their chests. it is painful for those who love cars. it is painful for those who love movies.<br /><br />i want my money back !!!
