believe me, i like horror movies. i like science fiction movies. i like independent films. and, i like low-budget, b movies. <br /><br />sometimes, i even like bad acting, plodding scripts, wooden lines, improbably situations, and the like. however, i did not like christmas on mars. <br /><br />it just doesn't work on so many levels. for all the reasons listed previously, and many more. that includes the nonsensical, blatant use of images of female genitalia. and the many allusions to male genitalia, in a very freudian way.<br /><br />i am convinced this is purely from ineptitude. as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different. i mean any movie that takes years to film, just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiences.<br /><br />i had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character. however, sadly, it was meant to have happened, as we saw things unfold on screen. <br /><br />about the only kindness that i can express, is that the image at the end was stupendous. if this had been used at the beginning, instead of the end, it could have allowed the film to take off where 2001 ended... <br /><br />to bad they didn't try that instead. i just don't understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made. was it the plot? surely, it couldn't be. was it the characters? i doubt it; i mean, i could live without knowing about ed 15. was it the dialog? emphatically, no. the music? perhaps, but more-likely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked. <br /><br />much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor.
