i usually comment only on movies that i like, figuring "everyone to his/her own taste," but here i want to make an exception. the premise of this movie, which somehow seems to get lost in the shuffle, is that these two self-centered adults have a perfect right to go off to las vegas, get drunk, get married, and inflict incalculable suffering upon their respective broods of children. even allowing for the culturally sanctioned inebriation, they have neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and undo what they have set in motion. after all, "love" is all that's important, isn't it? to hell with everybody else. whether or not things "work out in the end" is really not the point; in fact it's quite irrelevant. the point is that disrespect for others, especially if they are young persons, and especially if they are in a position of dependency, is made light of and thereby reinforced by this movie. there are far more innocuous behaviors these "parents" could have performed that would have brought down an army of social workers on their heads in a heartbeat.
