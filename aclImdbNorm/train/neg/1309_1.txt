this movie was extremely boring. it should least not more than 15 minutes. the images of child and animal being killed were little bit disturbing.<br /><br />usually i don't write comments but this one was so bad having so many good and excellent comments. i think in this case we are one step closer to honest assessment of this title.<br /><br />what more can i say? i fall asleep during this movie 3 times. it was about 4 hours after i had woken up from 8 hours long sleeping period. i think it is the point itself.<br /><br />there is no dialog between characters except maybe 2 sentences at the very end.<br /><br />when you fall asleep once watching it do not try to rewind and catch up because you will fall asleep again.
