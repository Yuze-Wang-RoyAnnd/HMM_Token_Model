i actually went to see this film in a theater, but what a complete waste of time and money! bad acting, i'm sorry to say, did not help to enjoy this rather sticky screenplay.<br /><br />some friends told me to go and see this film, since james redfield, the author of the book, was very heavily involved in the screenplay. they had really enjoyed the book, so the movie just had to be perfect. well maybe i had my hopes up a bit too high, but i absolutely hated this movie! it was predictable, too sweetish to a point that i actually left i had to vomit and worst of all there is going to be a sequel! do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade.
