i love movies, and i'll watch any movie all the way through, just to give it a chance. i can finally say that i found a movie i can't watch all the way through. the acting is terribly stale and monotone, the cgi looks like a computer geek did it in his mother's basement with minimal software, and.....the long scenes of just...walking!!!! and this movie is three hours long!!! i didn't even make it 15 minutes until i fast forwarded the dvd. the scenes with the aliens are very short. ummm, instead of naming this "war of the worlds", lets name this "war of the walking long distances". this cost 5 million dollars to make! what they spend the money on, the dramatic opening song?<br /><br />oh, but on a positive note, one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people. that's hilarious, not because people are dying, but because when they turn to skeletons, they still squirm for 20 seconds afterward.<br /><br />so....like i said, if you are a fan of boring, stale, action-less movies, here is one for you dvd collection. but i didn't write this for you, i wrote this for the billions upon billions of other people who will hate this movie. it is not worth your time or money<br /><br />i know this is by the book, but the book isn't that long, and i'm a complete book worm/nerd/geek/whatever, but why? just get the steven spielberg version, it's not all that good, but it's 10 times better than this!! <br /><br />i give this a big, fat zero out of 10.
