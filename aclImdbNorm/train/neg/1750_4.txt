priyadarshan's hera pheri was a nice situational comedy this film however actually lacks a story but is quite funny but illogical<br /><br />in fact they is no proper story yet it somehow manages a nice flow though it isn't anything great<br /><br />the first half has 2 funny scenes like the one where akshay and john invite neha for a lunch and another when paresh enters<br /><br />the first half gets boring slowly but the second half is funnier though they is no script <br /><br />the jokes are funny though one does wonder how they never hear each person's voices from inside the rooms?<br /><br />the climax confusion is treated like a stage play but it's quite funny but the film ends abruptly<br /><br />direction is okay music is good<br /><br />akshay kumar excels in his part which is now become his second skin, but this is his film completely and he overshadows everyone else<br /><br />john stumbles throughout and fails in comedy paresh rawal is hilarious rajpal is okay the girls are loud at times and awkward too nargis, daisy and neetu(only neetu is seen now) are good in parts but shriek too often manoj joshi is okay
