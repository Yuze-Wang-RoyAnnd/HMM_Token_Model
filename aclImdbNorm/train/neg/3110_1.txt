i usually come on this website prior to going to the movies, as i like to see what other people think of the movie. i read many reviews which said 'thriller not a horror movie'. this prompted me to give this film a try. i really must take issue with these 'thriller/horror' statements, as it was neither! i almost went and asked for my money back, and if you lot of reviewers enjoyed this rubbish....well you must be easily pleased! at the end of the movie, the people behind me said out loud "what a waste of time" and i turned to them and replied " i couldn't have summed it up better". i kept waiting for something to happen...but it didn't. there was the potential for a lot of good scares (or thrills if you like) but none happened. williams acted the part quite well but i felt he was short changed by a poor script which dithered around and went nowhere. save your money folks, this is a turkey which will be featuring at a dvd store 'bargain box' near you in the very foreseeable future!
