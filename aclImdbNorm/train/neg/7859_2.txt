my god. this movie was awful. i can't complain about it too much. i went to see it just to be grossed out. it did suffice, sort of. it's funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was in the very, very beginning where the woman is extremely vividly forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby.<br /><br />i also think that it's funny that the most notable actor in the movie was the hispanic soldier, who was a supporting actor in next friday. everyone in the movie did a horrible acting job. it was some of the worst acting i've ever paid to see. <br /><br />i also expected that it would be much more gruesome than the first one. it wasn't. i expected it to be more gruesome because it's a sequel and horror movie sequels are usually much less successful than their predecessors. i expected it to be more gruesome since gore and violence usually sell a horror movie these days (grudge 2, saw 3, jeepers creepers 1 & 2, dead silence), but it actually wasn't nearly as gruesome as the first one, which was yet another disappointment. <br /><br />the mutants in the first one were kind of disturbing but the filmmakers were trying so hard in this one to make them creepy that they were absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />i also hated the entire concept of showing the clip of the female soldier's son on her camera-phone saying "i love you, mommy" four times. it was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers, and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel even worse for her by showing it three more times for no reason. this movie was a joke.
