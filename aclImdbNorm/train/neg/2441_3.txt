i thought "intensive care" was quite bad and very unintentionally funny. but at least not as bad as i thought it might be. sometimes it's somewhat suspenseful, but never a good shocker.<br /><br />spoiler ahead<br /><br />the fun lies in ridiculous moments. but the all-time classic moment is this: peter (koen wauters) is stabbed and beaten by the killer. he lies moaning in the corner of the hallway. amy (nada van nie) kneels beside him and asks "poor peter, shall i get you a band-aid?".<br /><br />this movie was shot in dutch and english. to spare costs, all license plates are usa, and the background in the news studio is a skyline of manhattan. very funny if you're dutch and watching the original version in dutch.
