what an appalling film. don't get me wrong, gene hackman and denzel washington are good actors, but aside from a few interesting set pieces, the film is mostly taken up with hysterical submariners shouting, crying, sweating and generally freaking out when anything goes wrong.<br /><br />take that with simplistic asides to make sure the audience still understand what's going on (the scene where denzel washington explains to a radio repairman how he must be like scotty in star trek is nothing more than a joke) and you have a dumbed down thriller not worthy of the acting.<br /><br />let us just hope that the real nuclear us navy is not in the hands of such a script!<br /><br />
