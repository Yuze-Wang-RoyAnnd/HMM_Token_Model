i rented this movie, thinking it looked like a wonderfully delightful historical piece. what i got was a piece of pure garbage. this movie was confusing in most spots, choppy in almost every spot and dreadful in all spots. mira sorvino's portrayal of a queen playing a young male scholar was depressing at best. ben kingsley should have been stripped of his knighthood for even considering this film as one of his projects. fiona shaw should definitely stick to playing petunia dursley; at least the harry potter movies are more entertaining than this thing they call a play within a movie.<br /><br />the cinematography looks like some college kid took a class in cinematography 101 and failed miserably. almost every scene in the movie is chopped up for some sort of effect; the end result of course being the cheesiest bit of editing i've ever seen. jay rodan was almost good as agis; too bad he had such a bad script to work with. rachael stirling gives her best effort as the almost gullible lady in waiting. in the end, i really wish blockbuster video gave refunds. i'm so glad i didn't spend 10 bucks watching this fiasco in the theater. if they've been performing this marivaux play since the 18th century, it makes me wonder how many people over the ages have had their best naps during this work. if i had been there, they wouldn't have hear the play over the snoring. thank goodness for the modern convenience of dvd players; you can skip past the boring or awful scenes. guess that means i only watched the beginning and the end!
