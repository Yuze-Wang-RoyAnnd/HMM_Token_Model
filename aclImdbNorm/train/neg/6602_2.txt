for the life of me i can't figure out why anyone would make a movie like this. the plot is tired, the acting is strained, the language is consistently foul and at times the over use of the "f" word seemed like a lack of dialog was prevalent so 'let's throw in another couple of "f's" for good measure, that's what the american public wants to hear'. gossett was particularly foul and seemed to enjoy his part. forget this c__p, rent 'shrek" and have a good laugh.
