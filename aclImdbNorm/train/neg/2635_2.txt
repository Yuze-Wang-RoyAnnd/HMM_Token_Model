i've been willing to put up with a lot from late-spring/summer action fluff movies, but in general that's been due to the fact that most of them have reasonable payoff (i.e. cool special effects, interesting plot twists, comic value, steve buscemi, etc.). this movie, however, had none of this. all that we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of eva longoria's cleavage (an issue of maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket). there is an embarrassing lack of plot, suspense, back story, character development, continuity, etc. i would get into specifics, but quite frankly i've already-maybe willingly-forgotten most of the movie.<br /><br />the entire time i was in the theater, i was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a 24 season on dvd. save your money on this one, folks. unless you really, really, really like eva longoria's cleavage.
