it's one of the funny things about being young that one can be fooled easily by advertising. i have spoken before on another film,in which the commercial for the (comedy) film makes it seem funnier than it is. seeing the ad for this in 1981 made me think this was going to be a wildly funny film. what i and my brother who went and saw it with me didn't know is that the scene used in the tv ad was the very last scene in the film! <br /><br />since this scene is the end result of all that came before in the film,i can only guess that there was nothing else funny to use! the last scene is,thanks to a youth potion,dr. fu manchu turns from a long bearded old man,into a bright young asian/elvis like rock star! (with back up singers no less!) <br /><br />set for no real reason,in the 1930's,peter sellers does his best with the material at hand but he's not given any really good reason for his "comedic" moments. the rest of the actors were just plain dull and my brother and i sat all through this barely laughing at anything. it was only natural that we were expecting a "pink panther" type comedy,peter sellers was so great at that. <br /><br />it's a pitiful shame this was his last film before he died. his appearance on the muppet show was more entertaining than this ill-conceived flop. still,i don't fault him. i fault everyone else involved for not trying to make a better film of this. 2 stars is being generous!!
