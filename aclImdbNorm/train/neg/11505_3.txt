this picture reminds me of a keneth more picture from 1957 called the admirable crighton" whilst on the boat he was a servant and on the island he became the master and upon being saved reverted back to servant. madonna did ok in some movies however this one doesn't fire. if there is any picture that show madonna can't act it is this one.<br /><br />i am not sure whether this was a subtle copy of "the admirable crighton" but it sure looks like it and if thats the case then hollywood must be running out of ideas and that is sad. to provide a platform for actors to improve their career profile and just on that this fails in every corner and detail.<br /><br />the plot is loose and the acting is mediocre. the script should have been put thru the shredder before taking it on location. while many here have canned madoona for all her acting i think that in films like "a league of their own" was quite good and enjoyable and "who's that girl" showed a quirkiness of madonna's style not shown before or afterwards. other madonna films are not as enjoyable and i would have liked a to see a madonna animation series with the character from "who's that girl" i like the music from these two films however "swept away" remains at the bottom of the pile here and will remain so.<br /><br />everyone has a bomb right?
