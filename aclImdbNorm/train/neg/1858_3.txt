a serial killer dies in a snowstorm and gets mutated into frosty the snowman's evil twin. then goes on a killing spree. interesting plot. sounds scary. and it is scary. if you're five years old. otherwise, it's kind of cheesy. i saw it on cable and i'm glad i didn't pay money to see it. it has all the charm and style of a low-budget movie which may become a cult film. i'm sure it has a loyal fan base somewhere. i'm just not in it. even though i didn't like the movie as a whole, there were some scenes i found amusing. such as the bathtub scene and the post-explosion scene with the picasso reference. it was also enjoyable to watch the many ways the heroes try to kill jack and he just doesn't seem to want to die. in short, "jack frost" is a good low-budget b-movie comedy, but a bad low-budget b-movie horror.
