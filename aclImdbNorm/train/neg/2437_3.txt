well, i'll start by admitting i'm not a john ford fan. (i watched "the informer" only because i'm trying to work my way through a list of the "greats.") so if you are, just move along, 'cause you're not going to agree with me.<br /><br />what an overwrought and dated piece of silliness this is! i will say that there is a good idea for a movie here (it made me think about how few films there are about the irish revolution) but, as usual, ford is determined to bury it under over-acting and cheap sentiment. i suppose it's somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the less-than-seamless transition that was being made from the silents to the "talkies" -- the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue. (of course, title cards would prevent ford from restating every bit of emotion six times.) what dialogue there is usually has a "they're always after me lucky charms!" quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an irish accent. of course, as bad as they are, the accents are helpful in reminding us we're in ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some german expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over. (it feels as if, with an eagle eye, you might see some villagers off to torch dr. frankenstein in the background.)<br /><br />techniques change. tastes change. so i won't go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day. but it's not one of the classics that hold up --- more just "fair warning" about the kind of over-simplified malarkey to which ford was going to devote his career.
