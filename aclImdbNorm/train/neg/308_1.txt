mere thoughts of "going overboard" (aka "babes ahoy") make me want to weep. throwing yourself out a window would be better than watching this movie. it's not even a supposed "so bad it's good" movie. i would spend money to buy copies of this movie and burn them so that people can't see it. oh the pain, the pain...
