i just rented this movie to see dolph lundgren, whom i hadn't seen in any movies since rocky iv. unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment. the acting of all the parties was bad except for mr. lundgren, who was okay-ish. kata dob'o was something nice to look at despite her ridiculous outfit and make-up.<br /><br />the plot is not at all clever, it's something that's been repeated a million times in different movies. the crooks were utterly stereotypical, and lundgren's character hadn't any depth in it. i didn't really expect a movie masterpiece, but unfortunately this is not even decent action. every turn in the plot is extremely predictable and the unbelievable amount of over-the-top unrealism and comic-book like characters started to annoy me strongly pretty soon.<br /><br />i would recommend this to young kids wanting some comic-like action, but only if nothing else is available.<br /><br />1/10. (i guess the current average vote of 7.0 with 6 votes must have been influenced by somebody involved in making this movie)
