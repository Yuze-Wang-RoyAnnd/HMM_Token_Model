go immediately and rent this movie. it will be be on a bottom shelf in your local video store and will be covered in dust. no one will have touched it in years. it may even be a $.50 special! it's worth ten bucks, i swear! buy it! there aren't very many films than can compare with this - the celluloid version of that goo that forms at the bottom of a trash can after a few years. yes, i gave it a '1,' but it really deserves much lower. 1-10 scales were not designed with stuff like this in mind.
