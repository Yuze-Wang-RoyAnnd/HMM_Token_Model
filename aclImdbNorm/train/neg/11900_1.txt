how wonderful. yet another movie about america by someone who has visited here probably a half dozen times, a day a piece, and believes himself to be an "expert" on the country. sheesh. i should take a trip to germany for a week and then come back and make a movie about germany as the "land of nazis" or some such. wim il boy, you should get together with lars von trier and make the ultimate movie about the americans. of course we all know it takes a pretentious left-leaning "we are the world" european to make a "real" movie about america.<br /><br />yeah, right. for a continent that started not one but two world wars, europe sure has a lot of opinions about america's wrong "foreign policy".<br /><br />p.s. don't worry, wim il boy, there's plenty of uc-berkeley americans that'll just love your movie. of course, these are the same people who thinks george w. bush is worst than hitler, and that a painting of a can of soup is "sheer genius"!!
