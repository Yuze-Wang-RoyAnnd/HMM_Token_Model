this film describes the experiences of a couple of hit men (one of them burt reynolds), a prostitute, and two drag queens over the interval of a few hours on one night in miami. the convergent storylines eventually bring all the people together at one place and time. the movie was mildly entertaining, but the big problem was that everything happens at night and many scenes were literally under-exposed to the point that it was impossible to see what was happening. in a few scenes you can actually see where they tried to "stretch" the developing process to save the images. somebody didn't know how to operate a movie camera. amazing that this film was even released!
