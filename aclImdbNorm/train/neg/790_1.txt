here is what happened:<br /><br />1) head of bbc3 needs to make programmes aimed at different audience to bbc1 and bbc2 to keep licence and job.<br /><br />2) lenny henry offers his unfunny friends up.<br /><br />3) head of bbc3 snaps them up, completely ignoring the fact that they are not funny.<br /><br />worst of all, it is arguably racist, as all the characters play up to bad stereotypes. if a white person did this kind of thing, there'd be uproar!<br /><br />trash.
