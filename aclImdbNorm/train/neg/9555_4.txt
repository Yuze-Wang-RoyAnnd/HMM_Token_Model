you have to understand, when wargames was released in 1983, it created a generation of wannabe computer hackers. the idea that a teenager could do anything of far reaching proportions, let alone deter a world war was novel and thrilling. real computers were beginning to show up in people's homes, and for the first time, society was becoming interconnected in a way that made the movie's premise excitingly prescient. granted, a talking computer that balanced it's free time between chess and global thermonuclear war was a bit far fetched, but the brilliant commentary on nuclear proliferation and the cold war made up for it. i've probably even heard of the hackers that this movie was actually based on.<br /><br />fast forward 25 years, and we have a horrible mutant of a thing that i loathe to call a "sequel", called wargames: the dead code. i'll just dig right in. first of all, the plot hinges on a government operated gambling site where folks who win the games automatically become terror suspects. you're probably very confused right now. the idea is that eventually the terrorist will click on the sub-game within the web site called "the dead code" where they pilot a plane over a city, spraying it with bioweapons. at some point in the game, you have to choose between "sarin gas" and "anthrax", and if you choose "sarin", then you're automatically confirmed as a bioterrorism weapons expert and your family is taken into custody and interrogated. in the movie, this actually happens. however, since the payment for the game was made from a bank account that was suspicious, it obviously all makes sense.<br /><br />second, the avatar of the ai in this straight-to-dvd bomb is an annoying flash animation that keeps repeating the pop-up-ad-esquire sound bite "play with me baby". because apparently in the future, advanced ai loses interest in intellectual pursuits like chess, and gets into porn.<br /><br />third, the motivation for these "hackers" is profit and women, as opposed to pure curiosity as in the original movie. for some reason, recent hacker movies feel the need to portray all young adults as average surfer dude kind of people who are just like everyone else. that may work for your average sitcom, but c'mon, you don't learn how to take over government computers by doing your hair, playing sports, and shopping at the mall, folks. the one novel thing i noticed was that at some point in the dialogue there is a reference to a matt damon movie, and then later there is the phrase, "good hunting, will". i swear, they named the main character will just for that phrase so they could send a high five to mr. damon. this will kid isn't bad, but he was certainly wasn't like any obsessive hacker i've ever met. i can't fully state how annoyed i am that this movie shares the same name as the original, because it has absolutely nothing in common with it except
