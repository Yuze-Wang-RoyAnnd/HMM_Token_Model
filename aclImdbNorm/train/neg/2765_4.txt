how this movie got made with a supposedly $70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me. the storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish. characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before. no one seems to be grounded in the real world. the acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dud...but several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down. the hero's hair probably should've gotten its own credit, it was so oddly attention- grabbing...not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic. finally, for a movie about l.a. being besieged by giant reptiles, this film is shockingly boring. what a shame! if you do see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking up ways that you could have taken the sfx scenes and built a far better movie around them. sadly, it wouldn't have taken much.
