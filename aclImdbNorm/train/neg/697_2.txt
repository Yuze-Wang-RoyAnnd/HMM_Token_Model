the two things are are good about this film are it's two unknown celebrities.<br /><br />first, daphne zuniga, in her first appearance in a film, young and supple, with looks that still encompass her body today, steals the very beginning, which is all she is in, and that is that. she is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects.<br /><br />second, the score by then known composer christopher(chris) young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star...yeah, i know one star more is not much, but in this movie's case, it is a lot.<br /><br />the rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down, getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer, blah, blah, blah...we all know where this is going.<br /><br />watch the first eighteen minutes with daphne zuniga, then turn it off.
