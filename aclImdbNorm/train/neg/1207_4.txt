kim basinger stars as della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband, who gets into trouble while she's out at the local mall doing some last minute christmas shopping. after placing a hastily scrawled hateful note on a piece of paper and sticking said paper in the windshield of a car that took up two parking spaces, she finds out the owners of the car are the rainbow coilition of villains comprising of a white guy, a mexican, a chinese guy & a black. they confront her about the note, cap a helpless security guard, and the chase is on. during the course of the film della will go for hunted to hunter as she unleashes her inner bronson.<br /><br />i found this to be a somewhat tense little thriller. the acting was good enough (except for a few scenes, the "why god why" bit was cringe worthy in it's badness though) it comes undone a bit due to the sheer fact that the villains della chases from/after are mind-numbingly stupid. if they hadn't had the intellect of any given "home alone" baddie, perhaps their eventual defeat would be something to savor instead of the meh reaction it evokes. the unbelievability factor i'm willing to overlook as both the director & one of the producers had part in bringing "shoot em up" to the screen (a film which while throwing credibility out the window was immensely fun). this film while never attaining the heights of that film, was good in it's own rights.<br /><br />my grade: c- <br /><br />anchor bay dvd extras: commentary with writer/director susan montford and producer don murphy; a 25 and a half minute 'making-of'; a trailer & two tv spots for this film; and trailer for lower learning
