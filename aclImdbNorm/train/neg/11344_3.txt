i was very unimpressed with cinderella 2 and jungle book 2, but this is possibly worse than both titles. first of all, i didn't like the animation, very saturday-morning-cartoon, only worse in some scenes. i liked some of the characters, namely thunderbolt and patch, but the other characters, like cruella were mediocre. cruella was truly villainous in the original, but she lost her quality in the sequel. what she said was nothing at all to write home about and her animation was kind of ugly. also her artist companion lars was a joke to be honest with you, and roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight. the voice talents were very good though especially barry bostwick as thunderbolt, with the exception of jodi benson, the accent ruined it for me. there were some good moments, but the whole plot seemed bloated for me, and highly suggestive of an extended tv episode. all in all, a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60s disney movies along with jungle book. sorry, i can only give this a 3/10, it just wasn't my cup of tea. bethany cox
