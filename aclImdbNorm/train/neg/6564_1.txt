this is one of the worst movies i have seen to date, the best part was christian j. meoli "leonard" attempting to act jumping up and down outside the bar, kind-of like i wanted to do on the dvd, to spare the rest of humanity the agony of watching this shitty film. it has a great cast so you keep watching waiting for it to get good, i mean with sean astin "andrew" (played his part perfectly, did a great job, too bad it was in this film), kyra sedgwick "bevan", ron livingston "chad", ren'ee zellweger "poet" (they put her name on the cover she has a total of 1 line and less then 4 seconds in the whole movie...<br /><br />if the cast had any dignity, they would go out and buy all the copies of this film and burn them along with writer / director george hickenlooper and writer john enbom
