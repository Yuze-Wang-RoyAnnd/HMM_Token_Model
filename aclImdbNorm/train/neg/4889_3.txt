the line is funnier in england, where, away from vixen!'s native america, the word "fanny" has a whole new meaning. sadly, it's the only laugh you'll get in this terrible sex comedy that is neither sexy nor funny.<br /><br />oddly unalluring with painted-on eyebrows, erica gavin (acting ability: zero) is a nymphomaniac who lusts after her own brother, but rejects his black friend while making derogatory remarks about watermelons. as if in revenge, he asks her if she would go with a shetland pony. reference is also made to "making it with monkeys". gavin's ability to shake and tremble with orgasmic pleasure at the slightest touch is matched only in it's lack of appeal by her seduction dance
