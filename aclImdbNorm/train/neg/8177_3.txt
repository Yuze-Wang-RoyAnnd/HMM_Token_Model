90 minutes of mindy...mindy is a tease to boyfriend bill...mindy prances at the high school dance...mindy hitchhikes to big sur, shoplifts a loaf of "shepherd's bread," mindy nearly gets gang-raped... ah, the pleasures of crown international drive-in features. you must remember that these films were never designed to be watched start to finish on dvd players. they were made as 90 minutes of ambiance so the teens of the 70s would have a soundtrack as they got it on in their pintos and citations. the lack of pacing and structure didn't matter to the original audience -- they probably only tuned in when the t & a on screen matched what they were up to, out in the parking lot. the film is really irritating when watched as a story. it's a lot more fun to talk about it than watch it. my favorite inanities: 1) bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find mindy. with no luggage or change of underwear, they spend 2 nights sharing a motel room with the teacher, just like in real life. 2)after being abducted and nearly raped by depraved bikers, and after their innocent friend "pan" is savagely beaten, mindy and her girlfriend find an unattended motorcycle on the road. mindy immediately brightens up and chirps, "i'm going' to big sur!!" but again, it's a lot more fun to talk/read about than sit through.
