this bomb is just one 'explosion' after another, with no humor and only absurd situations. really, pyrotechnics to the extreme. reality is not one of its strong points. i give it a 1 out of 10. i would have made it a zero but that option wasn't permitted. sorry, but lithgow and sutherland deserve better roles. but then at times we all need to have money. and i still recoil at that tim burton farce about mars. nicholson was brave enough to admit that was a turkey. but if that was a turkey, this movie then is not even a gizzard. i wish i could say, "give me back my money". you can bet i would if i could. but that is the trouble with premium services, the subscription variety.
