prior to this release, neil labute had this to say about the 1973 original: "it's surprising how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack. i'm like, come on! you may not like the new one, but if that's your favorite soundtrack, i don't know if i *want* you to like my film." <br /><br />neil, a word. you might want to sit down for this too; as lord summerisle says, shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent. see, neil, the thing about the original, is that paul giovanni's soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it. the filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical. along with richard and danny thompson, and bert jansch, it practically kick-started the 1970s folk new wave. to undermine it is akin to imagining jaws without john williams. or the buddy holly story without buddy holly. the result's one of the most breathtakingly arrogant, pointless remake of a british cult classic since sly stallone's get carter.<br /><br />the original had apparently left nicolas cage "disturbed for about two weeks." so disturbed, during that fortnight's window, that he pitched the idea of re-imagining one of the most nuanced films about inter-faith struggle ever devised to a writer-director previously known for his wholly unsubtle depictions of male chauvinism. it's like some parlor game: what would you get if sam peckinpah took on bambi? or gaspar "irreversible" noe remade love, actually?(actually, i'd quite like to see that). unfortunately, someone took this parlor game seriously: all labute's succeeded in doing is ripping out the original's guts while saddling it with his own gormless sex war preoccupations.<br /><br />after failing to rescue a little girl and her mum from a fatal car crash, cage's highway patrolman spirals into a medicated torpor. then he receives a letter from ex-fianc'ee willow woodward (this one trades on name-homages for kudos), now living on the private island community of summersisle
