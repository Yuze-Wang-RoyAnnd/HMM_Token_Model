i've said this in other reviews, without a story, you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want, still no one will give a damn.<br /><br />the director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco (which i love), and i think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making. however, it's obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie, he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinned-plotted film. (spoiler) for crying out loud, they forgot to have a villain in this thing! ok they have one, but he's been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place. conran misses the point of having a villain. as far as action goes, well let's see, sky captain (law) shoots down one robot, two or three of the flapping wing airplanes (before dex (ribisi) tells him to stop shooting them down!!!), and a couple robots, but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him. paltrow as polly or peggy or punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie (the reviewer who comments on hers and law's lack of chemistry is so right) and i for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera, showing she only has two shots left, both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie, one uncomically, one quite funny, although i saw it coming from 70 years away. no one except law and paltrow have any significant time on screen, and that's the movie's real flaw. an audience doesn't identify with robots, they need a hero to root for, and a visible, despicable villain to hate. without that, plus a good engaging story, all the cg in the world won't help.
