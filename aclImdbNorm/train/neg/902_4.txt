i suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early sofia loren film. she was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953.<br /><br />i viewed this film because i wanted to see some of sofia loren's early work. i was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin bronzed over in brown makeup to resemble an ethiopian princess. surely, today, this would have been viewed as a slur and to be avoided in movie making. it actually became annoying watching ms. loren in skin color paint throughout the film.<br /><br />yes, this film would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie. then, the singing and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent. i discount the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier in weight.<br /><br />as beautiful as ms. loren was at age 19 and still is today, the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage. after all, we don't see beautiful young people on stage with "old opera singers" back stage singing from behind the curtain! do not discount the success of using heavy-weight opera singers. one only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the j. g. wentworth company with the opera singers on stage singing so professionally the praises of the company's product. this is one of the best and entertaining tv commercials produced to date.<br /><br />the quality of the movie print also makes this production of a somewhat lesser quality. the color ink has faded much and that can not be helped.<br /><br />to improve this film on dvd the production company should add english language subtitles so that we, who do not speak italian, can know what the lyrics are saying. it would help the story and teach it more than the narrator giving 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes.<br /><br />watch this film not because of the story of aida nor the fact that this is an opera. aside from ms. sofia loren none of her co-actors are known nor remembered by this writer. instead, watch this movie if you are a fan of ms. loren and wish to see her at age 19 -- no matter what the production is.<br /><br />larry from illinois
