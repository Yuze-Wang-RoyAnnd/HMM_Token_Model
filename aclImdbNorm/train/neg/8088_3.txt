to make a good movie you either need excellent actors or an excellent director. you need at least one of the two. in this eye of the needle we have none.<br /><br />i don't even remember the name of the director. he mustn't have done much in his career. i like very much donald sutherland but he absolutely cannot be the main actor in a movie. he falls short. sutherland is excellent in a movie when he appears for not more than 15 minutes. i would say for instance that sutherland was excellent in jfk of oliver stone when he talked to kevin costner on the bench of a park for 10 minutes non-stop without even taking a breath. wonderful. but sutherland being the principal actor in a movie is no good.<br /><br />kate nelligan? she is probably good for tv series. the dvd is awful. terrible colors. terrible light. i couldn't even appreciate the scenery of storm island for how lousy the photography was.<br /><br />this ken follett story was good but it's a pity they turned it into an uninteresting movie.
