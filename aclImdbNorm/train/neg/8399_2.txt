i am a huge stooges fan but the one and only redeeming quality this movie has is that curley is in it. done long before he started drinking heavily he is his classic self in this (and larry's not bad either). moe's character is a straight part (mostly) and this movie would be better named "the curley and larry movie". not that any of the stooges movies were very good (in my opinion), but as one commenter here said, how sad it is that this movie had real potential. the casting was good, it was well directed, filmed, and edited, but the story line tried to be about something serious with just some stooges antics and musical numbers (which i guess were good back then) thrown in. the best thing you can do for yourself during this movie should you actually believe that it has to be better than mowing the lawn and taking out the trash (which is subject to debate) is to wait for curley/larry scenes and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat during the rest of it.
