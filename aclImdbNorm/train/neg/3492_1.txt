i don't buy kung fu movies for a plot. i buy them for fight scenes. a bad plot can be forgiven for excellent fight scenes, but not the other way around.<br /><br />the story was decent, but moved too slowly for my tastes. there were about 3 or 4 mediocre fight scenes throughout, lasting only a couple of minutes apiece. the last fight was a bit longer, but by that point i was so bored i didn't even pay attention to it.
