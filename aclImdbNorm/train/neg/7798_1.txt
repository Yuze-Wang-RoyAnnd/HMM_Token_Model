this review is based on the dubbed shock-o-rama video released on an undeserving world in 2002. how bad is it? it's awful, which is what a '1' represents on the imdb scale--but it's much worse than that. it's nice to imagine that an original german-language print might improve matters--the comedic english-language dubbing isn't funny at all--but truthfully, this is one of the worst amateur films of any genre you're likely to see. the zombies in the film are as slow and clumsy as ever, and they don't seem to have the ability to speak or think about anything beyond their next meal. however, they're also intelligent enough to operate chainsaws and malicious enough to know that western taboos about genitalia will no doubt enliven their dinner table conversation. george romero's land of the dead posited a zombie nation that retained a shred of social coherence; here, zombies are nothing more than an empty canvas for the perverse imaginings of director andreas schnaas. utterly without redeeming social value, and even worse, entirely lacking as entertainment, zombie '90 is a bad joke on anyone who wastes money on it.
