this film deals with two ex-football players who are fred williamson, (mack derringer) and gary busey, (lenny) who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of ladies and men with some bad backgrounds. mack derringer is approached by his ex-wife vanity (jennifer derringer) who works at having sex talk over the telephone. jennifer is being threatened by one caller who wants to do horrible things to her and she asks for his help along with several other ladies. mack & lenny have more time on their hands and often go to miami, fl. golf courses or hang out in a sports bar where all kinds of city things go on. there is lots of punches, killings and plenty of double meaning words that bring this film completely down to a big zero. don't waste your time, this film cost me only 50 cents and that was too much.
