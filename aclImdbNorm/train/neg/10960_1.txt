ouch! they don't come much worse than this horrid adaptation of c. s. lewis's beloved novel. while the adaptation is very true to the novel, the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play. i've read that the budget for this miniseries was the grandest that the bbc has ever given at the time, but surely they could have scraped together a bit more than the $2 that it looks like this was filmed for. the worst effect of all is mr. beaver. i know computer effects weren't at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time, but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid. better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role! avoid this at all costs.
