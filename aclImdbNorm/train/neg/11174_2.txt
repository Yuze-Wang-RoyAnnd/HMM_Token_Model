al pacino? kim basinger? tea leoni? ryan o'neal? richard schiff? my mouth was watering. i dropped everything to watch this movie on cable. 30 minutes in i was having trouble staying awake. 60 minutes in and i hit the record button and fell asleep. finished watching it the next morning. shouldn't have bothered. what a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a "day in the life..." cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie. i guarantee you at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep. dialogue horrible. continuity non-existent. camera work could have been done with a hand held super 8 and looked better. <br /><br />this movie was a total disaster.
