i saw this for gary busey and fred williamson thinking they were buddy cops. they are but busey is in the opening scene then doesn't show up again until like 40 minutes into the movie. though every scene he's in is awesome. especially when he disguises himself as a blind hobo.<br /><br />what's incredible about this movie is the plot. in the movie fred williamson is trying to find out who stalking and killing phone sex operators. at one point i think thats its busey. but it turns out i'm only partly right. busey is not the killer, but he is calling up and harassing the women over the phone. why? i don't know. in no way is he connected to the killer, he just does it for kicks i guess.
