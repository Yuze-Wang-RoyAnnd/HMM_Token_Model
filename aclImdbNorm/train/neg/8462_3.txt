"bullfighter" was made in 2000 but it is being released on video 5 years later for some reason. i wonder why? could it be: the confusing storyline, the incomprehensible dialogue said by oliver martinez, and the annoying editing? it's got to be. i think the plot was mary (michelle forbes) and jacque (oliver martinez) go on a mystical road trip. they meet a lot of wacky characters and avoid some evil ones too. the movie looks great and there is a lot of style, but there is no substance. most movies, when trying to subtle, don't call attention to themselves with unanswered plot developments, and weak special effects.<br /><br />don't be fooled by the cover: willem dafoe is in it for 2 minutes at most.
