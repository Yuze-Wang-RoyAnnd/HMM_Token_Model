this film has little to recommend it, though that little being the breathtaking scenery, cinematography and direction of wildlife, it is difficult to bring up its weak points in the company of such rave reviews. it is precisely these things, however, that make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its execution so disappointing. <br /><br />i watched this with my children and none of us was too impressed by the end. yes, the pictures were great, the broad landscapes across the forest and mountains magnificent, but what was going on in the foreground? the rather dull narration of the stupidity of an insipid girl who learns all too slowly a very basic lesson about befriending wildlife - and gets off quite easily given the track record of that sort of thing. it is certainly not a new story, in fact there is nothing remotely novel about the way it is told, and we have all seen this before, and, indeed, much more eloquently by antoine de saint-exup'ery.<br /><br />the only thing really to be gleaned from this film is a sense of how to work with these wonderful lenses and forest lighting; the rest is a waste of time.
