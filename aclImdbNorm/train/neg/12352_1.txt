<br /><br />how this film ever got a 6 star average is beyond me. the script is so banal, and frankly an insult to whomevers life it is based upon. the cinematography comes straight from the slick world of advertising, and the talented ridley scott should be ashamed. demi moore however, shows none a surprise by participating in this film, if one looks at her tracklist. all in all, a "high concept" style film that even don simpson would be ashamed of.
