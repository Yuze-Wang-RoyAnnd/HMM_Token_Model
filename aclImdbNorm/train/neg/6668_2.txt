the longer this film went on-and it seemed to tediously go on for ever- the more annoyed i became, as quite frankly, what a waste of time sitting through this total nonsense. how on earth do people get to make films like this,or indeed receive finance for such rubbish? don't be fooled by the relatively high ratings on imdb as it just proves you can fool some of the people all the time. and in this picture the main players have an obsession with guns, so it is not difficult to work out the way this movie will ultimately unfold. america can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre how society in the usa has such an obscene and fatal 'gun culture'. <br /><br />anyhow:<br /><br />the lead actor portrays a loser who escapes into a fantasy world of being a cowboy in an urban sprawl.he comes across a family with two spoiled brat children, a teenage girl and boy; taken care of by a strict single parent father who can barely cope. the cowboy is seduced by the teenage girl or vice-versa, and the impressionable boy is seemingly taken in by the lunacy of the loser.<br /><br />the cowboy spends the whole time in a state of unreality and depression.a total loser who prefers to go to the beach then work for living, and then commits a burglary on his family as he is too lazy to make money legally.<br /><br />ask yourself:<br /><br />who wants to watch either a sad failed loser in a fantasy world holding a death wish, or indeed view a poor family who are in effect not much better than white trash?!<br /><br />this film is pointless drivel.<br /><br />it only saves itself from getting the lowest mark possible by some half listen able music:<br /><br />2/10.
