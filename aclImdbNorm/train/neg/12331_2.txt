one of the those "coming of age" films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids. this movie has neither. it is a poor excuse to let sylvia kristel's body double frolic with a dorky eric brown. to make matters worse, the movie is either silly or stupid when it tries to be funny, sexy, or dramatic. laugh awkwardly as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone with burying a dead woman in his front yard. ponder vigorously on why a woman famous for emmanuelle needs a body double. as the movie went on and on, i started to imagine a hybrid of private lessons and little miss millions that had sylvia kristel seduce jennifer love hewitt as howard hesseman makes us nostalgic for wkrp. watch this to laugh at other people's stupidity, or for ed begley jr.'s committed performance, or to wonder what sylvia kristel would look like with jennifer love hewitt. but i can give you an idea of your lesson, stay away from movies staring sylvia kristel that are not emmanuelle.
