revolt of the zombies has no redeeming features. i'm tired of people arguing that it's not that bad, and that the effects must have packed more of a punch in 1936. i suspect this isn't true: it's not like iq's have risen sharply in the last 7 decades. the average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored by this rubbish as the average viewer today. why? just try watching the first scenes, and count the pauses between things happening, the awful choice of when to cut to close-up, the slapdash editing that seems to include an extra two seconds on every shot to pad out the running time. pay attention to the utterly redundant dialogue: "i'm going to make some tea/go outside/read my book now." "are you?" "yes, i am." that sort of exchange happens several times. normally i would love that, being a huge fan of bad movies, but watch the listless actors mumbling their trite and tedious lines, and all desire to laugh at the movie slowly fades away. this sort of disinterested, pot-boiling time-waster is far worse than energetic, imaginative mind-blowers like plan nine from outer space or santa claus conquers the martians. those who claim that this is "better" than those more interesting movies have a backwards idea of entertainment. this movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw hangs open in astonishment: it's bad in the sense that your eyes slowly close in boredom. which is far worse.
