"true" story of three girls who go into the wilds of connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods. this is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across america thirty years ago to mixed acclaim. not particularly much of anything the film works with its low budget to mixed results. the film is watchable but isn't at all scary (blame how some of the attack scenes for that). its the sort of film that you'll probably forget about once you're done with it. odds are that you're never going to think to see this unless its handed to you by someone and told, "here watch this", which is what happened to me. if you're handed a copy give it back, the film isn't worth the effort to see it even if it is watchable.
