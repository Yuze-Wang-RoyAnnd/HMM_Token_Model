this is almost certainly the worst western i've ever seen. the story follows a formula that is especially common to westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered, so hero sets out to exact revenge, foils the ineffective lawman, rescues the kidnapped loving damsel, and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. this formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- but gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see. the scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity, and realism. the sound is bad; it sometimes looks dubbed. the cinematography is lame, and the sets are sometimes just facades. the acting is pitiful; sure, some of the performers could blame the script, but others cannot use that excuse. i hope i never see chris lybbert in a speaking role ever again; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean, he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho. and speaking of chris lybbert, who plays hopalong, check out his duds (if you dare to watch this film): he wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like roy rogers than a hard-working, down-and-dirty cowboy. if you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of hopalong cassidy, then get this, but if you have more than two neurons, watch something else.
