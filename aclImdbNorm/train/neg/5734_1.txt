this is the kind of movie that's so extremely bad that you cant stop watching it because you keep telling yourself that 'it cannot continue to be this crappy all the way to the end. it just cant'. you know, 'worse than jaws 4'-kind of bad.<br /><br />i honestly think i've only seen one movie that was worse than this, and then we're talking religious crap about how you'd end up in hell for lying or watching football.<br /><br />gore? indeed and lots of it. well made gore? no way.<br /><br />the acting is beyond bad and all the lines are lousy clich'es. same goes for the storyline which only really consist of sex, blood and violence, like so many other gore movies.<br /><br />if you're hoping for a mix between ichi the killer and august underground
