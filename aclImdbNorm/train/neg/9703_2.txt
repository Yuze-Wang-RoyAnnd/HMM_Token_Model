for those who are too young to know this or for those who have forgotten, the disney company went almost down the tubes by the end of the 1980s. people were not seeing their movies anymore and the company was not producing the usual wholesome material....at least no what people expected. a major problem: profanity.<br /><br />yes, the idiots running the disney movies during that decade would produce films with swear words - including the lord's name in vain, if you can believe that - interspersed in these "family films." in fact that happens twice here in the first 20 minutes! <br /><br />this movie, in addition to the language problems, has a nasty tone to it, too, which made it unlikeable almost right from the beginning. thankfully, disney woke up and has produced a lot of great material since these decadent '80s movies. ("touchstone" is disney, just under another name.)
