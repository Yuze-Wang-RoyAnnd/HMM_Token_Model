bashki should be congratulated for attempting to convert one of the great works of english fiction into a movie, and then slapped silly for this attempt. the animation was poor, the characters looked ridiculous, the music was overwhelmingly blaring, and the film was a ramshackle blitz through the first book and a half of tolkien's masterpiece. i can still remember my sheer disappointment and loathing for the movie when i first saw it. now i realize that any attempt to convert a book into a movie is bound to fail in many ways, simply because of the medium, but this movie, regardless of the source of the story, is just plain pathetic. bashki is capable of much more.
