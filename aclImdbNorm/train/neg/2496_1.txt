i would list this film under the horror film genre.i did this because i am not aware of a genre called horrible. since the genre horror comes the nearest to horrible i have decided to put it in this category. the acting was amateurish. you know who the villains would be at the first scene. the heroine is as ugly as the movie. students of movie making should take this movie as an example for the lesson what not to do in a movie. it is that bad. man the word bad is an understatement. the villains hijack an ocean liner and want 10 million dollars. they want the money to be delivered on an inhabited rose island in the middle of the pacific. they would be sitting ducks after they got the money. is there no getaway plan. how dumb. the female cruise director is a former cop, navy seal, kung fu i am scared. the hilarious part is the way the defuses the time bomb. he says he knows what he is doing and he keeps pulling all the wires one by one. he then puts it in his pocket and according to the movie with all the connections in place. is he mad? as mad us who watched this ridiculous. if you have a m-i-l whom you do not like. to annoy her rent this movie and pretend you enjoy it. i assure you she will definitely tell your spouse that you have such bad taste and that her son/daughter has married a person below her family standard.
