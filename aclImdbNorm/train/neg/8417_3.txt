i anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the broadway play. i waited and read reviews for months about the award winning performances. i mean with the star power of eddie murphy, jamie foxx, beyonce knowles, danny glover... the movie couldn't be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? wrong! i was definitely disappointed by the finished product. the film did not match up to the publicity hype it was given and the only saving graces were eddie murphy, anika noni rose and jennifer hudson.<br /><br />eddie murphy's james brownesque performance rescues the movie just when it hits its multiple lulls and jennifer hudson's performance compels you to pay attention each time she's on screen. her performance of "and i am telling you" was the only time that i felt the hype was deserved. you cringed as she begged her no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life. as many reviewers have stated, she steals the movie from the more experienced actors and deserves all the accolades she's receiving for this performance. anika noni rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent. <br /><br />jamie foxx and beyonce knowles, on the other hand, cruised through their performances. foxx's acting skills for this film seemed to predate his extraordinary "ray" performance and beyonce knowles was on an extended fashion photo shoot or video taping, posing and shimmying her way through the movie. her performance wasn't strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in the film.<br /><br />the movie was too hyped, 30 minutes and 1 song (beyonce's "heartfelt" solo to jamie foxx) too long.<br /><br />dh -- vancouver, wa
