i hate this movie. i hate the show. i hate just about everything about it. it's so annoying and stupid. everyone's saying that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and that they're going to make it big. what kind of drugs are you taking???!!!?!?!?!?! nat and alex are going to end up as either hobos or end up like jane hudson from "whatever happened to baby jane?". i could only get through not even 20 minutes of this one, barely 30 seconds of the show, and i managed to survive about half an hour of 'battle of the bands'. how anyone could cheer for these guys in the audience at the kid's choice awards, i have no clue. days before the movie premiere on nick, most of the teen girl actresses on nick (jamie spears, emma roberts, lindsey shaw, etc.) showed up in a commercial influencing brain-dead kids about how awesome nat and alex wolff are. first off, they didn;t trick me, and second of all, nat and alex probably either drugged them or payed them loads of money in order to say that and sound convincing, because i don't see how anyone could find this show/movie entertaining. the music is just awful. nat's singing sounds like a sick, dying moose on crack. alex is the most annoying movie/tv show character ever. he's not funny, he's annoying, he's really weird, and he thinks he's hot and knows everything about girls. this guy's lucky if he ever manages to get laid. you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters (in real life) don't even exist!! the character jesse is actually played by nat and alex's cousin jesse draper (they mustve had some budget problem). their father is not single, he's married to polly draper, but she doesn't appear on the show, making it seem the wolff's are mom-less. rosalina doesn't exist either. her name is allie dimeco. i'll tell ya, the naked brothers are gonna be in some deep sh** when their "fans" find out the whole thing is staged. 0/10
