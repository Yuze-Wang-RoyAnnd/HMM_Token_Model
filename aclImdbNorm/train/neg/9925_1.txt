this was on the 30th anniversary dvd for blazing saddles, itself brilliant, but not this. nowhere did i see mel brook's name on here and i can guess why, he's got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot. my gawd, who would find this funny. sure there may be a race issue but for me it just wasn't funny, well cause it's simply not funny. it's like the writers didn't even try to be funny, just to cash in on being tied with blazing saddles. did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot? flat out, they didn't care. it was a quick cash cow which thank god didn't cash out. i guess it's useful for historical purposes only, or only to demonstrate how stupid and unimaginative hollywood writers can be.
