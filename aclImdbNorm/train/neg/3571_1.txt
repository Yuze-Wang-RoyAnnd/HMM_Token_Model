the super sexy b movie actress has another bit part as future "goodfellas" star ray liotta's girlfriend in this box office bomb. she plays marion, has only one line of dialog, well, one word of dialog actually. she shouts out "joe!" as ray's character is violating poor pia zadora with a plastic garden hose sprinkler. this movie is so bad though it becomes funny, hilarious at times. the guys at mystery science theater 3000 would love this! check out the hysterical scene at the end where pia has a nervous breakdown and all the cheesy editing and effects they do to try and show how badly pia's character is freaking out. pia plays an aspiring hollywood screenwriter in this. pia zadora as a screenwriter? yeah, right. pia can barely talk, let alone write! pia is utterly and absolutely miscast in this dumb role. but who cares? the real star is the hot and fresh glory annen in her bit part in this cat's opinion! rock on glory!
