this movie was clearly done poorly and in a rush. i realize that the funding for any such movie is hard to come by. however if the plot had any kind of original substance someone would have seen that it got the necessary funding, this was not the case and movies like this are not necessary themselves and have no purpose in existing. the plot for this movie has been done and done better i might add, many times before. there is no reason to make a movie that has no chance in competing with any others. i was informed by my computer that i need a minimum of ten lines to submit my comment so the following lines are just bull to fill in space. in my opinion there is no need for anything else to be said about this film. what i've said is plenty and if you wasted enough time reading this review, than for god's sake don't waste more time watching this movie. the only exception to this is if you are the kind of person who likes watching crappy movies that get played on the womens entertainment network at 2:00 a.m. in that case go ahead see what i care.
