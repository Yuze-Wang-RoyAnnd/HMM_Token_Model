i'm a big fan of 50s sci-fi, but this is not one of my favorites. while the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teeny bopper sci-fi flick, the director counted too heavily on it to carry the movie. it's clear he was working with no money, because the entire movie is loaded with bloated dialogue that goes on and on forever. i have *never* seen so much time-killing in a movie.<br /><br />there are probably less than 60 seconds of "blob footage" in the entire movie, and most of the rest of it is people engaging in a lot of poorly-written, run-on dialogue. it was fun to see steve m. and anita c. together, but good heavens...how could casting have thought anyone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers?
