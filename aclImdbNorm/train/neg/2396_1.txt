just saw this movie on tv and i have to admit, i was a bit surprised it was even on. there were so many goofs, mess-ups, and bad editing that an old episode of sesame street would have been better to watch. the acting was ok, but please, you can really feel the "straight to video" feeling. the cast/crew made this movie a bad melodrama. yes, there is a message in the movie, but just wait until ten minutes before the ending to hear it. trust me, you wouldn't even tell the difference.
