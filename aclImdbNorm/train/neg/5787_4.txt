as far as heist movies go, this one is pretty weak. continuity is pretty lousy, there isn't enough character continuity to really feel like you understand any of the characters. peter falk is great, and he is one of the reasons its worth watching. falk has some great lines, like "he'll be right back, he goin' buy to some saugages" or something like that... there are a few nice scenes, although they are entirely due to the efforts of the actors. direction, script, and editing is pretty lousy.
