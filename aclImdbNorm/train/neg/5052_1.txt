platoon is to the vietnam war as rocky iv is to heavyweight championship boxing. oliver stone's story of the experience of a us army platoon in vietnam in 1968 is so overdone it's laughable. while most or all of the occurrences in platoon did occur over the 10+ year span of us military involvement in vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a horribly skewed picture of the war. in platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: us soldiers murdering civilians, us soldiers raping civilians, a us sergeant murdering another us sergeant, a us private murdering a us staff sergeant, us soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon. for stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a us soldier in vietnam is a disgrace. two vietnam war films i would recommend are we were soldiers (the true story of arguably the worst battle for us soldiers in vietnam) and hbo's a bright shining lie.
