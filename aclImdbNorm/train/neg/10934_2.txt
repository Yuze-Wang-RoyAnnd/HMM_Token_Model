first of all, let me say the i am lds or rather, i am a mormon. so when i watched this film, i automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt. i can usually find something redeeming in every movie i watch. and this one was no exception. it does have its redeeming moments. but they are few and far between.<br /><br />one of the first things i noticed that bothered me very greatly was that it seemed as though halestorm was ashamed of our church! in the lds church, congregations are called "wards" and the basketball court is in the "cultural hall". never once are either of these two names mentioned. the church is never referred to by name and "the standards" is as far as it goes in mentioning what our church believes.<br /><br />it makes me wonder if the directors are really lds or lds wannabes? this film had so much potential! it could have really shown our church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer, but also what we believe. instead it was only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired. if i were not already lds, i'd be left thinking mormons are stupid, idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs.<br /><br />it is not a film i will recommend to my nonlds friends.<br /><br />sorry halestorm. you can do better than this!
