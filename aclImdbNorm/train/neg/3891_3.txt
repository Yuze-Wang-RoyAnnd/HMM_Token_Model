i think that my favorite part of this movie, the one that exemplifies the sheer pointless, stupidity and inanity of the proceedings, comes at the climax of the film. doctor ted nelson and his unmarried friend the sheriff have finally cornered the melting man on a landing on some stairs in an electrical generating plant. keep in mind that nelson has been looking for the mm for nearly the entire film, and that the mm has killed and eaten several people at this point (including his boss), and nelson is very aware that mm is violently insane and hungry for human flesh and blood.<br /><br />so the sheriff has his gun pointed at mm, who is, and i give the movie and rick baker props for this, the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form that we have ever seen. and he yells a very important question to doctor ted nelson: "what do we do now?!?!?" <br /><br />the camera cuts over to doctor ted nelson, and it's obvious that ted has no idea what to do next. apparently ted was so intent on the problem of finding the melting man, he never thought to bring along some restraining devices, a lasso, or straitjacket, or a net, or some tranquilizer darts, or maybe a new age tape by vangelis to soothe the savage beast.<br /><br />so the sheriff panics and shoots, the melting man goes berserk, and hilarity ensues. <br /><br />maybe this explains why nasa has been screwing around with the space shuttle program in sub-lunar space for the last 30 years instead of going back to the moon or out to mars like everyone knows they ought to be doing. i dunno.<br /><br />anyway, that's the kind of lousy, lazy writing and direction that undercuts every aspect of this movie. it's hard to say how good the actors actually are, because the movie has complete contempt for their characters.<br /><br />two other incredibly painful sequences also ramp up the stupidity of the proceedings: there is a scene featuring the lumpiest old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a grove, only to be torn apart by the melting man. this scene is a nadir in 70s cinema. i can guarantee you've never watched a more pointless and irritating setup with odder looking people in your entire life. and the melting man's assault on the lady who lives in the house where they keep a horse who pees on the walls defies every attempt to process it.(btw, i think famous film director jonathon demme has a walk-on in this scene as the redneck husband who goes in first to check on the house and never comes out again). the only thing that keeps the actress from literally chewing the scenery is that, as i said, their horse has apparently been peeing on it. and we are forced to watch her hysterics for at least two minutes longer than any sane film director would hold the shot. <br /><br />burr debenning ought to beat the crap out of imm's director and photographer. i remember him from an old columbo episode where he looked much better than he does here - no one's idea of a leading man, but solid and unobtrusive. but no one could possibly be as unappealing in real life as his director makes him look here. <br /><br />everyone else comes off a little better except for the old couple (and shut up, i know they were being played for laughs, but i ain't laughing!) but not much. <br /><br />this definitely falls into the 'so bad you can't look away' category of cinema disasters. still, i'd watch it again before i'd watch a lot of other 70's and 80's abortions ( "track of the moonbeast" and "it lives by night" come to mind), and mst's coverage of it is great fun, so if you get a chance, watch the mst version.
