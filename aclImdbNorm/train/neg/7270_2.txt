i gave this loooooooooooong film a "2" because of the attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. otherwise, if you can't read like a speed-reader you will never get through the subtitles that try to keep up with the spanish speed talking! and, what the hell is going on in the plot if you can't read the subtitles. endless stares and goof-eyes and constant rejection. just boring after an hour or so. some good cinematography but also some so dark you think your screen has burned out. how this won anything i will never understand. difficult to talk about "acting" since the lead actors seem to just stare and look lovingly at each other when they are not pushing each other away. the character geraldo is so attractive that it is difficult to believe that anyone would push him away. and what is with his mother? i just plain didn't get it most of the time except that there were three guys that all seem to have had a history with each other....but never figured out who was whose "ex."
