my roommate got the no, no, nanette soundtrack as a dub on a tape and she proceeded to listen to it non-stop. after it finally totally brainwashed me into submission, i found the songs to be irresistible, especially the famous, i want to be happy, but i can't be happy... but of coarse from the soundtrack i had no idea what the film was about. so the other day i saw a copy of it at the video store and i rented what was supposed to be a long lost version of the film. i was thinking that it was going to be amazing, because the soundtrack is so cute. unfortunately most of the songs that i loved were nowhere to be found in the video i saw. now i've never seen the 1930 version of the musical but this version was sadly disappointing because there was very little singing and practically no dancing and beside that the sound was really bad through out and you couldn't really understand what people were saying a lot of the time. really the only highlights of this film were the outrageous 1940's fashion. nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that stick out like rabbit ears and kansas kitty has this bizarre feather muff that she keeps on her fore arm and then has herself wrapped in this net scarf. the one dance sequence is a little weird too with nanette doing this weird ballet stuff with pin-up girl imagery superimposed on top of her. actually one more bright spot of the film was the artist guillespe who dreams of being a fine artist but it currently condemned to drawing pin-up girls for money. i like how guillespe keeps it old school, and disses nanette when his masterpiece, the piece that was to make his career, is sold by nanette for a paltry $5250. doesn't she realize that that piece was his immortality? silly rabbit/girl with your feather rabbit ears on your hat. when will you learn? why doesn't he just pencil in a cigarette before the ad men take the work away?
