i'm sorry to all the fans, but this is a useless movie. the acting is bad, even wooden, it over-hypes the fright-factor early on, and doesn't exactly work. i think there was supposed to be a twist at the end, but it just ended up being maddeningly confusing. what the hell? the dude who was killing everyone was one of the hunted? try again.<br /><br />its hardly original, and it isn't even particularly good as a straight slasher. and that's saying something.<br /><br />i think whoever did the castings, whoever wrote the script, and whoever thought of the concept should be mercilessly fired and deported.<br /><br />don't watch this movie. if someone puts this on at a party, throw the disc out the window and put on a good horror movie, like silence of the lambs or the shining.
