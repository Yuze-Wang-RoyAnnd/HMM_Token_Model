i have seen some pretty bad movies, and this is right up there. no plot to speak of, it's like one of those bad coma episodes on a soap-opera. i just wanted to smack that little girl because, well lets just say, she's real suspicious all the way through the movie. the monsters running around wearing some bling was funny. i also saw a bit of "silent hill" in there. and i read that this was done by, and or stared a finnish metal band, lordi. so it's no wonder that it didn't make much sense. it seem to be a vehicle for promoting there band and nothing more. the fx are very good, the look of the movie, the monsters, and even the acting also good. but the story and the telling of it, just aren't there.
