do not bother to waste your money on this movie. do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you. if you must see a movie this weekend, go see batman again.<br /><br />the script was horrible. perfectly written from the random horror movie format. given: a place in confined spaces, a madman with various weapons, a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together, and an innocent and overly curious, yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend. mix together, add much poorly executed gore, and what the hell, let's put some freaks in there for a little "spin" to the plot.<br /><br />the acting was horrible, and the characters unbelievable - borat was more believable than this.<br /><br />***spoiler***and can someone please tell me how a butcher's vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch??? i'm in the army. we need that kind of stuff for ourselves.<br /><br />1 out of 10, and i would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score i can.
