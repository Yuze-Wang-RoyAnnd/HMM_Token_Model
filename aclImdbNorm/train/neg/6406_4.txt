an update of the skits and jokes you would have seen on a burlesque stage in the first half of the 20th century. it's a string of several jokes acted out. some of them you could tell your grandmother, some of them not, but it's a fairly safe bet she's heard them all before. for what it tries to be, it's not too bad. before you rent it, remember that it's an older style of entertainment and has more value as history than as comedy or titillation. robin williams has a couple of bits, but he's interchangeable with the other players.
