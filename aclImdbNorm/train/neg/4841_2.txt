really??? <br /><br />i am truly amazed to see the glowing reviews here! <br /><br />this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. it is one big pathetic, grainy, clich'e. i would have laughed out loud, and a lot, but was on a date with an ex-military guy. i could not hide my other response, boredom. yes, i think my date, a flat-line "good old boy", liked it. that's not a compliment. i know an actor wants to work.... fine for the others. but ralph, come on.<br /><br />it was a painful tease from ralph. i vote a 2 only because ralph looked so stunning. but i must plead, ralph, how could you? and, why?? <br /><br />i'm going to go watch the end of the affair to heal and recover now.... c1
