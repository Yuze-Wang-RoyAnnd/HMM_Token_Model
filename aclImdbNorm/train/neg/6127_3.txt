as i am from hungary i have heard many people saying better and better things about "uvegtigris so far, but actually i don't understand the reason of all the fuss.<br /><br />i liked many points of the movie, some of the quotes really cheered me up, but the stereotyped characters are present again, like in every hungarian film, and the story is also pretty dull. i liked the first half, but then i started to get bored, and then i found the whole film just boring.<br /><br />rudolf p'eter is good as always, reviczky is brilliant also, but the others are just there... doing nothing.<br /><br />how many years still have to pass for a good hungarian film???
