if you want to watch a real 'quality' movie get hold of the eden formula. this wondrous film must have cost all of $50 to make. it features a wafer thin script, pathetically bad sets, lighting and camera work, and a stop motion, paper-mache monster that is utterly laughable (it looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and/or a glove puppet for the monster - but all were equally dreadful). <br /><br />the actors all speak their lines as though they've never seen them before and are reading off a teleprompter. the special effects are way beyond lousy. and the only sad thing is that they dropped the really nifty original title 'tyranasaurus wrecks' which sums up exactly what you get for the full 90 minutes.<br /><br />this is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard you break through to the crud that lies underneath. <br /><br />i loved every minute of it.
