****minor spoilers*** as a bad movie connoisseur i must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet "hobgoblins" stands apart from all others in it's own unique way. classic baddies such as "the creeping terror," "the mighty gorga" and "manos" are uniformly bad from start to finish. "hobgoblins" on the other hand, starts off bad and gets progressively worse as it goes. during my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene i thought to myself that this was a truly bad film. i was blissfully unaware that i had just seen the best that this movie had to offer. the movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept "club scum" sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another. with just this one film, director rick sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of coleman francis and bill rebane as one of the worst directors of all time. how bad can a bad movie be? watch "hobgoblins" and wonder no longer.
