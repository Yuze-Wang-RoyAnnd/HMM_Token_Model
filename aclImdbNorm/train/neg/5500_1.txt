this movie tries hard, but completely lacks the fun of the 1960s tv series, that i am sure people do remember with fondness. although i am 17, i watched some of the series on youtube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun. sadly, this movie does little justice to the series.<br /><br />the special effects are rather substandard, and this wasn't helped by the flat camera-work. the script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour. other films with under-par scripting are home alone 4, cat in the hat, thomas and the magic railroad and addams family reunion.<br /><br />now i will say i liked the idea of the story, but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early, and i am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy. and i was annoyed by the talking suit, despite spirited voice work from wayne knight.<br /><br />but the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of christopher lloyd, jeff daniels and daryl hannah, all very talented actors. jeff daniels has pulled off some good performances before, but he didn't seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing, and elizabeth hurley's character sadly came across as useless. daryl hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored, and i liked the idea of her being the love interest, but sadly you see very little of her,(not to mention the monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them) likewise with wallace shawn as some kind of government operative. christopher lloyd acquits himself better, and as an actor i like lloyd a lot(he was in two of my favourite films clue and who framed roger rabbit, and i am fond of back to the future) but he was given little to work with, and had a tendency to overact quite wildly.<br /><br />overall, as much i wanted to like this movie, i was left unimpressed. instead of being fun, it came across as pointless, and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential, with some talented actors and a good idea, but wasted with poor execution. 1/10 bethany cox
