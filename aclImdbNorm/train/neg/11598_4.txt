when you look back at another bad nightmare sequel like freddy's revenge, you have to at least give it some credit for trying something new. and although the dream child is more enjoyable it offers absolutely nothing new to the series. yes, there's the creative deaths as usual, like a kid becoming part of a comic book and facing "super freddy" but even scenes like that aren't used to their full potential and the parts without freddy are just boring.<br /><br />this marked the official death of scariness to the series. freddy seems to be the comedic relief now...but to what?<br /><br />my rating: 4/10
