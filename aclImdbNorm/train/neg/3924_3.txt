truly terrible, pretentious, endless film. director bellocchio seems to be infatuated with the pretty face and figure of his actress detmers - and who can blame him? but maybe, just maybe, he should have focused his attention a little more on making a good, engaging film. i hate it when a sex film poses as an "art film" just to become more "respectable". the frequent, occasionally hot sex scenes are the only reason for this movie's existence. whether or not they are worth sitting through the rest of the picture is strictly a matter of taste.
