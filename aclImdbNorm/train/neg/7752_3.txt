the film is about a sabretooth on the lose at a amusement park where teens are on a scavenger hunt. since there are no rules they break into a building and start getting killed off. the deaths are cheesy and are dumb. but at least it had better effects then sabretooth. i gave it a three because stacy was in it and i loved the movie sabretooth. i thought it was okay but some deaths were off-screen. there was a dumb scene where the two teens kiss and the sabretooth's head pops out and the boy leaves his girlfriend behind leaving her to have her totally fake looking red guts out. then the sabretooth gets up in the vents and bites the kids head off. the end death with the owner was totally fake looking graphics. even that death was stupid because the statues tooth went through his mouth and hangs there like that will support it and there is a scene when a goth girl loses her contacts doesn't find them, and seems like she doesn't need the. the film is idiotic and a waste of time.
