if you rent a movie titled "exterminators of the year 3000," the odds are good you know what you're getting yourself into. i myself was sold by the promising descriptions of "nuke mutants," "motor-psychos," and of course the "exterminators" themselves which, according to the back of the movie-store case, are all cavorting around a post-apocalyptic barren wasteland wreaking all sorts of mayhem. let the wacky hijinks and low budget buffoonery ensue--at least, such were my hopes for this "film."<br /><br />now i like the occasional terrible movie, and if you're reading the comments on exterminators of the year 3000, you probably do too. that being said, i rated this film a solid "1(awful)"--not because i completely hated the film but because it is one of the most legitimately dreadful efforts at movie-making i have ever seen. the dialogue, the acting, the cinematography, the sound-editing, the editing in general, the plot, etc., etc., etc--all are worthy of what must surely be low spectator expectations given that marvelous title.<br /><br />so what is really "good" about this bad movie? it does have several of what my circle affectionately terms "quality kills." a quality kill, for those few of you unfamiliar with the phrase, isn't a hard and fast term, but in general refers to someone killed in a particularly gruesome, creative, or ridiculous fashion.<br /><br />exterminators of the year 3000 also has a fair supply of "dialogue-so-bad-it-becomes-funny," provided in great part by crazy bull, the aptly titled leader of the hapless motor-psycho gang--who incidentally also provide most of the quality kills (if you're hoping for big things from the nuke mutants, think again, they play essentially zero part in the movie...shucks!). crazy bull, however, is all you could ask for in a b-movie motor-psycho. shakespearean paraphrase and oddly pg-style insults are all he knows how to say...and that's terrific.<br /><br />despite its quality kills and bad dialogue, however, if you're looking for a truly entertaining bad movie, exterminators of the year 3000 does disappoint somewhat in that with its draw limited to things like silly and outdated special effects, quality killing, and bad dialogue, there is simply not enough to justify a full feature length, owing principally to the forty minutes or so in which the audience is forced to follow the characters in protracted and boring car "chases" and long desert hiking sequences...all in all, a pretty good awful movie, but hey, it's no death race 2000.
