this is the worst movie i have ever seen. i was deceived into thinking it might be good because a couple of my favorite actors are in it. now i want to punch jason schwartzman in the face for taking this role. i was physically ill after watching this film. i really don't understand hollywood sometimes. there are so many people trying to break in that i'm sure you can skim off the top and get the very best. that way the worst movie you make is equivalent to ferris beullar instead of this sludge. the gags like the hair doll and blatantly ripping off jeans commercials added to the humorlessness of the film. glad i avoided this film and watched it on tv. this proves that you should avoid january releases at all cost.
