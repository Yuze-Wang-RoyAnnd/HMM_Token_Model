like watching a neighbor's summer camp home movies, "indian summer" is a sleep inducing bore. eight alumni campers are barely introduced, when unbelievably boring flashbacks begin for characters we know nothing about. fine actors, alan arkin, and bill paxton are totally wasted in this film. one camper's observation that "everything seems so much smaller than i remember it" is repeated at least ten times, enough to make you squirm. the anticipated pranks are neither funny or original, unless you think that short sheeting is a real "howler". this movie was a great disappointment considering the ample talent involved. "indian summer" did not make me homesick, just sick. - merk
