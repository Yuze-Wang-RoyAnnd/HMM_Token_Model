very disappointing film. by the end i no longer cared for any of the characters. i did enjoy seeing ving rhames in a very small part, and william macy was good as always, still not worth watching. it starts out strong and just keeps getting weaker and weaker. insomniacs will like it as i am sure it will put them to sleep.
