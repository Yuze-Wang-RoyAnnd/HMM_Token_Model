if you want to laugh like crazy, rent cage. cage is about two war heroes, billy and scott who are best friends. when billy is shot in vietnam, he is unable to fend for himself, so scott takes him in.<br /><br />i have never seen a movie with more gay references to the two main characters. billy and scott love to "wrestle" and scott tells billy that he is "still sore from last night," among other things.<br /><br />wonderful catch phrases like "shut the sh!t up" and "ping pang pong, cut the sh!t" will keep you laughing for hours. the native american guys that are supposed to be playing mexican gang members are also top notch. as they say, it's "party time right now. ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba." i could go on forever, but just watch this movie and laugh your a$$ off. it was so funny i went out and bought the dvd for $5.99
