there is not a speck of entertainment in this entire film. there's not one scary, funny, or even interesting scene in this film. it advertises itself as a horror, then goes on to call itself a comedy. it doesn't even attempt humor. neither does it attempt to be scary.<br /><br />in order to not be bored by this film, you would have to be one of the most easily entertained people on earth. if you like this movie even a little bit than you have no standard for what you watch at all. i'm having a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this. its not funny, scary, shocking, or intriguing. so was it supposed to be a drama? because it really wasn't dramatic either.<br /><br />please just do yourself a favor and don't watch this film. life is too precious to be wasting 90 minutes of it watching this.
