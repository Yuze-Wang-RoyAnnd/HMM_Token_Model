my god, what an incredible movie it is! reminded me so much of the similar scene in mel gibson's movie "we were soldiers" when "the company is not lost, they're just cut off" and the other scene in pearl harbour when the british officer says to ben affleck "if all americans are like you, then god help the nation that goes to war with america!<br /><br />put all 3 movies together and you would have enough bullshit to fertilise the entire sahara desert.<br /><br />the story of the cut-off battalion may be real enough but the movie could have done without all that american preachy jingoistic propaganda attached to it. there were audible groans in the cinema during the above-mentioned scene in pearl harbour (no kidding either) the lost battalion however is really in a class of its own
