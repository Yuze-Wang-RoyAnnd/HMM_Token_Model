my spouse & i found this movie to be very schlocky. it started out good, but quickly got unbelievable & ridiculous. most of the acting was poor, with the exception of the little girl, abbie, who really was terrific. in addition, the dialog was predictable & lame - especially gideon, the angel's. also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she almost appears nonchalant. at first we thought it was 'shock', but then we realized that it was just a terrible script. we love almost all of the hallmark movies & their heart-warming stories, but this movie doesn't rise to the occasion of being one. there are so many great ones - don't waste your time with this horrible movie.
