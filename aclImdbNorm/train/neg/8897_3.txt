i remember when i first saw this movie, i was in sixth grade when it happened. before i saw this, i had listened to the original broadway recording of it, and i really loved it! but when i saw this, i was like, what the heck?! this movie is missing a lot of the songs from the musical for crying out loud! who decided to do all of that?!<br /><br />i really am a very huge fan of gene kelly, but this movie is probably the worst of a musical that he ever did! the movie looked more like a hollywood set than the beautiful highlands of scotland. and who the heck decided to cut all of meg's songs out of the movie?! <br /><br />i am willing to bet that when they saw this movie, lerner and lowe were probably wondering: "who in the world decided to do this to our masterpiece?" well they had a right to say that if they did, they were probably mad at the fact that hollywood turned their great musical into this rather blank movie.<br /><br />song and acting wise mr. kelly, you passed the audition with flying colors, but you are in a movie that is missing a lot of the text.<br /><br />so in short, if you want a good movie based on a musical by frederick lowe and alan jay lerner, this one isn't it! <br /><br />3/10
