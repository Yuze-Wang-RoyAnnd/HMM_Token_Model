remember the good ol' animated batman show from the 90's? the one that people praised? the one that people of all ages could all appreciate? the one that showed batman as a real detective instead of the hulk in a bat suit? the one that had villains you could relate to? the one that had villains with real motives?<br /><br />well clearly, warner bros. doesn't. hence this dreck.<br /><br />honestly, do these people know anything about batman? have they even looked at a batman comic before? do they know batman's meant to be a 'detective'? putting together 2 clues does not make you a detective! that makes you a slightly intelligent monkey!<br /><br />this is the basic layout for an episode:<br /><br />penguin steals something. 'opening credits'. batman finds dead giveaway of where he is. batman goes there and get's into trouble. commercial. batman finds obvious/ stupid way out of it. penguin escapes. penguin does something obvious again. batman follows. they do kung-fu (by the way everyone, and i mean everyone know's kung-fu for some reason). batman punch's penguin. he get's knocked out. goes to arkham. (note: it's usually a different villain every episode)<br /><br />well as you may have noticed from that, batman's not a great detective. "joker left this piece of cotton candy on the ground, maybe he's at the old amusement park"! yeah maybe, he was there the last 6 times.<br /><br />and i've already mentioned this but, everyone knows kung-fu! even penguin! what where they thinking? (probably because it's from the people who made that jackie chan animated series)<br /><br />what's really upsetting is that the show is just action. no smarts. none. if batman needs think, he'll use technology, then do some kung-fu.<br /><br />but hey, let's not forget the villains. afterall, what would batman be without his rogues gallery?<br /><br />well first off, i gotta say, kudos for originality. i don't think other batman media would have envisioned joker and a dread-locked monkey man, riddler like an emo, and poison ivy as a minor (which is kind of confusing when you think about, isn't her sexuality meant to be her main strength?)<br /><br />what's even more crap however is that, every character is now a 2-dimensional, stereotypical crook.<br /><br />e.g.<br /><br />killer croc wants to flood gotham for no reason.<br /><br />man-bat is a power hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for some unexplained reason.<br /><br />penguin just wants to steal everything. for no reason.<br /><br />noticing a pattern here?<br /><br />but the most insulting has got to be mr freeze.<br /><br />do you remember the emmy award winning 'heart of ice' episode from batman: the animated series? the one that gave mr freeze motives for his crimes? the episode that was so good that it was used in the comics over his original back story (mad scientist)? the one that made him a victim, with a goal? hell, even batman & robin acknowledged that, using that as mr freezes origin in that p.o.s. movie.<br /><br />well this series says "f#ck that" and makes mr freeze a jewelry robber before his accident, with only wealth in his mind, then gets frozen and gives him the power to make things cold. he then continues to steal jewels for no reason, while saying sh!t lines like "have an ice day".<br /><br />maybe they did watch batman &robin after all.<br /><br />but hey, look on the bright side. this series makes you feel nothing for the villains so that means that you're a good person. good for you.
