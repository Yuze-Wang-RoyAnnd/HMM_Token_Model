this "screwy comedy" seems very forced. indeed, the actors try very hard to make a go of an essentially unfunny script. and, as a result it doesn't really go anywhere. the idea of a woman finding out she was pregnant after getting a quickie divorce just isn't all that funny. and then, when cooper sneaks off with the baby because he doesn't want it put up for adoption just seems terribly unfunny and it's really pushing hard to turn this into a comedy. it's really a shame, too, as the actors were more capable than the script and i found myself just bored by the whole mess. considering that cooper made so many good comedies, i recommend you see them instead.
