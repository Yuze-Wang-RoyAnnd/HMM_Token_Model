this is a truly awful film. what they have done is taken a tv show, which was never aimed at young children & given it the george lucas treatment (i.e. ruined it by kiddifying it to appeal to the younger audience).<br /><br />ok so the thunderbirds tv show wasn't exactly the most cerebral of shows, in fact it was pretty formulaic, but it was always enjoyable to watch (especially when the models got blown up) and the voice cast wasn't too bad.<br /><br />this suffers from bad casting & bad acting (with the notable exceptions of sophia myles as lady penelope & ron cook as parker, who seem to be the only cast members to have a clue about how their characters should be played) & after this travesty i wouldn't let frakes direct traffic.<br /><br />the whole point of thunderbirds was that it was about the whole tracy family & how they worked as a team, preventing disasters or coming to the rescue of those involved in disasters.<br /><br />avoid this rubbish like the plague.<br /><br />i only give it 1 out of 10 because a zero rating is not supported.
