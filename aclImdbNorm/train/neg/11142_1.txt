this is the absolutely worst piece of crap i've ever had to watch - actually it was so bad that i just had to watch it :-)<br /><br />the cgi is sooo bad it's fun! it's not even close to the shitty cgi animations in spawn, that's how bad it is, har har har...<br /><br />i'm amazed over the fact that some distribution company actually has put money down to release this on dvd, but i guess they'll get more money out of it that way, 'cos the cost of making it can not have been more than a few hundred dollars.<br /><br />it's so awful that a kindergarten class could have made it.<br /><br />see it and laugh!
