sadly i don't remember the book anymore, but i do recall that i was captivated by the stories of edgar wallace. this film represents a typical german production of low quality. it does not hold my attention - although the story itself is good, it is just badly adabted. at the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances. even the well known and liked german actors joachim fuchsberger and eddy aren't cannot rescue this poor spectacle. however there's hope ... i've been told that the films following this one are getting better and better. so in conclusion i must say that this film doesn't deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon.
