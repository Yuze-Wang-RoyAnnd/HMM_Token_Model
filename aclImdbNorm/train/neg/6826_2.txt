it's been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad.. the acting is very average, the story is horribly boring, and i'm at a loss for words as to the execution. it was completely unoriginal. o, and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwood's a pregnant schwarzenegger! <br /><br />one of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% of let's face it - forgotten actors. if they were hoping for a career relaunch, then i think it might never happen with this on their cv! the script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pulled it off. fred durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest.<br /><br />i'm sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic, because not only it's a total loss of time, but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like.
