i've never understood the appeal of garbo. she always comes across in her films as stuck up, not all that alluring, and that annoying voice that could have drowned out the tuba section. she was also a very limited actress, like gloria swanson far better off left in the silent era. in this her last film, her performance is very average and even unassured. she tries hard but it all comes to nothing because the script is even worse than her acting.<br /><br />a would be screwball romcom that is never once believable and never gets off the ground (even though melvyn douglas manages to get airborne in the skiing scenes, which are really the only amusing thing here).<br /><br />there was potential but the script fails in almost every department, wasting every actor in it. douglas and garbo had good enough chemistry together but this one isn't even a spot on ninotchka, which i also found to be extremely overrated.
