well, what to say...<br /><br />having seen the film i still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was?? v.dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point... i had to look away from the screen, i was feeling physically sick... round and round and round.... you get the idea...<br /><br />very very strange accents at many points.... "those that should know, know"<br /><br />unless your getting in for free, or being paid to watch it, or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something.. then forget it...
