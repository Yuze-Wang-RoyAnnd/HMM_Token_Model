i should have never watched this movie. the style of filming may be considered artsy to some, but it is considered migraine-inducing to me. i think it may have had an interesting plot, but since i couldn't watch it for long stretches at a time i missed a lot. the flickering pictures and stop motion filming branded my brain. i stopped watching mid way through and won't be back for a second try. i suppose if i were home alone in my own lighthouse some dark and stormy evening, this might be just the ticket... ps not sure if the lighthouse/ film style thing can be considered a spoiler, but i don't want to be blacklisted on my first review ;)
