this is meant to be a comedy but mainly bad taste, and nothing remotely causing a smile in the film. the movie is about a couple trying for a child, and those people in real life who are in that situation will wince at the depictions that are portrayed. for instance scenes at a fertility clinic are not in the least funny and are quite frankly embarrassing. the male lead who plays a construction worker and in his hard hat comes across as a poor excuse for a reject from village people. the female lead is trying to look 20 years younger than she is. both leads come across as unappealing,unattractive and completely unconvincing. there are various ridiculous and totally unassuming gratuitous scenes in the film, for example with a budget airline, which is devoid of any humor. the only reason i give this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is one mark for shirley maclaine, who is a a class above anything else in the pic, and one mark for some half decent(albeit old) music.
