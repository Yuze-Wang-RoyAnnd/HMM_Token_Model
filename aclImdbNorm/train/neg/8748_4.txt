it was interesting to see how accurate the writing was on the geek buzz words, yet very naive on the corporate world. the justice department would catch more of the big corp giants if they did such naive things to win. the real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting, yet every bit as sinister. i seriously doubt any corp would actually kill someone directly; even the mod is more indirect these days. in the real world, they do kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, poisons, etc. this movie must have been developed by some garage geeks, i think, and the studios didn't know the difference. they just wanted something to capitalize on the microsoft antitrust case in the news.
