one of the other commenters mentioned that they almost walked out. if i hadn't been with my wife, who wanted to stay, i would have left. it's a shame, too, because i think it could have been a good movie. but this is easily one of the worst adapted screenplays i've ever seen. it starts out nowhere and it goes nowhere (i would say it goes nowhere fast, but it really goes nowhere slow...painfully slow). from time to time there are hints that something interesting might happen, or that there is potentially some depth underneath one of the characters, but that's all we get - hints. there is not a single payoff or revelation in the entire movie. not that i need a slick plot to be entertained...i love a good meandering character study as much as the next indie buff. but these characters add up to nothing. for the entire duration of the film you don't care what happens to a single one of them. as a matter of fact, you almost start hoping they die, because at least a death might be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unpredictable that you'd think it in itself would be compelling, but it's not. instead of quirky, noir-esquire characters acting in hard-boiled fashion, you simply recognize it immediately for what it is: a bunch of talented but miscast actors, brooding and raising their eyebrows while reading bizarre dialogue without a hint of relevant context. all this for two plodding, painfully slow hours. awful.
