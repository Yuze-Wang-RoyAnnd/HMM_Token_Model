i'm a big fan of lucio fulci; many of his giallo and splatter flicks are amongst my favourites of all time, but this made for tv movie is extremely sub par and not what i've come to expect from the great italian director. the film is neither interesting, like some of fulci's more tame giallo's, or gory like the majority of his cult classics; thus leaving it lacking in both major areas, and ultimately ensuring that the film isn't very good. the film works from a plot that has been used many times previously, but still it's an idea that always has the chance of springing an interesting story just because it focuses on the theme of the afterlife, which is the ultimate unknown. this film focuses on giorgio mainardi; a man that isn't exactly well liked and after he dies of an apparent stomach hemorrhage, there aren't many people that are sad to see him go. this means that his ghost is trapped somewhere between life and the afterlife, and so he decides to try and get to the bottom of his death, and his only ally in this endeavour is his daughter.<br /><br />the video that i saw this film on is proudly proclaimed that the film is "in the style of hp lovecraft", and that's one of the most blatant attempts to sell a film i've ever seen. there is nothing even slightly reminiscent of the great horror writer in this tale, and the reason for that tagline would appear to be because of title similarity to the stuart gordon/lovecraft film, 'from beyond' - which is a lot better. the film does benefit from a distinctly italian style, and the score is rather good. unfortunately, however, fulci has seen fit to positively roast every scene in it - and so the theme quickly becomes annoying. the plot plays out in a really boring way, and most of the scenes simply involve the ghost 'desperately' trying to find things out, or the daughter placing her suspicions over her family members. this movie was made for italian tv, and so it's not surprising that it's all rather tame. there's a little bit of gore and a nightmare sequence with zombies; but this isn't the fulci we all know and love. overall, this film is extremely mediocre and not a good representation of fulci's talents. not worth bothering with, unless you're a fulci completist.
