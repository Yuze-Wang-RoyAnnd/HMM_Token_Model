i rented this back in the 80's and honestly can't remember anything specific about the movie - only that it is the worst movie i have ever seen. this isn't one of those "it was so bad, it was funny". this isn't one of those "it was so gory, it leaves you with a bad feeling" movies. it wasn't even one of those "what the heck was that?" movies. i can't recall the performance of the actors, but it was poorly shot, the story was disjointed, and it had no definable style. when it was over, i was angry that i had wasted the time.<br /><br />i've seen plenty of movies i didn't understand because of unfamiliar cultures, styles and/or story-telling, but it was clear that those movies had some of those properties. the incubus has none.<br /><br />i actually contemplated not making a comment on this "piece" for fear that someone may watch it out of curiosity, but i am compelled to warn anyone who appreciates film to skip this movie.
