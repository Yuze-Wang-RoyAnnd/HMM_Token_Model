i've tried to like this film, really. in watching it, all i can think is, "this guy gives me the creeps, i would have gotten a restraining order". it also calls out codependence in capital letters. was this really the conversation before making the movie? "let's make a film that puts two chronically depressed, socially inept people into a relationship which deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are!" from what i've seen in life is that the last thing on earth we find attractive in a potential mate is constant self-pity. <br /><br />the mood of the movie is distinctly 80-ish; brooding and slow. don't get me wrong, the film has its moments, just very few of them.
