in modern day eastern europe life is hard and for young women prostitution is one of the only career options and one taken, reluctantly, by melania. she attracts the attentions of an american, seymour, who becomes obsessed with her, paying more and more money for time with her until he eventually wants to buy her outright. she has two pimps with differring emotional attachments to her and she is generally passed around like some piece of baggage with no feelings of her own. however, we are in "modern art-house cinema" territory, so conventions like narrative structure, lighting the subject so it can be seen, camera techniques that add to rather than distract from the action and a vaguely consistent plot can all be abandoned. much of the time i had no idea what was supposed to be happening and very rarely did i care. people began leaving the screening almost before the last latecomers had arrived and i don't think i've ever seen so many people walk out.<br /><br />images are important to the director - characters slowly emerge from or disappear into a dark screen, we get long lingering shots of nothing in particular and one sex scene takes place in infra-red. in fact for such an unconventional film the sex scenes were remarkably ordinary; missionary positions between naked people in bed abounded and there were no drugs or related weirdness. but perhaps these days being ordinary is unconventional.<br /><br />on the whole, almost entirely without merit.<br /><br />
