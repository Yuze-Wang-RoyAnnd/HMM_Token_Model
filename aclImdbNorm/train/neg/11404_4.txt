it's kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece. i am not a dullard as far as quality films go, and i will agree that from a technical filming standpoint, as well as for several of the characters portrayed, the film is in an award-worthy class. but there is no sense (for me) of this film actually going anywhere; i mean, taking the viewer anywhere. it is a series of mood scenes, perhaps remarkable as such, but i want more from a film. i look for story and movement and a fulfillment of arrival, none of which did i find in this film. yes, it might be considered poetry on film . . . but there is much poetry that i cannot live with for the same reason: that it paints pictures without going anywhere.<br /><br />one thing further to be said is that it documents a mid-century english childhood, which is necessarily limited in its universality. i was personally appalled at what a young british boy had to live through, in that time and place. having grown up in america just a decade earlier, i can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense. i cannot help wondering if this contrast has had some effect on those reviewing the film so favorably. in other words, could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its 'filmic magic' (which i acknowledge is there) and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of one's actual recalled experience?
