as an avid fan of cary grant, i expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter, as amc billed it as a comedy. i have never been more disappointed with a film! cary's usual charm and effortless comedy are awol from this entire movie; he comes across as strained, bored, and just not himself. mississip's character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes i have ever witnessed - his accent is terribly exaggerated (and incorrect, according to which part of mississippi he claims to hail from), and whenever he does deliver a line, it's several decibels higher than any other cast member. mississip tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable, country-bumpkin goofball, but in the end, he manages only to detract from the already weak plot. mansfield looks more like an obscene blow-up doll than a hollywood sex kitten, and while she was never known in hollywood for her acting ability, this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with. ray walston's character was sugary and ultimately contrived. for four men on shore leave, it was the tamest leave i've ever seen. i watched this nightmare until its very end, and while i won't spoil that for anyone, i will tell you that it's the most absurd you'll ever see. the film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men, but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast. sorry, cary!
