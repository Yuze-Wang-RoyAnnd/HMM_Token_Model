the best thing about camp films in general is that you know what to expect. it's like watching a professional wrestling match or a day time soap opera or a jerry springer show: you immediately can follow the skimpy plot, identify the cardboard characters, and watch in satisfaction while all the cliches are being fulfilled. however, at times, the director does something real unexpected. it may be something extraordinarily stupid, or something weird, or something insightful. the director makinen is up there with the best camp directors, and this is his best movie.<br /><br />in yon saalistajat, everything seems to come together. there's nothing good about it, but still manages to be a coherent whole. not once does the movie slow down - the action flows on and punches keep on coming.<br /><br />the weirdest thing is that there's no sense of time: some characters seem to take months doing something while other characters have only spent one hour at a bar. this is partially due to finnish summer where the sun never sets, so you don't experience the day turning into a night at all.<br /><br />finally: there is a plot, there, somewhere. you may have to watch the movie three times before you realize it, though.
