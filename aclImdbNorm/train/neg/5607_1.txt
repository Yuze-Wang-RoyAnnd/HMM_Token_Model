i sat through this movie expecting a thought-provoking, fact-based film. but instead was given some of the least thought out arguments against the christian faith imaginable. for instance, in an effort to prove that christianity is inherently violent, the narrator constantly quotes the bible without giving context, and thus altering the meaning of the text. jesus is quoted as commanding the execution of those who disobey him, when in fact, the quote is from a parable jesus told, involving a king who is then quoted. thus the narrator makes it appear as if jesus says one thing when he is actually telling a story where one of his characters says it. this is dishonesty in a very obvious form. is this really what atheism has to offer the world? this film also attempts to use the success of the passion of the christ over jesus christ: superstar and the last temptation of the christ as evidence that christians are bloodthirsty. he makes no mention of the fact that the passion was the most historically accurate bible-film to date. he makes no mention of the fact that it was actually the best liked by critics of the bunch. he then edits in a series of violent images from the passion as if to hammer home his point. ironically, he makes no mention of the texas chainsaw massacre which came out a few months later and plays violence for entertainment, versus dramatic effect.<br /><br />one thing that really bothered me was his mockery of people who actually knew more about the subject matter than he did. all the christians he interviewed were average schmoes in the parking lot of billy graham's new york crusade. atheists he interviewed for the film were notable authors and scholars. he asked the christians how the christian movement started, and of course, they said it started with the holy spirit coming to the disciples at pentecost. which is correct (acts 2). he then gives the commentary, "isn't it funny how so few christians seem to know the origins of their own faith?" and proceeds to explain that the apostle paul started christianity after being stopped on the road to damascus. the poor chap seems convinced that acts 9 happens before acts 2. more deception? or is this simply ignorance? he also throws around nonsense that paul didn't believe jesus was a real person. are you kidding me? 1 corinthians 15 describes jesus death and resurrection being witnessed by people (whom paul names in the passage) for the corinthians to question if they are in doubt!<br /><br />there are many many other examples of how full of crap this 'documentary' is. but because i don't have time or patience to go into them all, i'll skip straight to the end. it's obvious throughout the whole movie that the narrator has an emotional vendetta against his upbringing in the church. and the climax interview is his childhood principle! in a last-ditch attempt to disprove the christian faith, the narrator tries to make a fool out of someone who gave him a detention as a child. is this what passes as an intellectual documentary for the atheist community? surely there are intelligent atheist filmmakers out there who can make a documentary that isn't a load of made-up crap passed off as 'facts'.
