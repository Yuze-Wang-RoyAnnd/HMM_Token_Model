just finished watching, can't say i was impressed.<br /><br />it starts of quite good, the visual and the atmosphere gives a creepy feeling as this type of movie should. but it all ends when the first lordi monster appears. not only do you recognize them from the band lordi, but they are seriously malplaced in the movie. doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are so 80's.<br /><br />as for the storyline, it starts of as similar horror movies, people trapped inside a hell hole. but there is no clear story on why and what is happening. the viewer is thrown some lines on possible reasons, but the lines never meet and end up to anything but a mess.<br /><br />with all the money spent on this film, with an intriguing start and some good effects, i had thought someone would have taken better care of the product. i wonder if lordi made this movie just to prove that their show costumes could be scary (except they aren't).<br /><br />so the movie gets cred for the visuals, i guess the money had to go somewhere. but the rest is an embarrassing attempt from a rock band to make their on-stage monster aliases scarier.
