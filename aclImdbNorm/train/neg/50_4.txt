three part "horror" film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go "out there" and (unfortunately) gives us three tales to prove why.<br /><br />the first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet up with two psychos. it leads up to two totally predictable twists. still, it's quick (about 15 minutes), violent, well-acted and well-done. predictable but enjoyable.<br /><br />the second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money. his car breaks down, he's attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic. very obvious, badly done and extremely slow. even at 30 minutes this is too long. good acting though.<br /><br />the third is just barely a horror story. it involves a beautiful, lonely woman looking for mr. right. it has beautiful set designs, a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene. but (again) predictable and not even remotely scary.<br /><br />it ends very stupidly.<br /><br />all in all, the first one is worth watching, but that's it. tune in for that one then turn it off.
