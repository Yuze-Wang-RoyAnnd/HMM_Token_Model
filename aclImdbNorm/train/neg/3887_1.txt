i managed to grab a viewing of this with the aid of mst3k, and oh boy, even with the riffing this movie was excruciatingly bad. imagine someone whose competence with a camera could be out done by a monkey.<br /><br />the highlights (what little there were) came from the special effects, which were "ok". the acting for the most part was also "ok"; though nothing special, it was of a higher quality than other b-movies i have seen in the past.<br /><br />the rest of this movie is dismally bad, the camera work often looks like they've just put the camera man on roller skates and pushed him along. the story (if it can be called that) is so full of holes it's almost funny, it never really explains why the hell he survived in the first place, or needs human flesh in order to survive. the script is poorly written and the dialogue verges on just plane stupid. the climax to movie (if there is one) is absolutely laughable.<br /><br />if you can't find the mst3k version, avoid this at all costs.
