this is one of the worst movies i've ever encountered, but i want to say that some of the criticisms i had heard turned out to be unwarranted..<br /><br />as far as pure film-making technique goes, this director is competent. he's held back by the limited budget and the vhs camera, but the actual editing, camera angles, camera movements and scene staging are pretty professional. i've seen many movies where the "directing" was much worse. at least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and he has a few clever shots here and there. also, the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere. there is only so much you can do with a vhs camera, and he does a nice job as far as the technicalities go. as far as artistic merit, there is none. the scene where the camera pans down so that we can watch a guy urinate in the woods for 15 seconds sort of epitomizes the artistic style of the whole film. this is pure trash... total garbage.<br /><br />the gore is decent for a film in this budget range. , it's obviously fake but there's lot's of it, and it's very outlandish..<br /><br />i saw the american version with the intentionally campy dubbing. this was a good idea (and it's the only thing that allowed me to make it through the film)... unfortunately, it's overdone, especially towards the end.<br /><br />it's really a terrible film, but i have to recommend it for it's camp value. it's really hard to find a movie that's worse than this and that sort of puts it in a unique category.
