this is one really bad movie. i've racked my brain and i cannot come up with one positive comment to make. the acting is atrocious. i've seen more believable performances on cable access. the plot is ridiculous. stolen diamonds, secret recordings of the president, and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst. night of the sharks isn't even so bad it's good. the dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before it's filmed. and to top it off, night of the sharks has the worst soundtrack i've ever heard. i'm surprised my ears didn't start bleeding from the 80s techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to record.<br /><br />from everything i've read, the italian film industry was dead by 1987. night of the sharks is like a final nail in the coffin.
