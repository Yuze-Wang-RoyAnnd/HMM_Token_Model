poor michael madsen; he must be kicking himself to know folks have found out about this horrible flick. i really can't think of anything worse i have ever seen, except amateur porn. it's that bad, and all here; wooden acting, bad script, crappy moral ending, you hate it and it is in this movie.<br /><br />my question is: "who the hell put $$$ into this piece of doggy doo? at least we could have seen michael's sister virginia nude in a scene, but i don't think even that would save this stinker...<br /><br />for a cool guy that has made some exception movies, i want to know what wacky church sponsored this piece of crapola.
