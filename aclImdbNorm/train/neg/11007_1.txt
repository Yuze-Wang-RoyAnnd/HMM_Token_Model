lately they have been trying to hock this film late-night on cable tv commercials. don't believe the hype. i was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres. this is, in my opinion, the 3rd worst movie of all time, just behind mac & me (#1 worst), and jack frost (#2 worst), but i must admit, they are all close and all terrible! really, nothing of this movie is funny, or disturbing, or anything else it claims to be so don't waste your money. the only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy. i'm not lying about that. someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film. it is that awful. if you don't believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this, which i doubt you can finish. two thumbs enthusiastically down.
