i must admit, there are few books with corresponding movies that i have actually read before seeing the cinematic adaptation. nineteen eighty-four happens to be one of those rare cases. the book was great. it was immersive and interestingly prophetic. but the movie just plain sucked. it is easily the worst film i have ever seen. the only reason i didn't turn it off after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the movie was half of a two-part assignment for a class. it was dark and grotesque, but did nothing in the way of achieving the proper atmosphere. the acting was nothing above average, and considering the fact that there wasn't much to act out, this was severely disappointing. the book, for example, didn't give me the impression that winston was unable to blurt out more than a single syllable at a time. boring, disturbing, and visually unappealing, the movie totally cannibalized the book. wait a second...isn't it british?
