oh, for crying out loud, this has got to be the lamest movie i've seen all year, and i'm sorry the normally awesome john cusack was even involved in this brainless, twitty piece of stupidity. where sleepless in seattle delivered what amounts to be the same message, albeit on a more subtle, somewhat more mature level, serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer, and then proceeds to pound it into your psyche for the next tedious hour and a half or so (and that's an hour and a half of my life i'll never get back again, thank you very much!!). it's bad enough the main characters of this movie have the emotional maturity level of fourteen-year-olds (actually i've known better fourteen-year-olds...), except maybe for jeremy piven, who was enjoyable enough. just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie where kate beckinsale's character plays that annoying silliness of a game about throwing all sensibility to the wind (literally) had my best friend and i irritated beyond belief. i told my husband rockstar had more intelligence, and at least, the characters in rockstar weren't half as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this "serendipitous" mess. it's annoying to watch protagonists who seem to have no clue about choice in their lives, and feel they're nothing more than puppets to destiny and the whims of fate. how utterly tiresome. i'm sure this movie will be more likely enjoyed by those who'd rather not engage in the chaotic messiness of making more complex life choices and then responsibly living with the consequences. after all, here's a movie where our hero and heroine live happily ever after only after wreaking havoc and misery on two other people's lives (namely their respective fianc'ees), not to mention other relatives and friends, just to get there.<br /><br />
