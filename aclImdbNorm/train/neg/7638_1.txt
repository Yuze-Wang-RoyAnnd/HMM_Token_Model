i could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the end. i cannot comment on the story as i did not watch the whole film and the reason i couldn't watch it was because of the 'actors'. firstly, for the most part they just looked stiff and i'm sure their scripts were in their hands just out of frame - but that's a minor issue. the main issue i have with the actors isn't really their fault... it's whoever cast this film! come on, this movie came out in 2003... i thought that casting people in their late twenties to play teenagers went out of fashion with new wave?! i cannot watch a movie where one of the first lines, from a grown man older than myself, is "i'm 17!" how can anyone take that seriously????? don't fall victim to this movie, go out for a walk for 90 minutes and you'll get far more than this movie could ever give.
