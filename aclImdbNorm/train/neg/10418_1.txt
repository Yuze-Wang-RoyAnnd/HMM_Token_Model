this is not a children's movie!!!<br /><br />this movie is like a "bad acid trip" for kids under the age of 5. for a month my 4 year old from time-to-time would ask me "why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth" or "why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits?". (and that wasn't the worst of it). we stopped it about a 1/2 hour in but the damage had been done. intensely morbid, oppressive, violent. fortunately he's finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing. whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges. ... (go ahead censure me, my conscience is clear.).
