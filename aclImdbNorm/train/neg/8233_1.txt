this was probably the worst movie ever, seriously. i could actually do better myself, it wasn't even set up properly. it's like this movie had a $5 budget and left with change. don't watch it. i didn't even get all the way through this movie, had to turn it off. i've give this a 1/10 because it was hilarious how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie, but actually turned into a really bad comedy. basically, a bunch of girls crashed into a car, broke a headlight, and the owner of that car went after them. the bit that i saw was a women with a gun telling a load of girls to take all their clothes off, what the hell? it must be some kind of cheesy porn movie as well.
