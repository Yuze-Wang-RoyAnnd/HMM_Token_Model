the third installment of the "carnosaur" trilogy features a bunch of keystone kops-quality military commandos trying to kill two velociraptors and a t-rex. i give it a 4 out of sheer sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs. the movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy, it really can't be taken seriously. more significantly, however, watching this movie i can't help but notice some interesting parallels between the "carnosaur" and "xtro" trilogies. the first installment in both franchises is a dark, disturbing film that has become a cult classic, the second is an "alien" ripoff, and the third is a tongue-in-cheek, almost slapstick (whether intentional or not) movie that has you rolling on the floor laughing. also, like the "xtro" franchise, all the "carnosaur" movies are completely unrelated to one another. they they only carry the franchise name to drum up interest in the "sequels," i guess. obviously "carnosaur" and "xtro" have two different production groups at work here, but if you've seen all three movies of both franchises you find yourself referring back and forth between the two.
