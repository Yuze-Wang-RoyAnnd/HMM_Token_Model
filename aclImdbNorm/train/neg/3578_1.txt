there is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie. they took a sleazy story, miscast it, miswrote it, misfilmed it. it has bad dialogue badly performed in a meandering and trashy story.<br /><br />as badly as it fails as art, it fails even worse as commerce. who could have been the target market for this. what age group? what interest group?<br /><br />someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie. that i would pay to see.<br /><br />i've seen thousands of bad movies, and this ranks with "sailor who fell from grace" and "manos" ... my choices as the three most unredeemably bad movies i've ever seen. everybody associated with it should be forced to make conversation with vandamme for all eternity.<br /><br />i challenge you. watch this movie and perform an academic exercise - how could you take this and make it worse? i can't think of one way.
