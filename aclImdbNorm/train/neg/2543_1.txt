talk about your waste of money.. im just wondering why michael would star in such a turkey of a movie..michael is a great actor especially in the movie where he plays a man dying of cancer.. that was wonderful. as he tapes himself for his son to see it once he grows up .. michael is such a talented actor.. so what made him do this one??? i watched it and thought it was really dumb.. i guess at one time in their career they have the crappy movies .. especially "the squeeze" i didnt understand that one at all, and i feel his best performance was in "pacific heights" , his character really creeped me out.. and i really enjoyed "multiplicity". .that one was so hilarious !!! and he was just perfect for the role of "batman" .. and i kind of liked "night shift" and i love "johnny dangerously" too .. just too bad some of them end up doing lousy movies .. like this one was...
