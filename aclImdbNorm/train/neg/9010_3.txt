when you wish for the dragon to eat every cast member, you know you're in for a bad ride.<br /><br />i went in with very, very low expectations, having read some of the other comments, and was not let down. unlike some other cheap and failed movies, however, this one doesn't really remain hilariously (and unintentionally) funny throughout.<br /><br />-spoilers follow-<br /><br />first of all, plot it very inconsistent. looking past the "small" mistakes, such as the dragon growing up in 3 hours, the whole idea it's based on is messed up. see, the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites which really were dragon eggs. after explaining this, they show some peasant poking at one with his pitchfork and the dragon pops out. later, the obligatory "crazy scientist" guy babbles on about how dragons outlived the dinosaurs. so apparently humans were around when dinosaurs were, or we just have a fine little plot hole here. the other major thing is that the lab is blown up with a force "half as strong" as what was used for hiroshima. then two guys later walk in to check everything out, and it's almost unscathed! there's even another dragon, which grew out of who knows what. all in all it's very predictable. as soon as the guy mentioned cloning, i guessed they'd clone a dragon. that means that our mr. smarty-pants security guy isn't so intuitive and smart as the movie would have you believe, if you ignore that i knew this film would be about, you know, dragons.<br /><br />putting that aside, the second worst thing is the "special effects." others have mentioned the fake rocks falling during the beginning, the cg helicopter, and the dragon. it looks a bit better than a blob, but it ruined whatever it had going for it when it trudged down the hall in the same manner time after time. to their credit, the flying dragons in the beginning looked ok from far away (although the one in the cave is probably the worst one in the whole movie.) these things are funny to watch, however. the scenes where a million different shots of the same person facing different ways are shown are not. nor are the "introduction" screens with the vital stats.<br /><br />coming to the actors, they weren't the greatest, but i guess at least they tried? they seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors participating in the recent "bloodrayne," for example, and you've got to give them points for that. one thing i noticed though was that the woman who plays meredith often had her face covered in make-up that was many tones lighter than the rest of her. she looked like she had a bad run-in with some white-face.<br /><br />the script is bad and cheesy. you don't really notice the music, but it's actually not too bad for the most part.<br /><br />the bottom line is don't watch it unless you want to see it because you hear it's bad (like i did), although the only funny things are the bad cg effects. other than that, don't waste your time and money.
