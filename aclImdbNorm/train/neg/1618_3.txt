i went to see this movie with the most positive expectations. i had seen jacquet's previous movie (march of the penguins) and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio. however, i was severely disappointed. most of all, this movie is terribly boring. literally nothing happens. i tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend, and we both ended up laughing because i could only stammer things like "well then the winter comes, and then spring, and then there's an eagle, and a river, and one time it is dark, and the girl goes into a cave, and another time the fox has babies" and so on. after about half an hour i began sighing, yawning, rolling my eyes, cursing the reviewer at the radio station, and hoping that it would be over soon. but the movie went on and on. when it finally ended i had sunken so deep into my chair that i must have looked somewhat similar to stephen hawking. the most annoying parts of the movie are (a) the girl, who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with. she wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie (one year), and shows exactly two facial expressions: joy and seriousness. she is cute, no question about that. however, a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her all-too-human presence. i found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear, drown in the river, or something similarly terrible. (b) the commentary by the girl's adult voice, which tells us nothing but negligible, obvious, boring, redundant things. (c) the music, which is desperately lacking subtlety. when the girl is happily jumping around, the music jumps around, too. when the fox is threatened by an eagle, the music becomes threatening, too. it reminded me of the very early days of film-making, and was just too predictable to enjoy. admittedly, many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it, at least they got somehow involved. thus, my warning concerns adults only: if you are over ten years old, avoid this movie. you can get a better (and cheaper) sleep in most other places.
