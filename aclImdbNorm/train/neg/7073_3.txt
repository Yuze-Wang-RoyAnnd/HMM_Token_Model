we have an average family. dad's a famous rapper, we have the "rebelious teenage daughter", the adopted white kid, and the cute little kid. and we have careless housemaid, what show has had a housemaid like that? do we have a messed-up brady bunch? yay! when it first came out i thought it was really cool, mostly because i was young. the music was bad. the raps were so bad and they were too g-rated. all of his raps were about his family and friends and problems. the dad was kind of the "danny from full house" type of dad. always gave the advice out. but he wasn't a clean freak. they had a house-keeper for that. remember? the plots were basically lil' romeo was in trouble of some sort, or... not that's it. oh and maybe some preteen drama. yeah that stuff is good. not really. but its still a good show for kids. but nikelodean could do better.
