have previously enjoyed wesley snipes in several action flicks and i had expected a lot more, even from a score of 5.8 imdb, the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal, the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a "worst case scenario" of playing "strong" feelings accompanied by some bad acting... don't waist your time this movie 'isnt entertaining, if you wanna cry it might suffice though, even though your tears will be wept due to seeing wesley snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy...<br /><br />i give this 2/10 it really was awful, if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it, its all the good things this movie isn't.
