when i rented this movie, i had very low expectations......but when i saw it, i realized that the movie was less (a lot less) than what i expected. the actors were bad (the doctor's wife was one of the worst), the story was so stupid...it could work for a disney movie (except for the murders), but this one is not a comedy, it is a laughable masterpiece of stupidity. the title is well chosen except for one thing: they could add stupid movie after dead husbands! i give it 0 and a half out of 5.
