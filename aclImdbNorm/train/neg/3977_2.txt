identical twin sisters mary-kate and ashley olsen climbed to fame in sitcoms like "two of a kind", i had never seen them in anything before, but i had an idea of what to expect, but it was much worse. basically the hunter sisters charli (mary-kate) and leila (ashley) are in rome for a summer intern program, but not long after starting their jobs they are immediately fired for a series of mishaps. but the man who owns the company they are working in, derek hammond (julian stone), gives them their jobs back, and they they do slowly prove themselves useful assets, and talented (fashion) artists, and help stop a mean man taking over the company. also starring leslie danon as jami, derek lee nixon as ryan, ilenia lazzarin as dari, archie kao as nobu, valentina mattolini as heidi, michelangelo tommaso as paolo and matt patresi as enrico tortoni. you can tell that this film was made to go straight to video, the camera-work is completely mismatched, and it doesn't help when you want to admire the sights of rome. in fact the background is the only good thing to watch, the twin sisters are two of the most annoying celebrities around, i knew before watching that they weren't going to interest me in any way (their not even that pretty), this is awful gush of rubbish film. pretty poor!
