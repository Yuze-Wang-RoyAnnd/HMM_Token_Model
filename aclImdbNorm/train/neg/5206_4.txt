adapting plays into cinema is often a bad idea because they're two different mediums . do you think it's a great idea to make zulu into a stage play ? imagine it where two valiant redcoats sit in a tent gasping " blimey there's thousands of them out there " great movie and a bad stage play <br /><br />in order for a stage play to make great cinema there's two essentials needed <br /><br />1) a fine cast that creates on screen chemistry <br /><br />2 ) great dialogue <br /><br />on paper cher and chazz palminterri would be a good casting choice but not in these roles . the story revolves around a hit-man played by palminterri breaking into a house to kill a wife played by cher with most of the action taking place inside the house . i was unable to take these two characters seriously though perhaps it was the fault of the script which can't decide whether it was trying to be serious or funny . since the story is very static it's of the utmost importance that the dialogue shines and once again because of the bizarre tone of the screenplay it embarrasses more than anything else with much of the conversation revolving around sex acts . if you want to see a great translation of a stage play transferred to the silver screen give faithful a miss and watch 12 angry men instead
