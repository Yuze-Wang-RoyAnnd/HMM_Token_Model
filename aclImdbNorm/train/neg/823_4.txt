first, it takes a full half hour to get hackman out of jail and to start doing the job. what a waste of time, we all know hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters, why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences. then hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere, simply proving to us that hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters. again, another 20 minutes. then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife. all of this should have taken 10-15 minutes at most simply as a set-up for the real action, intrigue and plot twists. by the time the real action gets going, i was so bored that i just wanted the movie to end. hackman is great as usual, and the other actors as well, but this is a dud of the first magnitude.
