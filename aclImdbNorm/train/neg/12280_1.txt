i saw one of the stage performances in denver and have never been less impressed. the word "vagina" says it all. a body part. nothing shocking here. i could say to my doctor, "my left arm has been hurting a bit after tennis" or "my vagina hurts after cycling" with equal or more social commentary. it could be the "tricep monologues" for all the entertainment or radical comment i heard. the monologues were dull but delivered with drama, the topics were outdated, and i was alternately bored and annoyed. once i think i laughed but apparently it wasn't when i was supposed to. surely this isn't really a hit. oh, and spoilers: there was a lesbian! - oh, wait, maybe not, come to think of it. and inappropriate fondling! and a crack mama! that about covers it.
