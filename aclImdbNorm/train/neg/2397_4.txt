nicolas roeg ? he directed the classic supernatural thriller don`t look now didn`t he ? strangely the aforementioned movie was broadcast on bbc television at the weekend which did tonight`s screening of cold heaven no favours what so ever . <br /><br />you see it`s impossible not to compare cold heaven with don`t look now since they both have the same director and the same structure and for the first third of cold heaven i thought they also had the same plot except a dead husband had been substituted instead of a dead child , in fact my mind was set on this movie revolving around a grief stricken widow seeing her late husband running around venice wearing a red anorak . this doesn`t occur but about one third of the way through the running time there`s a massive plot twist and despite being an essential plot twist it`s not explained in any great depth . in fact very little is explained in cold heaven which ruins the movie <br /><br />people have mentioned the rather poor production values of cold heaven and it`s impossible not to notice them . if i didn`t no different i would have thought this was a tvm since it`s got a made for television feel to it right down to white capital letters in the title sequence . roeg also tries to inject art house pretentions via spoken thought processes but again this doesn`t help the movie at all . one can`t help feeling roeg should have put all his effort into the plot twists which are totally flat on screen <br /><br />cheap production values , disinterested directing and a really bizarre premise and screenplay make for a bad movie
