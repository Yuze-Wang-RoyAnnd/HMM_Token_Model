what a waste! this movie could have really been something decent, but the writing, in particular, is crap, and the main characters are rather shallow and uninteresting. mike meyers was good, and the historical recreation of late 70s decadence was well crafted, but overall, this movie was a big waste of time. instead, the movie to watch, that deals with similar themes and the same basic time frame, is the great boogie nights.
