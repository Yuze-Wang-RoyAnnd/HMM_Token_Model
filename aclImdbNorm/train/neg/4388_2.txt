oh man, i know what your thinking: "with a title like that, i can't go wrong!" uh yes you can. i too, loved the title, but man i hated the stupid kid that played "satan's little helper" i hated the mom too, and the sister/daughter, and her boyfriend - i hated all those people! man, it was agony watching this sometimes! the only reason this doesn't get 1/10 is becuz condsidering the low budget, they did ok. but oh man did i hate those actors, so stupid! i knew it was going to be bad, i guess they saved a lot of money on just using halloween masks for the killer, and the jesus costume at the end was really stupid too. oh the agony, do not watch!
