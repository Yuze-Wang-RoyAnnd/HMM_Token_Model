whatever happened to keaton is what i want to know.<br /><br />actually i don't, i crawled away, heaving, thinking she must owe half the bookies in vegas, or maybe not, maybe she was just brainwashed, blackmailed and bored to death. rich enough to adopt a third-world country, she somehow had to star in yet another cookie-cut, clich'e-ridden drool'athon, based on the same character-franchise she's been rehashing since 'father of the bride'('91). you'd think she's going head to head with mr.bean.<br /><br />(spoilers) <br /><br />so hubby (dax) get's fired by obnoxious son of boss, his mom (keaton)leaves his dad after classic row, and crashes over with her own dog-show in tow, oh those little rascals. hubby's got cold-feet for diaper-duty, wifey's clock a-ticking and hey, let's toss in a space-cadet as second house-guest for good measure, all in one day because that's so funny and original. wife gets fed up and walks away, mom leaves dad for space-cadet and the couple makes up in time for closing credits, 86 very long minutes later.<br /><br />now if you have to have a space-cadet, he can't be devious as well, he can't scheme some excuse for his stayover, and if mom leaves dad, she can't hop into a cab dressed as a pumpkin just because some scriptwriter agonized over how to cheer thing up. <br /><br />plus that gag whereby they invite her in only to then discover she's got her canine entourage in the cab has got to be outlawed by now. and you only get one obnoxious 2-dimensional boss to denigrate. another movie-killer would be the movie-script the space cadet is toiling away at, supposedly more lame than the actual one, again, dejas-ad-nausea.<br /><br />liv tyler doesn't seem happy here, her voice was weird at times, it had me wondering if they later had her redub some of it, and she's a smart one, she's handled great roles and we'll forgive her for jersey girl, it was disaster-prone, could happen to anyone. dax shepard was watchable and that's being generous considering the material.<br /><br />personally, it's the director, the screenwriters and especially the producers that i would love to see tar'n'feathered before shipped to guantanamo as playthings for the prisoners, and that's me keeping this 'lite'.
