i may have seen worse films than this, but i if i have, i don't remember. or possibly blocked them out. who knows,if i was to undergo hypnotherapy, i may remember them, along, maybe, with been abducted by aliens as a child, or other traumas. if so, i would happily exchange those memories for the ones i have of watching this film.<br /><br />i should give the film some credit: it did produce an emotional response. i actually started to become angry at scenes that spoofed other films and tv programs, that this travesty was dirtying them by association. i am terrified that i may be unable to watch films like dr strangelove again without this film flitting across my minds eye.
