to be honest, this film is another in a series of huge disappointments...most of these so-called "masters of horror" films are only horrifying in terms of their sub-par effects and laughable story lines...aside from ron perlman, everyone else in this film cannot act to save their life...the gunshots sounded like someone was playing bop-it under the boom mike or something, and looked completely unrealistic...overall, this film is about as scary as home alone...the only good masters are cigarette burns, jennifer, and maybe pelts...i don't know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have ruined the very genre that some of them used to actually understand...
