i can't believe i actually sat through the whole thing. this movie has the worst acting since killjoy.<br /><br />here is a brief outline of the plot: the movie starts out with jojo and that other chick sitting around on the beach, drooling over a skinny blonde-haired beach "hunk" who looks like he hasn't been to the gym a day in his life. somehow, everyone knows him, and every single chick in the movie wants him. uh oh! here comes the competition! the stereotypical "hot chick" and her best friends, who drive an ugly pink car. we soon find out jojo's mom got the job of a lifetime in australia, which means that jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind (oh no, i think i'm gonna cry). a huge storm comes, and fills their swimming pool with nasty water. somehow, for no apparent reason, the little chick falls into the pool, and comes face to face with, yup, you guessed it, a mermaid! this is where the "story" really takes off. basically, they want to get the mermaid to fall in love with the "hunk".<br /><br />this is a preteen flick with acting so bad, it makes the 80's look like the pinnacle of oscar-worthy performances. this movie has all the clich'es possible... the best friends, the "hunk" who everyone wants, the "hot" bad girl and her bitchy friends, the scary old man... you name it, it's in there. i took one for a lot of people by watching this. consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice to you. please, don't see this movie. don't make it so i suffered in vain.
