...but the actress playing the daughter just doesn't come across as credible.<br /><br />it doesn't work for me when i see an actress of about 25 years playing the role of a 12-year-old... other commentators have suggested that this is one of the messages of this film, that children may sometimes seem more adult-like than adults, but with the casting as it is in this film, it just doesn't work for me.<br /><br />you might want to check other comments to find out what this film is actually about, because i couldn't bear watching it to the end.<br /><br />i agree that the premise for this film is beautiful though - i wish another director would try to pick up this story again.
