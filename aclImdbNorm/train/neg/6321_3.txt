i can't imagine anyone would ever, in a million years, want to watch this movie. not because it was one of the worst ever made (it wasn't), but largely because it's about 20 years old and oh-so-out of the mainstream. i was trying to find out where i saw an actor before and this popped up. so, yeah, a kid stops playing little league because he doesn't like nukes, this prompts major media attention and a quick resolution to the cold war. the end. a fantasy, to be sure, but one so cockeyed it would make john lennon blush. since terrorism has replaced communism as the -ism that scares the hell out of us, this movie really has no relevance, except as an (innaccurate) look back at those times. the writing, acting, and film craft are similarly undeveloped. the reason i rated it as highly as i did was because i watched this movie around 50 times while i was 5-6 years old and still have a little place in my heart for it, but i now realize that it doesn't quite cut mustard. so, if the law of large numbers holds true and someone eventually does decide to check out this movie, realize that there are much better ways to spend your time, but also much worse ones. (i will refrain from a john q. tirade for now.)
