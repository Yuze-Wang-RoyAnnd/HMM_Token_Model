a pretty worthless made for television movie that pretty much follows the killer insect script. ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel. i think it is from the hotel food because the sewage from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the ant bed. there is a lack of suspense in this film and it is not scary either. watching a bunch of ants sting their victims is not very terrifying.<br /><br />spoilers section the stupidity of the hero is near incredible. he is told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero. it has to be a mysterious virus. after the inspector says this, the hero takes his bulldozer and wrecks the huge ant colony. this disturbs the millions of ants and traps the people in the hotel.<br /><br />end spoilers overall, this movie is extremely lame. i don't understand why it got a dvd release when so many deserving movies have none. my only guess for the dvd release is that suzanne summers is featured in the film. this is a movie to avoid.
