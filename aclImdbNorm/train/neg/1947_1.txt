i am 17, and i still like most of the scooby doo movies and the old episodes. i love the 1990s movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to dvd scooby doo outings of this decade, scooby doo and the goblin king, which i wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. anyway, back to get a clue! i watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what i saw of it, i wasn't impressed at all. first of all, i hated the animation. it was flat, deflated and very saturday- morning -cartoon -standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. even some shows i really hate had slightly better animation. even worse, shaggy and scooby looked like aliens, and i really missed fred, velma and daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when scooby doo was positively good. i also hated the character changes, because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries, shaggy and scooby were now playing superhero, something they would've never had done in the movies or in the scooby-doo where are you? show. the theme tune wasn't very good either, i can't even remember it, and the jokes were lame and contrived. though, i do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast, had they had better material, and hadn't been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible, which they did, might i add. in conclusion, i personally thought it was awful, and i am not trying to discredit it, it's what i personally feel. 1/10 bethany cox
