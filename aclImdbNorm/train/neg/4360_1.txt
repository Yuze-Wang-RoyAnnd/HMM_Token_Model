first of all let me say that i had to think a lot about writing a comment for this movie. the best review for this kind of cinema can be just the silence. movie addressed to housewives and to grandmothers. this movie tries to look "genuine" and the characters should be supposed "real people". an italian could never think that the characters might be "real": they are just "low-profile" stereotypes. it gives a very misguised vision of what life is in the italian countryside. the plot is weak (plot? which plot?) and the humour does not make laugh anyone older than 12.
