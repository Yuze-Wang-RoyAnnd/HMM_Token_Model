t. rama rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot mature with the changing times, styles and fashions. he's like stuck with the same old-fashioned film-making style.<br /><br />actors are not bad, not good either. anil kapoor generally acts convincingly his two roles of a father and his son, but the flawed script often makes him look funny and pathetic. rekha is good, but then - she's always good, and here she's nothing more than such. she makes the best of what she is given, but she always does that. in conclusion, nothing great at all. raveena is ok, which means ordinary, not bad, not good, nothing.<br /><br />this film is melodramatic, occasionally stupid. maybe it's a delayed film? well, even then it still would be below standard. the script is terrible, the film is overdone, and the story goes nowhere. it feels like a film made in the early 1990s, but the script makes it look even older, the style is like from the 1950s.<br /><br />don't recommend, unless you're a big fan one of the starring actors.
