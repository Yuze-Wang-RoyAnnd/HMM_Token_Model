if you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, let it be boy. but prepare yourself by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio.<br /><br />after having watched such a good movie as arisan (2003), it is terrible to see what they come up with again in indonesia. it seems that the only idea is to make money, but no one seems seriously to work on the image of indonesia in the world of entertainment. that it is a 'global' world doesn't seem to come up in the minds of those who make movies in indonesia. and since the indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them as 'made in indonesia' with a flavor of the west, they get away with it.<br /><br />ok, the story is nice to begin with. and it could have developed into a nice flick. but did the director never think about the fact that a musical needs first of all live music or at least good playback, and secondly good choreography? in this movie, the playback is so bad that it makes you wanna cry right there in the cinema. every single word you hear is followed seconds later by the actor or whoever sing playback, and it is extremely annoying while watching the movie.<br /><br />the choreography is as if they planned to make a movie about morning gymnastics, but in the end thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical... they only forgot to change the choreography. it is hardly dancing you see, they jump here and there, throw their legs up in the air, and that is about it.<br /><br />well, at least there's a happy ending.... but if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic, do so!
