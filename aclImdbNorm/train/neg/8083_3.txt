disowned by richard c. sarafian, this disaster stunk up japanese theaters before coming to the states and going immediately to video, where it was not seen again until the turner networks needed something other than infomercials to fill their 3am-6am time slots and found this tape at the bottom of their bin. the smithee name is supposed to be used when the studio hacks the movie so badly that the director no longer wants his name attached to it. but i'm afraid that sarafian can not blame the studio entirely on this one. the actors, mostly recent graduates of "overacting 101", deliver one cornball line after another. the plot is convoluted. the special effects are unimpressive. the parts that aren't laughable are just plain boring. the script or the book must have been good - why else would palance, matheson, boyle, or heston agree to appear in this dud? but something went horribly wrong from the page to the screen. summary: avoid. not even bad enough to be so-bad-it's-good.
