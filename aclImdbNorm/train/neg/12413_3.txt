i'm not going to say that this movie is horrible, because i have seen worse, but it's not even halfway decent. <br /><br />the plot is very confusing. i couldn't really figure out what was happening and where things were going. when the movie was over, i was left scratching my head. i watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up, but once the credits were over, that was it. i felt like i was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie, with little or no transition between the two. <br /><br />character development is very shallow. i couldn't figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone. i couldn't tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk, stoned, mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them. this film seems to be based around stereotypes (to it's credit, they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band), which should make character development easier, since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child, or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean. stereotypes are easy to depict, which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters. this film, on the other hand, uses stereotypical characters left and right, but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible.<br /><br />another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation. i guess that's ok because so little time was spent developing the characters that i really didn't get a chance to know any of them, so i never really missed any of them.<br /><br />and last but not least was sadie's singing. it's awful. the music backing her up is not prize winner, but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from sadie's vocal cords. i swear that there's one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes. i seriously thought i was going to have to turn it off during this howl-a-thon.<br /><br />as a whole, this movie is confusing. characters are ill-developed, georgia's acting is wooden and stiff, sadie's character is yanked from one bad situation to another, with no back story or explanation. the music was unbearable, and i can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain.
