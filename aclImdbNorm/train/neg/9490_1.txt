this is complete and absolute garbage, a fine example of what a bad movie is like, this can't be appealing to anyone, not even b-movie fans. do not, i repeat, do not waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash. bad acting, bad directing, horrible (but i mean really horrible) script, and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment (of any form) is. i bought the dvd for 3 dollars, i swear i could almost pay someone to take it. burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me. i like b-movies, the killer toys, the weird lagoon monsters, but this is nowhere near. you know those movies that are so bad they are funny? not even. just plain old pathetic.
