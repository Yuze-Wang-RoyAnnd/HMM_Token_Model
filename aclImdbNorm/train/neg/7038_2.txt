ah yes the 1980s , a time of reaganomics and sly , chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies . at the time i couldn`t believe how movies like rambo , missing in action and uncommon valor ( and who can forget the ridiculous red dawn ? ) made money at the box office , they`re turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly . troma`s war is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you`ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place ? of course not . troma`s war lacks any sort of sophistication - though it does make the point that there`s no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones - and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up . maybe it is ?
