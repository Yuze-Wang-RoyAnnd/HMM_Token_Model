three writers made a valiant attempt to adapt jane stanton hitchcock's novel for the tube, yet this television movie has ultimately been injected with too much melodrama and just doesn't know when to quit. struggling artist meg tilly suddenly finds herself employed by wealthy, enigmatic ellen burstyn, who desires a mural painted on the walls of her unused ballroom. after learning about the last gathering held there--ellen's daughter's coming-out party--tilly decides on her artistic theme, never dreaming the daughter died mysteriously before the function even began, nor that she and the deceased bore a striking resemblance to one another! two superb actresses lend their services to an incredible yarn which doesn't bear close scrutiny, one that fails to match either lady in emotional intensity. burstyn's role teeters on camp, while tilly gets stuck doing the dreamy-eyed-waif routine. only one sequence late in the film (the morning after the mural is finished) is charged with honest feeling, anger and betrayal. the rest is piffle.
