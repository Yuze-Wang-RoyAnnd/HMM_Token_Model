i went in to this movie thinking it was going to be the next clerks, but left feeling let down. the humor was weak and the characters fairly flat. that isn't to say it was all bad, the idea of the dating service in the grocery store seemed like pretty fertile material, but the director switched focus to the cliche'd "save the mom-and-pop store from the evil corporation guy". i felt like if he would have just stuck with the dating service plot, he would have come out with a much more memorable movie. now, to do the film justice, i am from the rochester area and loved the way he portrayed webster. in fact, the best kevin smith (of clerks) homage here was giving props to his hometown. webster, ny is to checkout what red bank, nj is to clerks. the director wisely threw in a date at nick tahou's. trust me, as far as things to do in rochester, a garbage plate is at the top of the list. i was lucky enough to see this film at the little in rochester so everybody knew when the odes to the town came up and appreciated them.
