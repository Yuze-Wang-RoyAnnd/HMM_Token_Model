is miike like chabrol, alternating art with dreck, sometimes confusing the two? does he match the fifty/fifty rate some claim for chabrol? do we see here too much or too little miike? i don't know. i don't know. i don't know. but i could easily fill ten lines just citing chakushin ari's (one missed call's) steals, allusions, and clich'es. others here will hit on most of them, though not perhaps ochiai's saimin (hypnosis) for the sleazy telecast taunting things supernatural. only once, when yumi takes the zombie-like mother in her arms, did one missed call startle me a little.<br /><br />one other point of interest: renji ishibashi (looks like christopher walken) as the detective. ishibashi in audition's abusive back story, and as dead or alive's boss aoki of the vat of excrement drowning and more, may be the most convincingly evil character actor i've ever seen. so here he's a cop.
