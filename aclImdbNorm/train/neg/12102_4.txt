this film is really only bill maher's interpretation of religion. there are several funny moments, and some interesting points, but don't go into this expecting an even-handed discussion of religion. this is what i consider to be the worst kind of documentary - everything is arranged ahead of time and in editing to provide you with the opinion of the director, rather than letting you make your own decision.<br /><br />editing - it's very chopped up, inter-spliced with clips from pop culture and the media to reinforce the point. the interviewee barely has a chance to finish a sentence before he is interrupted by the editing. the only people given a fair chance to speak their mind are those who say what bill maher wants them to say. once someone deviates from the gospel according to maher, they get edited.<br /><br />interviewees - they are meant to represent the absolute most extremist religions. from the tv evangelical to the ultimate jewish stereotype, to a truck stop chapel (seriously. a truck stop chapel). he's picked the worst money-grabbers, the heavy extremists, and those who don't have the budget to say no to pick on. and when he does get a good person to interview, he edits the hell out of them.<br /><br />stereotyping - all religions are portrayed as stereotypes. especially hard hit are the muslims. during the muslim segment, he barely gives anyone the chance to speak before interrupting them either himself, or through editing in pieces with suicide bombers. all muslims are portrayed as gun-toting extremists through the editing, and none of the people interviewed is edited fairly.<br /><br />ending - the message at the end is incredibly heavy-handed, and while it is an interesting idea, it's not presented with fairness to the countless people who are not religious extremists. bill maher explains himself while clips of destruction play in the foreground. this literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous, and that it will destroy the world. he also states that everyone involved in religion is stupid.<br /><br />with the faults to the film, it has some good points, and the humor, while very unfair, is actually funny. but know going in, it is a very one-sided view, bill maher's view, of religion. he's not discovering anything. he's telling you what he thinks.<br /><br />4/10 - some good moments, but heavy-handed with an extremely irresponsible documentary style.
