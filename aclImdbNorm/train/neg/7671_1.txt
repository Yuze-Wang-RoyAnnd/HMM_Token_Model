the movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes. it gives the basic summary of what is going on. this could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect. soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about, keep in mind this is all you will learn about them. the plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie. not only does the plot change, but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie. i have never played the video game, but know people who have. from my understanding whether you've played the game or not this movie does not get any better. save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters.
