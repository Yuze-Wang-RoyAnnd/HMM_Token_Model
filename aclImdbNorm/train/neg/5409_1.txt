the christmas secret was touted as a wonderful film, but i was truly disappointed. they even sold vhs and dvd copies of the film when it was over, which leads me to think the producers were really proud of this project. as a screen actor myself i felt most of the performances were phoned in, although beau bridges, as nick, did have a moment or two. if i were richard thomas i would not put this film on my otherwise fine resume. it was an embarrassment. i had been a fan since his waltons days, but have found myself untempted to watch any of his subsequent work, so poor was this offering.<br /><br />in defence of the actors, the directing was stilted, mechanical, and thoroughly amateurish.<br /><br />i hope this is not considered a spiteful review and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic. i turned the movie on because it had a good cast and i was prepared to enjoy the film. however i would challenge any one out there to watch this film and not wish for their money back, even though it was on t.v.
