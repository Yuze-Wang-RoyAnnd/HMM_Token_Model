going into this i was expecting anything really good, but after the damage this inflexed on me, i'm just happy to think strait. it's hard to think what the film-makers( ha!) this was a good movie. the stories, and i use the world loosely, are incoherent and do make any sense at all. there just stupid things that happen at random. the acting, if can be called acting is horrible i've seen batter acting in toy ads! i know it's a low-budget video-bin garbages, but still even it's not like they tried. will after stetting thought it, i feel very sleepy and still #yawws# do, i'm going to go lie down.<br /><br />warnning: do not atemp to drive, walk, read or do any after watching chillers. other side affectts may enguled lose of any or all metal funkions.
