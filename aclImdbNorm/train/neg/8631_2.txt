almost golden: the jessica savitch story<br /><br />aspect ratio: 1.33:1<br /><br />sound format: stereo<br /><br />bland, soap-opera dramatisation of the rise and fall of america's first female tv news anchor. with a tighter script and direction - and a better cast - this might have passed muster, but the flimsy story really wasn't worth the effort. a good documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go. typically strong production values in the tv movie conveyor-belt manner, but it's all as superficial as old fluff, and just as engaging.
