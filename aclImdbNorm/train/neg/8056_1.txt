inept, boring, and incoherent supernatural "thriller" in which college student cassie (melissa sagemiller) is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claims the life of her boyfriend sean (casey affleck).<br /><br />i can't begin to tell you how bad this is...nothing of any importance ever happens nor is there ever any sort of actual entertainment value. i did not like this cast in this particular film - they are all sadly unconvincing (then again, their roles are no good). to promote this as a horror film is a joke. where are the scares? there's no sense or suspense - there are a few good songs but that's about it.<br /><br />how on earth did this project get the green light? writer-director steve carpenter has no discernible vision or talent that i can sense. worst of all, the conclusion really makes the whole movie pointless.<br /><br />the alleged "killer cut" that i watched is 86 minutes of pure tedium.<br /><br />1/10
