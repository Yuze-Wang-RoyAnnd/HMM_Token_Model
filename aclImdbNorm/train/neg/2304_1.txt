i don't believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the united states as the 700 club. they are today's equivalent to the ku klux klan of the 20th century. their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand. their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of americans, as well as billions of humans the world over, who don't happen to share their bigoted, cruel, monstrous, and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen. the lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth, such as the idea of "life after death" or "god" or "sin" or "the devil" is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill, so lost are they in their fantasy. sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldn't let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy. however, the 700 club is in a class by itself. they are truly a cult. while i believe in freedom of speech, they way they spread hatred, lies, disinformation, and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits. i hope that one day the american psychiatric association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way, people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all. treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country, as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion. the 700 club though, is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of 'cult' but due to the 700 club's vast wealth (conned daily from the millions of americans locked in their deceitful grip) they are above the law in this country. for those of you who have seen the movie "the matrix" you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth: the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes, and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them.<br /><br />in less civil times, the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with the 700 club out of town with torches and pitchforks. but in today's world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them, we have no way to rid ourselves of the 700 club plague. <br /><br />the television ratings system and the "v" chip on tv's should also have a rating called "r" for religion, so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape, such as presented by the 700 club every day all over our country, from themselves and their children.
