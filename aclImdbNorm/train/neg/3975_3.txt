1st watched 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10(dir-steve purcell): typical mary kate & ashley fare with a few more kisses. it looks to me like the girls are getting pretty tired of this stuff and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to split up and go there own ways. in this episode of their adventures they are interns in rome for a `fashion' designer who puts them right into the mailroom to learn what working hard is all about(i guess..). besides the typical flirtations with boys there is nothing much else except the rome scenario until about  3/4  way into the movie when it's finally revealed why they are getting fired, then re-hired, then fired again, then re-hired again. this is definetly made by people who don't understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation of it. maybe the real world will be their next adventure(if there is one.). even my kids didn't seem to care for this boring `adventure' in the make-believe. let's see they probably only have a couple of years till their legal adults. we'll see what happens then.
