my husband and i went to see this movie, being the horror movie buffs that we are. two hours later i found myself wanting both my money and time back. i was so disappointed. the teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film. there was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances, etc. i found most of the 'scary' parts to be more comical than anything. after viewing other movies based on the works of japanese writers, i have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in japan is not what is frightening here in the us. my advice: if you are a fan of true horror movies, save yourself the pain of sitting through this one. i can't really say that i would recommend renting it either, unless you have a free rental coming to you.
