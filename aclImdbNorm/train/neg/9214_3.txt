many things become clear when watching this film: 1) the acting is terrible. tom hanks and wendy crewson are so-so, but the parent-child conflict borders soap opera-ish. the other two boys: an overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical i'm-a-babe-but-i'm-really-sensitive-inside blonde dreamboat; 2) the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing; 3) robbie's dreams and episodes are disturbing (acted by tom hanks); 4) the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice ("we are all special friends"); 5) the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting; and 5) this is a really bad movie. expect to be disappointed--and probably disturbed.
