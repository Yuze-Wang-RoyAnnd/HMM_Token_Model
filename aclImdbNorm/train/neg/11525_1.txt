simply terrible! why wouldn't you use actual actors? look, this has to stop! stop using non-actors! if you want any credibility or any message sent via these low-budget films...please for the love of god use real actors! most will work for free...take advantage of that! now back to my comment...anyway, the humour was lower than that of the bathroom variety and wasn't funny on any level. as for the quality...in one scene filmed on a public transportation bus you could see the reflection of the crew...guess what? it was one guy with what looked like a sony camcorder and probably not even his. well, i assume the only audience for this film are people with a gore fetish...and it wasn't even good gore.
