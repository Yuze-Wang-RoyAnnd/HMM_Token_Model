when you get to the scenes that involve albert brooks without his shirt... try not to gag on a fur ball.<br /><br />i like albert brooks. i've seen most, if not all of his movies but it was the first time seeing this one. modern romance is an interesting take on the subject of love. there are few movies that handle the desperation of love as well or as overtly as modern romance, although 1979's chilly scenes of winter comes very close. they both essentially deal with obsessed men that are too psychologically attracted/obsessed to their respective women.<br /><br />where-as chilly scenes of winter borders on the subject stalking, this movie has a more grounded foundation with the subject of love because both people are already in a relationship.. and out of the relationship.. and back in it again.<br /><br />and because it's a movie that was released in 1981, it is of its time in terms of styles and such. that's the main reason i like this movie. my basic rule when it comes to movies is "if it sucks at least it may have some historic relevance", you know time capsule stuff.<br /><br />which leads me to the horrific scenes of albert brooks sans shirt.<br /><br />the man is hair. very hair. like he's wearing a black curly fur sweater-hairy. and what's worse is he almost looks burn victim-hairy. it's not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him without a shirt go on and on. back in the early 80's hairy men were seen as normal and nothing shocking. but in 2009 the sight of something like this is just plain revolting. sorry, albert! i wish at some point someone said "hey let's try this scene but with you wearing a simple t-shirt, i mean you might scare people". it's just really bad and i feel sorry for the poor pretty actress that had to deal with albert brooks naked body on top of hers. she was probably pulling out his hairs from her teeth for days after that.<br /><br />anyway, it's an ok movie. it could have been better if i hadn't see albert brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 long continuous minutes because that will forever taint my viewing of this movie.
