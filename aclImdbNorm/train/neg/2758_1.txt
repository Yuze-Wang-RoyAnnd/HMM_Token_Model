i'm giving this movie a 1 because there are no negative numbers in imdb rating system. this movie was horrible. it was very badly acted, the story was poorly written, the action was unbelievable. i doubt even the salvation army could battle as poorly as the troops did in this film. i won't even write any plot spoilers because the movie just isn't good enough for plot spoilers. to write comments on the plot would be pointless. if i were to compare this movie, i'd have to compare it to reign of fire, however although i didn't like reign of fire either, that movie at least was better than this one. <br /><br />some of the people in the theater left before the movie was even halfway done. the only reason i didn't was because i simply didn't think to do it. i was hoping for a feast of cgi and fighting masterfully done, but that isn't what happened. the martial arts lasted all of 30 seconds and that was from an exercise routine done during the flash-back scene, very disappointing. the cgi was not done well either. one scene comes to mind. during one of the earlier tank battles, the troops are firing away at......nothing. someone forgot to cue the animation guys on that bit of film so the street was totally devoid of bad guys. i'm also thinking the bad guy's voice was dubbed by the voice-over of imotep from the mummy movies. had that same scraggly echoing thing going on. (someone owed some royalties, here?) since i mentioned the fight scene, i'll say yeah that might be considered a spoiler, but only to the purists i suppose.<br /><br />don't go see it, don't buy the dvd when it comes out either. you have been warned.
