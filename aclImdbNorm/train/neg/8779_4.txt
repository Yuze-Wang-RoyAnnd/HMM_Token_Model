as a cinema fan white noise was an utter disappointment, as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good, nicely lit, good camera work, reasonable direction. but as a film it just seamed as predictable as all the other 'so called' horror movies that the market has recently been flooded with. although it did have a little bit of the 'chill factor' the whole concept of the e.v.o (electronic voice phenomena) did'not seem believable. this movie did not explain the reasonings for certain occurrences but went ahead with them. the acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion, like many recent thriller/horror movies.<br /><br />definitely not a movie i will be buying on dvd and would not recommend anyone rushes out to see it.
