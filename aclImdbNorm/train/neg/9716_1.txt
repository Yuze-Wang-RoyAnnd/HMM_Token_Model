this is, without doubt, one of the worst films i've ever seen...<br /><br />the plot is so full of holes, the story is like a bad remake of a bad suspense movie and the actors sound like were reading directly from the manuscript for the first time. worst of all is steve guttenberg. he plays his character like he was in "police academy" - the same foolish womanizer - and that's not suited for a leading man in what should have been a thriller.<br /><br />it's really hard to believe that hanson would make "l.a. confidential" ten years later...<br /><br />avoid this like the plague...
