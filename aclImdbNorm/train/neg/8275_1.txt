(first of all, excuse my bad english) of course only a movie starring jessica simpson can include serious goofs like this.. i'm a norwegian and i felt offended and shocked the makers of this movie did not take the time to do their research upon making this american/"norwegian" movie. even wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country.<br /><br />so i'm posting my corrections out of my frustration: -the country is named norway, not norwegia. -"da" is russian, not norwegian. -norwegian priests never use those black capes with that white paper by the neck as the protestant church is the dominant by far -it's true we have a native traditional folk-outfit (that we only use like twice a year) but the outfit in this movie is more like a german outfit. -i could not understand the so called "norwegian" in this movie.. jessica was not making any sense.. neighter did the "norwegian priests"<br /><br />the only thing i recognise is the norwegian flag (and the viking hats, but that's so stereotypic what people think about norway - vikings!:o gosh)<br /><br />well.. i guess the people who made this film will never read this comment. but at least i cleared some things up and got rid of some of that frustration..!<br /><br />i'm proud of my country and i'd love if people in the us were less stereotypic and more accurate when they talk about this country.<br /><br />that was all.. lenge leve norge ! ;p
