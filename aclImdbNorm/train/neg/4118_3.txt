while channel surfing, we found this movie with its promising synopsis. we were dismayed at the flat acting, and formulaic storyline. we found amusing the exploding car scenes, unbelievable shoot outs, and sets that crash down with the weight of tyro-foam and cardboard. what was even more hilarious was seeing all the recycled scenes from "dante's peak", where the church front falls on the school bus, the store fronts break away from the main street, the overpass collapsing, and the red truck speeding down the alley way as the bricks fall down on it. it was a good laugh although unintended, and leaves the viewer wondering if it was not originally intended as a low budget spoof of disaster films.
