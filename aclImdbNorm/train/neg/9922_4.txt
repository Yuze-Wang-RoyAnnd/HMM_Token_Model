growing up, joe strummer was a hero of mine, but even i was left cold by this film. for better and worse, the future is unwritten is not a straightforward "behind the music" style documentary. rather it is a biographical art film, chock full of interviews, performance footage, home movies, and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from "animal farm." the movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour.<br /><br />the campfire format, while touching in thought, is actually pretty annoying in execution. first off, without titles, its hard to even know who half of these interviewees are. secondly, who really needs to hear people like bono, johnny depp, and john cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man? they were not relevant to strummer's life and their opinions add nothing to his story.<br /><br />this picture is at it's best when strummer, through taped interviews and conversation, touches on facets of his life most people did not know about: the suicide of his older brother, coming to terms with the death of his parents, the joy of fatherhood. to me, these were most moving because it showed joe strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved, but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face.<br /><br />there have been better, more straightforward documentaries about strummer and the clash. (westway, vh1 legends, and kurt loder's narrated mtv documentary from the early 90's come to mind.) joe strummer: the future is unwritten is for diehards only.
