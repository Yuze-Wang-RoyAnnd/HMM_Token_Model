this film has been receiving a lot of play lately during the day on either hbo or cinemax. the reason is that they are assuming people would be interested in comparing it to the leonardo dicaprio/tom hanks caper of the same name. the only reason to see it is for the attractive matt lattanzi. yum! although i must say matt was more than a little long in the tooth to be playing a high schooler. if he were a woman, they'd have had him playing the mother of a high schooler! (is is just me, or is his daughter starting to look like shelley duvall?) oh yeah, the plot--who cares? typical teen highjinx played by adults.
