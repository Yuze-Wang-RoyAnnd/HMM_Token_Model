whattt was with the sound? it sounded like it was all dubbed.<br /><br />otherwise, bad. plot = bad. accents = bad (even dougray, and we live in scotland), acting = bad, harp = bad, sex scenes - bad/cringeworthy.<br /><br />still, we watched it until the end in disbelief. how could such a good roll call of actors perform so badly? will they ever get a decent job again? <br /><br />bad, bad, bad. by the way, we gave it 3 because we at least were enticed to watch it to the end due to its bizarre plot, etc.<br /><br />and to the older reviewer - i totally agree, it was like a romantic farce from the 1940s. how did it get made in 2004?<br /><br />ok, ok, there were some ok bits. they had a nice house in bristol. dougray had a nice boat. jennifer looked nice in a little outfit. but how come the sister got all the men?
