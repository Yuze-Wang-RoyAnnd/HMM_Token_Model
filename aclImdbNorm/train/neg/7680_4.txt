snow white is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. the plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too exaggerated. anyway, the movie seems not to have a lot of artistic ambitions. <br /><br />instead, i think this is a straight commercial thing. including a character from the french part of switzerland (the actor is the leader of the band he is touring with in the movie - the band's called sens unik) seems to aim to a larger audience. a straight german-swiss movie would not have sold in the french part - and vice versa. what really got on my nerves were the product placements all over the movie. sometines scenes remembered of advertisement clips! <br /><br />i also think the topic of "young people taking drugs without any other targets in their lives" is a wide spread reality in zurich. therefore, it should be elaborated with more care. i hope samir got enough money with snow white, in order that his next movie is gonna show his true artistic skills.
