what an appalling piece of rubbish!!! who are all these people who blubber on about how good this is? yes, it's "arty"; and yes, it's "foreign", but .... that's not enough. the plot is boring and disjointed, like a reality show but not so slickly made.<br /><br />the people are intrinsically uninteresting; but as characters they don't have enough depth to feel empathy for them. if they are based on real people then i feel very, very sorry for them.<br /><br />the violence (and some of it is very violent) seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous. it's like the producer has visions of being quenton tarantino. not that i think very much of him, either.<br /><br />and oh yes: if i had neighbours like these, i'd move!
