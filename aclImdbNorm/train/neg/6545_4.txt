practically the only other actor who would be less likely to play evel knieval than hamilton is anthony perkins, yet somehow hamilton manages to turn in a reasonably effective portrayal (and as producer of the film, he wasn't likely to be fired or told he wasn't right for the part!) the early life of the daredevil motorcyclist is recounted here in multiple flashbacks. the film opens with a rather silly prologue with hamilton in his white-leather, star-spangled gear spouting the world according to knieval as if to say, "don't worry. this film is about my youth, but i'll be back in my familiar costume by the end of the picture." hamilton is preparing for a huge jump, yet is still licking his wounds from the previous one as devoted wife lyon both supports and derides him. he recalls various vignettes of his childhood and delinquent teenage years along with his early days as a stunt rider and blossoming celebrity. this flip-flop approach is pretty abrupt and sometimes disjointed, but it does prevent the movie from sticking to one of its inexpensive sets for too long a time or from getting into a rut with the fairly pedestrian characters. hamilton, usually a suave and debonair persona, does a very fine job of enacting the tiny details of his subject's mannerisms and demeanor including his walk. his hair is a shade lighter and longer and he works hard to give the right inflections in his speaking. (he even pays minor tribute to knieval's many injuries by appearing in a skimpy towel while his shoulders are covered in "scars" from the multitudinous accidents.) facially, he looks nothing like the real cyclist, but he does suggest him in his physical performance. lyon is excellent at playing the young girl he loves and then the more worldly wife, though her 3-pack a day voice does threaten to give her away at any given moment. she and hamilton strike up an easy chemistry which goes a long way in putting the film over. other nice supporting turns are given by freed as his jaded doctor, cameron as an early influence and taylor as a flea-bitten sideshow barker. the film was made on a low budget, but the story is a rather low rent one anyway, so that doesn't affect it too badly. the makers wisely used actual butte, montana locations to give the film a proper small town ambiance. several of hamilton's antics are amusing, though the character is certainly reckless and inconsiderate of other people's property! some of the real knieval's completed and failed stunts are included in some blurry footage, one of which features a mind-boggling "splatter" in which the man is rolled up and snapped around like a rag doll. hamilton's then-wife (stewart) appears briefly as a nurse.
