spoilers i guess.<br /><br /> the absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the entire movie. i just couldn't get over it. and what is wrong with mark wahlberg's character? if i suddenly found myself crashed-landed on a planet full of talking apes, i'd be all like, " aaaahhhhhhh!!! run for your lives! the monkeys have inherited the earth!" but he's all like, "talking apes, okay. next?" that's pretty jaded i'd say. he must run into even stranger things on a regular basis. besides that, this is rick baker's best work yet. this film is a true testament to how far we've come in the monkey makeup field. 3/10.
