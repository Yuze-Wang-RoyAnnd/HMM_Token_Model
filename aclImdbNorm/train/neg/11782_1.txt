the danish movie "slim slam slum" surprised me to be the worst movie i have seen to this date. i didn't think that it was possible to top my list of bad bad b-movies but this one deserves the gold. it's not funny. it's bad acting, it's bad filmed and the storyline is bad. the only positive thing i can say about this movie is it has three girls in it. i truly believe this flick has the potential to knock of the other danish movie "stjerner uden hjerner" as the badest danish film ever made! and that's truly something. congratulations in advance!
