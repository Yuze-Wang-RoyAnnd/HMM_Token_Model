the characters are cliched and predictable, with everyone being either snow-white pure or wholly evil. the acting is too stilted for it to be bad in an amusing, over-the-top way. it's doubly disappointing if you're a bette davis fan, because her character is not a typically fun bette-davis-type character; she just gets to frown pensively a lot.<br /><br />on the whole, neither my wife nor i found the movie to be interesting, moving or enjoyable at all.
