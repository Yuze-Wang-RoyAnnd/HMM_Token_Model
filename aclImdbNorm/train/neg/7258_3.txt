this grainy film has a cult following and one of those word-of-mouth features you just had to see. maybe hard to believe, but there is a rural community in southwest arkansas, fouke, that knows the legend is true. this tale is told in documentary-style narrated by vern stierman and filmed in actual locations talking to actual folks involved. the legend changes with the telling, but during the late 60s and most of the 70s the surrounding area of fouke was visited by a bigfoot-like creature that traveled along boggy creek. long limbed with three toes and standing over 7 foot tall, this hirsute creature periodically caused damage and frightened the 'bejeebers' out of most of the community. i personally crossed over the small boggy creek bridge in 1974, and yes the hair on the back of my neck did rise. of course it was about 1 a.m. in the rain. by the time i arrived in shreveport, i was laughing.
