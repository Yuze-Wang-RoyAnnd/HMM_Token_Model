the special effects of this movie are, especially for its time, laughable and used in such an over-emphasized way that you can't deny their terrible existance.<br /><br />the acting redefines the term "terrible overacting" at the hands of meg foster and richard joseph paul, where julie newman and andrew divoff just redefine "bad".<br /><br />***spoilers***<br /><br />the charm in this movie can be found in two things: first is the excellent casting of carel "lurch" struycken as the mysterious psychic gaunt, who can sense where and when people will die and is always there.<br /><br />the second are original finds, the combination sf-western is obviously original, if terrible, but other finds are more original, like the gunman zack stone being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots (though his acting falls short here).<br /><br />overal...don't see this movie, except if you love that ol' hunk-o-brutal carel struycken, as any self-respecting dutchman should.
