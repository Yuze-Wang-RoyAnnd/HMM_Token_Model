it's interesting that all who (so far) seemed to like this film had no expectations--i guess that's the trick. in contrast with them, i had optimistic expectations, and that was a mistake. as soon as i saw how close to the faces the camera always was, i knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director--that's always a clear sign of them, they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors. the actors in this film, though, had only one facial expression each. <br /><br />if the close camera wasn't enough, the lack of light in the film killed it. the film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark. so now we know that the cinematographer was a rank amateur, as well. "ooh ooh, we're going to light the set with a flashlight! that will make it all seem intimate!" no, that made it all seem invisible.<br /><br />on top of the serious technical flaws, there was absolutely no story beyond the barest hint of an idea that was never developed, and nothing new about this kind of relationship was illuminated. (perhaps this is a new kind of film for germany, but in los angeles, forget about it.)<br /><br />the fact that this film won a couple of film festival awards doesn't indicate the quality of the film, but besmirches the quality of these particular festivals. i can assure you that this film won't win anything in the festival where i saw it. in fact, two times during the film it seemed that it was finally over and people started to get up to leave (this was one of the side effects of the cinematographer's "total darkness" technique). but when the film shuddered on, instead, there were moans coming from the audience. and once the movie finally did end, it was clear that it hadn't mattered if it actually had ended at either of the two earlier points. an earlier ending would have saved the audience from yet more monotonous scenes of domesticity (folding sheets, cutting vegetables, spreading honey on bread). yeah, we get it, the life of the lonely old man was boring-- but we figured that one out at the very beginning.<br /><br />i recommend that audiences miss this one, it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie-goers.
