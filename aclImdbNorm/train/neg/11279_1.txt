words really can't describe how bad this film is. i thought zandalee was bad, but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off. this is just laughable! terrible script, poor direction, awful acting and you know what? i can't think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn't too long. if you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment, book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work - far more enjoyable and much better value for money (assuming that you need it!). incidentally, i need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review - please do not buy this movie. it is terrible!
