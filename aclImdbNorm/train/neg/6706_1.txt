i saw this move several years ago at the central florida film festival if i recall. i liked it, it showed great potential. i guess most people here are blasting this film because the film did seem hobbled together (by the filmmaker's own admission on the official site -- the short was exhibited as a "rough-cut").<br /><br />but nonetheless, it was an easy-going comedy. i think many people try to read far too much into a comedy. all they are supposed to do is make you laugh -- that's all. i did just that at its showing, so it succeeded on that level. just my 2 cents anyway.
