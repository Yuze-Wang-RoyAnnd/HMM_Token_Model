funny how a studio thinks it can make a sequel to what was a classic christmas story with an entirely new cast and expect it to float. sure they used various actors for batman, but in that instance batman was a classic character before any of the actor donned his cape. in this instance you had a classic character in the blond headed horn rimmed glasses wearing ralphy that wanted a red ryder bb gun for christmas... somehow we are supposed to forget him and accept another little boy that share no resemblance to the original... if i had not known it was a sequel i wouldn't have guessed it from the cast... except of course charles grodin tries so hard to imitate darrin mcgavin that your are constantly reminded that the original was far better...<br /><br />in the end it might have work if they had cast the movie better. they should have looked for look a likes or simply ignored the original and not tried to copy its look and feel. this one is just a cheap imitation. the ralphy evokes no sympathy just a desire to seem his character shoot his eye out or die.
