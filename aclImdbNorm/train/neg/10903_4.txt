rob schneider is a famous comedian cause of his movements, facials and performances of "not humans". this time he is the animal. marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day, nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked, so marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man. but on his way to the crime scene, he crashes with his car and gets really damaged. he doesn't remember what happens and at the next ordinary day, his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts. of course, we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings, are useless. she is played by collen haskell. there are no negative characters. the negative character, is destiny if i could use this metaphor. marvin should find out, how to become a normal human being again. by the way-his animal instincts, helps him in some situations. schneider's performance is a so-so. the movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies, called mindless fun as i have written above. so watch it for the monkey style rob schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that schneider appears in. he is a great comedian but this is not his best movie.
