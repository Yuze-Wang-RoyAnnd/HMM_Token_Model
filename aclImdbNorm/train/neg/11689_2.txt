i have never seen any of spike lee's prior films, as their trailers never caught my interest. i have seen, and admire denzel washington, and jodie foster's work, and have several of their dvds. i was, however, entirely disappointed with this movie. if this film is any indication of spike lee's ability as a director, my advice would be to "get a job", and stop wasting the time and talent of others. <br /><br />i wonder if some of the other imdb commentators watched the same movie that i'd seen. i can only assume, from their sappy lovelorn reviews, that their adoration of spike lee has blinded them to the banality of this piece of work. i only paid $2.50, in a "second run" theater, and still felt i'd wasted my money.<br /><br />the imdb "trivia" page says it all.......<br /><br />* "shot in 39 days" -- how can you expect to shoot a big budget "blockbuster", (as the media hype promised), in such a short time? no wonder there was such a weak performance by all.<br /><br />* "ron howard was first going to direct the film..." -- he may have done this project some justice, given more time to do so, of course. though the writing was atrocious, the premise had some merits. <br /><br />ok! maybe not. i'm sorry! this film was so rife with pitiful clich'e's, implausible scenes, and lousy characterizations, that maybe even he couldn't have made much of it. (hey ron! be sure to thank russell...good call!) <br /><br />* "jodie foster filmed her part in three weeks." -- and it showed! her portrayal of a "fixer", who makes people's problems go away, was as unbelievable as the script she was given. did she even want to be there?<br /><br />other peeves: <br /><br />* how many bank robbers would bother to come to the door, and inform a uniformed police officer that they were inside robbing the bank, and he'd better keep away...or else? <br /><br />* when "detective frazier", (denzel washington), comes into the bank to verify there are no corpses yet, how many bank robbers, without a gun, would have "led" a cop, (much less "let" a cop) back out to the front door, allowing the police officer to walk behind him? <br /><br />* det. frazier later claimed, to have given the robber "every reason to shoot me." why, then, in their brief struggle, didn't he even try to expose the robber's face? that may have gotten the response he was looking for...a robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification. and why did it take "steve, stevie, steve-o", (the robber's accomplice), so long to come and help out? <br /><br />* i understand that these weren't your typical bank robbers. they had a different agenda, and didn't want anyone harmed. but the cops had no reason to think that they wouldn't. to them it was a desperate situation. why then, when two of the bad guys stepped outside to "pick up the pizzas?", were they not taken down. (first of all, how many robbers would have came outside without using a hostage as a shield? is this spike lee's version of ny city, or snl's?). taking them down would have reduced the bad guy's numbers, screwed up their plans, and the remaining robbers would more probably have given up. if not, there at least would be fewer bad guys inside. (give swat something to do, or send them home!)<br /><br />* what police department in this country, would have allowed madeline white, (jodie foster), to just waltz right into the bank, and discuss a matter with the robbers, that she would not disclose to them first? she had no authority, no governmental credentials; and besides, this was after all, "already" a hostage situation...add one more?<br /><br />* why wouldn't the bank ceo, (christopher plummer), just have destroyed the incriminating documents a long time ago? screw sentimentality! the diamonds, he could have sold.<br /><br />* who was that "schmuck", (the character, not the actor), with the jersey accent, that, conveniently, volunteered, and said he knew the recording was "100% albanian", but yet he himself couldn't speak it.....sir! put your hand down! and his ex-wife! what a "schlump" she was!!! both were totally unbelievable. <br /><br />* when interrogating suspects, why did det. frazier, continually harass the individuals who were obviously not a part of the heist?, (i.e. - telling the elderly woman she could go, and then she couldn't, then could; then couldn't?) give me a break! <br /><br />* who, after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages put on jump suites, couldn't deduce their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the hostages? <br /><br />* near the end of the movie, a false wall was shown to have been built in the supply room, behind which clive owens hid out for "a week"....where did the materials come from? (the drywall & studs). it was also to be assumed that they cut into the sewer, so he could relieve himself. the bank employees hadn't complained about the smell, all week long? hello!<br /><br />* after such a debacle; since the documents "had" fallen into the robber's hands, what kind of "references" was ms. white expecting to get from the bank ceo, seeing that he was now to be a target for blackmail, due to her failure?<br /><br />* and last, but certainly not least, what's with the "electric glide" that denzel did? how stupid! was that supposed to indicate his "resolve" to bring these guys to justice? he looked, rather, like a man who hopped a ride on a shopping cart, while trying to prevent a bowel movement! "cheeee-zheeee"!!!! <br /><br />other than the mediocre plot; lousy script; bad acting; and overall pitiful directing......yada, yada, yada. <br /><br />hopefully this will give enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or not!<br /><br />.
