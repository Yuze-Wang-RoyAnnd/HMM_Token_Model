this movie was absolutely pathetic. a pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes. at times i felt like i was watching an episode of beavis and butthead. i couldn't even sit through the whole movie. emran hashmi disappoints, and hrshitta bhatt is not impressive at all. celina jaitley was not bad. the only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on anu malik and his obsession of shayaris. it was pretty hilarious. the songs "sini ne" and its remix version were really good. you can always count on emran lip-locking and lip-synching a chartbuster. all in all, it seems emran doesn't have a good script from the bhatts to back him up this time.
