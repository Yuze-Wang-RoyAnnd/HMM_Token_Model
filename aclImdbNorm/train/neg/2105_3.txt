bela lugosi as creepy insane scientist who uses orchids to woo brides in order to steal life essence for aged wife. the midget in this film is hilarious!! a lot of freaks, plus a lot of padding and no plot makes watching this film a nightmare. i loved how all the pieces fell together in the end in typical hollywood fashion. the story never gets interesting, and you feel helpless as you watch.<br /><br />usually i'd score bore flicks like this one low, but the midget added just enough creepiness and entertainent to gain a couple more points.
