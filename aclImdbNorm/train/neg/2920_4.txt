wow! i'm shocked to learn that it's a small world and that we are all interconnected. what a waste of 88 minutes. john dunne put it much better in one sentence. "no man is an island." the acting wasn't bad. the kids gave it all they had but at times the thread got so thin i couldn't follow it and the only real "hero" in the film ends up in jail after being tormented by a meter maid. i don't know. i just don't get it. oh well.
