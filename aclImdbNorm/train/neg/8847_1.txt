this u.s soap opera, 'knots landing' has all the entertainment value of being trapped in an elevator. every episode contained plots such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug smuggling, not much different to the plots of other drama shows of the period. as for the cast, i've seen better actors on a cereal box. from the mid to late '90's, repeats of 'knots' stunk up u.k-gold like a mountain of mildewing nappies. i regret to announce that i had to suffer this as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it religiously. though since then, re-runs have been few and far between (let's hope it stays that way). the only positive thing that can be said of 'knots' is the catchy saxophone signature tune, later used as the title music for the i.t.v sitcom, 'the upper hand'. great legacy that, eh?
