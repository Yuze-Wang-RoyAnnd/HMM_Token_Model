...let me count the ways.<br /><br />1. a title-only 'remake' that pulls out every clich'e in the slasher handbook.<br /><br />2. a plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic.<br /><br />3. a completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills.<br /><br />4. a pg-13 rating that insures no gore, violence, or sex.<br /><br />5. a villain that is not frightening or even mysterious.<br /><br />6. a cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we couldn't possibly care about them.<br /><br />7. a lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere (much unlike the original prom night).<br /><br />8. a script of dialog that's beyond poor - it's mind numbing. <br /><br />9. a series of cardboard performances (not sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for that).<br /><br />10. a completely inept teen-targeted slasher remake that's not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination - or even to show a puddle of blood.<br /><br />it's a no-brainer horror fans, save your money.<br /><br />bomb out of ****
