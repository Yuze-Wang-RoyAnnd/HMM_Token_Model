as the number of video nasties i've yet to see dwindles, this little pile of garbage popped up on my "to rent" list when i saw it was available.<br /><br />the premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots. some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, though if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. he's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors ever! granted, they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood. after stealing away into the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour. now, this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes and that's pretty much it. his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack, and i found myself muting much of those scenes.<br /><br />oh, did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity? this is probably the main reason this film was banned, though there is one specific scene, about one second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out, but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans. also, jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals, and, sadly, male as well. so, if you want "fair" in terms of exploitation, you got it.<br /><br />i can't recommend this trash to anyone. it's not even the good bad movie. it's just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then, if you are making your way through the list, leave this for the very last. if you watch it first, you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.
