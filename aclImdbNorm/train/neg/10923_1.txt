tv movie about an ancient egyptian curse brought to the us in the 20's during the filming of demille's first version of the 10 commandments and which is reawakened when demille's sets are unearthed in the desert.<br /><br />one of the worst films i've seen in a long time.<br /><br />the question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film? if this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness. if its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons.you will laugh long and hard at this film, probably more than many other hollywood "comedies".
