now, it would be some sort of clich'e if i began with the bit about the title, so i'll wait on that. first, this movie made me wonder why kids do stupid things like wander around in labs and break bottles. then i realized it, this is a movie with a message, that message is beat kids and things like this won't happen. things like what you ask? things like a giant insectish monster growing up and causing a bit of mayhem before dying in the typical "kill the monster indirectly" fashion. now, as promised... blue monkey... has nothing blue in it nor any simian of any kind. now it snot like i was cheated or anything. the picture on the cover had a giant bug/crab/idiot/thing on the front chasing some screaming nurses. that kinda happened but i wanted apes! having just enjoyed most extreme primate a few nights before(half drunk on cask and creame's brandy mind you) i was in the mood for more monkey hijacks 80's style. not so much. if you like snow boarding apes or blue things this movie is not for you. if you like bugs and good reasons to hit kids, rent this.
