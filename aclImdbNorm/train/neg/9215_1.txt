checking the spoiler alert just in case.<br /><br />perhaps one of the most horrendous movies i have ever seen, mazes and monsters felt like i wasted 101 minutes of my life. the only redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious, but just ended up being funny since they were so bad. evil dead anyone? unfortunately for m&m (fortunately for us) it did not develop a cult following and result in a trilogy. this movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character, robbie (played by hanks) encountered throughout the film. it ended up being a fear mongering video about stereotypes that helped fuel the d&d is the devil movement in the 80s.<br /><br />if you want to avoid wasting your time and money, steer clear of this junk.<br /><br />p.s. - even though the cover looks kinda interesting, which is why i guess my brother bought it, it in no way takes place in a fantasy realm, unless you consider new england or new york city to be such a place.
