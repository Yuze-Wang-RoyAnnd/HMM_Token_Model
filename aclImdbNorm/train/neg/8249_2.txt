hiya folks,<br /><br />well, this movie sucks really. think "love actually" in reverse. nothing fits quite right, nothing is coherent, and certainly nothing makes you laugh. love is rare in this film.<br /><br />it is a total flop. as indicated however, there are three redeeming points about this mangled potential of a film.<br /><br />a) with a star billing of jennifer love hewitt, there will be hordes of guys who will submit with grace to viewing this just to catch a glimpse of the petite hewitt with form fitting clothing. to tell you now guys....there are some promising scenes....but it's really weak eye candy. the "possibilities" here are watered down. nevertheless, i watched the whole thing tempted by the next scene of you know what.....titillating!<br /><br />b) the ending is romantic and positive. that it's contrary and "over the top" is relevant.....yet for me was still a positive point.<br /><br />c) dougray scott plays an amourous friendly guy........refreshing! thank you! <br /><br />2/5, not worthy of your 10 or so dollars.<br /><br />2/3's of the way through, i was convinced jennifer love hewitt was becoming the next softcore legend. although i'll take that back for now.....it hinges greatly on her next film.<br /><br />oh, and her sister is way stupid. her husband is way stupid...and what the heck, she's way stupid.<br /><br />next time. can't wait for the next love actually with jlh!
