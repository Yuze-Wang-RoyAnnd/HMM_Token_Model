the most misogynistic movie of all time? not to mention by '68 shouldn't they have moved beyond white people in brown face playing the "indians"? my favorite parts though have to be when the girls giggle and blush as the bikers drag them off to gang rape them. rape is fun! who knew? let's see, then there's the blatant rip-offs of "the hustler" (fat boss character actually plays pool while scheming to destroy the indians with the lead rebel dude), the horrific acting, the so-on-the-nose-they-might-as-well-have-just-told-you-what-to-think music cues, the lack of anyone who's actually indian in this movie. and who are we supposed to be rooting for? i have to say it figures that quentin tarantino loves this movie. even though his movies tend to champion strong women, i've heard from at least one source that in real life he's a misogynistic idiot. why did i watch it, you ask? don't ask.
