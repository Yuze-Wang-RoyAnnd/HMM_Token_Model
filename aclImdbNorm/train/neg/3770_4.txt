director warren beatty's intention to turn chester gould's famous comic strip into a live-action cartoon (with beatty himself cast in the lead as the square-jawed detective) had sweet overtures of innocent nostalgia--quite unusual and intriguing coming from warren beatty. unfortunately, the picture is requisite ham, fun for awhile but eventually tiring. dick tracy attempts to bring down mobster big boy caprice, aided by loving tess trueheart but tripped up by evil breathless mahoney. for the first half-hour or so, the oscar-winning art direction and set design are wonderful to absorb but, as the plot creaks along predictably (with no real sting in the writing), things begin to congeal. al pacino got a surprise supporting oscar nomination as bad boy caprice, and madonna (who is mostly used as a decorative prop) gets to sing stephen sondheim's "sooner or later (i always get my man)", which copped the award for best original song. lots of heart, thanks to beatty--who was dedicated to his vision--but the picture is too cool and calculated. it lacks heat. *1/2 from ****
