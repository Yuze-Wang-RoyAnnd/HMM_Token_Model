the screaming skull (1 outta 5 stars) this movie boasts some pretty cool opening credits (an offscreen narrator warning that movie patrons will be offered a free burial if they die of fright watching this movie, a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool and the ubiquitous scary music) but, sadly, the movie is all downhill from there. a widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion... admonishing his servants and friends that the new mrs. has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in her past. well, in no time at all she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can. her husband assures her that it's all merely in her mind and... well, you can probably see where this all is going. you will have figured out what's going on long before our hapless heroine... because you have probably seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and tv shows (and done better, too). to add to the movie's myriad transgressions, most cuts of this movie (on numerous cheap dvd compilations) seem to be missing a few key scenes. you see the heroine slowly walking towards the window... she goes to open it... you know she is going to see something scary... and then... suddenly the scene cuts to her sobbing in her husband's arms. so what did she see??? i guess we'll never know.
