lois weber, self proclaimed missionary via the cinema, wrote, directed and produced other films on controversial subjects, but this may be the first to get wide viewing, thanks to tcm. this film is her indictment of abortion, but she cleverly muddles the issue by bringing in eugenics and birth control, leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion. her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here, but one may be forgiven for wishing she had used them less didactically. if you have wondered what tyrone power, jr.'s "famous father" looked like, here is your chance. 1916 fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece. it's enjoyable even if you don't appreciate the propaganda.
