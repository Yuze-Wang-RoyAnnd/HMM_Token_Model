this show stinks. for parents, they usually want their kids to watch something good for them. it is usually educational, funny, and bright.<br /><br />is it educational? no. the doodlebops sing and that's it. they usually sing about themselves, they don't try teaching anything.<br /><br />is it funny? no. the doodlebops instead say something which is not intended as a joke, and laugh at it.<br /><br />is it bright? it's so bright, it's painful. as far as color,s everything is extremely bright, so that's good. but nothing is ever wrong in the world of the doodlebop's. therefore, they are always happy. a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad.<br /><br />the show is also extremely cheesy. every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny. it's overkill.<br /><br />for kids, it's entertaining, but past the age of 2 you won't want your kids to see it. they'll never know how to grow up.
