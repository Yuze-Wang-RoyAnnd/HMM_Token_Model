just okay horror film about a nice suburban family dealing with the death of their parents and the "thing" in the basement that they keep feeding people they pick up off the street. of course there is more to it then that but to say more would be telling.<br /><br />for me this just didn't come together as it tries to have it two ways both as a family drama and a horror film. the film tries very hard to walk the cutting edge between the two genres but seems more to stumble all over the place as it tries to be shocking, something it never really is. it doesn't help that the final revelation is less a scare then an "oh", as on "oh thats it?". maybe if i hadn't been watching so many horror films recently this might have been better or it may have just seemed it since i wouldn't have compared it to so much.<br /><br />i'd take a pass
