i purchased this movie on blu-ray because it promised great visuals and music. i was also a great fan of a similar movie... baraka. the movie is very much styled after baraka, wide angles, very similar shots with cameras set to capture long time passage in each shot. even some of the scenes were identical (the street with traffic). whereas baraka told a great story, juxtaposing nature, man-made environments, spirituality, and horrors of the world in an engrossing fashion and great music, this movie just jumped from shot to shot with no encompassing story, mediocre musical score, and then.... poof, it's finished! i thought there must be some sort of mistake! history of the world? half the movie is egypt and landscape (looks like arizona, but i didn't bother to check). seriously folks, this is horrible, rent it if you must, but do not buy it. the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for putting this out.
