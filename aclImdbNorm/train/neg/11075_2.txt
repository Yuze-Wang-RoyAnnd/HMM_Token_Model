once upon a time there was a science fiction author named h. beam piper who wrote a classic book named "little fuzzy" which was about a man discovering a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet. mr. piper died in 1964, but hollywood and many of today's authors starting looting his grave before his cadaver got cold. this is the book where they got the idea for ewoks from.<br /><br />skullduggery is such a blatant ripoff of "little fuzzy" i can wonder why i'm the only who's ever noticed?<br /><br />but don't take my word for it. here's a link to project guntenberg where you can download a copy of "little fuzzy" for free: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
