the only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh. i had high hopes as i usually love bad campy holiday horror movies, but this just didn't qualify. it's really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity, which again, isn't a bad plot, but is done poorly here. there are some scenes (such as the ending) which are not intended to be funny, but actually made me laugh out loud. there were a couple of times when i thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction, but it never fulfills what it could and should be. in my opinion, if you are looking for a christmas slasher flick, try silent night, deadly night.
