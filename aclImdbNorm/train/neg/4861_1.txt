in the glory days of the 90s (god rest its soul) you could turn on the great comedy central at any hour of the day and see the greatest sketch comedy show of all time saturday night live. whpat a glorious show that was, whether it was the original not-ready-for-primetime players or the second golden age of snl featuring the greats- chris farley, adam sandler, david spade... and then, it all went to hell. i was first exposed to madtv about a year and a half ago, and i think i must've passed out from shock. how could a show so terrible prevail for so long? there are so many horrible flaws. i suppose i'll start with the writing. the writing, for most part, is terrible. it is nothing more than kindergarten bathroom humor. the cast, for the most part, is talentless. there are a few sketches i have enjoyed, such as some of ms. swan and stuart, and there are a few talents on the show such as the magnificent alex borstein. phil lamarr is a talented actor, just not as a comedian. although there a few sparse ha ha moments, they are not enough to redeem this endless line of horrible drivel populated by babbling idiots. miss this one.
