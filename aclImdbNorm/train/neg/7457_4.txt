chris kattan is a great sketch actor on saturday night live...but he should probably leave the movie industry alone unless he gets some sort of creative control. he plays an annoyingly peppy character who basically comes off as mildly retarded and on speed. wanna know the only funny parts? the stuff they showed in the previews. yes, his rendition of take on me is funny. nothing else is. especially when you can tell he's trying very hard to be a physical comedian, which he shouldn't have to try at because he is one. and yet, his 'demolishing the vet's office' bit comes off as cringingly bad. this movie made me develop an eye twitch. avoid it at all costs, and keep watching snl.
