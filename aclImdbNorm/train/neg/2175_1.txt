carlos mencia continually, violently, hatefully screaming "b**ch!" at women is like screaming "n**ger!" at black people, except it's worse. remember, the b word, unlike the n word, is the only pejorative term that is still associated on a daily basis with violence. "b**ch!" is the last thing women hear before they are raped, beaten, or murdered. this guy is perpetuating violence by hatefully using the language of violence. sounds like he may be a gay guy trying to cover by woman-bashing, so that he will sound like a hetero. and how about all the nazi white guys in his audience giving the fascist salutes while their stupid little bimbo white women whimper tee hee hee at their side, clearly terrified to protest this tidal wave of woman-hating. tee hee hee. bet mencia doesn't believe or support free speech for them! come on, carlos
