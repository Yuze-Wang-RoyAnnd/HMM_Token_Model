within the realm of science fiction, two particular themes consistently elicit interest, were initially explored in the literature of a pre-cinematic era, and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike, with varying degrees of success. the first theme, that of time travel, has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film, as well as the written word, most recently on the screen with yet another version of the h.g. wells classic, `the time machine.' the second theme, which also manages to hold audiences in thrall, is that of invisibility, which sparks the imagination with it's seemingly endless and myriad possibilities. and this theme, too, has again become the basis for a film adapted from another h.g. wells classic, `the invisible man,' the realization of which, here, is `hollow man,' directed by paul verhoeven, and starring kevin bacon and elisabeth shue.<br /><br />sebastian caine (bacon) and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the u.s. government, exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility, which they have, at last, achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method. they have, in fact, progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured; their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original `visual' state of being. it's a problem, however, that caine, after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab, has solved-- or so he thinks. and when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful, he decides to present the results to the board of directors, in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project.<br /><br />at the last minute, though, caine demurs, fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level-- the testing of a human subject. and he takes it upon himself to become that subject, securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they've been given approval by the board to do so. but something goes wrong, and caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility; and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it's too late, it all begins to take a toll on caine's mind. and suddenly, his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential, as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that. now there's a very real chance that he may lose everything-- including himself.<br /><br />verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting, even thought provoking film; he establishes a good pace and uses the f/x at his disposal to great effect, though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development. anyone familiar with `the invisible man,' or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story, will know early on that caine is not destined for happier times. still, verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience. but he seems bent on rushing toward the climax, and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful, opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless blood-and-gore fest that betrays his audience and everything he's worked for earlier in the film. rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to caine's suffering, and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it's inevitable conclusion, verhoeven takes the low road, and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level, any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind, along with anything that would have made this a memorable film. and it's a shame, because verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre, and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower.<br /><br />kevin bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable, if only on the surface, which seemingly serves verhoeven's purposes perfectly. there's little depth to bacon's portrayal, but it has more to do with his director's agenda than his own acting abilities. verhoeven simply does not allow bacon the time to develop caine to any extent; the character is mainly a vessel around which verhoeven can build his story, and toward that end, it works. the film would have been better served, however, had verhoeven and bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part, something that would have drawn them in a bit, rather than leaving them at the gate, as it were, as mere observers of an f/x laden extravaganza.<br /><br />elisabeth shue comports herself well in the role of linda mckay, caine's willing accomplice in the ill-fated experiment, but it's basically a thankless part that offers little challenge, especially to an actor of shue's caliber. the same can be said of kim dickens (so magnificent in the 2001 film, `things behind the sun'). her character, sarah kennedy, does little more than support the action and f/x. both actors are capable of so much more, and deserve better than what they are given to work with here.<br /><br />the supporting cast includes josh brolin (matthew), greg grunberg (carter), joey slotnick (frank), mary randle (janice) and william devane (dr. kramer). entertaining to a point, and even successful on a certain (low) level, `hollow man' is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been. like an annual fireworks display, it will give you some momentary thrills, but after awhile it'll begin to blend in with all the others you've seen, without anything special to set it apart. and it's too bad, because given the talent and abilities of those involved here, it could have been so much more. i rate this one 4/10.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />
