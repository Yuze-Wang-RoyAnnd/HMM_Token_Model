how many fricken' times do we have to see a spook walking by in the background & peaking through a mirror's reflection? it's been done in two dozen movies in recent memory & four dozen times in this choppy, poorly done film. there were only two freaky moments to appreciate....when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters. speaking of characters, the acting was as flat as the diet coke in the 64 oz. cup i was drawing it from. the side characters could have been pulled from various scooby doo cartoons. there was the friendly, aged sheriff. there was the kooky weirdo living in the backwoods with the alabama drawl. lots'o'characters with no development. the most disturbing image was that of a murdered child in the beginning. but rather than explore the child's murder, which would have been interesting, they just let us know that she was dead & her parents had a hard time reconciling her death with the community & each other. when they reach the cabin, the scenes rarely flowed together....with flashing images of the dead daughter interjected here & there. oh...and the eerie sounds were also overdone. you know what i mean....creaking doors that open by themselves, crickets in the forest, yada yada yada. ooooohhhh. haven't seen that before. again, you'll see the amazing self-opening door in the movie over and over an over again. note to director: a scary scene is only scary if it's not repeated every 5 minutes in the same film. think these things out before calling out "it's a wrap!"
