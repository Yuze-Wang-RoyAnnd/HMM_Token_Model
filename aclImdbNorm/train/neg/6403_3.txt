....as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates. barely even reaching feature length, "can i do it....'till i need glasses" is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. many of them are so short that you can't believe it when you realize that that was supposed to be the punchline (example: the santa claus gag); others are so long that you can't believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up that punchline (example: the students' awards gag). and nearly all are directed without any artistry. don't get me wrong: about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny (the iron / phone one is probably my favorite). there is also some wonderful full-frontal nudity that proves, yet again, that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is some comedic male nudity as well). and i agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy! but none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than * out of 4.
