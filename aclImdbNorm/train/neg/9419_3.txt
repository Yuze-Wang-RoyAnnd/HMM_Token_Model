i'd never heard of this, then found out it's the man with the deadly lens, which i'd heard of but not seen. connery's presence drove me to buy it, and it's not good. it wants to be a sort of cross between dr strangelove and mash, but it just isn't that funny, unless you find the name general wombat (?) funny. it comes across as a flat 70s thriller until the last ten minutes, when it springs to life. there are many, many flat scenes in the whitehouse between the president and his aides which don't work. it's almost as if the initial cut was too long, and the first half was edited down to get to the whole nuclear bomb ransom storyline and the suicide bomber attacks, which i think are meant to be played for laughs, but again, aren't that funny. the location filming is excellent but the studio stuff looks like cheap tv. i could not believe the man responsible for key largo, crossfire and elmer gantry did this. only laugh: connery throws away his wig before putting on his helmet and jumping out of a plane. it makes never say never again look like genius.
