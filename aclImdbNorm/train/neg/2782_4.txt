just saw the movie this past weekend, i am upset, and disappointed with it. basically, the movie tells you that immigrants, the ones from former soviet union especially, come to this country, bring everyone they can with them from the old country, and invade and take over what americans have been working for. which is a very wrong way of looking at immigration, and a much worse way of telling people about it. that's the main thing. another thing, the overall writing, directing and filming is on the level of village amateurs. the actors did pretty well, but it wasn't up to them save this bunch of crap. a few jokes were funny, but most were bad and cheesy. couldn't wait to get out of the theater, want my money back.
