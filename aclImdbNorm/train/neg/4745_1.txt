there isn't more i can say that saying this film was awful. the whole chineseness is awakened in your being because of the ancestors was a hard sell. but telling the audience that every chinese knows chinese history without even studying it just laughable. that is like saying every american knows american history without studying or every filipino, etc, etc. it just isn't believable.<br /><br />the story is flat out hideous. it talked about shin being from a monastery in china - later identifying it from bejing. however, the early sequences of the film show the map focusing in on mongolia. i know the current chinese regime wants to claim areas like mongolia for its own, granted. but its a distinct nation and it even labels "mongolia" on the map. did disney studios fail 5th grade geography? <br /><br />the relationship between wendy and shin is superficial at best, and yet she somehow feels connected to him. her training is just cheesy as well. and, lets cut to the chase: everything about this film is bad. its bad enough to laugh at and cry over. the taekwondo action was over played and unrealistic in many instances.<br /><br />the evil eyes thing was cheesy. however, the left out ending would have been the only descent thing about it. they should have left the evil eyes ending in it. but instead somehow evil is defeated. yey! <br /><br />overall,not worth the time of the dog in the film. brenda song should get on with another studio.
