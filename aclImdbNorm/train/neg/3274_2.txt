once again, like charlie's angels, inspector gadget and thunderbirds, a tv series is turned into a full length film and gets ruined for all the hundreds of people that watched. basically the duke cousins, luke (johnny knoxville) and bo (seann william scott) in hazzard county, spend a lot of time driving very fast in "the general lee". but they need to get their act together and stop their family farm being destroyed along with almost the whole town by nasty jefferson davis 'boss' hogg (razzie nominated burt reynolds) to make way for a huge coal mine. they get help along the way from their sexy cousin daisy (razzie nominated jessica simpson) and uncle jesse (willie nelson), while being chased by equally mean sheriff rosco p. coltrane (lost's m.c. gainey) and the police. also starring joe don baker as governor jim applewhite, jack polick as deputy cletus hogg, david koechner as cooter davenport, michael weston as deputy enos strate and lynda carter as pauline. i think the only reason i give the film an extra star is because of a couple of impressive car stunts, and of course the gorgeous body of simpson (i'll admit her legs aren't quite catherine bach, but still!), but besides that it is pretty boring. it was nominated the razzies for worst picture, worst director for jay chandrasekhar, worst remake or sequel, worst screen couple for simpson & her "daisy dukes" and worst screenplay. pretty poor!
