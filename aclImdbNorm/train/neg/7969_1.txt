ok another film bought by me and joe swatman. ok this isn't the worst film i've reviewed this week but it still sucked royaly. we had a lot of fun watching this piece of crap.<br /><br />the monster jigsaw is a mish mash of all these dysfunctional students ideas, u just know ur in for trouble when someone equips him with a buzzsaw and a sawed of shotgun, the film wasn't as gory as we hoped, i mean on of the deaths is a heart attack. again i think the acting sucks, sum of the actors must be porn stars and one get into her undies for what ever reason. <br /><br />the absolute worst part is the ending, it leaves it open for a bit of a jigsaw 2 but thats never gunna happen lets face it.<br /><br />my ratings:<br /><br />funny 4/100 mock (how much fun we had mocking it) 73/100 acting 8/100 generally 12/100
