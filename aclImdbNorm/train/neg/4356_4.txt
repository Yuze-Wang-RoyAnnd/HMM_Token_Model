as i am not a blood and guts fan i found the gory scenes totally unnecessary (you spell it) and too real for my liking, if you're the type of person who gets their rocks off on beheadings on the internet or snuff movies i say go for it, it beggars belief what sort of person dreams this sick crap up though.<br /><br />apart from that it had the potential to be a great movie, the music was top class too (through the movie and especially the end credits). some parts though were a bit unbelievable, like you've just been found by your girlfriend trust up awaiting torture and death and all you do is tell her about what had happened and how you got there, (why didn't he ask her if she happened to have any wipes or even some air freshner or a piece of gum while he was at it?), come on now, most would probably just scream "hurry up and untie me then lets get the f*** out of here quick!". where were the flys, maggots etc, and when the girl accidentally came across the place surely the stench of rotten flesh would have sounded a few alarm bells! i would only recommend this movie to friends of dennis niellson and the like, i'm sure a video like this would make sickos like that have a very happy christmas.
