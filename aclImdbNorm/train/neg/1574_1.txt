there is no story! the plot is hopeless! a filmed based on a car with a stuck accelerator, no brakes, and a stuck automatic transmission gear lever cannot be good! i would have stopped that car within one minute whether i was in it or in the police car constantly following it. i feel sorry for the actors that had to put up with such a poor script. the few scenes that some similarity to action was heavily over-dramatized, and as far from reality you can get. in addition, there were a lot of blunders, for instance the hood of the runaway car, which was popped doing 100mph. at first it just folded over the windshield, like it would in reality, but then, afterwards, it blew off. the car was later in the movie observed with the hood on....<br /><br />this film was nothing but annoying, stay away from it!
