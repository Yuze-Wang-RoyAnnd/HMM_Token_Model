the movie is actually too slow. there are some nice images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact boring. you see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more. it may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn't fun at all. though you laugh several times but it's really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun. to disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie video-clips into the movie. they are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50's but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it's really sad. several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something, that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that's it. beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music. the director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost. personally i cannot recommend the movie. i believe that art is something that shouldn't be boring. during the projection there was yawning all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review.
