i find it hard to believe that anyone would put this movie in the same context as the exorcist. where the exorcist was subtle and creepy, stigmata was blunt, clumsy, and way too formulaic.<br /><br />this is one of the most visually beautiful films i've seen in a while, but the imagery does not make up for the downward spiral of patronizing exposition that makes it unbearable. <br /><br />my interest in this movie was peaked when it was compared to the exorcist, and my visit to the official web site increased that interest. the web site had many tales of "actual" stigmata throughout history. however, scene by scene, the movie is so obsessed by its quest for "genuineness" that it becomes comical at first, then outright hard to watch toward the end. i began getting suspicious when the priest charged with investigating potential miracles walks into the beauty parlor where our would-be heroine cuts hair and, evidently, flirts with priests.<br /><br />the plot: a woman without faith in god begins receiving the wounds of christ (the stigmata) and is baffled and upset about the ordeal. a priest is sent straight from the vatican to investigate the case. is frankie possessed by satan, or a vessel for jesus christ?<br /><br />the only miracle in this film is that it finally ends.
