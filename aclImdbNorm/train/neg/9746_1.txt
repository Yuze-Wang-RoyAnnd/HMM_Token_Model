i remember this film, exhibit in barcelona (spain) in 1970, for the time of a week. although it could seems incredible, and i can't offer any explanation for it, this movie was exhibit in a theater dedicated to... movies of art and big quality (that, is, bergman, resnais, malle, bu~nuel, and... the projected man). few people saw it (luckly people, no doubt) and no reference about this very boring sf movie can be found in the peter nichols science fiction encyclopidie, or about the author of the original novel. very indicative. i remember of it, after all this years, a no-story, a lot of special effects that seems ridiculous effects in fact, and no more. it seems that in some countries the running time is 90 mm. and in anothers 77 min. well, it means only a little more of pain.
