i really don't get all the adulation that this film has received. it's mawkish, unnecessarily manipulative and dodges many of the big issues - ie nash's affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places. that, i suppose, in the context of a commercial hollywood film is just about tolerable, but what's with all the praise for russell crowe's performance? the man just seems to shuffle about, clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting? anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that crowe's performance is little short of caricature. it is also rather offensive. and, dare i say, just on the right side of being truly terrible
