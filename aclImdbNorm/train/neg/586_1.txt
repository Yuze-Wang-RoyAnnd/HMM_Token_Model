after what i thought was a masterful performance of two roles in man from snowy river, why was kirk douglas replaced by brian dennehy in the sequel? it just wasn't the same without spur and harrison, as portrayed by douglas. maybe he recognized how poor the plot was--jim returns after extended absence, to find jessica being pursued by another man. he could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him, and not find competition. for a disney movie, this contains foul language, plus the highly unnecessary part when jim & jessica shacked up without being married--very lame. quite an insult to viewer intelligence, according to members of my family. i'll stick with the first one, and try to forget i ever saw the sequel!
