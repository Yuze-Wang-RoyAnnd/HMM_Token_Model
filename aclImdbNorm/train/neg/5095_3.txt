i sat through this movie this evening, forcing myself to stick with it even though i never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them, because the two leads, g'erard philippe and mich`ele morgan, were major film stars of their era and i wanted to see them in "something different," which this certainly was. they both gave fine performances, but of distasteful characters.<br /><br />indeed, the whole movie is about a shabby little town in mexico inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful characters (the doctor is, of course, the major exception). what mich`ele morgan ever sees in philippe to fall in love with him is never explained.<br /><br />this is supposedly based on a work by jean-paul sartre. all i could think was that, if sartre's work is anything like this movie, it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating camus' masterful novel the plague, which dealt with a plague in north africa.<br /><br />a well-acted but uninteresting movie.
