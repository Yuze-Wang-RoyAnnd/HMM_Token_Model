quite one of the worst films i have ever seen. terrible acting, laughable 'action' (it's clear that the cars are travelling slowly), atrocious script, hideously unsatisfying ending and incompetent direction make a hash of a movie. we know judge reinhold is a fine actor, but he should be ashamed of this detritus. there is no great tension within the car and, when the characters stumble upon moments of hope, they laugh like inane banshees for some reason, even 'high five-ing' when they see the bridge lowered!<br /><br />also, the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car strains credibility. apparently based on true events, though? if that's the case, truth is evidently stranger than fiction! unfortunate then, that it was portrayed in such an inept manner.
