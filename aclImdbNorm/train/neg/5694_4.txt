i'll be honest- the reason i rented this movie was because i am a huge fan of kyle chandler's (most notably from early edition). since he usually plays the good guy, i wanted to see him as in a different role (out of curiosity). the plot itself also drew me in; a wanna-be hitman (tony greco- a.k.a. mr. chandler) must kill a person at random before he is trusted with the life- or, rather, the death- of a witness who will testify against someone in "the family". the movies was nothing like i expected. it was sick, i hated the end (if you saw it, you'd know why), and there were so many unnecessary parts. basically- it was filthy, and made little sense. yes, it was a mob movie, and yes the guns do go boom. but there's more to a movie than that. this film acted as if it didn't have the time to go into detail- just deal with it and understand it. the acting really made up for it- james belushi was pretty amusing as "the rose". sheryl lee made angel seem as believable as she could get. she surprised me the most. and kyle chandler was equally convincing as an anxious newcomer to "the family". if only the script did justice to the actors.
