not an altogether bad start for the program -- but what a slap in the face to real law enforcement. the worst part of the series is that it attempts to bill itself as reality fare -- and is anything but. men and women that dedicate their lives to the enforcement of laws deserve better than this. what is next, medical school in a minute? charo performing lipo? charles grodin assisting on a hip replacement? c'mon...show a little respect. even the citizens of muncie are outing the program as staged. police academy = high school gym? poor editing (how many times can they use the car-to-car shot of the taco bell in the background?), cheesy siren effects (the same loop added ad nauseum to every 'call' whether rolling code or not), and last, but not least -- more officer safety issues than you could shake a stick at.<br /><br />if i want to see manufactured police work and wise-ass fake cops, i would watch reno 911.
