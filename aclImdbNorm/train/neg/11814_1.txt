back in the day, i remembered seeing dumb nintendo power comics that had the same artwork as this show... and then word came up that this show was a coming to a television near me! i was not estatic, but curious... i was curious about how bad this show was gonna suck. my friends all said that this show had no real meanings and was too silly for straight people like me to enjoy (i'm actually gay), so i decided to watch the show with low expectations.<br /><br />what a horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!! first off, i hate the new characters. tiff and tuff are so dumb and i hate how so many fanboys drool over tiff, it's sad. i also hate how they made chef kalasaki (or whatever his nonstraight name was) a good guy who owned a restaurant. bad move, 4kids tv! escargoon is nothing but a loser adviser to the king dedede (who sucks big time in this show) and i hate the face of that one company that keeps supplying dedede with those awful weapons to destroy kirby. so stupid, i hate this show.<br /><br />i then began to hate kirby even more since it was obvious nintendo was just aching to get kirby some popularity. kirby'll never beat mario in the fight for coolness, and kirby will always be nothing but a tiny little cream puff of gayness. nuf said!!!
