this is the version that even the author hated, because it's so schmaltzy. they gave it a 'happy ending' and changed a lot of the dialogue, and it's just a big pile of saccharine. the 'stage manager' is quite good, i believe he originated the role, but everyone else falls into that acting style of the 40's that is really just posing. the one great feature- the music. this has one of the best scores ever recorded, and it's worth seeking out in a record shop. overall i think the 1989 spalding grey/ eric stoltz/ penelope miller version is far superior.
