after 30 seconds, you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap knock-off. the story is taken from great movies like "texas chainsaw massacre" and "hills have eyes". i like those kind of movies, even if they're duplicated well (wrong turn, timber falls, carver). <br /><br />but "side sho" is hard to watch: the actors are really bad, the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and totally misplaced. you do not care at all what happens to the characters. the so-called bad guys are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypical. so how about the blood and gore ? well there is some, although it is rather cheap and the action is executed very poorly. 2 points, just for the gore and blood but do understand that this is hardly worth a look, even for the gore-hounds..
