the film did what it set out to do: show how a young girl copes with poverty and grows into her maturity. however, for most of us, this subject has been explored adequately and in most instances with more sophistication than done here. the movie fixated on breasts, which soon became boring and i lost interest. if this was on tv, i would've switched to the latest news on the starr report. that's how boring i found this movie.
