daraar got off to a pretty good start. the first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. other than that, the first half of the movie is a total bore. all the first half of the movie is about is rishi kapoor falling head over heels in love with juhi chawla. by the way, don't you think he's a little old for her???<br /><br />things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when juhi tells us about her previous husband; and wow what a lunatic is he! he was an over-protective, neat-freak with a really hot temper! he used to beat up poor juhi for no good reason! one of the reasons i really don't like this movie is because i can't stand to see juhi (my favorite actress) get so abused. this film in general has way too much abuse and bloodshed; i find it so sickening!!!<br /><br />anyway, all i'm trying to say is if you're thinking about renting daraar, you should put it right back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else!
