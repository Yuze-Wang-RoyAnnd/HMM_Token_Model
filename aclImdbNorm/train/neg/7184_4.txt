this wasn't really a very good movie. there were lots of implausible and predictable things that happened during the course of the film...but i think that most of the reviewers are missing the point of why this movie should be enjoyed by a wide audience. this movie was produced by magic johnson! isn't that enough to inspire us all to check out this film? a film produced by a former nba star doesn't come along every day, you know. beautifully stupid kids in a big house getting slashed by an axe wielding psycho. every clich'e trotted out for us to groan over. teen sex. and it was all produced by magic johnson! i can't say enough about this movie! teen drug use! college hijinx! and it was all produced by magic johnson! yippeeee!
