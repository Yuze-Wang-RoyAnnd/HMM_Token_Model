worst mistake of my life.<br /><br />i picked this movie up at target for $5 because i figured, "hey, it's sandler i can get some cheap laughs". i was wrong, completely wrong. mid-way through the film all three of my friends were asleep and i was still suffering. worst plot, worst script, worst movie i have ever seen. i wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour, then i'd stop, and you know why? because it felt damn good. upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it burn....and that felt better than anything else i've ever done. it took american psycho, army of darkness, and kill bill just to get over that crap. i hate you sandler for actually going through with this and ruining a whole day of my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
