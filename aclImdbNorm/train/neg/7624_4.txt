florence chadwick was actually the far more accomplished swimmer, of course. she swam the english channel both directions. she swam from catalina island to the california coast. marilyn bell's is a sweet story, but the usual glorification of us canadians in the face of a superior world. another sample of our inferiority complex. our political system works pretty well and the health system allows people not to die in hospital lobbies. that's pretty good. better than lebanon. what should we do about hockey though...? and curling. the notion of calling this a sport, of its inclusion in the olympics...! ah, but we digress...
