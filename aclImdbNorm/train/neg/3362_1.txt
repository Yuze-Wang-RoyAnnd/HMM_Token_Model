the haunting is yet another bad horror remake with phony overdone special effects and a big cast of on screen favorites and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever except maybe for the cinematography.yes remakes aren't all bad but remakes directed by jion da bont definitely are.i suppose that the a-list actors (liam neeson,catherine zeta jones,owen wilson)are there to distract us from the boring plot,ridiculous special effects, and terrible attempts at scaring it's audience however this is a movie not a tabloid magazine we don't care whose in it we care about the characters and story two things this film missed.the storyline is like taking the classic novel the haunting of hill house and ripping out four chapters and then using whatever's left for the film it is so boring and a lot of it is unexplained.the characters are pretty thin and while the acting is good you don't really care about any of the characters at all.lily taylor gives a horrendous performance and sounds like she's 8 years old when delivering her lines not to mention what a horrible screamer she is.lily taylor isn't made for the horror genre at all.the ghosts are stupid and cheesy, they look like a bunch of casper the friendly ghost's and the ghost of hugh cain looks like a fat guy dressed as the grim reaper for halloween with a smoke machine.there is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and it's not even funny unintentionally just plain sad.the house is pretty and well designed that is probably the only positive thing about this movie it looks nice but that doesn't save it from it's brutal everything else.i can honestly say i felt like i was wasting my time watching the haunting on tv for no price so i would've been even more pi$$ed if i had paid to see it but luckily it was on scream channel.overall the haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a poor attempt at horror.
