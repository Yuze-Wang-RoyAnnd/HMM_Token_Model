your first clue that this is a cheesy movie is that it was shot on video, not film. the story is convoluted, and the production is amazingly sloppy. note, for example, that when the title couple are on a plane ostensibly landing in vermont, where they've gone to celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony, the plane is shown coming into an airport surrounded by palm trees. their ceremony - in vermont - takes place in a garden of tropical plants, including palms, which wouldn't last five minutes in the new england climate. on yet another airplane trip, the establishing shot depicts a fedex cargo plane taking off. presumably they could only afford to travel in steerage. as for the plot, this movie expects you to believe that victor, the devoutly christian brother of arthur, is kicked out of his church when the congregation learns that his brother is gay. not only that, but the pastor eventually sets victor up with a hit man to have ben and arthur killed "to purge their souls of sin." apparently no one in this church has ever heard of the ten commandments. were it not for jamie brett gabel, who is surprisingly effective as arthur, this movie would have no redeeming qualities at all.
