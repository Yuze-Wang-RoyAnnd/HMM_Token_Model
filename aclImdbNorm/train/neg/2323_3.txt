jim belushi is having a mid life crisis, nothing is going right, when his car goes out on him..he goes into an empty bar where michael caine shows him what life wouldve been like if one event in high school had come out differently.. a good premise with some moments..but mostly flat and uninteresting. on a scale of one to ten..3
