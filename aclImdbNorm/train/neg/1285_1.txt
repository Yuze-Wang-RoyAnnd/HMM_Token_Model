born, raised, and educated in scotland, i was appalled at this disgusting portrayal of a man who was no more nor less than a cattle rustler. worse yet, the thread of the entire movie was sex in one form or another, by implication or verbally. to view it, one would think that 18th century scotland was populated by a bunch of sex perverts and homosexuals. lange was a joke acting as the "young" mother at age 49 but liam neeson was even worse! taking a "bath" in a scottish loch is not commonplace as they portrayed him - but, it did give them yet another opportunity to demonstrate how sexually driven we were. save your money and watch pinnochio.
