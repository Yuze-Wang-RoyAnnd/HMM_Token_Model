ok, first of all, i am a huge zombie movie fan. i loved all of romero's flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the re-make of dawn of the dead. so when i had heard every single critic railing this movie i was still optimistic. i mean, critics hated resident evil, and while it may not be a particularly great film, i enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot-em up with a half decent plot. this however, is pure crap. terrible dialogue, half-assed plot, and video game scenes inserted into the film. who in their right mind thought that was a good idea. the only thing about this movie (i use the term loosely) that i enjoyed was jurgen prochnow as captain kirk (ugh). while his name throws originality out the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it. everyone else acts as if they're doing shakespeare. and very badly i might add. basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a.) are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b.) like to play mst3k, the home game. see it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughs.<br /><br />
