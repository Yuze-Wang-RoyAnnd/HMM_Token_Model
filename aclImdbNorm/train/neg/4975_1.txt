after having seen the canadian/icelandic/british 2004 production of "beowulf & grendel," which i thought brilliant and stunning, i approached this--the first of 3 newer beowulf movies due out this year--with trepidation. as soon as i heard "viking" and saw the horned helmets, i groaned. these were migration era swedes and danes, not vikings (they came later). and even the vikings never wore horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you). then there's hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a set for a movie about greece or rome, not 6th-century denmark. the swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods. i spotted weapons that might have been used by crusaders in "kingdom of heaven," and one character was even wielding a windlass steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from "beowulf & grendel"! beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was dismal and the acting totally wooden and unconvincing. the biggest yuk was a secret-weapon crossbow, complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles, that looked like something bought from iraqi insurgents. the special-effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that beowulf could never have torn off an arm, as he did in the poem. thank the gods for bazooka crossbows! i could go on, but i won't.
