i'm a huge steven seagal fan. hell, i probably weigh as much as he does although i don't have the street cred to sport the frizzy-mullet-ponytail. having stated my own bias and affection for america's favorite corpulent stage and screen hero, it is with a heavy heart that i must declare this to be his worst movie ever. i'm not sure he could make a movie any worse than this.<br /><br />in his defense the major problems with this film seem to occur in post-production. it's painfully obvious that this movie was supposed to have a different storyline. that results in woeful voiceovers in which steve's voice doesn't nearly sync up with that of the dubbed voice. the editing is pisspoor and overall this starts bad, gets even worse, and by the end you'll wish you had rewatched the da vinci code instead. yes, it's that bad.<br /><br />after this i don't know what to expect from steve. my friends still laugh at me for listening to his cds. is it time i start checking out some of the van damme direct to dvd nutty logs? if you are tempted to watch this movie, rip your eyeballs out and flush them down the toilet. a lifetime of darkness is better than 89 minutes of this.
