as a mother of 2 young children who are or should i say have been growing up with the many reincarnations of scooby i feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of scooby.<br /><br />if as a family we had not seen any episodes prior to shaggy and scooby get a clue we may have enjoyed it as a light weight, nothing special saturday morning cartoon. but that in essence is the problem it is in it's current format so light weight that it will not have the longevity of the "old" scooby and gang. i'm sure it may succeed in a quick monetary return but i'm sure the long term buy in of old and young is in very real danger of being lost. my 6 year old son on seeing the new version was really disgruntled and without any prompting said that it looked really badly animated and why wasn't it anything like the last series(where are you).<br /><br />scrappy doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better than this. let's hope get a clue will be apropos with reference to the producers.
