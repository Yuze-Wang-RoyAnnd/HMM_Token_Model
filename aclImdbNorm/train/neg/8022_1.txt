i see that someone already thought of a similar analogy, which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after i watched this movie. they said that the ingredients were there but there was no plot. besides the sexual scenes which bordered on child-porn (which i feel could have been edited out or been presented more suggestively in nature rather than graphically, i would liken this movie to a recipe that's been torn in half. it's kind of like being handed a list of ingredients, with no directions on how to put them together into a finished product. from the start, character development and story development are lacking...unfortunately, many times in this monotonous drivel we are teased with bits of plot and we think "ahh-ok...finally we are going to find out something more about why this scene is going on...or...who this character is...or maybe we are finally going to get to know and appreciate this character more...or understand and get involved more with this inter-character relationship...etc." but no such luck! on the contrary, many times i was tempted to just turn it off more than once but stuck it out when the carrot was dangled, only to find that whatever mini-plot within whatever mini-plot (and that poorly presented) was just a ruse. why i stayed with it till the end is a mystery, other than usually ifc has better selections and they gave it 2-1/2 stars (another mystery). it's not that the characters aren't likable to some degree, or that you can't identify with them or their humanness at all...it's just that this could have been so much better with just a little more effort. i notice this was shot around santa cruz and find myself wondering if it was someone's film school project. i wish i could have given this a better review but honestly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half.
