watching beautiful women sneaking around, playing cops and robbers is one of the most delightful guilty pleasures the medium film lets me enjoy. so the house on carroll street was not entirely a waste of time, although the story is contrived and the screenplay uninspired and somewhat irritating.<br /><br />there are many allusions to different hitchcock pictures, not least the choice of kelly mcgillis in the starring role. she is dressed up as grace kelly, and she is not far off the mark. not at all. but her character is not convincing. the way she is introduced to the audience, she should be someone with political convictions and a purpose in life. after all the movie deals with a clearly defined time period, true events and a specific issue. but the story degenerates within the first minutes into a sorry run-off-the-mill crime story with unbelievable coincidences, high predictability and a set of two dimensional characters. this is all the more regrettable, as the performances of the actors are good, as are the photography and the set design.<br /><br />the finale in central station, new york is breath taking. it starts in the subterranean section and then moves up to the roof. the movie can be praised for its good use of architecture.
