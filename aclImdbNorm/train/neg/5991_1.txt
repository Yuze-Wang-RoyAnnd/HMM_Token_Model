ba ba ba boring...... this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction slumberness. genie francis (aka general hospital's laura) has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be bad.... there is ben kingsley (an academy award winning actor) in this stinker and a few others decent actors. you have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this awful movie. the music dramatically goes up and down like it's a major dramatic story. even if you pay attention the plot is impossible to follow. the effects are mediocre as well and seem really dated. all of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have no realism to their dialogue. i could go on and on on how this is a bad movie. at least with battlefield earth it's so bad it's funny but this is just b o r i n g. avoid unless you want to be lulled to sleep.
