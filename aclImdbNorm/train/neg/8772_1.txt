there's nothing new for me to say: 4 hours of people dying over and over in the same hill. the cast was stellar, but unfortunately the producer/director/editor/god goofed. he should have eaten humble pie (if not for his own sake then for the men who died in kargil), hired one of these brilliant bollywood directors, hired a real scriptwriter, hired a real editor, hired a musician that wasn't related to him in some way (and who seemed to have listened to some bad version of "apocalypse now" on some cheap indian drug), hired a real professional crew, thrown away all the fireworks and told a real story. unfortunately he, like the bigwigs of the indian army, made decisions that were terrible for his actors, and terrible for his audience. we all died over and over. <br /><br />please don't do that again, sir! sushma kathmandu, nepal<br /><br />ps: next time an indian director decides to glorify the gurkha regiment, i suggest he hire more than one nepali to represent the team. surely there are plenty of nepali men working in bombay--last count was 40,000 to half a million.
