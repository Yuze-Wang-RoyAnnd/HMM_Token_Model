you must be seeing my comments over many films under evren buyruk ..i am off to make another comment over a movie that is not even worth a minute of talking though..this film is basically two hours of dafoe's character drinking himself - nearly literally - to death. the only surprise in this film is that you didn't have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised. it was just a grim, sad waste of time.<br /><br />willem dafoe is excellent actor. peter stormare is an excellent actor. but this film just sucked. slow doesn't make the movie bad, it was just bad. the sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic detail aren't cohesively drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives, finally at the end. i really appreciate the artistic vision, but as entertainment, it put me to sleep. (seriously, i fell asleep and had to re-watch the film - which was even more disappointing.) i generally don't like to make negative comments or reviews on the works of others, even when they suck, but this film warranted one. it's just too bad that these great actors were shamed with this end result.
