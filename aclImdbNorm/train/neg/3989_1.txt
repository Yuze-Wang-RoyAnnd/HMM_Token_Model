who in their right mind plays a lyrical song at the same time they are portraying an emotional scene between two people? when flipper confronts his wronged wife in the dressing room, the song sung with lyrical content is as loud as the dialog, so one can hear neither, diluting any emotional impact the scene may have had. the scenes of annabella getting beaten by her father with his fists, a lamp and then a belt was so cartoonish as to be absurd. this entire movie is a cartoon, the rampant prejudice against whites is literally astounding. the discussion by the black women after flipper's wife finds out he has cheated on her with a white woman - as if it were a discussion by an oxford debating team, is ridiculous. the rampant racism might be possible to endure, but the soundtrack and the sound mixing during this 'movie' is too much. it was a technically poorly made movie. there is no understanding of the basic craft of movie making, the sound track, the editing and the desperate attempt of great actors trying to keep this movie afloat. i actually felt sorry for anthony quinn, wondering why he had accepted a role in this flick - his appearance in this is painful. this is the first movie i have seen by this director and it will be my last.
