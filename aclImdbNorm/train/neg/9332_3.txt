it's not a terrible movie, really, and glenn and keitel are top-notch actors. further, they do an acceptable job with the very weak script. the scenery is lush and the plot has some interesting twists. further, i umderstand why these actors and the crew made the film, they are professionals and they get paid for it. but i do wonder why studios spend the time and money to make a film and then don't release it for theater audiences? even if a film is a box-office flop, surely it makes some money. if you are a fan of keitel or glenn, rent the video or catch it on tv, as did i. granted, the movie won't help solve the immigration quandary with mexico, but the experience is far better than 90% of the standard tv fare of today.
