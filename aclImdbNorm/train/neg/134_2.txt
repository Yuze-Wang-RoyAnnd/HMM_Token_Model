this movie in away was super-clever. it's theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made. valentine makes zero attempt to be original. what is valentine anyway? it's a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier. there is nothing original in valentine. <br /><br />i only saw it once, and in that one viewing here are some of the films it ripped off. 1.prom night 2.carrie 3.scream 4.any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody.<br /><br />i know there is more, but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk so it couldn't grab them as fast as they came.<br /><br />valentine had no chance of being a good movie. how come every horror movie has to have a "suprise" killer, people you don't care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene. one minute a nice girl turns into an evil b--ch, then she's an insecure woman, and so on and son on.<br /><br />normally any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by gore, once again valentine doesn't have this. it was as if they tried to make it pg-13 but failed, so they left the edit. <br /><br />do not see this overly-inspired, rip-off unless you hate yourself, and you want to die.<br /><br />*1/2 (3) -j.leonard rollins-
