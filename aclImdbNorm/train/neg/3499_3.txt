comedy central has had success with original programming using professional comics. the chapelle show, mind of mencia, the daily show and the hugely popular colbert report all star professional comics and all are, or in the case of chapelle show, were, solid shows. given that sarah silverman is one of the best female comics in the business, i was expecting good stuff when i tuned in.<br /><br />i was so disappointed.<br /><br />there were some mildly funny sequences, but given that the star is the caliber of silverman, the show could have been much better. it was just the pilot, and hopefully next week's show will be better. if not, get her some help in the form of better writers for the show.
