- bad stuff: this movie is real crap. bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake i thought this was "the twilight zone". the flashbacks are pretty much useless. one part of the movie he thinks taking his anger out on a window will make his life better. i wanna know the casting director and if he was high because the acting, even from the adults was horrid. a kissing scene in this movie even sucked. this movie killed the book. the book was great. i highly do not recommend this movie. not even for educational purposes. <br /><br />- good stuff: i don't know what i can say really. there is some suspense parts that get you going, but they are quickly shot down by the bad stunt work and acting. <br /><br />- my verdict: do not watch.
