well, this movie started out funny but quickly deteriorated. i thought it would be more 'adult oriented' humor based on the first few moments but then the movie switched into a bad made-for-disney channel type mode, especially a go-kart racing scene that was incredibly long. alana de la garza is gorgeous but has a really fake italian accent. the movie looked and sounded very independent and low budget. there was one very cute moment which i'll just call the serenading scene but overall this one was a yawner. the laughs are very few and far between. the end surprise for "mr. fix it" is so ridiculous it left me more mad than anything else. might be worth a look if you can catch it for free or tv but don't waste your money buying or renting this movie.
