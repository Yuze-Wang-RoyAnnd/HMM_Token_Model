if you enjoy the original snl cast and shows then avoid this movie at all costs. when this first came out my friends and i waited in line for over an hour to get in to a sold out movie house. half way through the movie the theatre was 3/4 empty. we refused to leave thinking it would get better. when the movie ended we were the only ones left in the theatre. the movie lasted only one day in all theaters then vanished from sight. in interviews with "mr. mike" he refused to comment on this film. the film was an inside joke on the episodes of snl that came out right after the films release and closing in one day. we all tried to contact "mr. mike" by phone and mail to get a refund but were totally ignored.
