man, i really wanted to like these shows. i am starving for some good television and i applaud tnt for providing these "opportunites". but, sadly, i am in the minority i guess when it comes to the cinematic stephen king. as brilliant as king's writing is, the irony is that it simply doesn't translate well to the screen, big or small. with few exceptions (very few), the king experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read. many people would disagree with this, but i'm sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed king story is but a pale memory of the one they read. the reason is simple. the average king story takes place in the mind-scape of the characters in the story. he gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view. in short, king takes the reader places where you can't put a panavision camera. as an audience watching the filmed king, we're left with less than half the information than the reader has access to. it's not too far a stretch to claim that one becomes a character in a king story they read, whereas one is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed. for as long as king writes, hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor, without any regard to whether or not they should. i don't blame the filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive stephen king adaptation that works. the task is akin to turning lead into gold, or some arcane zen mastery. oh well, better luck next time.
