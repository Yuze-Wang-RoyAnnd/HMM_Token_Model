cliff robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a razzie-worthy performance here if there ever was one; it's as if director michael anderson kept yelling "dial it down; think zombie, only less lively" through his little bullhorn as he coached robertson's effort. the rest of the cast is barely better; jennifer agutter of logan's run fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role. if the quality of the acting was three times better; if some of the more gaping plot holes were filled; and if the pacing were given a shot of adrenaline, then this yawner might be brought up to a standard acceptable to the hallmark\lifetime tv channel crowd. as is, its rating is so inexplicably high one can't help thinking chronic insomniacs are using dominique to catch a little snoozing time. perhaps the late-night tv telemarketers are missing a major opportunity in not shilling it as such.
