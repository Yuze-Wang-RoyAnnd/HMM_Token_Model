a meteor hit's crater lake (hence our title), awakening a plesiosaur, who proceed's to snack on the hick population (in california, that hick capital of the world.) <br /><br />there's bad movies, and then there's "the crater lake monster", which somehow managed to escape mst3k. featuring grating acting, a decent stop-motion beast, and more, this is a dreadful piece of 1970's low budget exploitation/monster movie dreck.<br /><br />while the movie is guilty of many crimes, the biggest one is arnie and mitch, two obnoxious rednecks who serve as our comic relief. they bumble around, fight to stock "banjo music",ogle women, and act like pathetic excuses of humanity. the characters are so bad, they should count as a crime against humanity.
