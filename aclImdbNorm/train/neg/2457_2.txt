some people don't like the animation. personally, i think the animation was quite remarkable given when this movie was done. there are lots of older cartoons that i just love. my problems with this movie are not the animation, but basically the way it was constructed. the characters are all just... well, goofy. and for this movie, they shouldn't be. apparently, everyone in lotr has a limping problem (for starters.) just the way they acted in general annoyed me. my two sisters and i were laughing through most of this movie. i think that if many people had seen this before seeing the newer ones, they wouldn't have gone. i'm glad i rented this and didn't buy it. there are few movies that give me a headache. this was one of them. however, this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen, although it ranks up there. or down there, depending on your view.
