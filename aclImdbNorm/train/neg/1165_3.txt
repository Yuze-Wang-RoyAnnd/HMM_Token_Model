i'll keep this short, as i know i don't need to say much.<br /><br />"alive" is a strange little film that obviously appeals to some, but i found it to be shockingly bland from almost the very beginning. the film did very little to make any of the characters likable and the story at times became so convoluted that i completely lost interest. as i said, i know others enjoyed it, but i found kitamura's "alive" to be anything but - a lame, extremely boring drama disguised as a thought-provoking action sci-fi flick. i felt like i was suckered into watching this film, based by its intriguing premise and uber-exciting cover art.<br /><br />my suggestion? pass it up for kitamura's far more enjoyable freshman effort "versus" or his 2004 riot "godzilla: final wars".<br /><br />...and don't get me wrong, i'm always up for a good thinking man's film, but this certainly wasn't it. there was nary a moment that i actually cared about a single event taking place in this overly-preachy, dialogue-heavy movie.<br /><br />if you wanna talk about something... talk about boring.
