after i watched this movie, i came to imdb and read some of the reviews, which compared it to lost in translation lite. when i read that i immediately could see the reviewers point.<br /><br />this movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme. interestingly, the format of the movie is nearly identical, but the pacing is incredibly different. "10 items" rushes the viewer through the 1-day time line of the movie, whereas the better-planned "lost in..." seems to stretch out over a few long days.<br /><br />i'm sure some people will see this because it has morgan freeman, and will be disappointed. it seems his better roles now-a-days are supporting roles in big blockbusters, rather than leading roles in sub-$10mil limited release movies and indie films.
