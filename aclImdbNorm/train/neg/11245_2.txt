i entered the theater to sky captain in 2004 expecting a good film. nearly every review of this movie had been positive, the effects looked enticing, the previews convincing.<br /><br />needless to say, disappointment actually doesn't describe the feeling i got from this film. it was rage.<br /><br />beyond being boring and poorly written, the reason this film gets a 2 out of 10 stars is because everything in the film was stolen from another source. i understand the difference between an homage and stealing: this was stealing. more importantly, it seems that the filmmakers didn't steal to progress a point or move the plot along. they stole just to show that they could. there is literally no point to showing a clip of the wizard of oz in a theater at the beginning of the movie except to set up another scene (that i won't elaborate on) which steals from the same film. needless to say, every concept in the film was neither original nor even a spin on an old concept: it was literally just a rehash of something i had already seen, from pulp-era robots reminiscent of the old superman cartoons and the recent film "the iron giant", to the silent martial artist minion of the villain that has been used in countless films, most recognizable in recent years as darth maul in "star wars: the phantom menace".<br /><br />on the subject of the actual film, most of the performances were completely wooden. perhaps this is because the entire movie was done on a blue-screen, with computer imagery filling in everything save the actors. frankly, this is no excuse for poor acting. if a person was ever a child, they understand that a lack of visual reference is no excuse for not trying.<br /><br />finally, there is no humanity in this film. the protagonists are the only real human beings here. nearly all the antagonists are robots, and the number of friendly characters that are shown during the film can be counted on one hand. if robots are attacking the entire planet, shouldn't we expect to see masses of humanity running from them? the sub-par performance of the main characters prevents us from connecting to, really, anything here.<br /><br />the film wasn't the worst movie out there, which is why i didn't give it a 1. rather, the film was an example of all that is wrong with modern action films: the filmmakers tried to justify the movie with special effects, but without artistic vision or originality of any kind, it falls flat.
