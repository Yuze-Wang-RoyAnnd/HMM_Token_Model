it has very bad acting. bad story lines. bad characters. you should never see this show if you see it on. turn it off. or you be cringing for the next 30 minutes. it should have never been aired. it's not great. you should never see it. never ever ever. so now, if you ever wanna watch this show, please don't. turn to the the cw for smallville. or disney channel for hannah montana, wizards of waverly place, or nick for drake & josh, those are much better family shows. so believe me on this, i've watched it before. and it is honestly, and i say honestly, the worst show i've ever seen, and i've seen a lot of tv. so do me a favor, and never watch this show.
