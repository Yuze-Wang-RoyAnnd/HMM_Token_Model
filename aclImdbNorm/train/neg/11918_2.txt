this seemed to be a good movie, i thought it would be a good movie, and throughout the movie i was hoping it would be a meaningful use of my time, and yes, i have to admit that the acting talent of dimple kapadia and deepti naval where truly commendable, but despite the best effort this movie falls short of effectively conveying a meaningful message, which it seems is it seemed was what somnath sen is trying to do. the final point comes short and the ending seemed kind of unsatisfactory after all that happens; a bit like real life in that respect but movies unlike real life ends in about 2hrs and the ending should leave the audience satisfied, if indeed that was the director's intention. this falls short in that respect and that is what disappoints me the most.<br /><br />another aspect that concerned me was the national stereo-typing of the american characters - they all seem to be carved out of the same block. seems to me that most american characters in indian english movies are based upon how common indians themselves perceive americans to be like and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any american in the movie.<br /><br />these two aspects put together they make for a disappointing story.
