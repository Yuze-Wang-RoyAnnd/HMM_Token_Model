i guess i was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor, so i gave it a chance, from director gregor jordan (buffalo soldiers). basically ned kelly (heath ledger) is set up by the police, especially superintendent francis hare (geoffrey rush), he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family's names. that's really all i can say about the story, as i wasn't paying the fullest attention to be honest. also starring orlando bloom as joseph byrne, naomi watts as julia cook, laurence kinlan as dan kelly, philip barantini as steve hart, joel edgerton as aaron sherritt, kiri paramore as constable fitzpatrick, kerry condon as kate kelly, emily browning as grace kelly and rachel griffiths as susan scott. ledger makes a pretty good performance, for what it's worth, and the film does have it's eye-catching moments, particularly with a gun battle towards the end, but i can't say i enjoyed it as i didn't look at it all. okay!
