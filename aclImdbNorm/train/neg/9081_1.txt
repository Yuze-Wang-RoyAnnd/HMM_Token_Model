there's a lot of movies that have set release dates, only to get pulled from distribution due to a legal snafu of some kind, and then put in limbo for a long time. you can only wish a film as rotten as "slackers" remained in a coma for what it's worth, which is miniscule. release dates were continually shifted around for this truly awful movie that is so much a bleep on the radar like it deserves. the premise kicks off under the guise of ethan, a creepy nerd with a scary obsession for the campus bombshell angela. ethan devilishly enlists the aid of david and his friends who have been scamming the school for their entire run with blackmail to help win angela. i don't like to give spoilers out, but for a piece of crap like this i can make an exception. angela falls for david, ethan intentionally screws everything up, the good guys win. that's what happens in a nutshell for another tired retread of the teen gross out genre. gross humor is funny, it always has been dating back to the days of the immortal classic "animal house", to the likes of contemporaries like "there's something about mary" and "road trip" amongst dozens of others of which there are too many to mention. but when you use it as a plot point you can only get so far, case in point, ethan has an angela doll composed of her individual strands of hair of which he does god knows what with it. no one wants to take witness to watch ethan urinating in the shower while singing to himself. no one wants to watch a young man singing "she'll be coming around the mountain" with a sock on his penis. but nothing can prepare you for the full visual assault of seeing 50's bombshell mamie van doren bare her breasts at 71 years old. i don't know if it's the story's lack of coherence, which cuts to scenes that make absolutely no sense. director dewey nicks was a former fashion photographer, and after reviewing this film, you can only wish he'll go back to the profession. the worst thing you can do on any film, is to make it look like you're having fun, because you detract from your objectives, just like "slackers" does, by burying it's plot outline under a pile of gross out gags, pointless vignettes, and lack of construction. it's like a bunch of college students got drunk, took one's camcorder, and shot a bunch of random crap and compiled it together. if you want to see a teen gross out comedy that's actually good, then i suggest "american pie" and "animal house", or "road trip", just something that's entertaining, and not dreadfully bad like "slackers". coincidentally cameron diaz makes a cameo in this film, just as she did in another bad film such as "the sweetest thing" where the story treats gross humor like another plot, instead of a device much like this disaster.. if you pass by "slackers" at your local video store, just keep on walking, and let it end up at the bottom of the shelf like it deserves.
