i remember watching this film back in 86' when it first came out & what an awful film. the acting was atrocious the plot was so flimsy it would or is that should have blew away in a breath of wind. i think it put me to sleep on more than one occasion & i was not tired that i remember. please avoid at all costs better still have all your teeth taken out with no anaesthetic cos that would be more entertaining. it's just a pity i couldn't give it a zero or a negative score. i wish i had not wasted my money getting this one from the video shop all i can say was that the tape it was on was still brand new practically hardly surprising as the film was so poor. if i remember right i sat & watched it with a girl i really wanted to go out with & the fact she was sat next to me was still not enough to keep me awake thats how bad this film was.
