i remember this show being on the television when i was a kid back in the early 1990s, and there was this rage about kids with goofy leotards doing kung fu on one another and riding around in plastic dinosaurs. it was called power rangers. i remember that little kids would go around hitting each other and then the shirts and the stuff from the show was banned in many school districts all over the country because this show taught kids how to fight each other in solving their differences.<br /><br />i never really thought of this as a show, especially when better shows like the tick were playing on fox kids. most older teens always looked at power rangers in a ridiculous and scornful manner, and it's not hard to wonder why. the footage is ridiculous at best. the colored rangers costumes look like stuff you would work out in and the dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. then you get into the acting, and of course those really laughable haircuts. all the guys run around with earrings on, half of them are wearing 90's mullets, and they always wear the same clothes everyday, and then change into leotard wearing power rangers.<br /><br />the toys are especially ridiculous as well, and was the joke of many late night talk show hosts. and of course two of the worst movies ever made, and i do mean two of the worst movies ever made were based on this show with nearly every critic trashing both the films, and the shows it was based on.<br /><br />power rangers is nothing more than a bad television commericial for especially bad toy merchandising. as an adult, i don't look at it fondly, but rather as another embarrassment of 1990s kids shows, fashion and guys' earrings.
