i saw this movie when i was really little. it is, by far, one of the strangest movies i have ever seen. now, normally, i like weird movies, but this was just a bit too much.<br /><br />there's not much of a plot to the movie. if anything, it starts out like toy story, where toys come to life, and raggedy ann and andy go on an adventure to rescue their new friend, babette. from there, craziness ensues. there's the greedy, the looneys, a sea monster named gazooks, and a bunch of pirates singing show tunes, all of which just made the movie weirder. also, i can't help but feel that babette is annoying and a bit too whiny. she definitely didn't help the movie.<br /><br />now, even though i didn't like this movie, there were a few cute parts. i liked the camel's song. even though it was a song about being lonely, it had a friendly feel to it. then, there was sir leonard. while most of the looneys were just plain nuts, sir leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest. king koo koo was just a little dirtbag that made dr. evil look like a serious villain. also, there was raggedy andy's song, no girl's toy. it was definitely good song for little boys who wanted to act tough. but, honestly, even these things didn't make the movie any better. (but remember, this is just my perspective.) <br /><br />while i personally wouldn't recommend this movie, even i have to admit, it does have its charming moments. see it if you're interested, but only if you're in the mood for something "really" out of the ordinary.
