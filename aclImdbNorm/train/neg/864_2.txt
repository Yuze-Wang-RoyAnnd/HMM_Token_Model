even though there's a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from, this 'succubus' is often named as the best jess franco film. heck, even the legendary filmmaker fritz lang counts 'succubus' among his personal favorites. so, maybe it's me but i thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie. the opening is great, though, and shows janine reynaud performing an sm act on stage. it's all downhill from here, unfortunately. reynaud's character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance. franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations, beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score. this could have been his greatest film indeed, if it wasn't for the lame and uninteresting story. it's supposed to be psychedelic but i'd say sophomoric is a better term to describe what's shown here. half of the time, you don't have a clue what's going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to last ages. this most certainly isn't franco's best film according to me. i wouldn't even recommend it to die-hard exploitation fans. if you're looking for more superior jess franco film, try to get your hands on 'las vampiras', 'the awful dr. orloff' or 'female vampire'.
