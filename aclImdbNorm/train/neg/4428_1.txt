you loose 100 iq points just for tuning in. this show has to be awful, i refuse to tune in from just what i've seen in commercials. where did they dig this guy up at anyway? also, what do they intend to do next season? the secret is out. everyone already knows the set up? are they going to look for people who has been living under a rock to star in next season? where are they going to dig up more stupid women? no wonder america is a big joke to outsider's,look what you are watching!!
