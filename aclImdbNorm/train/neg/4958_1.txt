not only did they get the characters all wrong, not only do the voices suck, not only do the writers seriously need to get girlfriends, not only are the drawings really crude, but it seems like it was mainly created for ages 1-6. the only episode i've ever seen of this show that kept me watching, was "a mattter of family", because i liked the robin character. and sometimes i think it's just a general copy of batman the animated series. example: in btas, bruce is friends with harvey dent, yeah? over a two episode story, he transforms into the unlikely villain, twoface. in the "show" bruce is friends with that ethan guy, and over a two episode story, he transforms into the unlikely villain clayface. that was just a small example (that may not even be true), but in short, this is the worst attempt on a batman series. and that's saying something.
