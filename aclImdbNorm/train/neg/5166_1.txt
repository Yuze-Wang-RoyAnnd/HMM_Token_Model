terrible acting, lame plot, stupid story and just all around terrible movie sums up this piece of junk. it was excruciating to sit through. just awful. do not waste one penny on this. the movie theaters should feel bad about actually putting this movie out there for people to watch. this "horror" film was not even in the least bit scary, creepy or disturbing. it was in no way visually appealing. the acting was so terrible by all of the actors that any attempt to draw you into the movie through dialog are completely destroyed within moments of the actor/actress opening their mouth. plus the entire story, i don't know why someone would make a movie with this story again. do not waste your time or money. even if it's a free ticket don't waste one moment viewing this movie. you will feel dumber for watching it.
