fiction film (it lists as based on a story though it does have a "documented by" credit) about a group of scientists going into the wilds of canada to try and find a bigfoot.(they want to capture one and then attach a tracking device). its lots of scientific mumbo jumbo mixed in what is really a dull film of a bunch of people wandering around in the wilderness. there are some attempts at creating tension and scares, but to be perfectly honest there is nothing here worth seeing outside of some great looking shots of the wilds. this is a perfect definition of an exploitation film, it promises you so much, a look at bigfoot, but in reality it delivers very little. recommended for insomniacs only
