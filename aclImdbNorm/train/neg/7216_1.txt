i love westerns. i could watch them all day. "the good, the bad, and the ugly" is my all time favorite. i watched "silverado" for probably the 8th time just the other day because it was being featured on cmt. however, this movie, shiloh falls is without a doubt the worst western i have ever watched. the acting was terrible all around. they explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass looking thing. the only good part i can think of is the good-looking cantina girl. the very noticeable long pauses between the dialog seemed intentional just to make up time to make the movie of acceptable length. this movie wasn't even worth the new rental fee i paid at our local movie rental store. i felt like i was robbed and deserving of a rental refund if there was such a thing. only reason i finished it was because i hate to not see a movie through to the end. i turned it off half way through because it was so bad. to the director, please do a better job if you decide to make another. this is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to westerns.
