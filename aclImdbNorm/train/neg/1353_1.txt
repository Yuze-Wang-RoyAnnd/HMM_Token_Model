what is it? is a mish-mash of bizarre recurring motifs (snails, shirley temple, swastikas, and overtly racist music, among others) unfettered by any sort of narrative or plot or character development. the whole thing struck me as self-consciously "freak show," and i don't mean only the unusual casting decisions. it has the feel of a bad acid trip, far beyond any level of drug use one might attribute to hunter s. thompson or william s. burroughs. the only movie to which i can compare it is eraserhead (my second-least-favorite film of all time), which was by intent much more depressing, but i still found what is it? a total waste of my time. it's one thing to give me a peek into the inner workings of someone else's mind -- even someone else's chemically altered consciousness -- but quite another to just throw weird visuals at me purely for the sake of weirdness.
