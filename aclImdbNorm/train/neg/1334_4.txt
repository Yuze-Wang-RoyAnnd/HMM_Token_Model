so i finally saw the film "my left foot" last night after years of being told by my mother how amazing it is... the central performance of day-lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing, but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing less.<br /><br />the fatal misjudgement in my eyes was that in becoming obsessed with proving the normalcy of this man; the movie chose to show him as a complete and utter jerk. on the one hand i can see that this is a logical correlation; mankind always has the capacity to be objectionable, and disability shouldn't obscure that. i just wish that impartial onlookers wouldn't be so forgiving of aberrant behaviour and assume that circumstances automatically make it forgivable. they don't. acting out is normal, and so yes, disabled people act out - but they don't do it because they're disabled; they do it because they're being unreasonable. a physical impairment doesn't afford you the right to throw a hissy fit in public, just because someone you love turns you down.<br /><br />there are certain things it is unwise to do whether you are disabled or able-bodied. giving someone tacit permission to boot a football directly at your head for the sole purpose of fitting in is one of them. (admittedly, i did once save a penalty from the school's star striker with my face, but i already belonged by then. it wasn't for acceptance.) engaging in a bar brawl is another. revelling in the fact that your father only extends companionship to you after you've proved yourself capable of metaphorically jumping through physical hoops takes masochism a step too far. all of these things are stupid, and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your bravery doesn't make them any less foolhardy.<br /><br />so yes; just because you've overcome obstacles to achieve great things doesn't make you any less of a jerk... being a good person takes priority; setting an inspiring example for the disabled should appear way down the list.
