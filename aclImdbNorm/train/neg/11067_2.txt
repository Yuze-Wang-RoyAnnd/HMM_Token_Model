i'm a big fan of the true crime genre, but i couldn't sit through this putrid piece. it was almost as if dahmer was intended as erotica, down to the porn-flic soundtrack. there was no look at what made dahmer tick, no exploration of who his victims were. nothing but "look at how creepy this guy is." and i have to give the filmmakers this much -- their dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen.
