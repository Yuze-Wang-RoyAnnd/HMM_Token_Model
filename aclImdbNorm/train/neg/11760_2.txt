amen to magsel. there was a lot of confusion going on. first off, how do you know which movie you are purchasing? henry cele stars in every one of them. i bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries...what a letdown!! it would have been a comedy but for the young girl being raped. david hasselhoff (spelling?) is ok for popcorn tv but he was not believable in this film (where was his english accent?) and what's with the love story??? the movie was supposed to be about a young man's rise to military power - not the slave ship captain getting jiggly with the english maiden looking for her daddy...<br /><br />if i had paid more than $7 for this movie, i would have to call the police - because that would be a crime!
