i rented this horrible movie. the worst think i have ever seen. i believe a 1st grade class could have done a better job. the worse film i have ever seen and i have seen some bad ones. nothing scary except i paid 1.50 to rent it and that was 1.49 too much. the acting is horrible, the characters are worse and the film is just a piece of trash. the slauther house scenes are so low budget that it makes a b movied look like an oscar candidate. all i can say is if you wnat to waste a good evening and a little money go rent this horrible flick. i would rather watch killer clowns from outer space while sitting in a bucket of razors than sit through this flop again
