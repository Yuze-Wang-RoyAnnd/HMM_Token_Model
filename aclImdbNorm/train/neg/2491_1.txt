maiden voyage is just that. i'd like to say straight away that i watched 5mins of this before i just couldn't stand it anymore. as already stated in another comment, this film doesn't fall into the whole "so bad it's good" thing, it's just bad. the acting is awful, the sfx are poor, and the story is bland and stupid. even the extras suck, the "bag guy guards" and such appear to hold their weapons like water pistols.<br /><br />don't even bother watching this film, the only thing special about it is that, no matter how low your expectations are, you will still be disappointed.
