do not waste your time or your money on this movie. my roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called descent (the flick about some travelers who get trapped in a cave). so, we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldn't be that bad. it was. i can't believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public. it was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just can't make yourself. i honestly feel emotionally scarred. it went from being a semi-low budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy she's dating to an all out porno flick. and really not a good one. i went from hating the woman's rapist to almost feeling bad for him. almost. all in all, an awful movie that was definitely rated nc-17 for a reason. don't waste your money. and don't let your kids watch it.
