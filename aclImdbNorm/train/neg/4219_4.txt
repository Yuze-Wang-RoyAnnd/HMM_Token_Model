this is an amateur movie shot on video, not an "electrifying drama" as the dvd liner notes falsely boast. i have seen much better stuff from undergrad film students. the bulk of the story unfolds with an all-nite taxi ride around jakarta. this movie could have been made using a single video camera, but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was bounced together later. the editing is extremely rough. the final edit was probably done with two cameras, bouncing content back and forth, instead of with a proper editor. perhaps they did the editing in the taxi too? the english subtitles were written by someone not fluent in english, e.g., "where you go now?" to say the production quality is on a par with blair witch is generous. if you're not scared away yet, this film was an ambitious and creative endeavor, with lots of cool and funky images from all over jakarta.
