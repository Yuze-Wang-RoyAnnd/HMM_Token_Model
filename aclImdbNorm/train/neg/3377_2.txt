the broadway musical, "a chorus line" is arguably the best musical in theatre. it's about the experiences of people who live for dance; the joys they experience, and the sacrifices they make. each dancer is auditioning for parts in a broadway chorus line, yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite. <br /><br />the film version, though, captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show, and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical, as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance, whatsoever. <br /><br />the biggest mistake was made in giving the director's job to sir richard attenborough, whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for "gandhi." why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted place?<br /><br />which brings us to the next problem. "a chorus line" takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes. it's the least flashy of broadway musicals, and its simplicity was its glory. however, that doesn't translate well to film, and no one really thought that it would. for that reason, the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers, and should have left the theatre and audition process. the singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet, jazz or tap class. heck, they could have danced down broadway in their lively imaginations. yet, not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film, as attenborough's complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical direction.<br /><br />many scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director (michael douglas) whether he wants to hear them or not. douglas' character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear, and to whom he has no patience. <br /><br />while the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play, some heretical changes were made. the very beautiful "hello twelve, hello thirteen, hello love"--a smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescence--was removed and replaced with the dreadful, "surprise," a song so bad that it was nominated for an oscar. adding insult to injury, "surprise" simply retold the same story as "hello, love" but without the wit or pathos.<br /><br />there is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what not to do when transferring a broadway show to film. if you want to see a film version of this show, the next closest thing is bob fosse's brilliant "all that jazz." while fosse's daughter is in "a chorus line," he is the fosse who should have been involved, as director. he would have known what to do with this material, which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort.
