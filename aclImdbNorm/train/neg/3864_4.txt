just a regular jason lee movie, there were some parts of the movie that were funny. the undertone of the move is to live life on the edge i guess. these are the types of movies that i think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties. it was an all right movie. it is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention. i think that julia stiles and selma blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot. its just kind of a boy meets girl movie. this is that perfect movie they would show on comedy central. i am glad that i didn't see this movie in the theater, i would have been angry. but i guess that's why i didn't see it in the theater.
