oh dear, oh dear...<br /><br />for jm fans, this was the nail in the coffin as far as her a-list hollywood career was concerned. after solid turns in girl can't help it, wayward bus, the burglar and rock hunter it seemed jayne was well on the way to becoming one of tinsel town's hottest stars. however, an obsession with racy publicity and an appearance in this clunker relegated mansfield to the sidelines, namely cheap euro loan-outs until fox could drop her contract at the earliest opportunity.<br /><br />this movie really is a diabolical waste of everyone's time with the exception of suzy parker who is the only thing in this movie bad enough for the material. many people blame poor jayne and her grating performance for this film's poor returns at the box office and while she is a pain in this film, she can only do her best with the material. after all, cary hardly sets the screen on fire does he? after a handful of very good dramatic and comedy turns jayne takes 10 steps back in her pursuit as a serious actress by agreeing (simply for the sake of appearing with grant) to portray this squealing, idiotic menace. her character of alice is a complete cartoon bimbo and although she looks good enough to eat in a boiler suit, her every appearance in the film jangles your nerves. we all know jayne could do so much better than this dross and yet here she is parading around like a prize pudding. a real shame.<br /><br />steer clear of this so-called comedy. it's more depressing than funny.
