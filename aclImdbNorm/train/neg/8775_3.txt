loc could have been a very well made movie on how the kargil war was fought; it had the locations, the budget, and the skill to have been india's "saving private ryan" or "black hawk down". instead it come across as a bloated, 4 hour bore of trying to meld the war move with the masala movie. even the war scenes were terribly executed, using the same hill in all their battle scenes, and spending unnecessary time on casual talk. instead of trying to appeal to the indian public, a better movie would have been a to-the-book account of what happened at kargil (like "black hawk down") or even spending time on the militant point of view (like "tora, tora, tora"). even better, it could have used a competent director like ram gopal verma to write, direct and edit the film. until then, i'd like to see some one re-edit this film, with only the pertinent portions included; it would make the movie more watchable.
