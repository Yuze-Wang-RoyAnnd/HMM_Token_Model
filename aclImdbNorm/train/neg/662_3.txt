and rent a good horror movie. it's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn't realize every single thing he wrote was clich'ed and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like "scream" and "scary movie".<br /><br />in between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written. stupid "we're going to the prom" junk. i wanted to claw my ears off. honestly, "the hills" has better dialog.<br /><br />there really was no need to make this movie. leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking "her? really? guy is obsessed with her? really?" <br /><br />all the characters act in stupid ways, including the police. (cover the place in teams of 2! front and back! not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed.) <br /><br />the serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem. no resistance from victims (or doors). nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back (or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door). the people are like mentally disabled sheep.<br /><br />by the by, if you're a gore fan, you'll be disappointed too. all the killing is kept offscreen and is -- ahem -- tastefully done. (so boo hoo for you!) <br /><br />none of the killings is the least bit interesting. most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out.<br /><br />the only clich'e missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies. "oh kitty! you scared me! i thought you were the killer -- aiieeee!" <br /><br />and then at the end when it's time for the killer to die -- well, let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. snore.<br /><br />the audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout. it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough. don't encourage this kind of lazy film-making.<br /><br />(oh, and by the way -- no crowning of a prom king or queen. no tiara. no bucket of blood.) <br /><br />so save your money and rent "carrie" or "friday the 13th" or "halloween" or "scream" or "scary movie" (any of them) to get a good scare with some original twists.
