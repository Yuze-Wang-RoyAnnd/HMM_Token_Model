this really is the worst film i have ever seen. ever. period. i actually paid lb3.50 to watch this steaming turd of a movie. incredibly dull, poorly acted, dire script, often incoherent and too many scenes that don't seem to have any relevance to the overall film (like when heath ledger's priest partner get's nailed to a wall by a ghost...what was the point in that scene? answers on a postcard please...)<br /><br />i should have got a medal for sticking with this film for it's entire running time. i would rather take a strong kick to the groin than sit through this film again.<br /><br />this should be cast into imdb's bottom 100. hopefully my vote of 1/10 will help it on it's way.
