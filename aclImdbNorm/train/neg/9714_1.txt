i hate this programme: not only is the very concept ludicrous, but it tries so hard to be feasible (something that was left out of similar "i confess" ending programmes like, muder: she wrote).<br /><br />sigh. why is it that the writers can't ever be intelligent enough in this programme to come up with evidence that would stick and win a decision in court?<br /><br />come on: after x-amount of years of the cases being unsolved, why must every suspect, every episode *confess* (damn it!) to a murder which would otherwise go unsolved?<br /><br />i bet all police wish that criminals were this good sportsmen: "aw, shucks, officer, you're a bright one - i guess if you've uncovered enough to convince yourself i did it, i may as well admit to it and make it easier for you in court. what can i say? it's a fair cop."<br /><br />absolute dog s**t and an insult to those of us with with enough brains to even have heard of i.q.
