it's hard to believe that in 1997 david duchovny was at the top of his fame, with x-files, one of the best sci-fi series ever, being at the top of the glory. nine years later he is almost forgotten, and his tentatives to make it on the big screen failed miserably. i cannot even explain why, he is a fair actor, but probably his moment of fame cast him in a eternal role that takes big talent to break from.<br /><br />at the same time angelina jolie was much less known, and she was really lucky that a film like 'playing god' did not led her career into a dead-end. fortunately for her, 'the bone collector' and 'girl, interrupted' were waiting beyond the corner, and when lara croft came, her career was launched.<br /><br />there is not too much to be told about this film. it's the only big screen film of andy wilson, and there must be a reason. all is banal and most of what happens on the screen expected in this story of an ex-doctor who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar only to find himself working for the mob. the off-screen voice is especially bad, with a moralistic text that kills any shade of cinematographic experience from the film. you probably will not meet the film but in dvd rental stores, or on tv. try to look for something better.
