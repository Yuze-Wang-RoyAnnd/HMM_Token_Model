it is hard to describe this film and one wants to tried hard not to dismiss it too quickly because you have a feeling that this might just be the perfect film for some 12 years old girl...<br /><br />this film has a nice concept-the modern version of sleeping beauty with a twist. it has some rather dreamy shots and some nice sketches of the young boy relationship with his single working mother and his schoolmate... a nice start you might say, but then it got a bit greedy, very greedy, it tries to be a science fiction, a drama, a thriller, a possible romantic love story, fairy tale, a comedy and everything under the sun. the result just left the audience feeling rather inadequate. for example, the scene when the girl(played by risa goto) finally woken by his(yuki kohara) kiss, instead of being romantic, it try's to be scary in order to make us laugh afterwards... it is a cheap trick, because it ruin all the anticipation and emotion which it was trying to build for the better half of the film.<br /><br />i have not read the original story the film is base on (it is the well-known work by the comic-book artist osamu tezuka is famous with his intriguing and intricate stories) i wonder if all the problems exsist in the original story or did it occur in the adaption? it is rather illogical even for someone who is used to the "fussy logic" of those japanese comic-book. for instance, how did yuki kohara's character manage to get to the hospital in an instant(when its suppose to be a long bus-ride away)to run away risa goto's character in front of the tv cameras right after he saw her live interview on the television?<br /><br />there are also some scenes that is directly copied(very uncreative!) from other films and they all seem rather pointlessly annoying ie. the famous "the lion mouth has caugh my hand" scene from "the "roman holiday"<br /><br />the film tries to be everything but ends up being nothing... it fails to be a fairy tale and it did not have enough jokes to be a comedy... and strangely there are some scenes that even seem like an unintentional "ghost" movie. nevertheless, one should give it credit that it has managed to caputured some of the sentiment of the japanese teenager.<br /><br />it is by watching this film i have a feeling that there might be some films that should have come with a warning label that said "this film might only be suitable for person under the 18 of age", it would have definitly been on the poster of this film.<br /><br />
