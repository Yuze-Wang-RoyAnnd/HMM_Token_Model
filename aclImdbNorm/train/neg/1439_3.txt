i give 3 stars only for the beautiful pictures of africa. the rest was... well pretty boring. for about 50min we have the outline of the plot... in war of the worlds, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10min? then was real action! this is something like:"let's take a walk in the savanna and gasp at the beautiful sunsets!". and maybe deliver a message, like "don't kill elephants!". very ecological. i would have expected this out of a "new" steven segal movie, not from this... the leading actress makes me think about artificial sun-tan, dyed hair and too much foundation! and i didn't see one scene where her hair is messed up, or she sweats, or her clothes are dusty. she just doesn't look like a 19 century woman! and in the bar, where they seek up our hero, swayze makes a comment about the commander that he looks like dracula. hmmm, bram stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and it became famous in the next years. livingstone and other explorers went to central africa from 1840 to 1880. so unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900.. houston, we have a problem. :) swayze makes a nice impression.. as a nutshell - hard on the outside, but soft and cuddly on the inside. not that i would cuddle with a nut, but you get the point. he really manages to have that beaten puppy look on his face on several occasions. the movie stank. way too long and increasingly boring. don't watch it! don't buy it! it's a waste of your money!
