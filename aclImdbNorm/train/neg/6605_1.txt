designed only to annoy (or amuse) any self-respecting intelligent person. if the director's intention had been for the viewer to dislike the title character, then it would have been okay, but i know that there is no such thing as a hollywood director who'd make a critique of america's pro-marxist 60s movement, especially not a filmmaker from the 70s. there is so much idiotic dialog going on here, that sometimes i wondered if i wasn't actually watching a comedy. you wouldn't be at fault for thinking that this is a satire
