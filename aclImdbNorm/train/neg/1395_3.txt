you know you're in trouble when the film your watching has numerous alternate titles. generally it means that they tried and retried to hide the turkey in various markets. such a turkey is the brain machine which has seven different titles.<br /><br />its about some super secret government project that is suppose to be able to use a computer to read people but instead it drives people to kill each other or themselves, or something like that. its filled with b level tv actors sitting in paneled room with lawn chairs trying to act a script that makes almost no sense.<br /><br />its a turkey of the untastey kind. avoid it.
