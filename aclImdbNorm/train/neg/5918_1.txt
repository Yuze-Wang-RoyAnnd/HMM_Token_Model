carl panzram lived an amazing life and scribbled down his memoirs on scraps of paper for possibly the only person who ever did anything selfless for him. the book "panzram: a journal of murder" by thomas e. gaddis and james o. long, which came out the better part of a century after panzram's death, gives the historical context to a first-generation american's account of running away from home to go west and be a cowboy, getting caught, thrown in the boy's home, getting away repeatedly and thrown into prison over and over all the time getting tortured and sodomized. as panzram grew huge and strong, he sought to take revenge for the wrong done to him as he traveled to south america, europe and africa, and it didn't matter what people he raped, robbed, or murdered because we are all equally worthless.<br /><br />this film casts skinny james woods as the rough neck, mean-ass, son of a bitch carl panzram who in the film is a "drunk", overly-dramatic and emotional, and who never mentions the joy of sodomizing men and boys. the film neither elaborates on anything else particularly of note about this world traveler and career prisoner (like robbing former president taft or being released from the oregon prison as long as he gave his word to return). in short, i don't think carl would be too happy.
