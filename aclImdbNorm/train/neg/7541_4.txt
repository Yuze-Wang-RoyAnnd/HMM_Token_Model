great mystery, but the film goes down hill from there. the beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer, edward. he is traumatized over this and is seen popping pills. a mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend asking for help in finding her missing daughter. so ed travels to an island commune of mainly woman. they don't like outsiders. a lot of filler is with ed shown looking around town for the girl. that made the movie too long. it finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for edward.<br /><br />overall, not a well written story and too long. <br /><br />final verdict: i would skip this.
