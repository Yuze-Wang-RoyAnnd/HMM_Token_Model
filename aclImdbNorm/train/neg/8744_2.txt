i sort of accidentally ended up watching this movie. i'm still not sure if i regret it or not. i felt like i was watching the film made by that group of film school students that didn't quite make the cut. it plays up every hollywood clich'e imaginable, all the while flogging us with the 'corporations are the ultimate evil' message. subtlety this movie does not know. as far as that goes, it even manages to provide it's own spoilers.<br /><br />the story appears to be a computer nerd's fantasy world come true. the lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend, yet is a programming genius and apparent hacker (i think), among many other nerd-fantasy-come-true elements that you'll have to see for yourself.<br /><br />as well, i should've known it would be a z-movie when i saw ned bellamy... he tends to be a good tip-off.<br /><br />can't recommend this one, i'm afraid.
