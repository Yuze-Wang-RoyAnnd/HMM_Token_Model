i watched this movie at a sneak preview screening and i'm glad i didn't pay for it. this movie is just disgusting. its full of dick and fart jokes and takes no pride in the action sequences(such as the shootout in "little germany"). i made a little list of things i enjoyed in the movie.. and a lot of which i didn't agree of.<br /><br />1. dave foley's penis. 2. the fart jokes. 3. the poop jokes. 4. the dude was a pussy. 5. no gary coleman. 6. the talibans 7. again making fun of bush.. we get it he's an idiot.. move on. 8. the dude has blonde hair. 9. the plot. 10. the killing of minors 11. uwe boll was in it. 12. most of the cast were just outrages and out there.<br /><br />now the (few) good ones<br /><br />1. the dude uses a cat as a silencer like in the game. 2. lots of action. 3. crotchy made a return (and a cameo of the maker of postal) 4. uhm.. i didn't have to pay for it. 5. there are a few "what the ef" moments<br /><br />boll did it again. he made another crappy game into movie adaption. kudos to you, mr boll. 2/10
