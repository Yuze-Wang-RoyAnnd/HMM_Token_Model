ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours. when nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point i should have left. but, ever hopeful, i stayed. and left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time. acting was ok, but the story line is so transparent and weak. the script is about as lame as it could get, but again, stretching out the ten minute plot doesn't leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue.
