first of all, the big named actors must need the money... the surgical scenes were laughable.... and surely they must know that people who have a little knowledge of medicine would find this utterly absurd......anesthesiologists do not leave the room during a heart transplant....nor do they do the surgery in a tiny room devoid of instruments, heart lung equipment and sterile techniques... just a joke... couldn't concentrate on the story line because of all the stupid surgery scenes... no blood, no personnel and then the hero doc coming in and taking over... it is not a film for thinking adults....also the budget must have been limited... the street scenes were ok but who was the technical adviser....seems like it was directed by a total idiot.. save your money and wait until it comes out on dvd and don't rent it..
