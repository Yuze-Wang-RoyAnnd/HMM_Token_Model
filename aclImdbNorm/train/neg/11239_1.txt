pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain! the majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties. this is a horrible film in every way. imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher/comedy video. they would receive a d for this. college kids would receive an f or asked to leave the school. since this monstrosity was made by "professionals" i believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation. i enjoy watching bad movies like "plan 9 from outer space" but, this thing doesn't even fall into that category. the script, acting, sound, and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable. if you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with ed wood, blaxploitation, or 1970's horror films. after viewing this you get the feeling you've wasted an hour and a half of your life.
