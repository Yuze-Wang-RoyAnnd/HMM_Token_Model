lorne michaels once again proves that he has absolutely no business producing movies.<br /><br />you'd think that after such dismal flicks "superstar", "night at the roxbury", and "coneheads", he'd start to get the notion that maybe he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to movies (and many would argue that he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to television, as well). trying to make feature films out of skits that wore out their welcome the third time the were done on snl makes no sense.<br /><br />i personally like tim meadows, and think that he would be great in the right movie. it's a shame to see a talented guy wasted in a film that features unfunny after unfunny situation, and caps it all with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene. any laughs here will be because the movie is so bad, not because it's funny.<br /><br />oh well, at least we can be thankful that there are many other tired snl characters who will never have films done about them. it's just too bad that this one made it to the big screen.
