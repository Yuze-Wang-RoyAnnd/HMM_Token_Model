strange, almost all reviewers are highly positive about this movie. is it because it's from 1975 and has chamberlain and curtis in it and therefore forgive the by times very bad acting and childish ways of storytelling? <br /><br />maybe it's because some people get sentimental about this film because they have read the book? (i have not read the book, but i don't think that's a problem, film makers never presume that the viewers have read the book). <br /><br />or is it because i am subconsciously irritated about the fact that english-speaking actors try to behave as their french counterparts?
