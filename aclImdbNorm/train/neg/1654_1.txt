final score: 0 (out of 10)<br /><br />***possible scene specific spoilers (but who the hell cares)***<br /><br />yes, that's right: zero. and i rarely give 1's. even for the lamest of movies i look for things like music, cinematography, imagination, it's humor, even a good pace to be as objective about the score as possible. looking at it within it's own genera or subgenera. but there is absolutely nothing redeeming here. i can't remember another time a movie actually sent me pacing up and down the room when it was over. the only reason i made it to the end was because i couldn't seem to change the channel - i sat there simply aghast, watching to see what insultingly stupid bit it would come up with next. it was like watching a snake digest a rat. <br /><br />but let's have some fun and pull this baby apart, shall we. first of all, there is nothing technical about "whipped" that works. the visuals are all sitcom style. the cut scenes all just pictures of the street traffic going by at night over and over. the music and score, not only doesn't contribute anything to the movie - it's obnoxious. not to mention it doesn't have anything to contribute to anyway. the acting is as cardboard as it comes, all around and that goes for amanda peet (clearly the "star" that got this train wreck green-lighted) too. these guys, supposedly good friends, have no more chemistry or sense of purpose then if director peter m. cohen had rounded them up at a bus station minutes before shooting.<br /><br />on the creative side, there isn't an original bone in it's body. it has no imagination. it shows us nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before. the whole premise, or "twist", of this movie is based on male-bashing and the "idea" that an empowered women can play men "just as they get played". anybody, that thinks this is somehow a twist or is in any way original has obviously never turned on a tv before. twisted, shallow women are common. male-bashing is the norm. it's not stealing from anything specifically, it's worse: it's stealing from clich'es. i can't imagine a women making a movie that depicted other women based so much on stereotypes and with this sense of contempt. makes me want to go rent "in the company of men" - or better yet, "there's something about mary". this movie wants to be a "edgier" version of "there's something about mary" so bad you can see the sweat. <br /><br />the movie has no insights into women, men, dating, sex, or really anything. cohen is simply content to regurgitate myths he has been indoctrinated with from other sexist movies. on the other end, the movie doesn't work as a satire either, because even though it is ripe with exaggerations one could view as "satirical" it doesn't have that grounding in reality that satires need. it doesn't even know what it's satirizing. then there's the dialogue, which is little more then the characters screaming obscenities at each other. example: character 1: "f**k you" character 2: "oh yeah, well f**k you" (repeat)<br /><br />and the bottom line, the thing that could excuse all the other discretions: there are a lot of movies without plots, without good acting, with morally repulsive characters and obscenity laced dialogue that have been funny and thus, been good. "whipped" ain't funny. not for a second. it has no comic skills or timing. the situations are all completely phony, not based in any shred of truth, especially enough to wring laughs out of us. the characters all broadly drawn so they will seem relatable to the lowest of the lowest common denominator. just look at "the marquee scene", "cult classic" hair gel scene. one of our bumbling anti-heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees mena (peet)'s vibrator. for some reason light shines down on it as if he's found the holy grail. why cohen thinks men react this way to vibrators i do not know. while he rubs it on himself, he drops it in the toilet and then attempts to fish it out with his bare hands when, oh my, mena walks in on him. oh, my sides. <br /><br />but strangely enough, people actually like this movie. of course, people also like "friends" and reality dating shows so i shouldn't be surprised. all of this has a common thread however. "whipped" is big evidence to me that there is just a huge pocket of people in america that will laugh at any joke just because it is about sex. they will like any show or movie (or think they like it) just because it is about dating or relationships. it's lack of any quality has no baring on these people. just as people are indoctrinated to want whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they are also indoctrinated to blindly lap up anything dating/relationship related to sell them cheap, empty, effortless tv, movies and any number of products. <br /><br />the only consilation will be that when i die, because i saw this movie, i've got a credit to get 80 minutes of my life back. <br /><br />
