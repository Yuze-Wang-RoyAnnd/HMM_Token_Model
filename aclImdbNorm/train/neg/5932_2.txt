what kind of a documentary about a musician fails to include a single track by the artist himself?! unlike "ray" or countless other films about music artists, half the fun in the theater (or on the couch) is reliving the great songs themselves. here, all the tracks are covers put on by uninteresting characters, and these renditions fail to capture cohen's slow, jazzy style. more often, the covers are badly sung folk versions. yuck.<br /><br />the interviews are as much or more with other musicians and figures rather than with cohen himself. only rarely does the film feature cohen reading his own work (never singing)-- like letters, poems, etc. the movie really didn't capture much about the artist's life story, either, or about his development through the years. a huge disappointment for a big cohen fan.
