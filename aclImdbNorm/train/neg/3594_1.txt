this is not a horror film, but a boring sex movie. a very bad movie, to be avoided by any serious horror fan. no plot, awful acting and annoying music. if you only watch the trailer you will know enough... it's a shame that such thing is available on vhs or video while there are so many good movies unavailable. if you like vampires try the hammer productions or the italian gothic from mario bava and antonio margheriti instead. those are masterpieces if you compare this with this trash. rating = even "1" is too much! and believe me, i am not the only one with this opinion.
