the story by norman maclean is a masterwork; redford's film is a mediocrity. he adds banal scenes of the maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story. the cipher, brad pitt, trying to play the charismatic paul maclean, a genius outdoors, proves either risible or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful. also, tom skerritt as the father and craig sheffer as norman are strong and masculine, as men were once expected to be. none of the women make an impression in the film, which is regrettable, because maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.
