when i come on imdb boards,i'm always fed up when i see a "the worst movie ever" post.after watching this *movie*,i think that i am soon going to create my own post!!<br /><br />the opening titles:great,some kind of lame zoom on a gas oven (yeah,focus on the fire=explosions=great action packed movie!!)<br /><br />the actors:i think that ice t is a cool rapper,even a nice actor (sometimes, i insist,"sometimes") but the steven seagal like policeman he plays is...beyond the words. the rest of the cast is...well i don't know where those actors were hired but jeez!!i bet my dog would have been a much better actor than them!!<br /><br />the plot:hijacking.original isn't it??<br /><br />the action sequences:the first shot of the movie is an explosion.i told myself,well, cool!!at least there will be some nice pyrotechnics...i was dead wrong.the rest of the movie is mostly filled with low rent stock shots taken from the air force...<br /><br />the dialogs are hilarious,the music is pure crap,the end is happy( i mean i was happy at the end because the movie was over!!!)<br /><br />my cousin who was watching the movie was delighted( i'm 22, she's 42...well).i was on the verge of taking the movie and burn it.maybe next time i'm gonna watch it...(who said never???)
