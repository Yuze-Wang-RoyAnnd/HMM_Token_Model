very disappointing version of lorna doone. too many missing characters, no romantic scenes, changes in story line, too short, appeared low budget. hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you're not familiar with the novel. in some scenes it looks like lorna has a cold sore on her upper lip. i'm sure make-up did it's best to hide it. i guess they didn't want to halt filming until it healed up, pity. most likely why this movie lacked kissing scenes. only one disappointing kissing scene at the very end. lorna doone is a great epic tale and should be told true. the 2000 version of lorna doone is twice as long, more romantic, much more enjoyable and more true to the book.
