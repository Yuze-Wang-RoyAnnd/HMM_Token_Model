is this a stupid movie? you bet!! i could not find any moment in this film that was creepy or scary. stupid moments? plenty. stupid characters? you bet. bad effects? everywhere! rick baker may have gone and done bigger and better things, this is not one of them. oh well people gotta start somewhere. dr. ted nelson is cheesed. he is the most whiny doctor i've ever seen. he's got a melting man running amok out in ventura county somewhere, he's not overly happy that his wife is pregnant (probably cause she's 55 years old and weighs 90 lbs) and there's no crackers to be found anywhere. plus he's got the not-too-helpful general on his hinder wanting to find astronaut steve. and the local sheriff wants to know what's going on even though mr. nelson can't tell him anything. there also some random characters thrown in for good measure who encounter the melting man. eventually the movie ends and out monster gets scooped into a trash can to become compost. in the end it's just what you need for a great mst episode.
