there just isn't enough here. there a few funny spots, but not really enough. i was very disappointed because i love stupid movies. i was expecting this to be a hidden gem. it was not. it was a hidden turd.<br /><br />the whole time i was watching it i was thinking, "geez, i could do better than that and i'm a moron". don't believe the few good reviews. i was suckered in by them. at no point did i laugh at loud. maybe this was funny or cutting edge in 1987 but man, it fell flat today. this movie had promise, it just didn't deliver on it. maybe if they rewrote it a few more times. i cant fault the actors. they weren't the best, but they just didn't have much with which to work. this movie failed because of threadbare writing. sorely disappointed.
