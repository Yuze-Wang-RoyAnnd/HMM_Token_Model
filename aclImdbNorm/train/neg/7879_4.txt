first off, i have to say that i loved the book animal farm. i read it with my 9th grade class, and it was great. we also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial. the movie was so disappointing to me. the movie cuts out some characters, and misses a lot of the main points of the book. it skips around a lot, and doesn't explain anything in detail. if someone was watching this movie without having first read the book, they would be confused. the most disappointing thing in this movie to me, was the ending. the ending in the book was the most powerful, and in the movie, they changed it! it was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of "melting" together, but instead, the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs. to sum up, i don't think that this movie captured the real meaning that orwell portrayed in his book.
