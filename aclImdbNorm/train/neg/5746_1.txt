about the worst movie in distribution right now! i love zombie movies and saw this in the used rack so i thought why not? oh my god a shame to zombie movies and fans to the genre! whoever made this movie needs to put away your camcorder and go to film school! there are so many gore hounds out there who have put time and effort into their films and they have something that this film doesn't dignity. i know it what it takes to make films and i'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent in making meat market but none of that money and time went in to making it good. you need actors, a script, a real camera, invest in some books on how to make independent films. i don't know how you got a dvd release but whoever did that is either a really good friend or banging their head on the wall. in gore films it is quality not quantity, the effects are weak! i was so angry that this is actually in stores and that i couldn't get my money back. please if you have seen this film write here and put an end to shlock. i know i'm being very harsh, i only had 10 lines so i'm trying to get to the point.
