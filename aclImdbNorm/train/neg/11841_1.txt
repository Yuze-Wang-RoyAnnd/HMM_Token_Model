what happened to peter bogdanovich? once a brilliant director, a trail blazer... is now scraping the very bottom... is this the same man who directed "the last picture show"? here, he takes a somewhat interesting (albeit farfetched) premise, and turns it into bubble gum that loses flavor the moment you take the first bite... dunst is not bad, but izzard is miscast as chaplin, and all the other actors seem to have been cast for their "looks", and not because they were right for the part. too bad. i'll go rent "paper moon" again.
