if you are wondering where many of the conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the the un, israel, and international affairs come from, look no further.<br /><br />this isn't a supernatural hollywood film loosely based on some biblical passage. instead, this movie was made by a company (cloud ten pictures) with a political and religious agenda. as a movie, the end result at times more looks like clips out of a televangelism program (complete with family prayers and light breaking through church windows while harps are playing).<br /><br />for mainstream viewers, it may be hard to believe, but many people believe in this stuff literally, as presented in the movie. and that, perhaps, makes the movie important. you probably won't find a more concise exposition of the bizarre views of a significant number of your fellow citizens. so, if you view it, view it as a social/cultural document. if you are at all media savvy, you don't need to be warned about the unsubtle attempts at propaganda and manipulation in the movie.
