the movie was "ok". not bad, not good, just ok. if there was anything else in the theater this would be skipped by far. sadly, fast and furious 2 also stunk, but i'd rather see this than ff2. :) if you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk, this will be a "cute" movie for you. personally, i'd wait for hbo or blockbuster.
