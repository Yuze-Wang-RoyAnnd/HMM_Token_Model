just saw this movie, and what a waste of time. the movie was predictable and slow. it's basically the mormon bad news bears that play church sanctioned basketball. rather than watching this movie, i should have had a root canal. the cameo performances were obviously driven by sponsorship / funding. this movie had potential due to the outrageous behavior that is exhibited by mormons when they play church sanctioned basketball, however because it's rated pg, the true nature of the spectacle could not be transfered to film. the acting is horrible with the exception of clint howard and fred willard. thurl bailey's appearance in the film was completely unnecessary.
