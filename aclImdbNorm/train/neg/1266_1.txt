if there is a hell, it contains a screening room in which grand canyon is playing over and over again on an eternal loop. one would hope that the presence of so many marvelous actors - danny glover, alfre woodard, kevin kline, mary louise parker - would help make up for the presences of mary mcdonnell (whose penance is to watch her own films for all eternity)... but, no. apparently they injected those other actors with a serum made from mcdonnell. the entire affair is pretentious, overblown, insulting (if you are deaf or know anyone who is, be prepared for your blood to boil at the ludicrous tdd scene). grand canyon is filled with obnoxious, self-involved people, but never gives us a reason to like/understand/sympathize with or even tolerate them. with rare exception, they are insufferable losers that the gene pool would be better off without. there's no plot to speak of, no character development (these people won't ever develop), no break-out performance and the most arch writing you'll ever encounter in a film. the best thing about grand canyon? its title. this is one large hole of a movie.
