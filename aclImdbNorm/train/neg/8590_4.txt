ludicrous. angelic 9-year-old annakin turns into whiny brat 19-year-old annakin, who somehow seems appealing to amidala, 5 years his senior. now 22-year-old jedi warrior hero annakin has a couple of bad dreams, and so takes to slaughtering children, his friends, and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a) his precious wife might really die, and b) only he can prevent this. ludicrosity squared.<br /><br />i think the people who like this movie are not paying attention. the story is ridiculous. the characters are unbelievable (literally, not the perverted sense of "fantastic", "wonderful", etc.).<br /><br />obi-wan kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series, but in the climax, he hacks off annakin's legs, lets him burn in the lava, and leaves him to suffer. doesn't anyone think that's a little out of character? not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living, as it turns out.<br /><br />i was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations. none of that here. the story could have been written by a 10 year old.<br /><br />oh yeah, the cgi is pretty cool.
