from the moment the film begins, already there is a discrepancy. as this film takes place on the borders of normandy and the middle east, and is also an international film, one would expect proper accents portrayed. this is not done as the majority of the cast sound american. also, i find the acting to be rehearsed at best, the story line a little difficult to follow from the beginning. who is who? otherwise the film is very accurate in costume and scenery. if you want to see a movie to get a feel of what it was like in the past (albeit the lack of accents) then this movie is worth a rent. if you're looking for a movie as epic as kingdom of heaven, then look elsewhere.
