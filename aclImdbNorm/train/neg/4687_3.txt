spoilers (although none that aren't revealed in the first two minutes of the movie)<br /><br />robin williams is actually quite good in this as the friendly, lonely, emotionally stunted loser sy. he makes a very human, even sympathetic psycho, and really disappears into the character--no small feat for such a recognizable performer. <br /><br />too bad the rest of the movie is such a waste. the supporting performances (and performers) wouldn't look out of place in a soft-core porno (it doesn't help that every character but sy is made of 100% cardboard). at times, the director actually seems to be trying to frustrate suspense: we know from the very first moments a) that sy is a complete whack-job, b) that he survives, and c) that he gets nabbed by the cops at the end. so all we're left to ponder is the hows and the whys, and the answers provided aren't all that interesting.<br /><br />the plot is plodding and contrived, and features some nonsensical moments (for instance, the husband berates his wife for her expensive tastes, even though she seems to spend all her free time at the local discount superstore). about two thirds of the way through, sy does something so irredeemably stupid that it makes one wonder how much he actually cares about his grand revenge scheme. and the final clich'ed explanation of his psychosis, right out of `peeping tom,' is a terrible copout.<br /><br />the dialogue is of the absolute worst sort. it's not overwritten, or awkward, or unbelievable, or bad in any other way that could be considered fun, even for bad-movie lovers. instead, every line is purely, hideously functional--it's as if the director handed a plot outline to a newspaper copywriter and said, `hey, i need a workable script on this--in an hour.' it made me want to scream, honestly.<br /><br />this movie seems to be a throwback to the suburban beware-the-help thrillers of the eighties and nineties (`the hand that rocks the cradle,' e.g.), and while it's certainly unpleasant, it's never really scary. sy's fetishism occasionally makes you feel uncomfortable, but on its own that's not enough to make the film work. in the end, lack of craftsmanship from everyone involved, except robin williams, sinks this one. 3 out of 10.
