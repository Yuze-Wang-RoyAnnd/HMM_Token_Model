okay i saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie. first off the movie is so posed and not real, they are all acting. they can't sing. they are way too full of themselves. its awful. yes kids like 8 to 10 might enjoy but its really stupid. i mean they say their manager is a kid. and there record label is fake. its stupid. don't see it.<br /><br />as for the set up and directing, not so bad. it is a cute documentary but it documents a stupid thing. <br /><br />only see this if you don't really like good music. also, it's very corny. it's not even tasteful. i hate to be so mean...but this really is a piece of junk.
