<br /><br />worst. movie. ever.<br /><br />what was the purpose of filming this remake (aside from turning it into a 90-minute informercial for the movie's soundtrack)? zombies that *run*??? i guess the director never watched the original "dead" films, which show stiff-limbed (from rigor mortis) creatures shuffling/shambling toward their living prey.<br /><br />and how, exactly, did the survivors know which boat in the marina belonged to the recently departed steve?<br /><br />1/10
