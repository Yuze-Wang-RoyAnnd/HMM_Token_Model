i don't think this movie was rated correctly. i took my copy and blacked out the pg rating and wrote down r. i would not recommend this for anyone under 17 or 18, whatever the r limit is.<br /><br />why? it contains a scene in the jungle with several topless indian women. i don't know about you, but that's not something for little children to be watching. true, it might be the traditional "clothing style" of the african (?) indians, but... i think partial nudity should give a movie an r rating.<br /><br />i haven't seen the movie recently, but i guess otherwise, it was alright.
