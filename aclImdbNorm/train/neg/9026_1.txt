this has to be some of the worst direction i've seen. the close-up can be a very powerful shot, but when every scene consists of nothing but close-ups, it loses all its impact. <br /><br />tony scott has some very beautiful scenery to work with, the backdrops of mexico, the cantinas, the beautiful estate where anthony quinn lives, and the dusty towns costner rolls through on his journey for revenge. unfortunately we only catch quick glimpses of these places before the camera cuts to a picture of a big, giant head. even the transition scenes where costner is driving alone across mexico quickly cut to a close-up. <br /><br />the score is over-dramatic and intrusive, dictating every emotion we should feel. the story itself should have been handled much better. among other things, too many people pop up out of nowhere to help costner along - it's just bad writing. <br /><br />it's a typical thriller storyline, but many others have taken the same premise and done outstanding things with it. costner's no way out had a somewhat similar storyline, but it was a much better movie. <br /><br />the ending was completely anticlimactic and suffered from the most melodramatic scoring of the film. this movie was never going to be great, but if we saw more of mexico and less of giant heads this film might have been watchable.
