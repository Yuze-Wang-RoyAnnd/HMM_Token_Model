shintar^o katsu gained tons of fame playing the wonderful character, zatoichi. the zatoichi films had a weird and unbelievable concept--a blind guy is the greatest swordsman in japan and spends each movie righting wrongs and exacting retribution on evil doers. he's a heck of a nice guy and the films are exciting and addictive (i've actually seen every movie). it is because of this i saw this final installment of the hanzo the razor series, as i assumed it would be very similar....and boy was i wrong! it turns out that the hanzo films are extremely sexual in nature and they also promote the rape of "women who deserve it". you see, hanzo is a policeman from the meiji period and he regularly takes evil women into custody and interrogates them by violently raping them with his "penis of steel". how he made his member so strong is something you have to see to believe, but it certainly is not for the squeamish.<br /><br />overall, i just can't recommend anyone sees these violent and misogynistic films. however, from looking at the other reviews, i can see that they are still very popular...and that is pretty scary. despite some decent acting and amazing fight scenes, the films just are like brain pollution--and i'd hate to imagine how the films might have contributed to violence towards women.
