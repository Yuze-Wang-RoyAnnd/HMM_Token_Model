there's nothing i hate more than self-congratulating pretentiousness. kevin smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails for inspiring every white middle-class whiner to make a movie about why they can't get laid. i don't really mind inexperience and low-budget productions but when the writing is this obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes. the money put into this could've gone to a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like john gulager. if you watch project greenlight you'll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system. anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that doesn't manage to say anything really, at all. when will we be saved from the smithonites and whedonettes of the world? the revolution can't come soon enough. go watch a real first time effort by buying desperado or searching out friends with benefits. thank you and good day.
