i was true to my regard for mr. glover and ms. goldberg. i watched the entire film with my family and some friends. i have no idea what the movie was about. after much discussion, we all agreed that this was not one of their better efforts.<br /><br />it doesn't hang together very well. it is too choppy, and there is little comedy. i am disappointed. it could have been much better.<br /><br />i waited months to see this film based on the liner notes.<br /><br />don't waste your money unless you are a completist and just want to see all of mr. glover's and ms. goldberg's films.<br /><br />it was a poor way to spend an evening.
