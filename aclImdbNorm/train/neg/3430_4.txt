a bloody maniac with cannibalistic tendencies rapes a woman. he's been shot by two policemen and then he is risen from the grave because of some sort of satanic ceremonial rite preformed by an evil heresy. the hunting of women continues by this zombie-demon. the sacrificed baby returns from the grave and wants the maniac dead again, but only with the help of the police this will come true...<br /><br />a bloody 65-minute mess...horny zombies, doll-babies, s&m, corrupted and twisted policemen, repented heretics who seek refuge in front of jesus christ and three text-screens at the end of the film explaining us what finally happened to the policeman who survived (yes, we ought to know!)... two decent disemboweling shots can't save the situation. i've seen worst horror-flicks, but this one was pretty bad too. recommended only for the die-very-hard fans of the genre.
