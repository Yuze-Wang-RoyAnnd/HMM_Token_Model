i remember going to see the movie in the summer of '78 with my parents, and being pretty into it at the time. of course, i was seven at the time.<br /><br />right before the jackson movies came out, my wife and i rented this movie since she had never seen it and i was feeling nostalgic.<br /><br />ralph bakshi ran out of money about mid-way through the animation process for this movie, and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production. since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping, the animation technique for people on a budget, this is saying something. much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word. there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen, with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them.<br /><br />because of budget constraints, the movie -- already a compression of "the fellowship of the rings" and part of "the two towers" -- was pared down even more. what you get is sort of like a film-strip version of the cliff notes of the books.<br /><br />its not all bad, though, the animation brings a warmth to it, that i found lacking in the jackson movies. its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding.<br /><br />this movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came. several years later, a half-hearted half-hour long tv special was aired, which was meant to wrap things up. all i will say about that is that it was a musical.
