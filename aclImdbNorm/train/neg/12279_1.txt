although this seems to be quite an old show (2002), i watched my first ever episode last night and i have to say it has to be the worst show . . . ever.<br /><br />i am not one for placing comments but i was so shocked that a show could exist that blatantly tries to pander to, and i am only assuming that this was their target audience, children under 12 years old or people with a less than average iq.<br /><br />the episode i was subjected to last night contained so many disjointed story lines, tried to include every possible plot summary imaginable and all the while trying to preach about friendship, family, religion and politics !!!.<br /><br />basic story that they covered in the episode: frat house hazing gone wrong wrong with too much alcohol - death turns out to be senators son who wants fbi to investigate. death is actually murder by peanut allergy senator thinks it could be his sworn enemy and childhood best friend who did this because senator was taking money for his votes for legislation but eventually got a conscience and said 'no' to mean mulit millionaire. everybody a suspect but all have the usual alibi (ex-girlfriend student shagging a married teacher so had to lie, disgruntled student who was reported by victim actually had life changing experience, senators enemy did not pay desperate student to kill sworn enemies son, he gives money freely to lots of broke students). all the while the heroine of this dribble has her niece staying who is 'at that age' and has a crush on a boy, who she eventually gets the courage to talk to with the assistance of her aunty, but only to dump him because the 'in' girls says he is not good enough and so to keep in with them she dumps him. don't worry, she gets back with boy after she learns the truth about life and the 'in' girls drop her, aunty also explains that god is the only one who truly she can rely on (i was almost sick at this point).<br /><br />this 'drama' gets even better when sue and her fbi team find out who the killer is . . . your gonna laugh at this, i sure did . . . <br /><br />it is one of the frat boys who only a year ago found out he was adopted and that his real dad is an international terrorist and he is trying to impressive real daddy by killing boy and planting bomb at funeral . . . . . . . <br /><br />the characters are cardboard the acting is cardboard the continuity is cardboard the story is cardboard anybody who says that they love this show has cardboard for a brain<br /><br />why the writers of this show have tried to pack in every eventuality into the one show means that they obviously have no faith in the character development or actors capability to carry off a simple plot line. watching this show is like watching 'last action hero' with arnie killing 5'000 people with a tooth pick, except arnie is a better actor (wow, never thought there would be a day that i would say that !!)<br /><br />in the words of the simpsons beloved character 'comic book guy' . . . . <br /><br />worst tv show . . . . . ever.
