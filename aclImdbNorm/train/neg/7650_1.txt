i know i'm in the minority, but...<br /><br />uwe boll is about as talented as a frog. not even a toad; just a frog. he's reminiscent of about a hundred other no-talent hacks who churn out one useless crap-fest after another. <br /><br />this movie? is a crap-fest. slater's talent is only minimally utilized leading one to believe he's got other things (like his failed relationship) on his mind. reid performs as if she has either forgotten her acting lessons, been severely hit on the head and made to forget her acting lessons, or has one of the worst directors in the history of film. i'm voting on the third choice, myself, although the other two are always possible. <br /><br />uwe boll has never done a single thing from which i've derived even the slightest pleasure. frankly, i'm satisfied that he made this stinker. i was concerned with bloodrayne competing with "underworld: evolution" for ticket sales. now, i'm confident that len wiseman has nothing, and i mean nothing, to worry about.<br /><br />this rates a 1.0/10 rating for this messy, convoluted crap-fest, from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
