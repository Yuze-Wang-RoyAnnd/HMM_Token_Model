some moron who read or saw some reference to angels coming to earth, decided to disregard what he'd heard about the offspring of humans and angels being larger than normal humans. reinventing them as mythical giants that were 40 feet tall, is beyond ridiculous. there was some historical references to housing and furniture in parts of the world, that were much larger than would be needed for standard humans. these were supposedly built on a scale that would lend itself to a 10 to 14 foot human, somewhat supporting the "david and goliath" tale from the bible. there is no mention in any historical references to buildings or artifacts that would support the idea of a 40 foot tall being. if i was rating this movie on my own scale, it would have been a negative value instead of a one...
