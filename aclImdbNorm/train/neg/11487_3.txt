the best laurel and hardy shorts are filled to the brim with mishaps, accidents and destruction, mostly caused by stan, but with ollie receiving the bulk (!) of the punishment-- see the great 'the music box' (1933) or 'towed in a hole' (1932) as some some classic examples.<br /><br />here, however, for some reason (is it because it was based on a sketch by stan's father?) the boys play it 'straight' in a 'comedy' built around jokes and supposedly funny situations. it doesn't come off. it's merely another third-rate tedious 30s comedy, heightened only by the personalities of stan and ollie who never really display any of their trademarked gestures (ollie's finger wiggling, stan's blank stares, etc.) or comic abilities.<br /><br />the film begins with them running from the police. since we never see or know why, it's hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught, and thus hiding in colonel buckshot's mansion. the premise for the 'humor', ollie passing himself off as the colonel and stan passing himself off as both the butler and the maid are never very engaging. they are not playing 'stan and ollie' in this film. their parts could have been played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be just as poor.<br /><br />stan could mime and make whatever he would do funny, but he doesn't get the chance to do any of that here. he's constrained by uttering too much dialog to 'move' the plot, but none of it rises much above the silly. we are treated to endless third rate comedy chestnuts such as the running gag of not correctly pronouncing lord plumtree's name, the "call me a cab! okay you're a cab!" joke, cops losing their clothes and being seen in long johns, and a non-sequiter ending of stan and ollie as the two parts in a painfully obvious horse costume as they make their escape on a bicycle for two, and james finlayson is still doing his silent-era full body takes and keystone kop jumping jacks.<br /><br />stan and ollie do much better in a situation comedy in 'sons of the desert'(1933) where we get to see them do what we love about them -- be themselves. in fact, 1932-34 seem to be their best years.<br /><br />since this film does not play to any of their strengths, why bother with it? i have to give it a 3.
