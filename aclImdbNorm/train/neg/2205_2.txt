this type of plot really does have a lot of potential, but it was butchered here. honestly, i sensed the cheese element in the beginning, but i thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing. whoa, i was wrong! so mad scientist makes a monster, wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them, but of course they escape. after that, it's really bad. i should've counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage, but i most likely would have lost count.<br /><br />pan down to the blood-dripping-from-severed-leg to show us how the shark-man finds the folks. i hate being spoon-fed every aspect of a horror film.<br /><br />oh, and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark-man and trudging around a jungle-esqe island, there's nothing more cheerful than a middle-aged man reciting shakespeare...<br /><br />this is one where you'll find yourself rooting for the monster... if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick.
