the only reason i saw "shakedown" was that it has erika eleniak in it. she's sexy as always, but she plays second fiddle to leading man wolf larson. it's a pity, because she has more action capabilities than she's allowed to show here. the film largely consists of endless shootouts that quickly become monotonous - especially when most of the time you are seeing the bad guys armed with machine guns constantly missing larson and him armed only with a revolver (that never runs out of bullets) taking them all out rather easily. the earthquake effects are decent, but there is also a lot of blurry motion and poor cgi explosions. as the psychotic "spiritual leader", ron perlman tries, but the pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo he has to spout is simply boring. eleniak, perlman or larson (assuming he has any) completists might want to give this one a look, for others it is barely worth a rental.
