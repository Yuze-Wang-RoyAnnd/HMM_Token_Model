okay... it seems like so far, only the barman fans have commented on this film - time for a counterpoint. beware, this writeup is *long*.<br /><br />for those not in the knowing (mostly the non-belgians) : tom barman, director of this film, is the frontman of deus, one of the better known rock bands of the late 90's here in belgium. basically, they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale. then, egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart, with barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the deus-monicker. the way it always happens in such cases, the post-breakdown deus was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original. they tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album "the ideal crash" in 1999, presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting. they didn't quite make it. however, egos were still pretty big it seems : big enough for barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies.<br /><br />more often than not this sort of thing is a very big mistake, and this film does not make the exception. and barman clearly went for *art* on this one, another very big mistake. for one thing, he's a musician, not a movie director. for another, deus at it's best made fun and provoking music, but never anything close to what i would consider *art*. it shows.<br /><br />so, what's this movie about? basically, it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people, doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in antwerp, as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting. the characters are shallow, the plot totally pointless and the film just doesn't have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings. humor? the whole film made me smile (slightly) about 3 times, and actually managed to provoke a single 5-second laugh (not quite loud). mood? the film just doesn't seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all. mystery? well, (*minor spoiler*)the idea of the "wind-man", inspiring the name of the film, is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza - not very, and has been done a thousand times before (anyone remember johny destiny - one of tarantino's worst appearances on film to date)(*end minor spoiler*). and well, its *artistic*, so don't expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous. in other words, except for the few smiles, it bored me out of my shorts.<br /><br />so what remains? well, the soundtrack is pretty good, though it suffers from some of the same problems that other ost's have shown lately : first, it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the cd. second, it gives the impression that barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs, which simply doesn't work. in the end, it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs. and sadly, it's barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention, though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as i'm concerned. all in all, it just stands to show that barman knows more about music than movies. camera work is okay as well, though not anything that would make you scream out with joy.<br /><br />the only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sight-seeing factor. since i originate from antwerp, it was fun to play a kind of "guess-the-location" game. i would hardly consider this as a quality though.<br /><br />all in all, another chance lost for flemmish film. i keep on noticing that lately, the best belgian movies have been coming from the french part of the country. this is mostly because at least, they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional (the brothers daerden come to mind). maybe the flemmish art-house filmmakers should try that too.
