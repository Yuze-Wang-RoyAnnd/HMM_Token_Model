as we all know hollywood enjoys changing historical events around for our enjoyment, and 44 minutes is one of those hollywoodized movies. for example the bank robbers never did go back in the bank when they started shooting at the lapd yet in the movie we see them go back inside twice! another example is the number of lapd officers who were shot near the end of the movie, this is far from the truth! but of course hollywood must have a good bloody ending so they *add* some more blood and guts. some events were combined and many of the lead actors played several different people but this is what hollywood has always done so why complain? i guess the only sad part is that i have watched some one hour documentaries about the north hollywood shootout on tlc that were far better then this!
