the worst kind of film. basically, the us declaration of independence was replaced with a plasma screen and this fooled the museum's security for several days. eh?<br /><br />the plasma screen that would theoretically run for less than 2 seconds off that watch battery, assuming it had a low enough internal resistance to deliver the required current, which it wouldn't.<br /><br />it would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter, but that system wouldn't fit into the case. sorry to be anal, but this isn't even close to being plausible. the rest of the film wasn't a great deal better and i'm left wondering why the budget couldn't have been donated to charity or me.
