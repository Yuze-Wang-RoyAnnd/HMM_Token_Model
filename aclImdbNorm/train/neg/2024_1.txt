trying to cash in on the success of deal or no deal and 1 versus 100 comes this lame excuse for entertainment - show me the money, in which 12 sexy 'dancers' shimmy out in shiny red hooker attire. a contestant is given the beginning of a phrase, such as "which team lost . . ." with three choices, a, b, or c, each which completes the phrase. the contestant has three chances to give an answer to one of these 3 choices. the host - william shatner, at his obnoxious smarmiest - asks the contestant if he wants to "lock into the answer" and when the contestant says yes, he picks a 'dancer', to whom he yells "show me the money!" she opens a scroll that has an amount, and if his answer was right, he adds that amount to his winnings; if he was wrong, the amount is subtracted. (so theoretically, it is possible for a contestant on this dreary debacle to actually wind up owing shatner money.) there is also a "killer card" and if the contestant picks the girl who has that vile scroll, but he has answered properly, nothing happens. if he's answered wrong, the game goes into sudden death and has to answer another question. if he gets that one wrong, he leaves with nothing.<br /><br />before going to commercials, shatner yells, "let's dance" and shatner, the contestant and the 12 dancers shake booty. at the end of the show, shatner asks the ladies for "a last dance" and they all shake it some more.<br /><br />i give this show 6 episodes at the very most, at which time hopefully this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown the door. (it could've been worse - they could've somehow bribed cuba gooding jr to be the host, although i bet he's a better dancer than 'shat,' as they call him these days.)<br /><br />7/08: guess what - i was wrong! it lasted for only 5 episodes. there is hope for the world.
