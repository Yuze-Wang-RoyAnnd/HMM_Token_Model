film makeovers of old tv shows seems to be the norm in hollywood these days, but this disrespectful, toilet humor, do-you-kiss-your-mother-with-that-mouth foul language, rip-off is a blatant middle finger to all dukes of hazzard fans both north and south of the mason-dixon line. from the opening sequence of bo and luke duke making a moonshine run for uncle jesse (no shine running in the show because it would put the boys back in jail as a parole violation) to the closing sequence of uncle jesse smoking weed with the governor of georgia (uncle jesse was the moral compass despite his previous moonshining ways) this disappointing waste of film is an open faced insult. i can't tell you how many parents i saw get up and remove their children from the theater within the first 15 minutes of the movie when they realized that they had been horribly deceived. the original dukes of hazzard was a family show with basic moral values. the original dukes of hazzard was a kid safe, hemi powered, show of fun that parents didn't have to worry about teaching their kids george carlin's seven words. i have read reviews stating that the show and the movie are nothing but racist. those commits might be correct about the movie. those commits are absolutely incorrect about the show. the show, if anything, was about how to get along and be friends with anyone. hollywood has finally come out in the open about their disdain for those of us, yankee, rebel, or otherwise, who still believe in honor, loyalty, trust, family, and doing the right thing even if it is not the popular thing. hollywood has finally brought to light its belief that those of us in the heartland are stupid, uneducated, beer swilling, foul mouthed, trash that will buy any piece of garbage they are willing to sell. prove the hollywood elitist that they are wrong. do not go see this movie. boycott the sponsors. fill warner bros. email and snail mail boxes with complaints that we don't appreciate them destroying one of the greatest t.v. shows of all time. save your money and buy the dvd's of the original show, but whatever you do
