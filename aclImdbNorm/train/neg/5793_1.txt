it really was that bad. on a par with the (mercifully!) short-lived "dirty dozen" tv series that starred ben murphy and was made at around the same time (also on the cheap in yugoslavia).<br /><br />i was embarrassed for the cast members of this film - and for telly savalas in particular. he was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role (pushing 70 when he made this garbage), and the reviewer who draws parallels with telly the greek in this and john wayne in "the green berets" pretty much sums it up.<br /><br />other reviewers have pointed out some of the many laughable howlers that this crime against celluloid contains, so i won't repeat them here. but i will add that i'm amazed that no-one's yet mentioned the ridiculously tiny-looking helmet that savalas wears on his big, bloated head. <br /><br />i'm also astonished that this trainwreck of a film has a rating as high as 4.7 here at imdb.<br /><br />as far as i'm concerned, it's a "1" right across the board. if you want a good example of why flogging a franchise to death really is a bad idea (especially 20-plus years after the original) - look no further than "the dirty dozen - the fatal mission".<br /><br />awful - avoid!!!!
