i had not seen the movie trailer when i went to see the movie, instead i based my judgments on a friend's opinions. now i like chris rock and his comedy, but this movie just falls flat on its face.<br /><br />during the movie rock delivers a couple of funny jokes, but unfortunately the movie is sorely lacking in comedy. the movie seems want to integrate both laughter and love into one, and it that endeavor it fails. the love story in the movie is straight forward (luckily), but it detracts too much from the movie by making rock serious and bland. after all, the movie is first and foremost destined to be a comedy, where laughter should be the primary concern. not much of that in the movie.<br /><br />the plot is also pretty uninteresting as a whole. some parts were discontinuous altogether. if the supporting cast were meant to be funny, they certainly didn't do a good job. the couple of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes, which were dry and dull. rock's first incarnation's couple of underlings were also bland. if there's one thing they did do right, though, they made rock seem funnier by comparison.
