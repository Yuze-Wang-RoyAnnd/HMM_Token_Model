i greatly enjoyed margaret atwood's novel 'the robber bride', and i was thrilled to see there was a movie version. a woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder, and his buddy, an ex-cop journalist, tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman's crazy female friends. it's fortunate that the movie script fixes ms. atwood's clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men, victims of scheming women...<br /><br />heh. okay, you got me. if these guys are mentioned in the book, and i'm pretty sure they're entirely made up for the movie, i'll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy. apparently, the three main female characters of the novel aren't enough to carry the movie. zenia's manipulations aren't interesting unless we see them happen to a man, and a man's life is screwed up. roz, charis, and toni tell their stories -- to a man. because it's not important if a man doesn't hear them.<br /><br />i liked the characters in the book. it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man's story. i normally do not look for feminist angles on media, and i tried to enjoy the movie as is. if i hadn't read the book, i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more. so if you like the cop and the ex-cop, and you want to read more about them, you're out of luck. read the novel, if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot. it's the same plot: the movie excavated it, ironed it, and sprinkled it with male angst. it's like zenia's revenge on margaret atwood.
