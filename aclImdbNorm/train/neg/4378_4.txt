given the title and outlandish box art, i was ready for just about anything. perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to high, because i was left a little dry.<br /><br />a film crew working on a soft-core sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. where hasn't this set up been used before? the difference here is the uber-perverse nature of the sex. not allowed to show all the goods (groin shots were illegal in japan for a long time, what is shown is fogged out) the movie tries as hard as it can to show the viewer just how unnatural sex can be.<br /><br />amidst all the kinky goings on, a mud monster (whose origin i can't fathom) shows up and begins murdering the men and raping the women...then murdering them too. some of the sights are a bit much, most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of...stuff, but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare.<br /><br />ultimately the film is pulled down by it's own designs; it's too over-sexed to be a strait horror picture and too gruesome to work as a sex flick. the mediums can work, but there need to be a balance.<br /><br />4/10
