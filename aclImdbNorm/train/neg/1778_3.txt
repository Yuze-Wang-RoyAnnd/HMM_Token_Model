i have nothing against a fast-paced fright-flick, but this stephen king-derived nonsense is too freshly-scrubbed, too bright and modern. the plot, about a new teenage boy in a small town who is a "sleepwalker"--sort of a cross between a vampire and a werewolf--and who feeds on the blood of female virgins, begs for a more mysterious, ambiguous treatment. this thriller is given an inappropriately colorful look and feel, with hardly any atmosphere. the kids are predictably pretty and energetic, but the big plus is alice kridge as the boy's mother; kridge, from "ghost story", never broke out of the filler-female mold, and it's a huge loss that she hasn't been used more. her performance is creepy and intense, and gives hint that "sleepwalkers" might've been a much better film with a different focus and tighter direction. it's too over-the-top and commercially-driven, with an uneven tone that swings wildly from thriller to comedy to drama. stephen king pops up in a cameo, as do real-life directors john landis and tobe hooper. *1/2 from ****
