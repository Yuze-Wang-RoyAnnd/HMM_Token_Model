i have to say many people have argued that some of us need to get with the times cause the new "dukes" movie is a modernized version. oh please. if this is what you consider modernized then hollywood can keep it. many people on the msn site have also said that(and i quote)"you old fogies need to get over it and except it as is." well let me tell you something, i am 24 so i am a long way from being and old fogie, and i won't get over it, it was a disgrace to all that is hazzard county. the only thing right in the movie title was "hazzard." was all the profanity, smoking, and drinking really necessary. the cast was terrible. jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly i believe it has all gone to her head. she is in no way a daisy duke, a fluke maybe, but definitely no duke. i love sean williams scott, but not as bo. they should have included the original cast as at least cameos, but even hollywood knew they wouldn't approve of the script. i mean come on people even todays actors and actresses are voicing a negative opinion so why are some of you giving positive remarks.
