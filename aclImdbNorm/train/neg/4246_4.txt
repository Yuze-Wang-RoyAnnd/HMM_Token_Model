anne bancroft plays estelle, a dying jewish mother who asks her devoted son (ron silver) to locate reclusive one-time movie star greta garbo and introduce the two before estelle checks out for good. might've been entitled "bancroft talks" as the actress assaults this uncertain comedic/dramatic/sentimental material for its duration. hot-or-cold director sidney lumet can't get a consistent rhythm going, and bancroft's constant overacting isn't scaled back at all by the filmmaker--he keeps her right upfront: cute, teary-eyed and ranting. estelle becomes a drag on this scenario (not that the thinly-conceived plot has much going on besides). silver and co-stars carrie fisher and catherine hicks end up with very little to do but support the star, and everyone is trampled by her hamming. *1/2 from ****
