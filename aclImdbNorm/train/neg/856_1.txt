these writings write about the end of the plot so don't read it if you haven't seen this rubbish.<br /><br />i found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror. if i owned a video store i'd put it in the boring section. this film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks.<br /><br />this film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary. well i drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me it's not scary. it even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving. even the little kid does it too. round and round he goes and he never stops. what's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour? i think nothing and if you watch it you will not think so too.<br /><br />the family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens. then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. that's all that happens and as you can see it's rubbish.
