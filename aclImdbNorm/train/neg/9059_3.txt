i'll just be vague about my potential spoiling comments. there are enough canned plot elements in this movie that it's essentially pre-spoiled.<br /><br />this movie derives a few ideas from a southern classic, to kill a mockingbird. i suppose maybe tkom got its ideas from some source.... at any rate, after you watch this, you'll say, "oh yeah, that is a ripoff".<br /><br />i think the truly entertaining thing about these mcmovies is once you've identified a plot element, is to figure out whether they'll stick with the original, or try to twist it around. not a lot of twists in this one.
