what is this crap? my little cousin picked this out obviously for the overly girlie dvd art and title... i decided to watch it with her so she didn't get bored, and i sure was appalled at the horrible quality.<br /><br />first, the acting was terrible. they seem like amateur actresses reading off of cue cards. the delivery is sub-par and very formulaic. scene cuts were terrible.. it looks like they took it straight from the story board, if there was one.<br /><br />secondly, the jokes and stereotypes weren't original or well played at all- again, very formulaic. i can't count the times i was able to predict the next joke. i got a few chuckles out of the blatantly "subtle" sexual innuendos. the cat, the beaver patch, hung wong?.. c'mon! just.. stay away from this movie. it's not cute, it's not funny, it's not even stupid-funny. it's just stupid-stupid. it's like a pg kids' movie with unnecessary sexual innuendo, vulgarity, and violence to bump the mpaa rating. stay away.<br /><br />"would you like to ride my yacht?"<br /><br />"is that what they're calling it now?"<br /><br />"you could ride my ding."<br /><br />"oh! i think i got blood on my stool!"<br /><br />badly played, sir.
