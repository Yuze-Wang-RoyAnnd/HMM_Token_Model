a bad one.<br /><br />oh, my...this is one of the movies, which doesn't have even one positive effect. just everything from actors to story stinks to the sky. i just wonder how low i.q. you should have to watch this kind of flick and even enjoy.<br /><br /> is there something than this is worth watching for? well, there is a lot of nudity involved, but it's nothing particular. and when you just think that it couldn't get worse, your realize that all the naked ladies looked like there are forty years old. c'mon guys, where did you search for these actresses. in elderly home, perhaps.<br /><br /> anyway, the leading actresses has some sex-appeal and knows how to show it. again, too bad, that she is too skinny & old. all in all, skip these one.<br /><br />2 out of 10
