no, this wasn't one of the ten worst films of the 1980's, but it certainly skirts the bottom 100 somewhere. this movie looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981. how else would you explain special effects pre-dating "an american werewolf in london," disco still being considered cool, and ronald reagan not being the 40th president of the united states? while we're at it, let's not overlook those 1970's hairstyles in the 1950's and '60's. i've seen more of that here than in "happy days" & "laverne & shirley" combined.<br /><br />the one woman who elevates this movie to the "so bad, it's good" category was the late, great elizabeth hartman, but just barely. biff plays as miss montgomery, the mousey high school teacher who becomes a sexpot, a stereotype that's been done to death and is still being churned out by hollywood today, but even as a "hot chick" she retains her mousey qualities. her call for help is evidence of this. she also looks much better as miss wimp. "seven bucks at the beauty parlor, shot to hell." she wasn't kidding.<br /><br />this isn't to say that there aren't any good parts elsewhere, they're just few and far between, and i'm not just saying that because i like hartman. incidentally, "teen wolf" was better than this. "teen wolf too" was better than this, and that wasn't even so good.<br /><br />
