i went in to see d-war on a whim and with very low expectations. the movie failed to meet them.<br /><br />i don't mind stories that stretch credulity - remember reign of fire? - but i do expect them to be internally consistent. this film leapt from howler to howler without pausing for breath, all interspersed with special effects that lagged far behind the likes of lotr or even godzilla.<br /><br />a shape-shifting mystic warrior from korea, curiously metamorphosed into a caucasian antique dealer and popping up like deus ex machina to get the hapless protagonists out of their latest mess. a special agent from the fbi who seems to be completely boned up on ancient korean folklore because of the fed's excellent "paranormal division" - which has gone unremarked up to this point. lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims "i never meant for this to happen." a reincarnated pair of long dead koreans who "died like star-crossed lovers." mystic pendants, faceless hordes of robotic soldiers (that owe a lot to peter jackson's orcs) and a serpent who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along to distract it.<br /><br />the dialogue is appalling, the acting wooden and the effect of the whole was, to be honest, tedious. however, for me the crowning moment was at the end, after the finale, when the music for the closing credits was - arirang! this is rather like akira kurosawa closing "ran" with a karaoke rendition of my way - and let me be clear that i am in no way comparing director shim to kurosawa.<br /><br />in short, a self indulgent, lackluster collection of clich'es and narrative non-sequituurs which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in koran popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer - or even a not so-serious movie goer. i would suggest that this bypass the movie theaters altogether and go straight to video, but i'm not even sure that it's worth that much.
