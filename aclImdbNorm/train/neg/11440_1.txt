otherwise it is one of the worst movies i've ever seen - and i mean ever. my wife and i were both bored out of our minds within 10 minutes. not to mention being boring, it is entirely unbelievable. women (non-lesbian) don't bathe together - nor do they "accidentally" kiss. brothers and sisters don't live together well into their 30s and run around swing dancing together and engaging in footraces in central park. men don't find out their wife and sister romantically kissed the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with said wife. absolutely ridiculous.<br /><br />heather graham is possibly the worst actress in films today. she smiles when she should be crying and vice versa. the only movie she has ever been good in is boogie nights - and that is because she wasn't acting.<br /><br />i cannot stress enough how bad this movie was.
