a terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one. it needed some dependence on something.<br /><br />this totally miserable film deals with the interactions among irish people. were they trying to imitate the wonderful film "crash?" if so, this film crashed entirely.<br /><br />there is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem.<br /><br />the film is just too choppy to work. one woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor. this causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing. the older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance.<br /><br />then, we have 3 losers who purchase masks to rob a bank. obviously, the robbery goes awry but there doesn't seem to be any punishment for the crooks. perhaps, the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film.
