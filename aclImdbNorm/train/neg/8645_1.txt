i just got back from this free screening, and this "osama witch project" is the hands-down worst film i've seen this year, worse than even "catwoman" - which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction.<br /><br />in "september tapes," a "film crew" of "documentary journalists" heads to afghanistan - despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip, the conditions and, oh yeah, the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife's death on sept. 11 - to track down osama bin laden.<br /><br />they "made" eight tapes on their journey, which now "document" their travels and, of course, their attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (the eight tapes, thankfully, all end at points significant in the narrative, which is convenient for a "documentary.")<br /><br />the psychotic, idiotic protagonist - who is given to long, significant speeches that he probably learned watching "macgyver" - cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps. i don't know why he didn't just wear a sign on his back that said "shoot me."<br /><br />the crew's translator, supposedly their sensible voice-of-reason, does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom. <br /><br />you wish they'd brought along someone on their trip to call them all morons.<br /><br />around "tape 4," i began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew.
