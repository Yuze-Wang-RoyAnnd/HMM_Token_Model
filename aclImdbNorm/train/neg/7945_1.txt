the movie confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent argument against the death penalty on any level. by presenting the lawful execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind the movie elevates a parent killer to the status of martyr for christ. somehow, according to the plot, god is outraged that society has chosen to rid it's self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds. yet this same god has no indignation for the acts of the killer. the lead character, an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman, ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsuccessfully save this convicted killer. in other threads of the underdeveloped plot jesus comes back as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of god. the modern lackluster incarnation of christ not just dehumanizes him but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions as well. he is unable to affect humanity for good and unemotionally skates the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it's self. meanwhile, with little help from jesus the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate herself into her newly born soulless child which somehow saves all of mankind from the wrath of the almighty. i also interpreted that as a statement in support of abortion on some levels. this movie which attempts to weave many religious themes into a thriller fails to make any religious point that i could clearly interpret except to mock people's beliefs. it raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer. it disregards the religious values of its audience while attempting to portray an asinine version of their fulfillment. silly
