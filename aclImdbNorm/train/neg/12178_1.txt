annie's wig does not look good. she is not cute and pretty enough to play annie. annie sticks out in the movie, as her outfits look like halloween costumes. terrible acting and terrible plots. this movie is such a change from the 1982 version. i think that a younger and smaller girl should have had the lead role. ashley johnson portrays a very boyish annie. not appealing at all. at least the casting director got it right with daddy warbucks. ms. hannigan was also miscast. camilla belle played molly alright. "warning" this movie might insult your iq so you might just want to only show it to very young children. 8 and younger. some of the plots are too fictional and could hardly take place in the real world.
