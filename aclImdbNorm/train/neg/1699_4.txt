i'm somewhat of a fan of lynche's work, so i was excited when i found this dvd. unfortunately, i was very let down. it's a series of short cartoons which attempt to show a disturbing and disgusting sort of humor. the animation is very crude, no doubt done using macromedia. each cartoon has a big fat guy beating up his family and generally acting like a jerk to everyone he knows. <br /><br />for people who are not familiar with this vein of animation, they will probably be somewhat impressed by it. however, if you've spent much time on newgrounds.com, like me, then these cartoons will be no different than any of the other stuff you've seen before. many of the popular amateur artists on newgrounds are doing much better work than what was shown on this dvd. if lynch submitted this work to the website, then he would blend in perfectly with some of the better of newgrounds artists. but, since i saw this on dvd, instead of on newgrounds, i give it a 4/10, instead of a 7/10, as i would have otherwise. these cartoons are fit for the internet, but with a name like david lynch on it, i expected better quality both in story and in animation.
