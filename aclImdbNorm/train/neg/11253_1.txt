visually interesting, but falls flat in the originality department. this tedious excercise in technique wears thin after the opening battle. jude law has the charisma of burnt toast, but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogue i have ever seen on the big screen. in fact the script is so poor that it keeps taking you out of the film, and had me thinking about work, bills, my dogs, etc. there are many moments that scream bluescreen. paltrow is as wooden as they get. this could of been saved by snappy film noir dialogue or over the top camp. my only complaint on the technique is that black & white film (sorry, computer) would of helped because it looks like turner colorized black and white. just a big dull clich'e mess. i would rather break my femur than sit through this endurance test again.
