1993 was the year. this was long before phillip seymour thomas had won an oscar. who knew i would be an extra in a movie with him? i was actually a paid extra in "my boyfriend's back," which was shot in a suburb of austin called georgetown, tx. the original title was "johnny zombie" (thank god the producers had a change of heart!) i was in the theater scene. i rushed out to watch the movie the day it was released in theaters. it is more of a comedy than a horror movie. but... for a good laugh, you might want to check it out. nothing that is even close to "dawn of the dead" or even "shaun of the dead" quality, but the cheese factor is good enough. ciao
