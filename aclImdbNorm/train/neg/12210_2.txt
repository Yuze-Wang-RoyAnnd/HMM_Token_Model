this movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies stallone ever made. this is a typical 80s movie where you have one man destroying the whole army by himself. "first blood pt. 2" is very similar to schwarzenegger's "commando", but there you have arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation showed as the bad guys. this movie is a typical american anti-soviet propaganda. true, this was the peak of the cold war, but i'm sick of having communists or the nazis always being shown as the enemy. there are so many american movies that have this one thing in common. why can't there a movie that show americans as the enemy? who's going to believe that one lone soldier will destroy the whole army? do you really think that something like this would have really happened? by the looks of it, an average, brain washed american viewer certainly would.
