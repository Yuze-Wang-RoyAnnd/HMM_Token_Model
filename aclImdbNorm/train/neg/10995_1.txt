anyone who has watched comedy central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie. i first saw ads for this movie back in 2001. it looked like it could be funny, but i wasn't about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first. i figured i would wait until the movie was available to rent at blockbuster.<br /><br />about a year and a half later, i was at tower records and in the "dvds for less than $20" pile, there was a copy of this movie. seeing that the dvd was only $6.99 i decided to buy it. i got home, put the disc in the dvd player, and waited for the laughs to start...and i waited some more. the laughs never came.<br /><br />i'd have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when i say that this movie was horrible. sick, desperately tasteless, and poorly written and directed, the underground comedy movie is an atrocious piece of garbage and is in my opinion the worst movie of all time. no stars.
