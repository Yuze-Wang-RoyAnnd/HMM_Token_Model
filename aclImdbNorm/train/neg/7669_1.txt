this movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you've seen. however this comes from the fact that you can't make heads or tails of this mess. it almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid. if you don't want to feel slighted you'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they've all seen better days, but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you'll lose pity for them just like you've already done for the film. i can't go on enough about this horrible movie, its almost something that ed wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece.<br /><br />to start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you've never seen/heard, this thing has got to be five minutes long. on top of that it is narrated, as to suggest that you the viewer cannot read. then we meet mr. slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets underway, it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line. soon we meet stephen dorff, who i typically enjoy) and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does. then comes the ultimate insult, tara reid playing an intelligent role, oh help us! tara reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies, in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the american pie type. <br /><br />all in all you just may want to see this for yourself when it comes out on video, i know that i got a kick out of it, i mean lets all be honest here, sometimes its comforting to revel in the shortcomings of others.
