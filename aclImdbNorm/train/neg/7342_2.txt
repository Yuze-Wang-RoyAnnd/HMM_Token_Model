"the man in the attic" is a movie set in the 1910s. it is inspired by a true story. unfortunately, it's a story that really didn't need to be told.<br /><br />looking at the box, the people responsible for packaging the movie tried their best to make this film appear steamy and erotic. they use terms such as "illicit passion", "forbidden affair", and "unlimited pleasures". they even show a picture of neil patrick harris (little doogie howser, m.d.) holding a gun!<br /><br />the story involves krista, played by anne archer. she is unhappily married to a gentleman who owns his own business. edward (harris) is an employee of her husband's company. krista and edward end up falling in love with each other.<br /><br />the supposedly "shocking" part of the movie is this: krista's husband finds out about the affair and forbids them from ever seeing each other again. so what do they decide to do? krista ends up having edward live up in their attic. wow! krista ends up seeing someone else and edward gets extremely jealous. so on and so on and so on.<br /><br />"the man in the attic" doesn't cover any new territory. it's a showtime original picture, which explains why the stars are a couple of b-list actors and both appear briefly in the buff.<br /><br />
