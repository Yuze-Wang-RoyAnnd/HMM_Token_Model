this isn't cinema. it isn't talent. it isn't informative. it isn't scary. it isn't entertaining. it isn't anything at all.<br /><br />i got this because my cousin says, "diablo! cool!" yeah, right. the only thing cool about this experience was the lone fact that i didn't buy it but rented it instead.<br /><br />it's shot like a bad soap opera. no wait. soap operas at least look professional...sorta. this? this looks like it was shot with someone's camcorder. it's horrid! wretched! it sux.<br /><br />the cinematography is detestable! who is this director anyway? i don't even care enough to look him up. he stinks! the performances by these poor unsuspecting actors were far better than this crap-fest deserved.<br /><br />2.6/10 on the "b" scale. <br /><br />that registers about a 0.3/10 on the "a" scale from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
