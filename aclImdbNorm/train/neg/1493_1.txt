i really don't get how people made this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it. even more puzzling are those who watched this film without feeling cheated out of 88 minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading leviticus. <br /><br />first of all, surely they could have 2 found real irish people, and some good-looking women who could deliver their lines better than the washed up, haggard porn stars sprinkled throughout this film. granted, the gore works- but strangely, it's not as troubling as you might think to see organs yanked out of the porn stars' hot (formerly) tight bodies left and right. probably has something to do with the fact that after their horrific inhuman acting you just want them to die in pain.<br /><br />so, if you don't care at all about the following: <br /><br />- acting (seriously, everyone sucked. i've never witnessed this before. everyone sucked).<br /><br />-plot (some crappy horror movies are remotely linear, or at the very least surprising. this movie doesn't make sense unless you're as trashed as the writers obviously were). <br /><br />- theme (nothing to learn from this film. nothing to be scared about in bed at night, nothing to contemplate or grasp, or explain to others). <br /><br />- soundtrack (crap, crap, crap. music as ordinary and dull as the script). <br /><br />- scenery (could have been this film's saving grace, but no...nothing pleasing here. even the rocks are fake).<br /><br />so, yeah. if you don't care about that, and you're just a horny teen with bad taste in music and "women," this movie is for you. positive comments: interesting cinematography at times, wasted on the other elements. very realistic gore; again, wasted. but the intestines scene is classic. i agree with the mutant- disembowelment solves the fake accent problem.
