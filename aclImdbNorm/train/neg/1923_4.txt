ironic that dr. seuss' fable emphasizing the non-commercialization of christmas should be one of the most hyped, marketed, and successful blockbusters of the holiday season. the general gist of ron howard's adaptation is that the grinch's bane against christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for cindy lou who (played very well by taylor momsen). this movie makes an ardent, ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of seuss' story, but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of chuck jones' animated version. jim carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish grinch, but whether it's the dialogue, the pacing, or extraneous storylines heaped upon the initial plot, the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly. there are some wonderful visuals and the make-up work is amazing, yet beyond the technical triumphs there's an element or two here that's missing.<br /><br />succinctness?<br /><br />soul?<br /><br />or maybe jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25-minute cartoon that howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long. howard, carey, and crew are all very capable and talented, but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product. if you must see the feature-length version, rent it on video with jones' animated version and you can see how bigger and glitzier is not always better. i give this film three cans of who-hash out of five.
