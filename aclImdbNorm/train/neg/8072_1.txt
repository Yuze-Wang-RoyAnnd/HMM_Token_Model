(a possible spoiler or two) <br /><br /> "soul survivors" is quite possibly the worst theatrical released movie ever. nothing makes sense at all, there's some plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead. the entire movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that don't really tie together, by the end of the film. <br /><br /> tha acting is non-existent, the camera work is jerky and the script is so confusing, it just makes the movie even harder to watch.<br /><br /> i kept waiting for something to tie the movie together but nothing came. definitely the worst film of the year. -****1/2 stars.
