this movie was so poorly written and directed i fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie. the jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles, it is too far fetched and at some points- ridiculous. if you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed, but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts (which i might add are poorly done) and wish you were some warrior to. the casting in this movie wasn't very good, and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it didn't fit at all. on a scale of 1-10 (10 being excellent, 1 being horrible) the acting in this movie is a 4. brenda song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of movie, in some of the more serious scenes, her acting was laughable. when she made some of her "fighting" poses, i started laughing out loud. i think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing, for example, the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing, how her voice turns dark and evil, i think that was incredibly stupid, and how wendy's (brenda song)teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks, that was pretty ridiculous to. so to sumamrize it all, a disappointing movie, but okay if you're 10 or under.
