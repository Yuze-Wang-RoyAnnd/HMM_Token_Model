this movie was definitely not one of mary-kate and ashley's best movies. i really didn't like it, and i was kind of disappointed in that movie. for some reason, it seemed like it was a movie that they put together really fast. in some parts, it got so boring that i had to fast forward it. it didn't have any bloopers or any exciting parts like their other movies.
