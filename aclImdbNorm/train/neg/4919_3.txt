i've rarely been as annoyed by a leading performance as i was by ali mcgraw's in this movie. god is she bothersome or what?! she says everything in the same tone and is horrible, so horrible in fact that, by contrast, ryan o'neal is brilliant. <br /><br />there is not much of a story. he's rich, she's wooden, they both have to sacrifice a lot for love. his father is stonewall jackson, hers is called by his first name, in case you didn't notice the difference in the two of them that they overcame in the name of love. <br /><br />the oscar nominations for this movie indicate it had to have been a bad year. john marley is fine as wooden's father, but a supporting nomination? at least ali didn't win. <br /><br />i still think katharine ross should have played jennifer, but then again, if it were up to me, katharine ross would have been in a lot more movies. she's certainly a better actress than mcgraw. <br /><br />i didn't even cry when she got sick, never occured to me to even feel sad. <br /><br />it was nice to see tommy lee jones looking like he was about 15, and the score is good. but this one is so old by now it has a beard a mile long, and the sin of that is its not that old, but it feels it.
