if asked how i would define the word " shallow " i would reply " watch a jerry bruckheimer production " . if asked how i would define the phrase " wasted potential " i would reply " watch a jerry bruckheimer production " . bruckheimer productions are nearly always sure fire hits at the box office but nearly always receive critical pannings from the critics . off the top of my head i can only think of an officer and a gentleman and black hawk down getting a lot of critical acclaim . <br /><br />crimson tide too received some begrudging acclaim from critics , it`s certainly one of bruckheimer`s better films which alas isn`t saying much . the problem i had is the scenario that sets up the story : the russians are fighting the chechens and the conflict spreads through the whole of russia leading to an ultra nationalist russian to take over a nuclear missile base and threaten the west if they interfere . maybe the ending of the cold war had everything to do with it but i found this set up very unconvincing . it`s not helped by some errors in geography like the french carrier foch being in the med ( wouldn`t the foch be better positioned in the black sea ? ) or that the expositional newsreel consists of familar footage featuring conflicts from the balkans , the first gulf war and even vietnam . once again the adjective " very unconvincing " crept into my mind . the story does improve somewhat when the story proper - a battle of wills concerning orders between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two - gets underway . director tony scott does his best as do the cast , but the problem still lies in an unconvincing scenario . the worst thing is that if this had been made in the mid 1980s when ww3 was a real possibility - nay probability - this film would have terrified me , but after the cold war ended so had the dangers of nuclear war which means crimson tide has little impact .
