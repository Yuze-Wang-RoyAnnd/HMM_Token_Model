it was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the chick flick audience, to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most. however, this was a very irritating attempt by heather graham to become the next meg ryan ( who became annoying as hell in her own right ). her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles. this film might have been more, as there was suitable budget for settings, actors and a decent story line. my wife and i both agreed that this was 'muck' at the end, as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high! better luck next time, hope miss graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like from hell.
