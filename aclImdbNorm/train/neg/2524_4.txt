title: robot jox (1990) <br /><br />director: stuart gordon <br /><br />cast: gary graham, anne marie johnson, paul koslo <br /><br />review: stuart gordon who we usually associate with extremely gory horror films such as re-animator, from beyond, dagon and castle freak, took a small detour here and did a little sci-fi flick. i stress the word "little" since this is a very low budget flick, and there in lies its main weakness.<br /><br />the story takes place in the future. a world in which the great superpowers (that according to this movie are the united states and russia) duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war...but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots. our hero achilles must go up against the evil russian robot fighter called alexander. lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues.<br /><br />well, the idea is awesome i guess. the great nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots? interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the proper budget had been available. unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director.<br /><br />i as a kid loved this movie, and i guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie, you'll have to revert back to little kid mode to have some fun with it. i showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like "what the hell is this piece of crap franco?" and i'm like well this movie is a sci-fi by one of my favorite directors stuart gordon?" but as the movie progressed into corny territory i almost felt like pressing stop and not having them go through that torture. i could go through it, cause i loved this film as a kid, and there's still a little nostalgia attached to watching it. but everyone else was just not going to get it.<br /><br />and i myself realized that the movie isn't really that good. first off. the movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other. and in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you'd have to use some damn good special effects to make it work, expensive effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief. but unfortunately this being a small scale movie, from a small scale company (empire pictures, which went bankrupt after making this film!)the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them. heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed.<br /><br />ok granted, once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other. there are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool, and made me go "thats why i liked thid movie!" but every know and them, some crappy effect will take you right out of that protective little cocoon you were trying to hide in. and boom, your right back into realizing this film just doesn't live up to its premise.<br /><br />and heres another thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie. this movie is basically a movie for kids. you know, giant robots duking it out? stop motion animation? hello? but this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody. so i kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not? after a while i just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities, which really isn't a good mix.<br /><br />so for those of you who don't feel that certain naive childlike charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you don't have a nostalgic connection to this movie (like i do) well id suggest you steer clear away from this one. gordons a great director, but this movie he made, just didn't do it for me. well, at least not now that i'm a full grown adult.<br /><br />rating: 2 out of 5
