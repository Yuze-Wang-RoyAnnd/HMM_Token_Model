'maladolescenza' has the air of a dark fairy tale, with its child protagonists, forest setting, and the discovery of a castle's ruins. yet at its core, the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents. opening with a dream sequence employing the not-so-subtle metaphor of fabrizio wrestling with his menacing hound, the film details his psychological persecution of laura, the girl who has pledged her love to him, and his eventual romance with the equally malicious sylvia. the film's psychological complexities do give the film merit, yet there's no doubting how unnecessarily exploitive the film is in its depiction of nudity and sex. the film's look relies more on its gorgeous locations rather than particular cinematographic skill, and there's no doubting the film's greatest asset is the creepy, children's choir-augmented soundtrack. with its odd dreamlike quality, the film is at best interesting, yet pales beside louis malle's surreal and brilliant 'black moon' from the same era. certainly deserving of the art versus pornography debate, for unlike many banned films, pasolini's 'salo' or larry clark's 'ken park' for instance, the film is rather unremarkable from an artistic perspective. cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock, so perhaps 'maladolescenza' should be admired for retaining that power thirty years after its release. however shock value is the one reason alone the film is memorable. <br /><br />the film does have its defenders. yet so does nazism.
