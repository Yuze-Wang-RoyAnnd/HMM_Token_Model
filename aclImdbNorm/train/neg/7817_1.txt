at the beginning i was happy to know about a new superman movie , i though that will be great but it wasn't.<br /><br />is a bad copy of the richard donner work,lex is again a villain that makes no more else , even played by kevin spice.<br /><br />the evil plan is the same of the first movie of donner just a lot forced.<br /><br />the script is predictable and simple (all stuff luthor finds in a museum or an old lady).<br /><br />the story is the wrong thing , it must be the kevin smith script and may be it could be better.<br /><br />i just hope a sequel without brian singer and with a new talent director to do something new and not a copy.<br /><br />all read you later
