if this is your first time experiencing the wonders of cinema, if you've never seen a "moving picture" before, you'll think this movie is a child of the gods. but if you've seen a movie, a tv show, even barney the dinosaur, then you won't be very impressed by this film. heck barney the dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinos in this flick.<br /><br />now i like b movies. i just watched "the giant gila monster" right before i watched this swill, and i liked that movie much better. it works as a b movie. it has lamer dialog,hokier acting, cheesier effects and an honest to gosh real gila monster as the monster! carno 3 just doesn't pack much of a b movie punch. it has some gore, and that polchek guy comes close to being funny a few times but this movie is underwhelming, almost....flaccid. it's the little engine that couldn't of dinosaur movies. i'm not saying you shouldn't watch the movie. <br /><br />some people can watch gum drying on a sidewalk and feel entertained. if you're one of those people, then give this movie a shot.
