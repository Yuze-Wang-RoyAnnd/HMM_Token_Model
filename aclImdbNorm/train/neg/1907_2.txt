this horrendously bad piece of trash manages to be racist, sexist and homophobic all at once, while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated. atrocious performances, a cliche ridden screenplay, and boring direction make this movie one to steer clear of. two scenes were especially offensive - the one in which schaech scrubs his tongue after being kissed by another man (could it really have been that gross), and the scene where eastwood is kissed by schaech's best friend, who is pretending to be russian. after he leaves the room she exclaims "f**king foreigners"! so much for her being a cultured artist who dreams of living in paris!?!<br /><br />jonathon schaech can be a likeable actor on screen, and is astonishingly good-looking. it's a shame he didn't learn more from working with cutting edge gay director gregg araki on an earlier film, and try to salvage this film from descending into a string of gay stereotypes and a mire of homophobia.
