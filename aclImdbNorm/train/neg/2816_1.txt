this is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just have to get because it just looks so horribly bad. and indeed, we couldn't take most of it. there was a lot of fast-forwarding going on.<br /><br />but then we came across a scene where robert englund seduces the female protagonist (her name somehow slips my mind at this time). cripes. i've never watched a single scene from a film so many times (i'm estimating forty or so). and i've never laughed so hard in my life. you see, englund has this thing for showing off his loins. i last saw the film a couple months ago, but i can't stop laughing as i type. anyway, the scene is a montage of shots-- englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl, englund riding a horse naked, and some mysterious woman fellating a snake's head. this is absolute genius. you've got to see it for yourself.
