christopher guest need not worry, his supreme hold on the mockumentary sub-genre is not in trouble of being upstaged in the least especially not by this extremely unfunny jab at rpg-gamers. the jokes are beyond lame. not enough substance to last the typical length of a (particularly rancid) snl skit, much less the 87 atrocious minutes i waisted watching this drivel. the great william katt (greatest american hero, house) deserves much much better. one thing and one thing alone makes the fact that i saw this worth it in my mind and that's posting about it on here so hopefully just hopefully i'll save someone such a bad experience.<br /><br />my grade: d- <br /><br />dvd extras: 2 audio commentaries; 7 interviews with various cast members; 4 deleted scenes; & theatrical trailer <br /><br />dvd-rom extras: 2 wallpapers <br /><br />easter egg: highlight the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short scene
