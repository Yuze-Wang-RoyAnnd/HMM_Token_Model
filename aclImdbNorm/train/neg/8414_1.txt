yeah. pretty sure i saw this movie years ago when it was about the supremes.<br /><br />another recycled storyline glitzed up hollywood-style, borrowing scripts from better making-it-in-the-music-industry films.<br /><br />nothing original here.<br /><br />more make-up, glammier costumes and choreography = more money for the questionably "talented" beyonce draw.<br /><br />if you like the throwback style, you should appreciate actual groups who struggled (without having digitized voices and a hollywood empire).<br /><br />beyonce's involvement makes this hypocritical garbage.
