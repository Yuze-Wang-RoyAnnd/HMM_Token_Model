one hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and i decided it was pretty lame. that was right after hopalong (chris lybbert) drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse. i was pretty mystified by the whole hopalong cassidy/great bar 20 gimmick which didn't translate into anything at all. obviously, the name coppola in the credits couldn't do anything to guarantee success here, even with more than one listed.<br /><br />if you make it to the end of the film, you'll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions i did. what exactly was the hook with the gloves? what's up with the rodeo scenario? who was the stranger supposed to represent? why did they make this film? <br /><br />i could probably go on but my energy's been drained. look, there's already a western called "the gunfighter" from 1950 with a guy named gregory peck as the title character. watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad. that one i can recommend.
