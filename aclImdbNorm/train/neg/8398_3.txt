schlocky '70s horror films...ya gotta love 'em. in contrast to today's boring slasher flicks, these k-tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula.<br /><br />this is a b movie about the making of a b movie...that went horribly wrong. faith domergue (this island earth) stars as an over-the-hill, b movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that befell a family in their home. her boyfriend/director, who looks and acts like gordon jump with an attitude, is filming on location and on a tight schedule. the ken doll co-star discovers a book of tibetian chants that they work into the script to add "realism". unfortunately, "realism" is something they could have done without.<br /><br />john carradine, having long since given up looking for the 17th gland (the unearthly), now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate. he goes about his daily work, but always seems to run afoul of the director.<br /><br />the horror builds slowly; a dead cat here, john carradine entering a grave there, finally culminating in seven, yes seven murders. (at least there's truth in advertising.) it's just sad that the ghoul didn't understand that there was a movie being made above him. how was poor faith to know that those darn tibetian chants would actually work? face it, you just can't go around tugging on satan's coat and expect him to take it lying down.<br /><br />sterno says perform an autopsy on the house of seven corpses.
