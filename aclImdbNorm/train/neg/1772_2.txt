"sleepwalkers" is the first film which stephen king has written a script for. given this, and the excellent santo & johnny song that they used as the theme of the movie, you would be expecting a odd, and ultimately fulfilling viewing experience. unfortunately, that's not what you'd be getting. the thing is, they could have probably made it a good movie. the beginning is intriguing what with it's small town spooky atmosphere. but something strange happens about 20 minutes into the film. the film turns funny for no apparent reason! from that moment on the whole atmosphere of "sleepwalkers" is ruined.for those of you who have seen it, who can ever forget good old johnny screaming out "cop kabob!!" after jabbing the pencil into that one cop's ear?!? but don't get me wrong, the humor has no redeemiing quality. i just rented it again to see if mabye i was wrong the first time around, given how original the plot sounded, but i was right. man, what a waste. i can't believe they got the rights to that santo & johnny song. i gave this a 2.
