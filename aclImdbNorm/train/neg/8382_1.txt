there was a bugs bunny cartoon titled "baby buggy bunny" that was exactly this plot. baby-faced finster robbed a bank and the money in the carriage rolled away and fell into bug's rabbit hole. he dressed up as a baby to get into bugg's hole to retrieve the money. the scene in "little man" where he's looking in the bathroom mirror shaving with a cigar in his mouth is straight from the cartoon. this was a hilarious 5-minute cartoon; not so much an entire movie. if you are really interested in this, buy the bugs bunny dvd. it's was much more original the first time (1954). plus you'll get a lot more classic bugs bunny cartoons to boot!
