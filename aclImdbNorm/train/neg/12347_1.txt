this is easily the worst ridley scott film. ridley scott is a wonderful director. but this film is a black mark on his career. demi moore and viggo mortensen, both totally miscast in an overaggressive film about a girl going to the army. very stupid. and there is never one scene that is convincing in any way. it is really not difficult to make a film such as this. everything the crew makes could have been an idea of just anybody. the writers didn't have much inspiration either; many foolish dialogs that made no sense at all; and some brainless action. i strongly recommend to stay away from this rubbish. i hope that the many talented persons involved in this project realize this type of film does not deserve their attention, and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent movies than this useless mess.
