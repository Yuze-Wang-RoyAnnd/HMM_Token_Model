"the bat people" is a really bad film that deserved the mst3k treatment just as well like that other film "the creeping terror."<br /><br />in it, we are in some sort of mountainous terrain full of bats. we see many things happen, like bats flying out and attacking and stuff, station wagon chases, mishaps at the emergency room, and much more! all this, plus the cheesy mediocrity of the 1970s (hey, think "mitchell" here!), making "the bat people" actually one of the very best of the last "mystery science theater 3000" episodes made in the series! moviewise, it's awful. it should be avoided like the plague, unless tom servo and crow are watching with you.<br /><br />"the bat people" - more like "the bad people!!!!!" lol<br /><br />1/10 of course!!!!!
