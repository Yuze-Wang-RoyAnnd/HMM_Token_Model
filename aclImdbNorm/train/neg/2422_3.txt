this movie does not really promote kids to be nicer and have better attitudes, as a family movie should, and this wouldn't be considered family anyway because it has some things in it that children shouldn't be seeing. not the best abc family film if you ask me. if there were less sexual themes in the movie, then maybe it would be better. hollywood isn't doing anything to make a movie better by adding in sexual situations. there's really no reason for them. at least this is a tv movie. i wouldn't want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it. if you have other things to do other than watch this movie, please proceed to them.
