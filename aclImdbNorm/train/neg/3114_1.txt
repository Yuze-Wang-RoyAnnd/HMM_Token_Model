trying to compare or represent this "swill" as anything "hitchcockian" is an out-n-out attempt to mislead hitchcock fans to waste $7 on this movie... weak acting weak story weak script. <br /><br />no real suspense, no thrills. you wait all through the weakness of this movie for the big payoff or even any payoff...you're left thinking, what the heck was that all about.<br /><br />and please, enough with the movement to make "alternative lifestyles" hip and politically correct!!...i can't recommend this to anyone...did i mention how weak the acting is? williams did a better job as peter pan and "mork". but those were much more innocent times...........
