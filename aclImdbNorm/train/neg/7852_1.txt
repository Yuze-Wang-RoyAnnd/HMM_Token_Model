i'm no horror movie buff, but my wife's nieces and nephews are. so, i saw the first movie. it was gruesome, and tense, but not my taste. still good though. for similar reasons, at this very moment, i am being exposed to a sequel.<br /><br />the premise itself is beyond absurd. i can buy that disasters occur in the desert. i can buy that mutants exists. i can even buy that the events might be so weird and strange that the military may decide to get involved. it is unlikely, yes, but i'm willing to suspend my belief.<br /><br />however, under no circumstances am i willing to believe that the military squad assigned to recon such an area would be unable to fend off the mutants. being a member of the united states army, i can assure that while fresh recruits may lack the seasoned eyes and experience of combat soldiers, any such recruits would be integrated into a capable squad.<br /><br />a squad of armed soldiers is not about to be taken out by a few mutants with knives. that's just the way it works. squad movements, vastly superior firepower, and of course, radio support, would ensure nothing less than total victory. i'm not saying you wouldn't have casualties, but as soon as the area was verified as hostile, military training would take precedence, no-one would go off on their own even to use the bathroom.<br /><br />and if it were discovered that the area was so infested with hostiles that the squad was unable to handle the danger, they would radio in for backup. and believe me, their radios would not be jammed, if there was a chance that normal radios would not do, the squad would have a military issue satellite phone. chances are, if they were unable to check in every hour, a search would be called.<br /><br />in order to accept this movie, you must accept that our soldiers are incompetent fools, with incompetent leaders, and an incompetent chain of command. while it may still be true that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and compass, our military forces are filled with intelligent, well-trained, competent soldiers. mutants with knives are far below our ability to deal with.<br /><br />with the whole execution of the movie depending solidly on the impossible to imagine, the film fails to deliver. instead, we are expected to believe that our soldiers, sailors, and airmen are incapable of dealing with even the most mediocre threats.<br /><br />as a combat veteran, i find the movie insulting.
