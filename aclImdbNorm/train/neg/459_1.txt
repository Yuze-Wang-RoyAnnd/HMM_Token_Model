i was looking for a cute, simple comedy to pass the time but choosing this film proved to be an enormous mistake.<br /><br />i can't write a single good thing about it. first, the script is stupid and not funny at all, relying on tired, recycled jokes and a farting turtle for laughs. in my book, that's not funny, that's pathetic.<br /><br />low budget 'effects' (if i can even call them effects) with horrible cinematography. in many places it feels almost like an indie film shot with no money.<br /><br />acting... i feel sorry for the actors. are pamela anderson and denise richards that desperate for some money that they've agreed to take part in this? (looking at their recent filmography, it would appear so.) despite the outfits, pamela is showing her age and as a whole, they don't even come across as sexy, let alone funny.<br /><br />this movie is not even in the so-bad-it-is-funny category. it's just bad, as if everybody involved was sick of it.<br /><br />avoid.
