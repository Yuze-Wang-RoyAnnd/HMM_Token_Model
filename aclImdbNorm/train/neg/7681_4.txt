sean, you know i think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world, but i can't commend you for this. comedy just isn't your strong suit.<br /><br />however, it wasn't all your fault. some of the stuff was just too hard to understand. alfred lynch did a decent job, but you gotta wonder where the lines came from from the beginning.<br /><br />once again, sean... i apologize.
