if i could say it was better than gymkata, i at least felt my money was not totally wasted.<br /><br />then i saw steven segal's on deadly ground.<br /><br />this movie should see a resurrection though on mst 3k. if santa claus conquers the martians could make tom servo's head explode, one wonders what mayhem this movie could cause.<br /><br />there is a very good reason why kurt thomas never had a movie career.<br /><br />the writers of this dreck should be forced to wear placards every day of their lives that say "bitch slap me! i was a writer on gymkata."
