i can see the guys doing the budget preparation for this flick. "well lets see now, we spend 50% getting dirk benidict, cause battle star galactic and the a-team were cool. the we spend 40% making a demon costume, never mind that the demon is supposed to be incorporeal in the script. and we spend the rest making the movie." this was pretty bad and very cliche.... have a loved one present when watching (or bring a good book)
