there are really two sections of this film. firstly there's the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the 'the simpsons' troy mcclure should be doing the narration.<br /><br />then the rest of the film begins (starting off with a title song which really doesn't fit in with the rest of the film) which, while technically ok, is killed by a vague, inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters, but characters that make no sense.<br /><br />this is especially so with mickey rooney's spiventa, who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the 'organisation' the whole time yet what would have happened had hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out? in that case he would've been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character, which in the end he still is.<br /><br />the overall problem of the film is that it's totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy. it's as if the filmmakers didn't have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions.<br /><br />put simply, the film fails on all levels.
