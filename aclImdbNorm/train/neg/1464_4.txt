i watched this hoping to find out something i didn`t know about modern history`s most infamous man and couldn`t help thinking that history has been rewritten in hitler:the rise of evil . hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have one of her admirer`s shot . hitler turned up with a gun in his hand to arrest ernst rohm . forgive me for asking but haven`t the writers confused adolph hitler with tony montana from scarface ? that`s bad enough but what really offended me was that there`s entire chunks of historical context missing in this mini series . germany lost the first world war and the allied powers made germany pay a heavy price for doing so. it was this economic environment that led the german people to have someone - anyone - to restore their pride and that`s why they turned to nazism . the german humiliation of the 1920s caused by the allied powers seems to be entirely missing therefore there is no way that hitler:the rise of evil can be taken seriously as a historical document, and i haven`t even mentioned that himmler and goering are conspicous by their absence <br /><br />there is one positive point about the mini series and that`s robert carlyle in the title role . okay some of his mannerisms are wrong and his voice is a little too loud ( archive recordings show that hitler had a soft seductive voice ) but carlyle is a charismatic actor and he does manage to communicate hitler`s own charisma on screen . comments in the british press that carlyle resembles the synth player from sparks more than adolph hitler are unfounded and he gives one of the better interpretations of hitler.<br /><br />i liked the performance by robert carlyle but i hated everything else about this mini series and wondered why on earth it was made in the first place . there`s nothing to recommend it to serious history fans
