about halfway through, i realized i didn't care about these characters in the least; however, i watched a bit more anyway. regrettably, i came back the next day and finished it. i shouldn't have bothered.<br /><br />if you know *anything* about the film beforehand, you know that the lead character will be a plane crash survivor - and the title gives you a pretty good idea of what's gonna happen afterward - he's gonna get on the phone and call people about it! that was almost as bad as "snakes on a plane" (another bad aviation catastrophe flick).<br /><br />i realize this is an old film, and the acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than today. but even by those standards, the acting was embarrassing. these weren't characters, they were stereotypes. i suspect this movie was, more than anything, an attempt by bette davis to help her husband's (gary merrill) career. to no avail however - i have seen oak trees display more genuine emotion than he did.<br /><br />davis' playing the happy cripple (i.e., a non-glamorous role) was probably looked on as an edgy and bold career move. it wasn't. it was just boring. she was a kind of tiny tim in the film, making trask (merrill's character) see the truth about love and forgiveness (although she was less winsome than tiny tim), calmly dispensing wisdom about life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband had just died.<br /><br />the final scene, where trask calls his wife back in iowa to reconcile, was so affected and over-acted on both ends of the phone line, i almost cringed. i had to remind myself that these people actually got paid for what they were doing in this film.<br /><br />i noticed a lot of people seem to have enjoyed this movie. if you found it uplifting , that's great. but frankly, i just found it bad. there are plenty of old movies from the golden age of hollywood that were far better written and acted.
