kudos to the patience of paul muni, who spent hours and hours in the makeup room each day to look the part of zola. muni was the one of the biggest stars in the 1930s and i wonder how many people today -other than classic movie buffs - know anything about it. he was a giant in the business for at least a decade. he could have won the academy award for this performance, which would have given him two in a row, as he won it for playing louis pasteur the year before. my own opinion is that while he tended to overact a bit, i still think he was one of the great actors of the "golden age." whatever part he played; you were riveted to the screen watching him.<br /><br />unlike the pasteur role, i thought this story smacked of a little too much of what we've seen in the last 60 years: going overboard to make a liberal hero. even in 1937, hollywood couldn't suppress its disdain for police or for the military, here making it a point to tell us how "corrupt" those organizations are. filmmakers just love it when authority is challenged and defeated. in that regard, this film is way ahead of its day since we've seen this big-time since the 1960s.<br /><br />however, it must be noted the facts support this story. it also does not in any way diminish zola's accomplishments as a social reformer, getting rid of certain evils. good for him! i wish they had spent more time showing that, than concentrating on one trial.
