i'm a huge fan of ivan reitman-i loved evolution and who didn't like ghostbusters? from the trailer you already know that uma's character will get dumped by luke's.so the build-up is obviously towards the moment when she unleashes her superpowers on him.but the pay-off is just not there.the shark tossing did manage to get a (slight) giggle but once again, it was all in the trailer.<br /><br />no one does breathless quite like uma and luke is diet owen on his good days.if not for riann wilson you would sit there with a constipated smile until your cheeks start to cramp.this is a comedy,right? <br /><br />it's not awful-it just sits there like a stale cracker behind the fridge.this could have been such a brilliant send-up of superhero movies and feminism but fails on both counts.let's see if jason reitman can salvage the family name.
