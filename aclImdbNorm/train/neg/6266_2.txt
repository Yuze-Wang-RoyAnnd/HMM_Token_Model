it seems like anybody can make a movie nowadays. it's like all you need is a camera, a group of people to be your cast and crew, a script, and a little money and walla you have a movie. problem is that talent isn't always part of this equation and often times these kind of low budget films turn out to be duds. the video store shelves are filled with these so called films. these aren't even guilty pleasures, they're just a waste of celluloid that are better off forgotten. troma entertainment is known for making trash cinema, but most of their films are b movie gold. however, some of the films they've put out they had nothing to do with making and some, like 'nightmare weekend,' didn't deserve any form of release at all. <br /><br />pros: the cast members do the best they can with the lousy material. some unintentional hilarity. moves at a good pace (should at 81 minutes).<br /><br />cons: awful writing, which includes putrid dialogue and countless plot holes. poorly lit, especially the night scenes and the ending, which you can't make out at all. doesn't make a lick of sense. badly scored. cheap and very dated effects. total lack of character development and you won't care about anybody. this is supposed to be a horror film, but it's lacking in that area and isn't the least bit scary. nothing interesting or exciting happens. loaded with unnecessary padding.<br /><br />final thoughts: i never expected this to be some forgotten gem, but i never imagined it would be this bad. i don't know if it's the worst film ever made, but it's a definite contender. troma should have let this film rot instead of giving it a release. don't make the same mistake i did and let your curiosity get the best of you.<br /><br />my rating: 1/5
