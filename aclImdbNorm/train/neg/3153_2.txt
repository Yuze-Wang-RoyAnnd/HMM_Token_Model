i'm a sucker for a good romance, but this one doesn't qualify as either good or a romance. i had the plot nailed down before the credits were through. with such poor dialog, plot and character development, i suggest investing your hour and a half elsehere. i had to rush out and rent serendipity for the third time so i could get the bad taste of this one out of my mouth.
