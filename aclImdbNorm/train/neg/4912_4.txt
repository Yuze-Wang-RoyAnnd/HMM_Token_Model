having not read the novel, i can't tell how faithful this film is. the story is typical mystery material: killer targets newlyweds; woman investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal disease. yes, it sounds like a soap opera and that's exactly how it plays. the first 2/3 are dull, save for the murders and the last 1/3 makes a partial comeback as it picks up speed toward its twisty conclusion.<br /><br />acting is strictly sub par, though it's hard to blame the actors alone: the screenplay is atrocious. during the last 1/3 you stop noticing because the film actually becomes interesting, but that's only the last 1/3. director russell mulcahy is very much in his element, but there's only so much he can do with a tv budget and the network censors on his back. he's pretty much limited to quick cutting and distorted lenses, though he managed to squeeze in a couple "under the floor" shots during the murders in the club restroom. unfortunately, as this is made for tv, the cool compositional details he uses so well with a wider image are nowhere to be found. note to producers: give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you hire him.<br /><br />summing it up: this film is bad by cinema standards and mediocre by tv standards(watch csi, instead). if you're in the mood for a film like this, i've some excellent suggestions: pick up a copy of dario argento's "deep red"(my highest recommendation; superb film), "opera", or even "tenebre". they're stronger in every category.
