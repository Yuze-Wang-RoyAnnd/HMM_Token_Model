it must be the most corniest tv show on the air. this is probably a escape for jim belushi and all of his bad movies. his brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother. i hope this show is canceled and never spoken of again except in a negative use. jim has got to retire or something. please let them go of the air. if i here a joke from that show i will throw up and and wash my eyes out with a toothbrush. id rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a full half hour that piece of programing. i still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running. we all know deep down that we want to shoot our tv screens when we see jim's face. in conclusion, no more please.
