poorly-made "blaxploitation" crime-drama aimed squarely at the black urban market of the early 1970s. pam grier stars in the title role, that of a nurse who becomes a one-woman vigilante after drug-dealing thugs make coffy's little sister a junkie. violent nonsense plods along doggedly, with canned energy and excitement; only grier's flaring temper gives the narrative a jolt (she's not much of an actress here, but she connects with the audience in a primal way). not much different from what charles bronson was doing at this time, the film was marketed and advertised as crass exploitation yet still managed to find a sizable inner-city audience. today however, it's merely a footnote in '70s film history, and lacks the wide-range appeal of other movies in this genre. *1/2 from ****
