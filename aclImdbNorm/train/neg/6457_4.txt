i guess i've seen worse films, but that may be becuz i'm so jaded by how standard these bad horror movies are. the killer monster thing is really really bad, basically its a guy in some kind of green body suit. there is much worse acting as far as b movie go, but don't think for a second this was anything stellar, hell no. it actually did have a plot with substance, but was still pretty stupid. basically its just a bad low budget horror movie. but at least its not as bad as titanic, that movie sucks balls, this one just sucks. the blood looks really fake in this movie. thats one complaint i have about all the horror of the new millinium, low grade gore, looks stupid. a good gruesome death scene with really fake blood is so stupid. at least there was a nice shower scene
