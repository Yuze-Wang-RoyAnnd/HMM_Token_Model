strictly a routine, by-the-numbers western (directed by genre-mainstay andrew v. mclaglen, so is that any wonder?). army colonel brian keith spars with smarmy bandit dean martin, who has just kidnapped the colonel's wife (honor blackman, who never found her niche after playing pussy galore in "goldfinger"). fist-fights, shoot-outs, stagecoach robberies and denver pyle in a supporting role...in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. talking in a low monotone throughout, keith gets to dally with a prostitute (something of a shock after his run on tv's "family affair"), but otherwise this low-rent material wastes keith's amiable talents. it's also bad news for dino, who doesn't seem to notice or care. hack direction, poor writing and several unfunny attempts at lowball humor. * from ****
