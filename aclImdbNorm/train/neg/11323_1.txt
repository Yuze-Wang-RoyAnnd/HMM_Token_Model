this movie will promote the improvement of the mind. read a book! it's incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make. i've seen "b" movies before but the "c" movie has just been invented. i didn't think i would ever enjoy power rangers since my kids stopped watching but i found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into "knights." high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume. embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind. my roommate, who loves these types of movies even turned it off. now that has to really tell you something. if you watch this movie, and like it, i will pray for you.
