i rented this movie today thinking it might be a good football movie, since i'm a big football fan. boy, was i wrong. this movie is way too religious and preachy and is really unrealistic. this movie pretty much says that if your a christian you can get anything you want in life easily, like become a great football player! you don't become a great football player by becoming christian and asking god, you do it through practice and hard work. all you gotta do is ask god and he'll give you anything....puh-lease. thats not true at all, duh. i laughed several times because of this embarrassment. the only part that was funny was when they were being dumb (shultz the cartoonist? no, the dude that flew over the atlantic, etc etc..) but really this movie wasn't that great. i don't recommend it, especially if you aren't a christian, lol.
