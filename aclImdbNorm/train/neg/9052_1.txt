i respect the fact that this is a very popular show. however, in comparison with robert altman's ingenious, hilarious, zany, and groundbreaking 1970 movie classic, this show was probably destined to be less-than-mediocre... even if it did run for 11 years, that doesn't necessarily make it any good. this show formed an all-too-integral part of my early childhood (it was on re-runs every night, and guess whose parents were watching it and laughing it up), but it's one of the memories i don't miss. and now that i actually have seen the movie, i can give this series an accurate critique. on its own, it's not nearly "2 out of 10" bad. however, the characters on this show are nothing like those in the movie. some of them technically are the same, but they're only similar in name. for instance, since when is alan alda anything like donald sutherland? his style of humor is totally different, as are his characterization and outlook. the new characters are not that great; they just serve to make you miss the ones that they're replacing. it's the same with the new actors (including jamie farr). the only thing that actually transfers to the series is radar, who's still (even though played by the same actor) merely a pale imitation of the original. what else? oh, yeah. with a laugh track (it didn't matter whether it was used in surgery scenes or not), it comes across as creepy, due to what's going on in the other settings. and because it lasted nearly four times longer than the actual korean war, it takes viewers into this bizarre temporal rift that doesn't work outside the world of cartoons. i've never liked this show, and i never will.
