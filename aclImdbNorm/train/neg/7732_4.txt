before writing this review, i went back and reread the reviews of others. this movie was a particular disappointment to me, since it features two of my favorite dancers, gene kelly and george chakiris, boasts a score by the often wonderous michel legrand ("wuthering heights," "ice station zebra," "the thomas crowne affair"). the dancing was stilted, unmotivated and unoriginal, the songs forgettable, the story a joke. even the costuming was not particularly flattering. only the photography correctly captured the proper mood and spirit. i'm glad other people enjoyed "the young girls of rochefort," though i most certainly did not.
