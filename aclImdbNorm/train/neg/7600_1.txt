this movie proves that good acting comes from good direction and this does not happen in ask the dust. colin farrell is usually a fine actor but in this he is juvenile. donald sutherland comes across as an amateur. why? because the script is awful, the adaptation is awful and the actors seem bored and half hearted. the atmosphere of the movie is bad - i could only think when it would finish and i turned it off half way. the director has done a very poor job and even though i have not read the novel it is certainly a missed chance. the atmosphere this film is trying to evoke and the message and storyline never reaches the audience. in one word, it is a terrible film.
