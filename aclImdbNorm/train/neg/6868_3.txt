ok, admittedly as an orthodox woman who lives in boro park, i'm going to be a little biased against this film. however, it seemed that boaz yakin's sole purpose in making this film was orthodox-bashing. with our wigs, modest attire, and separate seating, we're a pretty easy target already. yakin never made it past the surface. the result is a film with more holes than swiss cheese: 1. yosi tells sonia off for loving him more than g-d or their parents. then he deliberately defies his father's order that he not go swimming because of his poor health. 2. sonia flips out at her son's bris. why would a hasidic woman from monsey have such a strong reaction? it's hard to believe that she never attended one before. let's face it, even reform jews hold bris milah ceremonies nowadays. 3. was mendel sleeping during his chosson classes? he's supposed to satisfy his wife's passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street. especially in the middle of the busiest street in boro park! 4. sonia and mendel had to have been married for over a year, and he just now noticed that they were not meant for each other? a little clue--arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy her parents set her up with. nor will she be shunned by the community if the marriage doesn't work out. 5. if sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business that badly, she did not have to go through her lecherous brother-in-law. there are orthodox female doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. sonia came off as more whiny than sympathetic. instead of taking control of her life, she sat back and waited for things to happen, and then complained that she didn't like the outcome. that's not standing up to one's environment; that's pandering to stereotype. frankly, i think she got what she deserved.
