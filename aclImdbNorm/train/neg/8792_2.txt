this film is another example of the curse of east asian cinema: two or more separate stories rolled into one film. other reviewers have obviously picked up on it as well because there are several mentions of the "first part" and "second part". how can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and the story are featured for such a short time? i was enjoying the first part until it abruptly stopped (it didn't "end", it just stopped in what appeared to be the middle of the story) to be replaced by an inane and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around a girl rearranging and cleaning a guy's apartment (wow!) i look forward to the day when wong kar wai is given a decent script to work with!
