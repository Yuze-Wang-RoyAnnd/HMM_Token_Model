when watching this show you are not quite sure whether it is the story or the acting that is more annoying. first of all, the storyline of each episode is very predictable, the writers must have used every clich'e possible, you can guess not only the general plot, but the arrangement of the scenes and also the lines of each character, making the show some sort of a collage of every police series out there. on the top of it all comes the "message" of the show, that the good are good and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good shall prevail and that we should all love each other, be better man and better citizens, all done in the most ostensible manner. the actors, as the vehicles of this message and nothing more than that, will use a limited set of acting skills: the "i am a good carrying person" smile, the concerned look and the "victory is ours" body posture, while the bad guys have the "i'm a bad one" frowning and the "you caught me" look, followed by the "i'm good for nothing and i should be removed from society" head banding (this kind of also sums up the general development of each show). true story or not, the show is garbage, yet another proof that producers don't give a s**t about viewers, that we are all thought to be idiots. well this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the living brains out of you.
