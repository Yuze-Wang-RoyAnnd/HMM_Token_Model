why every horror director wants to imitate "the exorcist" is a complete riddle to me, as william friedkin's "classic" is a very overrated film and, in my opinion, not all that tense or shocking. and yet here's another clean rip-off, a spanish one this time, that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family. paul naschy (who i must admit looks quite hot here) plays the honorable priest who gets approached by john gibson because his sister leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. at first the priest doesn't believe it but when john's body is discovered with its neck twisted, leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable... "exorcism" is not only very unoriginal, it's also an insufferably boring film! here naschy and director juan bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore, and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that'll nearly put you to sleep! the last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, albeit very stupid, and there's quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze. the absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since paul naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money. this is just an awful film, end of story. other european "the excorcist" rip-offs are "the antichrist" and "beyond the door" and they suck as well!
