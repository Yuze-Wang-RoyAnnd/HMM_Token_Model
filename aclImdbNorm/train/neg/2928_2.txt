i'd really, really wanted to see this movie, and waited for months to get it through our blockbuster total access account. when it showed up in our mailbox, i threw it straight into the dvd player.<br /><br />i was very sadly disappointed, which in turn made me mad. i'll give any movie a chance, even if i want to walk out of the theater/press 'stop'. i watched it all the way through, but didn't get anything from it but frustration.<br /><br />the acting was very, very good, but that was about it. nothing is explained; while we understand that mathieu becomes depressed and lands in a psych ward of some kind, we're never given insight to his 'downfall'. while we understand that he and cedric break up, again, we don't see it happen or why it happened. during an interview with mathieu's doctor, cedric reveals that he'd cheated on him once, but it was no big deal. i expected to see this in flashbacks, but no--nothing. we also gets the hints that cedric was the one to bring mat to the hospital--but again, we don't see it.<br /><br />i know some movies are a 'take it as it is' basis, but this movie honestly ticked me off. when pierre, cedric's ex shows up in the club and starts trouble, we don't see hide nor hair of him until near the end, and it took me a good chunk of time to figure out that pierre was the ex. his personality at the club and when mat finds him are entirely different. i might even be wrong saying this, it was that confusing.<br /><br />the film expects you to know everything and move along with its disjointed, out-of-place and confusing pace. i can keep up with films like 'pi', 'citizen kane' and other films that have flashbacks/flash-forwards left and right, but cu didn't capture and hold onto the style. at the end of 'citizen kane', you know what's going on and discover the answer to the main mysteries. cu just leaves you hanging. it has an air of pretension in its 'we're not gonna tell you a damned thing, figure it out for yourself' presentation. it's like reading a book with the chapters switched around and pages missing.<br /><br />good acting, like i said. i liked the characters, but the whole story was just too disappointing.
