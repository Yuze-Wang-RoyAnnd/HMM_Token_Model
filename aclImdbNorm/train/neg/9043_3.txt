i went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son. he seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and i did. the writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar / disney excursion. in fact, i had a very hard time paying attention at all. the movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that i was hoping my son would fall asleep so i could pick him up and walk out.<br /><br />not to say that the film isn't an interesting concept, it's just told so oddly, (bad screenplay?) especially when we "meet the family" for the first time. i know we're supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord, they could've shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes (seemingly, i didn't actually time it). by that point i was scratching my head looking for an exit.
