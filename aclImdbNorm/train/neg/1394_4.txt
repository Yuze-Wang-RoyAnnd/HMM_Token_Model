"the brain machine" will at least put your own brain into overdrive trying to figure out what it's all about. four subjects of varying backgrounds and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and environment. since the only common denominator among them is the fact that they each have no known family should have been a tip off - none of them will be missed.<br /><br />the whole affair is supervised by a mysterious creep known only as the general, but it seems he's taking his direction from a senator who wishes to remain anonymous. good call there on the senator's part. there's also a shadowy guard that the camera constantly zooms in on, who later claims he doesn't take his direction from the general or 'the project'. too bad he wasn't more effective, he was overpowered rather easily before the whole thing went kablooey.<br /><br />if nothing else, the film is a veritable treasure trove of 1970's technology featuring repeated shots of dial phones, room size computers and a teletype machine that won't quit. perhaps that was the basis of the film's alternate title - "time warp"; nothing else would make any sense. as for myself, i'd like to consider a title suggested by the murdered dr. krisner's experiment titled 'group stress project'. it applies to the film's actors and viewers alike.<br /><br />keep an eye out just above the general's head at poolside when he asks an agent for his weapon, a boom mic is visible above his head for a number of seconds.<br /><br />you may want to catch this flick if you're a die hard gerald mcraney fan, could he have ever been that young? james best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic reverend, but don't call him father. for something a little more up his alley, try to get your hands on 1959's "the killer shrews". that one at least doesn't pretend to take itself so seriously.
