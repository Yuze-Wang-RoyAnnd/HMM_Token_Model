the idea was awesome, the actors were incredible, the story could of been very scary, but the writing was poor and there was no depth. i couldn't really get into this movie. i couldn't feel for the characters, there were a lot of cliffhangers, and the movie just ends very weirdly. was it a happy ending? i don't know. was it a sad ending? again, i don't know. you leave the theater feeling unsatisfied. the movie had so much to give, but couldn't. just because you can edit, doesn't mean you should, right? i wouldn't really recommend this movie because you just can't say that you left the movie feeling like it was completed. you'll just be confused. trust me, you will probably thank me if you don't watch this movie.<br /><br />3/10
