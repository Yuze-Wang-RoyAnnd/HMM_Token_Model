dooohhh! my bwainn hurrrts! well it certainly does after this endurance test of a film. how on earth i managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows. <br /><br />maybe it's me!!maybe i don't get the premise of the film... or maybe i don't appreciate it's alleged mystical atmosphere. in my humble opinion though the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to mcdonalds.<br /><br />in addition the characters were all dreadful and there is more character development in a tom & jerry cartoon. yaarrrghhh! why do i do it? why do i watch such tripe? it's enough to make one run away and join a monastery or the foreign legion!! yaargh!! an absolutley dreadful film in just about every respect. apart from that it's not to bad.
