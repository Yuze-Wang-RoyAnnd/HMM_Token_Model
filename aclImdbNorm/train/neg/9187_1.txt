i have watched some pretty poor films in the past, but what the hell were they thinking of when they made this movie. had the production crew turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of making it, because you sure have to be brain dead to find any enjoyment in it.<br /><br />i am a fan of most genres and enjoy "shoot 'em up" games, but merging the daft scenes from the game just made this ridiculous and unwatchable.<br /><br />as most have already said, there was hardly any script and the acting was weak. i won't waste my time describing it.<br /><br />anyone who rates this film above 4 has to be part of the production company or sega, or else they have a very warped concept of entertainment.<br /><br />i must say, i was more annoyed with the video shop, who gave this a thumbs up, which led me to rent it. thank god i had a second film to watch to restore some of my faith in movies.<br /><br />comic book guy would be right if he said "worst movie ever"!
