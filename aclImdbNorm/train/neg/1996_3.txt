this sad little film bears little similarity to the 1971 broadway revival that was such a 'nostalgic' hit. keep in mind that when burt shevelove directed that revival, he rewrote the book extensively. i have a feeling that this screenwriter wrought as much of a change from the original 1925 version as well. i played the 'innocent philanderer' jimmy smith on-stage in 1974, and thought this $1 dvd would bring back memories. not a chance. even the anticipated delight of seeing "topper" roland young play 'my' part was a major disappointment. three songs from the play remain, and are done very poorly. even the classic duet, "tea for two", is done as a virtual solo. the many familiar faces in this 1940 fiasco do not do themselves proud at all, and the star, anna neagle, just embarrasses herself. when i feel gypped by spending a dollar, i know the film must be bad. another commentator mentioned the doris day version, which is actually called "tea for two" and is about doing the stage play (the original, of course), so those who are seeking the true "no no nanette" might find a more recognizable version there.
