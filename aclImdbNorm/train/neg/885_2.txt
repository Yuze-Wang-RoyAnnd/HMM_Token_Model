an anthology is always risky business and i think this endeavor should be praised. there's a lot of talent involved here. a great many talented actors, directors and writers. unfortunately, i couldn't really enjoy this movie based on three issues i had.<br /><br />first of all, the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality. and unfortunately some of them clash with the others. <br /><br />secondly, several segments feel underdeveloped to me. like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition. i'm not talking about happy endings here (or even an ending period) but rather, they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in. <br /><br />last but not least, i did not feel new-york and its inhabitants were properly portrayed.<br /><br />what you're left with is high-brow short films that may still be of interest to some but will leave the average viewer unsatisfied.
