the fact that this movie has been entitled to the most successful movie in switzerland's film history makes me shake my head! it's true, but pitiful at the same time. a flick about the swiss army could be a good deal better.<br /><br />the story sounds interesting, at the beginning: antonio carrera (michael koch) gets forced to absolve his military training by the army while he is in the church, wedding his love laura moretti (mia aegerter).<br /><br />the acting in some way doesn't really differ from just a few recruits getting drunk and stoned in the reality. melanie winiger plays her role as the strong michelle bluntschi mediocre, personally i found her rather annoying. <br /><br />the storyline contains a comedy combined with a romance, which does not work as expected. the romance-part is too trashy, and the comedy-part is not funny at all, it's just a cheap try and does not change throughout the whole movie whatsoever. it's funny for preadolescent 12-13 year olds, but not for such as those who search an entertaining comedy. the humor is weak except for some shots.<br /><br />dope? cool! stealing? cool! if you want a proper comedy about the swiss rs, make sure you did not absolve your military training yet, and even then don't expect too much!<br /><br />i'll give it 4 out of 10 stars, because marco rima is quite funny during his screen time. not a hell of a lot screen time though
