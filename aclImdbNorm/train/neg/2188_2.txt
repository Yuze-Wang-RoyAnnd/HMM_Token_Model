following a car accident, a mad scientist(jason evers) keeps the head of his fiancee(virgina leith)alive. he then goes on the prowl looking for the perfect body to make her whole again. pretty lame all the way around, nothing redeeming here. also in the cast are: leslie daniels, bonnie sharie and bruce brighton. someone should have helped put this one out of its misery. let it die.
