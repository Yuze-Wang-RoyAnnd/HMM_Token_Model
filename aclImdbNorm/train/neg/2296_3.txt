"back of beyond" takes place at a dive diner/gas station in the middle of the australian desert run by tom mcgregor (paul mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive. we get what, at first, confusingly seems like a flashback in which he and his sister (though their relationship to each other is better understood later in the film) are speeding through the desert on his motorcycle. afterwards, he appears as a terribly quiet, and sometimes, moody character in the presence of the arrivals.<br /><br />we know one thing is for sure and that is mcgregor's sort of spiritual sense, his foresight of danger and such--his clairvoyance only slightly relevant to the story, the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves who's car breaks down and who rely on tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way. of course, tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named charlie, and suddenly, it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other. but not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action. in fact, the whole movie all the while seems to want to build up to something significant, but really fails to do so. even the ending, of which plays out like a trite campfire tale (and one that really reveals a lot of narrative flaws), is almost just as ridiculous.<br /><br />it may be worth trying if you don't mind the terribly slow pacing, but are in the mood, at least, for something a little different than the usual.
