i saw this movie the other day in a film school class, and i hadn't seen an almodovar movie before but went in expecting it to be good. unfortunately, it turned out to be a pointless film with only a couple of laughs mixed in with two hours of sheer boredom. high heels is just a collection of random scenes that might have worked in their own separate movies but together don't add up to any kind of meaningful whole at all.<br /><br />or so i thought. then, the next day, my film professor spent the entire class period explaining all of the movie's hidden little details, like how the mural depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is some kind of commentary on the lack of identity that spain as a nation has developed under fascist rule. apparently, the whole movie is chock full of clever little visual tricks and references like this.<br /><br />great, but you know what? it's still a bad movie. it takes more than depth and complexity to make a good film--you still need to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention, something to interest the viewer enough to actually care about all the subtle tricks. high heels gives us strange, off-beat characters but keeps them in mostly mundane situations recycled from other movies, and almodovar doesn't seem to be using them to make any kind of point. what is the significance, for example, of the hitchcockian surprise character revelation that occurs towards the end of the film? why is that even in there? just to surprise us?<br /><br />there is one funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast. and that's it, that's the only entertaining moment. the rest of the movie is just nonsensical filmic references and visual cues that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart pedro almodovar is. but no matter what my film professor says, it takes more than self-indulgent trickery for a movie to be good.
