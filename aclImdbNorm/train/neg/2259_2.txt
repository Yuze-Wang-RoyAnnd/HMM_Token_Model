for the life of me, i cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the "jerry springer show". it's so incrediably trashy. some ways, sadly it's a guilty pleasure. we all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. it's part of our pop culture. i saw this on usa recently. it's pretty bad. i will admit that. jerry does a horrible job of what i think he meant as acting. or something like it. jamie pressley is in it. she's playing herself basically. all she needed was her lover boy, kid rock. it would've been perfect then. so, i would recommend skipping "ringmaster". just watch the "jerry springer show". it's more enjoyable than this.<br /><br />2/10
