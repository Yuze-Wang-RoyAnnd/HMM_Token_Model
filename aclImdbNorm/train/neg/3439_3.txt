*****probably minor spoilers******<br /><br />i cant say i liked it, but i cant say i didn't...its very strange. it has bad things in it like for example a shark that came out of nowhere with the worst cgi you can imagine,if i was the director i would cut that part for sure, gave me the urge to stop seeing the rest of the movie... for some people it will be boring cause it lacks action, feels home made sometimes... take for example a scene that one of the friends died and next thing they are doing is what? nop,not crying...their telling horror stories to each other..*sighs*(just after crying for hes lost)<br /><br />another stupid thing was when they were talking inside the boat they had like "hundreds" of candles in the table in front of them...the boat is surrounded by some kind of rag curtains(old rags covering the windows) and sofas/couches ...i thought it was dumb, using candles but not thinking about the surroundings, besides being in high sea alone...<br /><br />the good, some scary scenes they are nicely done i liked some. sometimes horror works better when its hidden when its behind something instead of showing of, so this movie does it good, maybe because its a low budget i don't know, but it works fine for me! you will feel tension if you forget some holes like the ones i mentioned above.<br /><br />do not expect much of it! but if you like anykind of movie watch this one, be patient, try to enjoy.. lol<br /><br />(sorry about my raw english) =)<br /><br />cheers
