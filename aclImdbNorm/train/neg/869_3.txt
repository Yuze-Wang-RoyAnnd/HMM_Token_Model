where to start... if this movie had been a dark comedy, i would say it was fannn-tastic! unfortunately for me, and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare (mind you that was the price i paid, got it from wal-mart), this movie was meant to be a thriller. the only thrill i got was watching kirkland's lousy rendition of anne wilkes from misery sans snowy woodland area. if you want a good laugh, on a rainy friday night with some friends, then i highly recommend this movie. but if you want to watch something at least half way decent, then don't even bother.<br /><br />i for one enjoy crappy films, the worse the better in most cases. but wow... i meant wow!! the only person in the entire film that didn't stink it up was the little boy, played by vincent berry. the only reason why i even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do.
