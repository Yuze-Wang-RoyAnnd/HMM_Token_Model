this cannon movie tale is the worst of the lot, and is positive proof that a five minute fable does not a full-length film make. poor sid caesar as the vain emperor, is made to look so stupid, it's hard to watch him. as the sly tailor, robert morse hasn't an ounce of charm. neither does his hapless nephew (jason carter) the "songs" are dreadful and only slow what there is of the plot down. the direction is practically nonexistent, and the supporting characters add very little. lysette anthony is pretty as the emperor's daughter, but her voice has obviously been dubbed for some reason, a fate shared by many of the minor players. and the film crawls at a snails pace. hans christian andersen must have been turning somersaults in his grave when this appeared. it can honestly be said, at least of this movie tale, it's no surprise that it went straight to video oblivion.
