i grew up baptist and i know the story this movie is trying to tell, although i no longer believe the story. i'll give the movie kudos for being as good as the average lifetime movie of the week. mildly interesting, mediocre acting, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is sappy, and it is a bit melodramatic. and all the people left behind have got to be the squeakiest clean non-christians, ever. not a single curse word from any of them. but i laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the united nations pronounced "nuclear" as "nu-cu-ler," just like bush. is there some christian code of honor that mandates that since bush claims he, too, is called by god, that all christians must cover up his ignorance by mispronouncing that word the same way he does? lol! i really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that. after the "nu-cu-ler" incident, the movie began to feel like packaged, manipulative propaganda. i was looking for something bold. actually, i was looking for something that might make me think, but i didn't find it here. if you're looking for mindless entertainment, stop here - it's good for killing a rainy afternoon. but if you're looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
