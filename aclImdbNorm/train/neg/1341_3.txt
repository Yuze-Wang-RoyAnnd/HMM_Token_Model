following the success of the (awful) gilligan's island tv movie reruns, a number of tv movies were made in the 1980's reuniting casts from classic shows. most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humor that made the shows so special. the munsters revenge is among the most disappointing because it goes for a laurel and hardy-type comedy style that really wasn't in the original series. yvonne de carlo, a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series, is completely wasted - she has less time here in this 90 minute movie than she did in any single 30 minute episode. and since the roles of "eddie" and "marilyn" in this movie are nothing more than cameos, what was the point of making them younger and recasting them? with very little rewriting, they could have used butch patrick and pat priest. although seeing some of the munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch, i didn't enjoy sid caesar as the hammy mad scientist mainly because there's too much of him and not enough of the underused munsters (ironically that very year, 1981, caesar's old partner in comedy, imogene coca, was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a tv movie reunion return of the beverly hillbillies). another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the munster family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum. why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a "typical" (if strange) american family, not famous monsters? this was the last munsters project featuring the original cast in their roles, there was an awful revival of the series in the late 1980's with a completely new cast and a 1990's tv movie which featured decarlo, lewis, priest, and patrick in cameo roles as a family dining.
