notorious for more than a quarter century (and often banned), it's obscurity was its greatest asset it seems. hey, it's often better to be talked about, rather than actually seen when you can't back the "legend" up with substance.<br /><br />the film has played in los angeles a couple of times recently, and is available on home video, so that veil is slowly being lifted. while there is still plenty to offend the masses, it is more likely to bore them, than arouse much real passion. except for a gratuitous and protracted xxx sex scene between a pair of horses ("nature documentary" anyone?), there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama. <br /><br />once the sex and nudity begins, it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation, a looooooooong flashback to an alleged 'beauty and the beast' encounter, and a naked woman running around the mansion (nobody, even her supposedly protective aunt, seems to even think of putting some clothes on her!). on video, i guess you can fast-forward thru the banality, but it's not really worth the effort. the nudity doesn't go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as bertolucci's the dreamers.<br /><br />try as one might to find some 'moral' or 'symbolism' in the carnality, i doubt it's worthy of anyone's effort. unfortunately, for la bete, now that you can more easily see the film, the notoriety of something once 'forbidden' has been lifted. and this beast has been tamed.
