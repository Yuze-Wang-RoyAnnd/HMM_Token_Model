another case of a decent dvd case betraying the shot-on-video quality of the film. <br /><br />it wasn't that bad. rochon does a serviceable job and damn! the cast is good looking. i've never seen that many musclebound guys hang out together on a regular basis. this movie really wanted to make you think rochon was the killer, but it was not to be. my biggest problem with the film was that by the end, i didn't much care who was the killer, and the real killer made little sense, since it was out of the blue and the filmmakers were thinking 'ha, betcha didn't see that one coming, sucker!'. yeah, there were continuity errors about (mainly with ms. rochon's ever-changing wardrobe), but for an indie slasher it's not that bad. i was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless, but that was just a gimmick. the dialog was overly think and painful at times.<br /><br />just don't have high expectations going into this, and it won't be that bad. and lloyd kaufman's cameo is wonderfully understated.
