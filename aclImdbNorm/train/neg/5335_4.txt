it's been a looooonnnggg time since i saw this comedy, and i'd forgotten just how idiotic it is. i'd place this easily in the lower two or three of elvis presley's very worst movies. presley plays joe whitecloud, a half-breed indian bull rider who returns home to arizona and the broken-down shack where his family lives, and where his friends love to party all night long. his parents are played by burgess meredith and katy jurado, and his old indian grandpa is thomas gomez. none of the three offer anything of substance , comically or otherwise. the government has invested in the family's cattle, but they're lacking a bull. elvis gets to sing just a few utterly worthless songs, and is pursued by a young boy-crazy gal and her gun-toting mother. this is just a real slapdash of a mess, and the dilapidated surroundings practically stink of manure and don't make this much easier. the one thing that puzzles me, however, is that elvis actually seems to be having a good time in the film. hard to believe, considering he got so upset about being stuck making so many mediocre movies.
