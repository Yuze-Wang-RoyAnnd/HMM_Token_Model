i got the dvd from the library in the expectation of getting a good idea of how things go on in the background at a major opera production. i have to say, i was very disappointed. the subject had so much potential. the sets in a wagnerian production must, of necessity, be elaborate and impressive and the story behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience. instead, what we get it a hodgepodge of clips of people moving around big items of scenery, vaguely help together with a commentary which failed to hold my attention. i found myself listening primarily to the background clips of music from operas. i was impressed by the sheer enormity of the effort required to put on such a production - that did come across fairly well and next time i am at the opera i am sure i will remember that part if this video - but was left feeling somewhat cheated by the lack of detailed commentary and explanation.
