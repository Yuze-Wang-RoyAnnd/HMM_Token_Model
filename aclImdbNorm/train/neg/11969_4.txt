if you like to be entertained, do not go see this movie. if you like to see heroics of war, do not go see this movie. if you like to see good acting and an excellent screenplay, do not go see this movie. if you like typical hollywood war films that end just in time to give a politically charged appeal to the public about the greatness and glory of war, go see this movie. otherwise, don't waste your time. i am always interested in war movies because i think that if they are done well, they can teach us something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war. this film shows a bunch of guys running around the countryside, saying whorrible cliche lines, doing the most predictable things, and defending the oppressed with the same exact force and brutality that was being given to the oppressed. this film is a disgrace to filmmaking and to the united states of america! can you imagine being a person from europe or africa, or any other country and watching this, being told that this is how americans truly are? no wonder everyone hates us! please, please, please, don't waste your time on this piece of junk; if you must, wait and rent it. 4/10
