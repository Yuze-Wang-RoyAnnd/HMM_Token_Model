[***possible spoilers***] this movie's reputation precedes it, so it was with anticipation that i sat down to watch it in letterbox on tcm. what a major disappointment.<br /><br />the cast is superb and the production values are first-rate, but the characters are without depth, the plot is thin, and the whole thing goes on too long. for a movie that deals with alcoholism, family divisions, unfaithfulness, gambling, and sexual repression, the movie is curiously flat, prosaic, lifeless, and cliche-ridden. one example is the portrayal of frank hirsch's unfaithfuness: his rather heavy-handed request to his wife to "go upstairs and relax a bit" followed by her predictable pleading of a headache, leads - even more predictably - to his evening liaison with his secretary ("hey nancy, i've got the blues tonight. let's go for a drive"), all according to well-worn formula. we don't feel these are real people, but cardboard cutouts acting in a marionette play. also, the source of the obvious friction between frank and dave hirsch is never really explored or explained. dave's infatuation with the on-again/off-again gwen is inexplicable in light of her fatuous inability to defecate or get off the pot. his subsequent marriage of desperation to the shirley maclaine/ginny character is, from the moment of its being presented to this viewer, anyway, obviously doomed to fail, and it was clear - by the conventions of this type of soap opera - that it could only be resolved by someone being killed. the moment the jealous lover started running around with the gun i started a bet with myself as to who - dave or ginny - would get killed. the whole thing was phony with a capital 'p'. <br /><br />having said that, maclaine's performance and that of dean martin are the standouts here. but on the whole i find the movie's interest to be purely that of a period piece of hollywood history.
