first off i want to say that this film is worthy of more than the four stars i rated it. i gave it four stars because for me this 86 minute movie always seems like 2 and a half hours and is not engaging enough to sit through it all. however, "the big alligator river" (the title my dvd calls it) is better than your average nature strikes back movie.<br /><br />a tourist resort in the jungles of southeast asia is just opening and employs the natives while trying to manipulate the wildlife around. mother nature seeking revenge comes in the form of the god kroona, a giant alligator. but the creature isn't the only thing the tourists and the main characters (a photographer and the resort staff) have to worry about, the natives are getting rubbed the wrong way too.<br /><br />this movie is a pretty well-done adventure/horror story with a good musical score and direction. but the alligator itself, the main attraction of the movie, is obviously fake looking. some of the close-ups of its jaws are good but that should be all we need to see. some of the underwater far-away shots make it painfully obvious that what we are really dealing with is an alligator squeaky-toy you can probably get at a zoo souvenir shop. but the natives are believable, if not authentic.<br /><br />probably not the movie that will give you non-stop thrills, if any, but shot and produced well enough to be given good mention. and like a lot of creature movies, this one ends with an extremely high body count. it also has lots of good jungle scenery. acting is below par though, but who was expecting it to be better, eh? <br /><br />much, much better than its recent american counterpart "primeival" but nothing to be compared with "jaws". but remember it may not be engaging at a few points.
