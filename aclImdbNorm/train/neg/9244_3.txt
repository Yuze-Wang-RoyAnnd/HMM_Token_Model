one can deal with historical inaccuracies, but this film was just too much. practically nothing was even close to truth, and even for the era, it was seen as silly.<br /><br />in defense of ford, it was revealed on an old talk show, that he was operating on the story as told to him by the real wyatt earp, who was obviously old, senile, and replayed the scene his own way. earp told the director about the stagecoach, and how it was planned to happen during the stagecoach arrival, so despite what other historians claim, wyat himself asserts that it was premeditated.<br /><br />this movie portrays earp as an honest man, and also his brothers. history doesn't exactly say they were or weren't. most people like to interject a bit of deceit and lawlessness into their characters, but that is nothing new. the truth is probably closer to them being the law abiding sorts of gunfight at the ok corral. men who saw it as a career, and believe me, in the old west, you didn't have time to think about too much else.<br /><br />characters that don't exist, characters depicted dying at the corral who really didn't, all make this a weaker film. it is further weakened by mature, who really didn't make a convincing doc. he may be the worst cast choice ever for doc, but at the same time we must remember that older movies were closer to the era and closer to a feel for the truth. after all, ford did get information first hand from wyatt earp.<br /><br />it is also weakened by the all so predictable events involving the mexican girl. hollywood was very pro nazi in those days, and ready to kill off brunette women in very predictable fashion to show their patronage to hitler idealism. this occurs in most movies until the eighties. it is no excuse, and does cheapen the art, however.<br /><br />the actors who play the earps do well, and brennan is always a thrill. in fact, mature may be the only acting downside of this flick. still, it is the weakest of the old ok corral movies.
