i'm not saying that because the production values were so low, but because it was filmed terribly. that shot of the girl washing her hair in the creek? did we really need to sit there for an overlong shot and watch her do that for 5 minutes in the same spot? it was terrible, the lighting was just plain bad. you could barely see anything and when the characters were talking, you could barely hear what they were saying. did i watch the whole movie? of course not i skipped through most of it, and i don't want to hear anyone say i need to watch the whole thing first to judge it. this film was so poorly done and executed that even by independent and low budget standards it's just plain terrible. awful movie...don't waste any time on it unless you want a good laugh, but even then it's not because of the actors "funny" lines, it's because of how painstakingly bad the production is.
