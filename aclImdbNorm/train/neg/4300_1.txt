buford's beach bunnies gives b-grade t&a films a bad name. as a fan of the genre, i was appalled to find little attempt being made to exploit the young actresses talents. i refer specifically to the distinct lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes. what are the next generation of sad teenage boys watching this on late night tv supposed to think?
