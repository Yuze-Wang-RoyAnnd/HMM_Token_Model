i really wanted to like this movie - the location shots were mostly filmed in pittsburgh and the trailer had some wonderful photography. but, even for a filmed cartoon, it was a really badly-made movie. the continuity and pacing were both simply awful. the best bits in the movie are under the ending credits, so it's (almost) worth sticking it out to the end (though, oddly, it does pick up a little over the last half hour or so).<br /><br />when the best performance in a movie is by andy dick, you know there's got to be a problem...
