i have been watching horror movies since i was 5 years old, beginning with childs play.since then, i have seen good horror movies and bad, but this is without question, the dumbest movie i have ever seen! the actors did all they could with the material. the plot was just idiotic. plus , it was just all gore. i can stomach a lot of blood, but that was just ridiculous! in one of the scenes, a character gets stabbed in the rear end and choked with his intestines! plain stupid! another problem with this movie is that its boring and probably the slowest movie ever made. the end of it is just dumb. but then again, it goes with the rest of it! at the end, when the girl gets away from the cannibal/ancestor, she receives help from a old lady. the old lady is making tea, but when she turns around to talk to the girl, the girl attacks her! she turned into a cannibal! retarded movie.
