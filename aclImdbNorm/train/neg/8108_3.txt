after reading the book, which had a lot of meaning for me, the movie didn't give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed. this makes me wonder if kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else.either that or he is simply bad. most importantly where is the lightness?! from the very first scene, music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling, and this continues right through the movie. i think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie, this would make the story feel light- however they have completely failed here. instead the music manages to give everything that 'movie feel', in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them, so that everything actually feels heavy.<br /><br />another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line making it more dramatic. in the movie we see franz passing tomas on the street, who is on his way to see sabina. the introduction of this chance meeting/passing, which im sure didn't happen in the book, gives tomas' story more significance than it does make it light.<br /><br />there are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed, imo for the worst, however this might have been done because the book simply doesn't convert well into a movie, such is kundera's style. this makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book and movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film. a film which is as long as it is uncompelling. for those who haven't read the book yet i recommend just reading that. for those who have, i have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stay-clear warnings.
