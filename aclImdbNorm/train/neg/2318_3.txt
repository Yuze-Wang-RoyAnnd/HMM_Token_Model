kid found as a baby in the garbage and raised at a martial arts academy has a knack for sinking baskets. with the help of the man who found him he gets in to college and is promoted to the championship as he searches for his real parents. infinitely better in pieces action comedy is a real mess as a whole. it seems to be striving for a hipper basketball version of shaolin soccer, but the comedy is scatter shot, its focus wanders more than a chihuahua with add on quadruple espresso. i kept asking "what am i watching". i watched it from start to finish and i still don't know what the hell happened. its a shame since there are some great action scenes, some amusing jokes and the occasional moment, but nothing, none of it ever comes together, i'd take a pass.
