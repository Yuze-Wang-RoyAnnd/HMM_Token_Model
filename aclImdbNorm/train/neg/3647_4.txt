it's a good thing i didn't watch this while i was pregnant.i definitely would have cried my eyes out and/or vomit. it was kind of gruesome mainly disturbing. i personally thought the baby was adorable in its own twisted little way.however as a mom i cringed when beth stabbed herself in the stomach and when virgina aborted the child during her 3rd trimester with rusty utensils no less.also,as an animal lover i almost cried when she scratched the cat to a bloody pulp.however,as creepy and sinister as the baby was i was rooting for it to live.and as twisted as the movie was i am extremely intrigued to see the sequel...... ......... ....... ......... ......... ....... ...... .....
