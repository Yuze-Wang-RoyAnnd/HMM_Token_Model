normally, i don't like revenge films....period. but double impact has a little more than your typical revenge plot premise. you see, di has action, accuracy, exotic locales(i.e. hong kong), awesome gun battles, and enough martial arts to satisfy your cravings for impressive unarmed combat. like all revenge flicks, it has villains you'd love to throw out of a plate-glass window on the top floor of a 40-story building! however, double impact has none of the sensationalist crap that suffocates the plot and the elitist, racist, and venomous social stereotypes that invaded "eye for an eye" and "death wish 2".<br /><br />but in the plot department double impact is as transparent as saran wrap. chad and alex's parents were killed by a mob hit squad connected to a family friend with money problems or at least that's what i remembered. the explanation of why the boys were talking in french accents is a lousy one. it wasn't the watery plot that made this movie bad, but the use of clich'ed lines and moves from other movies (from lethal weapon to the princess bride) really made it worse. but nonetheless double impact is still watchable. but why is that shitty movies like this have villains(for example,that greedy british guy that killed chad and alex's parents and that lethal lesbian redhead chick) you would love to hate with fiber of your being?
