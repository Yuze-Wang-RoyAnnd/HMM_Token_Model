i am a great fan of david lynch and have everything that he's made on dvd except for hotel room & the 2 hour twin peaks movie. so, when i found out about this, i immediately grabbed it and...and...what is this? it's a bunch of crudely drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and foul mouthed and unfunny. maybe i don't know what's good, but maybe this is just a bunch of crap that was foisted on the public under the name of david lynch to make a few bucks, too. let me make it clear that i didn't care about the foul language part but had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors might have. all in all this is a highly disappointing release and may well have just been left in the deluxe box set as a curiosity. i highly recommend you don't spend your money on this. 2 out of 10.
