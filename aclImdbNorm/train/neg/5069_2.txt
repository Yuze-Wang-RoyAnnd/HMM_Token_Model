i have a severe problem with this show, several actually. a simple list will suffice for now, i'll go into more depth later on: superficial characters, a laugh-track and boring humour.<br /><br />if you don't wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior (as if you see anything in this show i didn't) to a frequently irked teen from canada i'll summarize: friends sucks, not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the tv audiences for new, good shows (arrested development, dexter etc.). friends is as much to blame for reality tv, "two and a half men" and "the king of queens" as the television executives. now then, on with the review.<br /><br />these characters have no soul, they are exactly the same in every way (outside of gender and hair colour). they react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies. where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it? why isn't rachel storming out on monica after monica starts hanging out with rachel's enemy? why doesn't joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously? oh right, cause he's the dumb one and he's comfortable with that. this is the curse of having perfect characters: lasting conflict and (god forbid) personality becomes an impossibility.<br /><br />the laugh-track is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born. any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny. how can i make such a broad generalization? when a show that claims to be "comedy" requires laughter from someone besides the audience it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it. laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks. humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity (see the office, arrested development).<br /><br />this leads to my next point: the humour is boring. there is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous (without a laugh-track apparently) simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws. so what if monica dated a 17 year old? she immediately recognizes that what she is doing isn't right and breaks up with him. there has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution. maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him. that would be great, it would be like a custody battle! so now i've provided evidence for my position. many of my friends love this show because they haven't heard of curb your enthusiasm or arrested development, many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching curb your enthusiasm or arrested development. <br /><br />i have watched very little of "friends" in my life, but i have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show, in my opinion, completely unwatchable. if you've read this far, thank you, and i hope you at least start watching some of the shows i have mentioned.
