how did such a terrible script manage to attract this cast? ridiculous, predictable and thoroughly unbelievable, this is well-acted and slickly directed, but the material is so bad it still qualifies as one of the all-time worst thrillers i've seen in years. amazingly bad, and not in a fun way. avoid at all costs, even if you're a fan of someone in the cast.
