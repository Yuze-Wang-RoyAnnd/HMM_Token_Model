i saw this movie twice. i can't believe pintilie made such a fantasy movie. i'm also a movie/theatre director and i know what i speak. this is not romania anymore, but i see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 september. no story, no plot, nothing. no conclusion, no message, nothing profound, nothing hidden. just empty images.<br /><br />what most of romanians don't know, this movie is for the french viewers, not for us. they really believe that is the reality in romania. also for teenagers. pintilie should stop making movies. i don't really know if we can call this a movie, maybe a horror :) and we wonder why we've got such an image in europe. this was a reality, but isn't anymore. a good friend of mine from the brithish embassy said: "you have no idea what a long way romanian people walked from ceausescu".
