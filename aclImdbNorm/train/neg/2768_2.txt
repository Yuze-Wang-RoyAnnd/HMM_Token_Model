this movie was horrible.<br /><br />they didn't develop any of the characters at all and the storyline was played out horribly. it was a definite sleeper. you'd expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points but d-wars surprises you with even a let down in that department. <br /><br />also, the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick. and i seriously mean that.<br /><br />i was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause it was just that bad!!! please, whatever you do people, don't waste your time and money on a crappy movie like d-wars.
