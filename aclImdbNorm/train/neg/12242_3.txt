i expected a bad movie, and got a bad movie. but i couldn't really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was. i don't even want to try to explain what blood surf is about. is not about blood surfing, but a big a$$ crocodile. they are complaining about the fake shark in jaws, but spielberg was wise and didn't show the shark until the end. here the crocodile is shown a lot of times, and it's the worst fake crocodile i have ever seen, and they don't try to hide it. if you want to see a good fake crocodile watch lake placid. <br /><br />the director had an opportunity to make a decent surf/shark movie, but he had to make a bad b-monster movie. he had the chance to make an original surf movie, but he wanted to make a monster movie. so you have understand how bad this movie is, does it have some good parts? not really, it got some nudity, and a sex scene that is taken straight out of a playboy movie. the acting isn't half bad either, and kate fischer looks good. too bad she doesn't take her top off. the lead actors aren't bad either. they had some potential. the location was beautiful and the movie start good with some nice surf scenes. the blame is on the untalented writer and director. the dialogue is some of the worst i have ever seen, and the script is really badly written, and the director got no talent what so ever, and not much of a fantasy either.<br /><br />don't watch it. even if you want to watch the beautiful kate fischer. it isn't worth it. watch sirens to watch kate nude, and watch lake placid if you want some good crocodile action.<br /><br />3/10 because i'm in a good mood, and maureen larrazabal looks good naked, and kate looks good (but is bad actress,)and dex miller, joel west and matt borlenghi did a good job with the piece of sh#t they had to work with.
