there is only one problem with this website, you can't give a negative rating. additionally a mate rated this as a d grade movie. i say he was being too nice. a piece of wood could show more emotion that the actors in this movie, and the money used to produce this movie would have been better used to start a fire. this is absolutely terrible, 2 hours of life that anyone who endures this untalented bloodbath will never get back. after watching 5 minutes, myself and the boys wondered if sinking bulk heavies would make this anymore entertaining. half a carto and a bottle of 151 later i finally found some of this g grade acting remotely funny. it's an insult upon this entire planet that the director thought anyone could find anything beneficial from this more, he should go and buy a rope. and to the actors in this flick, i hope you got paid well to be in this joke because i doubt you will ever work again. in summary i fine everyone in this movie 100 grand and 12 demerit points off your acting licence.
