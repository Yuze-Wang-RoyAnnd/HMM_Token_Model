this movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop. ram gopal verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie "sholay", but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and... i guess leave all the good parts of the movie (acting, script, songs, music, comedy, action etc) out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew. waste of money, waste of time. after making movies like rangeela, satya, and company he pulled a coppola (godfather) on us; what were you thinking rgv? anyways, the story is, though hard to follow, is almost like the old sholay. ajay devgan playing heero (beeru, sholay) and ajay, new kid on the block playing ajay (jay,sholay). both "bad yet funny" friends help a cop capture a bad guy first. later in the movie, now retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted bubban played by amitabh bachan. in case you haven't been watching bollywood movies, the good guys win in the end. there i just saved you 3 precious hours of your life!
