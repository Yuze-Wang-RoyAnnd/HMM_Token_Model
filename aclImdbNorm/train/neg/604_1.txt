i was so disgusted by this film, i felt obligated to warn off others. this film has no story, plot or hint of purpose. the film starts after the standard "lets be scary" movie intro, which by now every film watcher has become accustomed. so we can ignore the beginning completely. we are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching static. (unless you have seen white noise - eek) acting is a disgrace and all of them should return to the travelling pantomime from where they came. having said that, even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able. their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster. senseless violence and what i can only assume is the written word of yet another junked up "eccentric" writer, who probably considers himself to be an artist, has resulted in a film which will test your patience. it was not until my fellow watcher turned to me and said, "we have been watching this for 45 mins" did i realise that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag. clearly something was missing and unfortunately it wasn't the audience. rather than suggest what the film is missing, let me tell you what it has: dumb blonde (surprise surprise), victims, bad-monster-guy-thing, about 2 mins of storyline which is stretched over hours, days, weeks, months... and credits.<br /><br />want a silver lining? well, the blonde girl is a bit saucy looking in some of the scenes, but expect to want to see her face ripped off for the rest of the film!
