- a newlywed couple move into the home of the husband's dead former wife. it's not long before the new wife begins to have the feeling that someone doesn't want her in the house. she sees skulls all around the house. but when the husband investigates, he can't find anything. is someone trying to drive her back to the asylum that she was recently discharged from? or, is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house? <br /><br />- this is the first time that i've watched the screaming skull without the assistance of the mst3k crew. and, it will in all likelihood be the last time i watch it this way. can you say dull? i'm not talking ordinary dull - i'm talking watching grass grow dull. there are great stretches of the movie where nothing happens. the screen could have gone blank and i would have gotten as much entertainment out of it. the characters drone on and on with the most monotonous conversations imaginable. the screaming skull could probably be marketed as a sleep aide.<br /><br />- the actors don't help matters much. most of them deliver lines with the conviction normally reserved for a grade school play. i haven't looked it up, but i would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this movie ever appeared in anything of cinematic value. i won't even go into the script the actors are given to work with. let's just say that the characters are given some of the most idiotic lines ever uttered on film.<br /><br />- you've been warned! either avoid this one at all costs or, at least, seek out the mst3k version.
