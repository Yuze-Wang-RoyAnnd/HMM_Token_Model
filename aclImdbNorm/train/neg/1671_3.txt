i saw this in the market place at the cannes film festival. <br /><br />it's a real cheapo prod - nothing wrong with that but you have to make up for it with a bit of sex or gore or both. <br /><br />think larry cohen. <br /><br />sean young is an interesting actor - well done to the producers for hooking her i guess.<br /><br />the opening scene in the space-ship coming down is hilarious - you could picture all the crew hands shaking it around! <br /><br />ha ha - but i wish the people who made this well - at least it's not pretentious.
