six different couples. six different love stories. six different love angles. eighty numbers of audience in the movie theater. looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screen.<br /><br />i am sitting in somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie. all stories have got no link with each other, but somewhere down the line nikhil advani trying to show some relation between them. i tried to find out a few lines i could write as review but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes found nothing to write. the movie is a poor copy of hollywood blockbuster love actually.<br /><br />my suggestion. don't watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie.
