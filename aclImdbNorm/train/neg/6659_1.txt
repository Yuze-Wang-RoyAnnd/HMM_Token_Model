during the first 3 seasons fairly odd parents was as tasty as hard candy, bright and sweet and addictive. now it's as tasty as pepto-bismol. and unfortunately pepto-bismol is what you'll need after viewing the more recent episodes, where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence resulting in no laughs. cosmo, once one of the more endearing nick characters, has devolved into an abusive unfunny cretin that the cast of family guy wouldn't even want to know. timmy has become a selfish arrogant jerkwad that bart simpson would happily beat the snot out of (and given timmy's snottiness, that would take a lot of beating). and poor wanda...a real charmer who's become the victim of her husband and godchild, she's now labeled a "nag" for caring about the well-being of others. plus cosmo's stupidity causes pain to everyone else but he's never punished for it, nor does he learn any lessons. which pretty much sums up butch hartman's attitude towards kids: they're crude, vulgar and not too bright. thank god this crummy toon has been cancelled, along with butch hartman's darling, danny phantom. at least butch got what he deserved - unlike cosmo.
