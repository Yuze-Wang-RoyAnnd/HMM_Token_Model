serge farnel made a very precise critics of this film in the revue "the rwandese night" (www.lanuitrwandaise.net)<br /><br />a critics which shows how france was behind all the situation undergone by the united nations in rwanda.<br /><br />the un soldiers were in a dangerous situation while the french soldiers were warmly welcomed by the genocide forces.<br /><br />the day before, ten un soldiers had been killed by the genocide forces.<br /><br />that is why the un soldiers decided to protect their own lives by driving behind the french trucks.<br /><br />by doing so, they gave up the tutsi which is unforgivable of course.<br /><br />but we must keep in mind that the french soldiers organized this situation.
