gadar is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake story.it's too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol movie that is aimed to bash pakistan.the movie's aim is to misguide the viewers so they can think that pakistan and it's government is bad but trying to hide their own flaws won't work.and all the songs and music of the movie are all bad.most likely the sikhs will love th movie cause they are being misguided.the movie sucks and sucks with power. i think only amisha patel was good in the movie. if i can give 0 out of 10 i would but the lowest is 1.please save 3 hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie .disaster.
