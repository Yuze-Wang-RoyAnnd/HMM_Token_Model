i got this dvd well over 2 years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday. i don't know why it took me so long as i do like the inspector gadget show and even the new gadget and the gadgetinis. while it may have a bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie, there are some old things missing that bog this gadget right down the toilet.<br /><br />first of all the classic inspector gadget theme song and music is completely absent. the composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but it's still just no good enough. the gadget-mobile is now a talking car, not a car that can turn into a van. plus it looks a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool. penny no longer has her computer book and she and brain hardly make an appearance at all.<br /><br />the plot is non-existent. there's something about a transformation formula and doctor claw using for some never revealed evil but that's all i got. what the deal was with the short/giant italian guy i will never know. it had nothing to do with anything.<br /><br />and if the title is anything to go by, his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever. and he stays on the force so why it's called 'last case' is a mystery also.<br /><br />i wasn't impressed at all. this is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on dvd, but don't let that prompt you into buying whatever inspector gadget dvds you can. i sold this mere seconds after finally watching it. no kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it.
