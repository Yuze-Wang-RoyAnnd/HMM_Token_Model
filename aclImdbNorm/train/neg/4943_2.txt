i have watched 3 episodes of caveman, and i have no idea why i continue except maybe waiting for it to get better. <br /><br />to me this show is just pumping itself off the commercials, with no real humor. as we sat around watching these shows, we all speculated on what was going to happen.<br /><br />the episode of the woman cave-woman with a attitude was actually a big, yea right, for us. she's crude in a theater and acts tough to strangers, and truth be told, she needed a slap<br /><br />i consider myself a pretty good reviewer, taking in everything, but i must say, cavemen is comparable to the old show, my mother, the car. i give it a 2, only because they deserve 1 better than a 1 because they actually spent money on it.
