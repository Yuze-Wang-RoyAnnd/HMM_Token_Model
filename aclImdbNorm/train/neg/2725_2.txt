chesty gringo telly savalas (as frank cooper) is a us-mexico "border cop". he serves as a father figure to young immigrant danny de la paz (as benny romero), who wants mr. savalas to be best man at his impending wedding. savalas is tough, but boss eddie albert (as commander moffat) may be tougher. tough is what you need to stop smuggler michael v. gazzo (as chico suarez). alliances may be in flux.<br /><br />if you find the possibility of hearing "kojak" and "oliver douglas" uttering expletives to be repulsive, you ought to steer clear of "the border". if not, you may not have the stomach for the "realistic" cow slaughtering scene. although it doesn't end up being worth much, mr. de la paz and cecilia camacho (as leina) steal the show. <br /><br />** the border (1979) tony richardson ~ telly savalas, danny de la paz, eddie albert
