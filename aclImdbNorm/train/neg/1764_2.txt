although in many ways i agree with the other reviewers comments. i find that the plot and idea are very good. many of the supporting actors were very good. the fatal problem with this film is ellen pompeo. i am sure, i have never seen a less talented "actor" how this person has ever been in a film or on television, i cannot imagine. in my opinion she would be better as a greater at a wal-mart. to see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles, does beg the question...... "who does she know"? i would very much like to see this film re-made with some talent. i do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it.
