i can say without a shadow of a doubt that going overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen, and yes, i have seen cujo. adam sandler is an abomination as schecky moskowitz, a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner. that's the plot.<br /><br /> that's it! nothing else in the film makes sense, it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast, and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way, but more of a frustrating, 'throw both shoes at the t.v' kind of way. even general noriega makes an appearance, for no reason i can comprehend (it certainly wasn't for humour). add to the mix miss australia, who has the worst australian accent i've ever heared, and you have something which i won't call the worst film ever made, because going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a film. i highly recomend seeing this film, as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see. i guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a bad film will be "at least it wasn't as bad as going overboard".
