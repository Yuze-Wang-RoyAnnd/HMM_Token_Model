first of all let me say the first 20 minutes are great, the monster looks superb and the cgi is reasonably done. it's a shame then that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment, <br /><br />******** spoilers below ******** <br /><br />from the opening scene we can see this movie is anti-american, normally this sort of stereotyping wouldn't bother me (we brits get enough from hollywood) but here it's not subtle about making the americans brain-dead morons. it goes past the point of realism and your left wondering if a yank has raped the directors mother.<br /><br />the grieving scene was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts going downhill.<br /><br />here we are introduced to the olympic medallist auntie and drunk uncle who walk into the memorial and start blaming the father for his daughters death, then hitting him before they all start rolling around on the floor crying. hardly realistic bonding at a time of crisis!<br /><br />the whole virus sideline is ridiculous. if the americans know there isn't a virus, why are they wasting time, money and resources investigating? the us government agent orders the brain drilling of an innocent korean for nothing, making the americans look evil (or stupid), it wasn't helped by the fact this guy was cross-eyed for comical effect.<br /><br />the movie is about hunting the monster. us and korean special forces are assigned to finding the creature although through-out the movie they are invisible. the only people hunting the monster, in the whole of korea, is the main family and some random tramp who appears at the end to save the day! naturally a few us/korean agents try to stop them along the way.<br /><br />the sister was only included in the movie so she could make the vital shot at the end. it was clich'ed, you knew it was going to happen but to make it worse she does bugger all until that part! and my final annoyance, how the hell did that kid survive at the end? the monster had been swimming with it's head underwater for about 5 minutes! why didn't the monster eat the kids in the first place?
