i thought watching employment videos on corporate compliance was tedious. this movie went nowhere fast. what could have been a somewhat cheesy half hour twilight zone episode turned into a seemingly endless waste of film on people parking their cars, a picture of some dude's swimming pool (he really needs to answer his phone by the way) a dot matrix printer doing its job, and heuy and louey sitting in a yellow lighted control room repeating "t minus 10 and counting" as if something exciting is going to happen. it doesn't so don't get your hopes up. the best thing about this movie is to see james best and gerald mcc, in something other than there famous tv personalities, and that is stretching to find anything good. and do not get me started on the music which was totally composed of a tympani, some large marine mammals, and microphone feedback. this movie is as close as i have given a one yet, but it gets the 2 because i actually was able to finish this insomnia cure, and didn't have to leave in the middle. avoid at all costs.
