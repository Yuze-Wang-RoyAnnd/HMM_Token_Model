first of all, i ain't american or middle-eastern. second of all, i don't have a religion. the closest thing to a religion i have are sports and movies. henceforth, i believe i would be best served to supply an opinion of neutrality and free from bias.<br /><br />most of these short films are an utter disgrace. this dreadful event should be used to commemorated all those innocent people whom were murdered by "some" barbaric and uncivilized morons. instead, most of what i saw in these short films were conceited attempts to score varied political points. examples:<br /><br />1) ken loach's segment. sure, we are all sad that this dude had a hard life in his country but what has that got to do with the innocent victims of 2001? two wrongs don't make a right?! whatever! this film should have a subtitle for those who have trouble listening to a partially incoherent chilean-english accent.<br /><br />2) most disturbing is youssef chahine's segment. it is obvious that he has trouble with logic. he justified the murders due to - america being a democracy and because some americans voted the politicians in power, then all americans in the end are responsible for the actions and decisions made by their leaders on the middle-east. helloooo! is this guy for real?? some americans don't even vote! some americans don't even know where the middle-east is; some don't even know what religion is practiced there; and majority don't know the real political issues that are played behind the scenes. ### mr chahine, the reason why we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic. the innocent victims in the twin towers came from around the world. the murdered firefighters, rescuers, office workers, by-standers and flight passengers have nothing to do with politics. and yet, we are not allowed to go about our lives because "some" people think everyone has to choose a side or a religion. we are perceived as fair game for the extreme politics.<br /><br />3) the israeli segment showed their own bombed victims. another filmmaker using this event to push their own political agenda. sometimes, it is not about you. some people always think about the "me, me, me." sometimes, it is about other people.<br /><br />4) idrissa ouedraogo's segment is a joke and another political point scorer. they obviously want money from the international community by highlighting their poverty. blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />this movie denigrates the memory of "sept. 11th, 2001" victims.<br /><br />the best thing for it is the trash can.
