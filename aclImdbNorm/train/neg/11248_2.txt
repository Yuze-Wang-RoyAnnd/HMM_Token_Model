a gave it a "2" instead of a "1" (awful) because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning, a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork. but that wasn't enough to save it.<br /><br />the "sepia" toned, washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies. nothing new there. i can see there were some hat-tips to other old, classic movies. ok. no problem with that.<br /><br />but a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting, not something that would put you to sleep.<br /><br />the story line and the script of this movie was awful, the characters two dimensional. slow moving. some of the scenes were pretty to look at, but ultimately, as a whole, it was quite boring, i couldn't recommend it.
