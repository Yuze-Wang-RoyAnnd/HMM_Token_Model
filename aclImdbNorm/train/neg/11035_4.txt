this is the most saccharine romance i ever sat through. the perfect film for an idle housewife in kerchief, housedress, and ostrich-trimmed high-heeled mules to watch in the afternoon, lying on the couch eating bonbons. in fact, bonbons play a prominent role in the movie.<br /><br />the only reason i was able to watch to the end, is that i finally was able to gaze at keanu reeves' dreamy face in almost every scene. in most of his films, he moves too fast to get a good look. the only rapid action in this show is giancarlo giannini waving his hands with latin emotionality - more italian than mexican, really. <br /><br />the dialog is as stiff as wood. unfortunately, no bodices are ripped - the hero is disgracefully perfect-mannered and mild. the aristocratic warm-blooded old-world family cliche is as old as the hills. what does it matter if they are irish or italian or mexican? this is a fairy story.<br /><br />i knew before the titles finished running that this would not be the movie i hoped for. the glowing grapes looked like the paragon of all food ads in women's day magazine. i didn't see his name listed, but the art director surely was thomas kinkade, who paints the million dollar canvases of irish cottages snuggled in fuchsias. this film was literally seen through rose-colored glasses. if you like dreamy pink and blue sky, this film is for you! (the bonbons looked really good, too!)
