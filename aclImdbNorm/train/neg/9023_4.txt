i have watched anime but i'm not a die hard fan; and i don't read manga. i say this because many of the reviewers who are waxing lyrical about this film seem to have that background. i have seen "st. john's wort," and although it isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, it made me pick up "shinobi," especially since everyone seems to love it.<br /><br />well, i watched it this afternoon, and fought very hard to keep watching. yes, it's very beautiful - the slow motion water scenes, the autumn leaves on the trees, even the cgi eye flicker - majestic. i liked the hawk, the costumes, even some of the fight scenes, but overall this was dull as dirt.<br /><br />it seemed as if someone took "romeo and juliet" - the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers - and threw in some "x-men" for good measure. two of the characters split wolverine's powers - the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the grey-haired guy had his ability to heal himself. then you have the girl who has a poison kiss - that's poison ivy (from batman). why do they give these women such dumb powers? poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death. man, that's some great power for you. and the other girl, can create bugs from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands. the other woman, one of the star crossed lovers, has the power of a hypnotic stare. wow.<br /><br />i sort of made it to the end of the film, by fast forwarding it, and did see a bit more tragedy than i expected. some people are comparing this to "house of flying daggers" and "hero." don't make that mistake. they may share similar endings, but that's where the similarities end. "shinobi" is made by an amateur - the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker.<br /><br />i would say avoid this film unless you're 12 to 18 years old.
