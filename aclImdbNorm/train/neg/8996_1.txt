in the future of 1985, a governmental committee headed by howard hesseman, is holding hearings on tv's first uncensored network. they sample it's programming, that play as a series of skits. i can name the good 'skit' movies on one hand, not using my thumb. "amazon women on the moon", "kentucky fried movie", "the meaning of life", and "mr. mike's mondo video". notice how i didn't mention "tunnel vision"? the reason for that is that this 'movie' is death in cinematic form. none of the skits are even remotely funny, or even the least bit clever. it takes some sort of great ineptitude on the film makers' part to not even get one laugh out of me.<br /><br />my grade: f <br /><br />eye candy: dody dorn goes full frontal
