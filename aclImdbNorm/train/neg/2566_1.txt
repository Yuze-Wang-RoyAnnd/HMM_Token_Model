caught part of george 2 on tv recently, but couldn't get myself to watch it through to the end. just awful! i can't even remember the plot. all i know is that george and ursula were not the george and ursula of the first movie, which was bad enough. there's a lot of scrambling around, but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy, it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes. having the original voice of ape the ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this. george 2 is probably the single worst sequel i have ever seen, and that is saying something. jeez, because of imdb's 10 lines rule, i have to keep typing when i have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made-for-tv sequel. disney, hang your head in shame.
