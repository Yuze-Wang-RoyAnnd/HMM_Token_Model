i love sharks. and mutants. and explosions. theoretically, with those parameters in mind, hammerhead: shark frenzy should have been the best movie ever.<br /><br />it is not.<br /><br />the monster looks like a villain from power rangers, and has approximately the same range of rubbery movement. this might be okay if the makers weren't quite as proud of its design as they seem to be. that is to say, for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action/scifi/horror flick that could benefit from some mystery, the shark gets a lot of screen time. granted, it is usually shaky and erratic. i guess you're supposed to assume that it's so scary that even the camera guy freaks out.<br /><br />the camera goes to a person about to get eaten, the camera goes to the shark. the camera goes back to the person about to get eaten, only now they are screaming and armless. and so on.<br /><br />the costuming is bad, the acting is poor, and the special effects are sub-par, but the writing is by far the worst. things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten, or so something can explode. because let me tell you, the people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions = more better mindset. characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion. they shoot helicopters, there is a massive explosion. barrels, rocks, trees, whatever, they all explode, so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end.<br /><br />speaking of which, i don't care how crazy a person is, i find it hard to believe that anyone would think trying to make a giant half-person half-shark have sex with a woman in order to make freaky shark people babies is a good idea. that is, unless that person is the mad scientist in this movie.<br /><br />the bad thing is, the movie is so random (and at times, boring) that even its badness is not really enough to hold a person's prolonged interest. it might be a good one to mst3k with your friends, but past that, if you happen to catch this bad boy on, do yourself a favor and change the channel.
