very much a film from the times -- extremely long sequences with no dialogue, bad flashbacks, and an almost entirely male cast. the two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men.<br /><br />o'toole is riveting whenever he speaks; unfortunately, he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery. alastair sims is always a joy to see but he, too, is terribly underused.<br /><br />the film has one additional positive aspect, in that it depicts many aspects of british fascism and fascist sympathies (such as the casual appearance of the mosley graffiti) that many people today are unaware of. too many of today's films about wwii paint the allies as all-good and the axis as all-evil, when history tells us people are far more complicated than that!<br /><br />this would be a good movie for when you're recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex. if you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize, this is the movie for you.
