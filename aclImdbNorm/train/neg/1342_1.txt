this film is the freshman effort of stephanie beaton and her new production company. while it suffers from a few problems, as every low budget production does, it is a good start for ms. beaton and her company.<br /><br />the story is not terribly new having been done in films like the burning and every friday the 13th since part 2. but, the performances are heartfelt. so many big budget movies just have the actors going through the motions, its always nice to see actors really trying to hone their craft.<br /><br />the story deals with the murder(and possible return) of a disfigured classmate. the others are sworn to secrecy, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lifes. ten years later, the friends are murdered one by one by a gruesome stalker known as "the bagman". who will survive? you have to watch.<br /><br />if you are roger ebert or any number of arrogant critics, you probably shouldn't bother. but if your taste run more towards joe bob briggs and you want to see a group of people honing their craft, then check out "the bagman".
