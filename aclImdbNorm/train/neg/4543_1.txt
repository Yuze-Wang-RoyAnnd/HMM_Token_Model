i read the book and the book was fascinating.<br /><br />this movie, it's direction, the screenplay, and the acting were totally insufferable. i cringed at the lack of a screenplay that could not follow the novel, a novel that has all the action, simplicity, and courage to illustrate a temerity of a great possibly fact based story.<br /><br />i can see why this movie was not released to the general public in most cities. would not ever recommend this film to anyone i know. <br /><br />simply, one of he worst adaptations i have seen transformed into a plot less exploration of heaven on earth.<br /><br />the cinematography was indeed the only highlight. but, how could that fail when filmed in an beautiful country such as peru. <br /><br />to prospective viewers, do not waste your time or energy on this flop.
