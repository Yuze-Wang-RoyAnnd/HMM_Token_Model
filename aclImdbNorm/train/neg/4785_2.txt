so much is wrong with this abysmal little wet fart of a movie that it's hard to know where to begin.<br /><br />first of all, it's a remarkably un-scary scary movie, even by amercian standards. the dialogue is clich'e, the characters are two-dimensional, the writing is ho-hum, and what little story there is is neither coherent nor remotely interesting.<br /><br />we meet the following stereotypes in order: balding loser guy (probably divorced, but who knows? this movie doesn't tell us) with a brave heart, the young hero (who doesn't do anything heroic at all), brave little kid (with a homicidal streak a mile wide) and black bad-ass bitch (with more brawn than brains). these guys take up an ongoing fight with the tall scary reaper man and his evil ewoks.<br /><br />oh, and the film is full of wicked little metal orbs whoosing around menacing people. given a chance, they perform impromptu brain surgery on those who doen't have the mental acuity to duck when they come at them. booh! actually, one of them is haunted by a good ghost (but then again, it might be a deceitful spectre) who seems intent on helping our brave contagonists retrieve their young kidnapped friend.<br /><br />there is no character background or even an introduction to any of the characters. it starts with some kind of recap of the ending of the previous movie, but this doesn't explain a lot. if you've seen the first two movies, fine. otherwise you don't know who these people are, how they are related, why they aren't in school or at work, or why you should care whether they live or die. consequently, you don't. the only point of interest becomes any splatter effects. and there aren't enough of those to keep you awake.<br /><br />of potenial interest/amusement are the three raider punks, as stupid as they are evil, who menace our heroes. but they don't get much screen time. they are offed almost immediately. then they are buried (why anybody should take the time is beyond me), then they appear again as evil raider punk zombies. only to be offed again, literally within a minute.<br /><br />the rest of the movie mainly seems to consist of caspar the friendly ghost appearing and disappearing, driving around looking for places, and balding loser trying to score som bad black bitch booty, using pickup lines that would embarrass a mentally retarded teenager. no dice there; not even some gratuitous sex could have saved this movie, so good thing there never is any.<br /><br />the head baddie, called the tall man, doesn't manage to scare anyone older than 3 years; howling "booooy!" every five minutes isn't enough. why he, with his amazing telekinetic powers and uncanny upper-body strength, doesn't simply squash our heroes like bugs isn't explained. instead, he delegates the job to his inept retarded little minions, who never manage to kill anyone before being shot to hell.<br /><br />filmgoers who like masterpieces like "friday 13th part xxxxviii: jason goes to college" might find some entertainment. the rest of us, who have developed pubic hair, will be bored out of our skulls.
