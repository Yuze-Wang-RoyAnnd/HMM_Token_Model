fragmentaric movie about a couple of people in austria during a heatwave. this kind of movie has been done more often, and most of all, better. the stories don't really have anything to do with each other, apart from the pathetic finale: 'people are cruel'. ugly flesh, unpleasant people and a movie that goes on way too long without really making a point... ultra-realistic? hardly... boring? indeed. not even gorgeous franzisca weiss can save this one! 3/10
