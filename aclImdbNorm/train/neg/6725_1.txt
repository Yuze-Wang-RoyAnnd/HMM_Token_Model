what could have been an engaging-and emotionally charged character study is totally undermined by the predictable factor. fox is ok as nathaniel ayers, the julliard trained musician who dreams of playing with the walt disney orchestra until his bouts with schizophrenia drive him into the street and ultimately skid row. looking for a good story to boost his flagging career, reporter steve lopez {robert "rehab" downey } gets to know him and tells his story. taking every element of the classic "how we hit the skids" movies, borrowing very liberally from "a beautiful mind", taking the bogus "feel good" attitude of films like "rocky"-you pick the sequel number-and whipping up too much 1930s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie. it is corny, trite, utterly predictable and plays way too often on our sentiments. i hate to say it, but this is the kind of movie that, if you say you hated it, people will give you bad looks. i really wish i could say something positive about this film, but i really can't. the acting redeems it somewhat, but not enough for me to give it more than one star. strictly made for tv movie stuff. not worth your time.
