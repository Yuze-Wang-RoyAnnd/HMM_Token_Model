first off... i never considered myself an uwe boll hater since i think i never even saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named "seed" (which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about) i am close to joining the hate club. this movie makes absolutely no sense at all... the plot is a joke and although boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people 90% of this movie is just plain boredom. you can sum up this movie like this: <br /><br />1. hooded killer watches clips of animals getting tortured on tv. this is real life footage from pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason of "making a statement about humanity" and giving a peta address. since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture porn-exploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning onward.<br /><br />2. death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets it.<br /><br />3. cops watch videos of animals, babies and women starved to death and decomposing in seeds basement, having stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey because seed is such an evil bad mofo. although the acting is ok the movie takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotions... <br /><br />4. cops bust seed in his house, act stupid and get slashed in the dark. this sequence reminds me of a video game, you barely see anything except flashlights. seed is a super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough to be killed... except for one who busts him.<br /><br />5. seed gets the chair and we see his electrocution as lengthy as everything else in this "movie"... he won't die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must be set free if he survives 3 electric jolts. guess what... they just bury him alive to solve the problem.<br /><br />6. seed comes out of his grave, kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge on.<br /><br />7. a woman gets her head bashed in with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it. <br /><br />8. seed captures the cops family, lures him to his house, threatens to kill his wife and daughter. after killing his wife with a nail gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering thats whats seed wants (its hard to get into that guys head since he not just wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word ... the movie has barely any dialog anyway so don't mind).<br /><br />9. boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence 3.<br /><br />this is it... no message, no plot, no reason, no face behind the mask, no background except a stupid story that seed was burnt as a child.<br /><br />this movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value. i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment. its like watching august underground ... thats fine with me, some people will enjoy this brainless snuff. but what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudo-message in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camera-work, effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid. <br /><br />so how does boll get money to make such "movies" when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets?? "seed" is not just the essence of ridiculous, its living proof that the free market is flawed ... lucky uwe that the german taxpayer is paying for a lot of this waste to get deductments.
