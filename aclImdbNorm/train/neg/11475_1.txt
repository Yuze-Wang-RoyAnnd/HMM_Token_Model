a movie that makes you want to throw yourself on a sword. i've seen schlock in my time but after viewing the wretched mess i don't think i can ever watch a another movie again. may god pity the souls who made this.<br /><br />premise- ex-army quiet stud, underwear model type character (well acted actually) goes looking for the girl who sent him a xmas card while serving in the military. lands in with her cabin living-granola type family who are right-wing loggers. family takes to him and it takes 2 hours of our time for the chick to see he's a better catch than her liberal looking ,french wine drinking, porsche driving, loud cell phone talking, lazy, city slicking, jewish looking fianc'e.<br /><br />the bad- 1d characters, 1d themes. being beat over the head with the pro-military theme. ed asner.<br /><br />the good- commercial breaks were long. peter jason. it ended.
