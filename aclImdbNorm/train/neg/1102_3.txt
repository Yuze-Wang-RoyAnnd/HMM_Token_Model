first off, i must admit that both films i've seen by this director i saw without titles and so may have missed the points. my czech isn't bad but, having sat through two of his films, i wish i hadn't even tried to learn. samotari is too cool. way too cool. it's about ten different story lines that weave in and out together. that's not so deeply unusual in a town the size of prague (tiny, really.) the main characters are between 20 and 30. they've got jobs and only one studies. the best character is the young balkan girl. her sentiments are echoed by immigrants here every damn day. that's about it. the only great character. everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own. how can i sympathise with such obvious incompetence? perhaps there are interesting bits with japanese tourists but do i need another stereotype in film? if you like alright music, see this film. if you want to laugh at others' stupidity, see this film. if you like irony and dry humor, see an original jarmusch not an imitation. and under no circumstances see ondricek's film, septej (whisper.) that is unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes.
