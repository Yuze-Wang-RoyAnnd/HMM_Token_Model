americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial, we tend to lose interest really fast.<br /><br />i found out an exciting fact from this film: someone has to paint high tension utility poles and do it on a schedule! and guess what, they really would like to be doing something else (the viewer has similar feelings).<br /><br />surprisingly, when i was bored watching late night infomercials and decided to actually watch this film, i found the characters to be interesting and highly engaging.<br /><br />i just don't usually watch that much late night tv, so i can't recommend this film, unless watching paint dry is your idea of an exciting two hours out of your life.
