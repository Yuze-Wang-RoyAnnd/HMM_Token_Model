this is, ostensibly, a movie about multiple grief. as such, it ought to move viewers and make them empathetic with the plight of the main characters. however, its irritatingly postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible. the camera continually switches from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to the next, creating a choppy, disjointed effect. most characters appear to live aimless, unstructured lives, held together by their professional commitments. (it also stretches credibility that a man who has just been given what amounts to a likely death sentence, would cheerfully indulge in a sex romp with a woman he has just met). the storyline (if there is a storyline) is difficult to follow. in sum, the overall effect is rather disappointing. in spite of all that, the acting is generally good and some of the scenes are quite powerful.
