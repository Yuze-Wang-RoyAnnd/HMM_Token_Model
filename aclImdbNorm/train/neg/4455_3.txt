where to start? ok, don't compare this film to fight club for a start - ridiculous. if it was even a patch on fight club, the violence, blood, gore etc would be much more evident and realistic. secondly, this film is no football factory - which is so much more real (and danny dyer makes nicholas nickelby look like an embarrassment). fair enough, the storyline is quite decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed - with a decent ending i might add. but the film on the whole is poor, seriously poor. as people have been mentioning the accents should not spoil a film - i disagree - either a simple casting error, or a lack of effort in coaching the voices caused the film to be irritating all the way through - it was obvious from scene one some american/geordie was playing the role. don't get me wrong, good looking guy, who looks great with a skin head - but no not a football hooligan. i could go on forever about how ridiculous the football scene was - the 'fake steward' situation. also, when the gse are going to play united up north, they go on the train expecting only 3 of them - doesn't make any sense - this a real organisation of gangsters and thugs, which is portrayed in the film to be some mickey mouse cult of about 5 people. in terms of accuracy - did west ham and milwall not play for the last couple of years they have been in the championship together? hmm, ten years ok. and i'm sure 'bother' would be able to just waltz into a milwall firm pub. basically, a very poor film which people will like if they have little knowledge of real football, and hooliganism. if you do actually love football and are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism,, you will simply feel as though this film has insulted your intelligence. ross george
