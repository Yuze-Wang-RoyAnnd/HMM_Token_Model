not that i want to be mean but this movie really surprised me a lot. during the whole film, i was like...erm...what is this movie all about? i don't get the animations at all. probably this movie will only be suitable for those who belongs to the 1980s. during the film, there is a group of people walked out. after the movie, many people said, "that's it?" frankly speaking, i cannot believe that this movie was awarded the best children film award. if you are thinking of watching this film, i strongly recommend you not to. you will regret it. i'm not joking. you will find that you are just wasting both your time and money of you go and watch it.
