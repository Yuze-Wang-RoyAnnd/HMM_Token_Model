elizabeth ward gracen, who will probably only be remembered as one of bill clinton's "bimbo eruptions" (they have pills for that now!) is probably the weakest element of this show. it really continues the tired formula of the highlander series- the hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met, but there is some conflict, and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequence.<br /><br />then you have the character of nick wolf. basically, your typical unshaven 90's hero, with the typical "sexual tension" storyline. (seriously, why do you hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) this was a joint canadian/french production, so half the series takes place in vancouver imitating new york, and the other half is in paris... just like highlander did.
