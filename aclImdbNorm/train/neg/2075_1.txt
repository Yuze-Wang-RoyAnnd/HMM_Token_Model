i have to admit when i went to see this movie, i didn't really have high expectations. but even with my low expectations i was totally and utterly disappointed...<br /><br />basically luke wilson is a hot shot who tends to go out with slightly crazy girlfriends. there's slight mention of a girl stalking him but that's pretty much it for that character. which i don't quite mind cause it would probably be just as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie.<br /><br />so while on a subway rainn wilson (who i actually liked before this movie) convinces him to talk to a "hot" girl, uma thurman. this is strange to say the least, as everyone can clearly see that uma thurman does not belong under the category of "hot".<br /><br />rainn wilson's performance is also far from "hot". normally i'm all for his acting, but even he couldn't salvage this movie. his character was jumpy, unrealistic and rather annoying. you could never tell if the writers were trying to make him the comical token closet gay guy, or just desperate. it was almost painful.<br /><br />but anyway, someone steals her purse as she goes to leave the subway, and luke wilson being the charming savior he is runs after the robber. now we all know that uma thurman is the superhero, or "g-girl" as they like to call her in the movie. it still baffles me as to what the "g" stands for, but we'll leave that for the message boards to debate.<br /><br />the sex scenes i assume are supposed to be funny, but i find myself asking who has sex like that? they nearly throw the bed through the wall because of uma thurman's "passion" let's say. it makes my head hurt, but not in the "i'm thinking really hard to understand this" way.<br /><br />when uma insults anna faris, calling her a "whore" i had no debate with that. apart from the fact that she can't choose movies properly, she can't act and relies souly on the fact that she's blonde and typical.<br /><br />overall i would've walked out of the theater if i hadn't paid $8.75 to see it. the characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry, especially uma thurman. someone should let her know that just because you move your head a lot doesn't mean you're acting.<br /><br />also, the script and storyline could've used either a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid. i actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors, and their dying careers. overall, if you value your money, and your self respect do not waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie.
