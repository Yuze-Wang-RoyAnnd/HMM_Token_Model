i know it's a power-rangers gimmick and catered to 7 year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie? if they are going to write a plot with crayons, at least have the decency to make it silly. it's kind of hilarious if you watch this. we have a typical family filled with cliched characters (father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself lolol), air-head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting, and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space. funny stuff!<br /><br />however, the real great moment comes near the end when war-dad and bad-acting-villain try to work a sword fight, but then they realize none of them know how to (probably because no room in budget for choreographers), so they come up with this american gladiator type setting to run around in. lol.<br /><br />1/10 rating because they try to treat this seriously.
