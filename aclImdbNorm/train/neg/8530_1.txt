"her cardboard lover" is norma shearer's last movie. she quit the movies and, i think, joined the board of directors at mgm. that was a good move on her part. "her cardboard lover" was talky and boring in parts. it was obvious there were only a handful of actors with speaking parts so they had a lot of dialogue to speak to keep this turkey afloat. <br /><br />the story was a good idea about a wealthy woman (norma shearer) hiring a man (robert taylor) to make her playboy fiancee (george sanders)jealous. i am surprised that the director, george cukor, did not cut many of the talky scenes between ms. shearer and mr. taylor. mr. cukor served ms. shearer well in "the women" but not in this movie. <br /><br />the best performance in the movie was given by robert taylor. during mr. taylor's career, he was given his best comedy roles in this movie and "when ladies meet" in 1941. in 1942, he gave his best comedy performance in "her cardboard lover" and, up to then, his best dramatic performance in "johnny eager." he had a busy year. i think of all the actors at mgm, mr. taylor worked with all the major and minor actresses on the lot. also, mgm gave mr. taylor all types of movies to make - most of them were successful. that is why mgm kept him for 25 years. <br /><br />mr. george sanders was very good as a socialite heel. he played a similar role eight years later in "all about eve" for which he won an oscar for a supporting role. as for ms. shearer, this was one of her worst performances, she was not funny and too dramatic for this comedy. it is strange that she made a great comedy in 1939, "the women", and gave her best performance. it was obvious that she was too old looking for her younger leading men in "her cardboard lover." also, it didn't help that some of her clothes were awful.<br /><br />too bad she and mr. taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together, the superb "escape". the same comments about this movie can be said of another movie, "personal property" that mr. taylor made in 1937 with jean harlow. it was too talky, boring, and the actress looked old. ms. harlow looked ill throughout the movie and nobody in hollywood noticed to tell her to see a doctor, so in 1937, she died at age 26. what a waste! she was becoming a good actress and getting better roles.
