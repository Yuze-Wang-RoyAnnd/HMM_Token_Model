i have to say the first i watched this film was about 6 years ago, and i actually enjoyed it then. i bought the dvd recently, and upon a second viewing i wondered why i liked it. the acting was awful, and as usual we have the stereo-typical clansmen in their fake costumes. the acting was awful at best. tim roth did an ok job as did liam neeson, but i've no idea what jessica lange was thinking.<br /><br />the plot line was good, but the execution was just poor. i'm tired of seeing scotland portrayed like this in the films. braveheart was even worse though, which is this films only saving grace. but seriously, people didn't speak like that in those days, why do all the actors have to have glaswegian accents? just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes. i notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the americans, and to be honest i can see why they'd like it, i know they have an infatuation for men in kilts. however, if you are thinking of buying the dvd, i'd say spend your money on something else, like a better film.
