this wasn't what i wanted to see. i bought this on dvd and under the movie i found myself irritated and turned off the movie for a moment.<br /><br />heres what i didn't like:<br /><br />1 they were shooting at the father<br /><br />2 the tribes was really annoying<br /><br />3 the dinosaurs (mostly)looked to faked<br /><br />4 the bad scientist well he was annoying<br /><br />5 the picture quality on the dvd was really bad<br /><br />what i did like: <br /><br />1 the music by jerry goldsmith. this music is really great. i have the bootleg soundtrack from this movie. sadly the sound quality is not good, but its ok for its time.<br /><br />2 the first time we see the dinosaurs they inspire a sort of awe.<br /><br />3 baby is kinda cute when he is in the water and is playing<br /><br />4 that funny scene with the tent. <br /><br />5 the children who sees this film would hopefully learn that evil always loses.
