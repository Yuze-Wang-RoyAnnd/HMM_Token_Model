i'm not sure if the filmmakers were after a saw-type movie or 12 angry men (people piecing together the facts to get at the truth). whatever it was, it was poorly done and not worth watching.<br /><br />i don't watch movies for blood and gore, but because this film had little else going for it, it should have shown the actual killing more. most were off-camera, minimizing the horror that we were supposed to feel by the deaths.<br /><br />it also bugged me that the cop was among the victims; he unwittingly contributed to the innocent young man going to prison by accepting planted evidence (given to him by mjh) into the evidence room. (and wouldn't mjh a the prosecuting attorney, have had access to that evidence--taking it out and putting the wrong evidence back--anyway, so she wouldn't have needed the cop's help?). the others, while often also not realizing it was this particular person they were harming, still played larger roles in his ultimate demise. the gun dealer should have know his guns would be used for evil intent. the insurance guy rejected a person obviously in need, etc. but the cop's crime seemed minor in comparison since he didn't know exactly what he was doing. the filmmakers could have taken it a step further and had him be the one that encouraged mjh to plant the evidence, which would have made him more culpable. and mjh's yelling that he (the cop) got her in that mess doesn't make any sense at all.<br /><br />it would been more intriguing if each person died in a way that offered the others a clue to why he/she was there and deserved to die. the insurance guy, for example, could have had the applications he rejected rammed down his throat so he choked on them; the oriental woman could have had her eyes gouged out because she was a false witness, etc. yes, more violent that the gun deaths, but more interesting.<br /><br />the dialog wasn't witty, there were no twists, and the ending was one of the worse (if not the worst) i've ever seen. the ending along knocked three stars off my rating.<br /><br />the actors did a decent job, especially given the garbage lines and motivation they had to work with.<br /><br />overall, a waste of time.
