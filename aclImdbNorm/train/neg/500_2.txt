the bloodsucker leads the dance - what a laughable title, it's so utterly misleading. it's not surprising that the film-makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie.<br /><br />the story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island.<br /><br />very little happens in this film. and when something does wake the viewer from his stupor, it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice-artists. these guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remedial-level morons. it really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal. but the voice-artists cannot be blamed for the script. it's a travesty. unintentionally funny at best, pathetic at worst. the story in general is, to say the least, uneven. the women characters are particularly idiotic; the men are either creepy or tedious.<br /><br />the whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience. it doesn't remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders (finally) start happening, they all occur off screen. all we get is a few half-hearted severed head shots.<br /><br />a few people have said that this movie is a giallo. i cannot agree less with this opinion. anyone who enjoys italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it. it's basically a soft-core porn film with a horror angle. but it's not very erotic either.<br /><br />i can't recommend this to anyone.
