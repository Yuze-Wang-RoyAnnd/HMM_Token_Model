f*ck me! i've seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this takes the p*ss!<br /><br />honestly i can't express in words how bad this film actually is. besides the plot that isn't really there, the comically crap acting, the hilariously dreadful excuses for zombies; you know what, i could go on all day. every little thing in this film is either stupid, pointless, crap or embarrassing. i express to anyone who wants to watch this movie... don't!<br /><br />i'm ashamed to say, i have this on my rack. it's hidden away right at the god damn bottom of the huge pile. i couldn't even give this horse-sh*t excuse for a film away. that's how bad it is.
