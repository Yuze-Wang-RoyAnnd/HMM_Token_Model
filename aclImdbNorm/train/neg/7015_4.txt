"54" is a film based on the infamous "studio 54" of the 1970s - the hangout for the social elite and party clubbers. in the film, ryan phillippe is the main character, based on an actual employee of studio from 1977 - 1982.<br /><br />the film's problem is that it's all glitter and style and no substance. it tries to be a really grimy and probing satire like "boogie nights" but ultimately comes across as an inferior wannabe. mike myers is given the thankless task of playing cocaine-snorting club owner steve rubell. it's only a slightly comedic role and if this was myers' best attempts at sliding into drama like lemmon and other comedic actors did in their time, it's a total failure.<br /><br />"54" could have been insightful and interesting but instead it's just another dumb teen flick that isn't entertaining or even remotely engaging. view at your own peril.
