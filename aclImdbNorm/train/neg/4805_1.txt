i loved adrianne curry before this show. i thought she was great on top model and was really glad when she won. i also liked chris knight, he seems like a great guy. but this show just made me sick! i'm so angry at both of them for what happened on that show. i don't care that they were different ages, i know age can't stand between love. but adrianne, you had been together for only seven months. it didn't surprise me at all that he hadn't proposed. and i don't see the appeal of forcing someone to marry you before they're ready. if it's meant to be, then why not just enjoy each other's company and love each other, and let it come naturally? turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary, it's stupidly obvious that chris loves you, with or without a ring. and chris, shame on you for breaking down and proposing to her anyway! you've been through two failed marriages, how could you rush into another one just because she pitched a fit? i hope the relationship lasts, but i really feel that the marriage was rushed and for all the wrong reasons. maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to be married from within the marriage.
