after the already disappointing "final conflict", the series hits rock-bottom with this very weak fourth entry. at least the third film tried (unsuccessfully) to continue the story of damien, while this one simply rehashes and copies ideas from the "omen" (animals are afraid of the antichrist, the death of one man is very similar to the death of the photographer in the first film). but what looked exciting and creative there looks just dumb here. and the little girl looks simply like a spoiled kid.
