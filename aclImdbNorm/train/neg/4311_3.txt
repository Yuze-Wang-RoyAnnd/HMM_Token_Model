i watched this movie when i was a young lad full of raging hormones and it was about as sexy a movie as i had ever seen-or ever was to see. it may not have been a great movie. my guess is it wasn't. i don't really remember much about it, to tell you the truth. i only remember the sexual chemistry between crosby and biehn. no woman in any movie has ever done it for me as the unbelievably sexy cathy did in this movie. i haven't seen it since that first time i caught it on tv in the 70s and i don't think i'd want to see it again since i'm sure it would be a disappointment-my hormones aren't as raging and i've become more jaded over the years. still, when i think back on the shower scene i can still remember how great it felt way back when.<br /><br />added later: after watching the movie again, i discovered that it's dangerous to go home again. what was once erotic is now pretty tame. the older woman-younger man thing still works for me, just not as much as it once did, probably because i'm no longer a 12-year-old. that older woman is now younger than i am. also, the amateurishness of the whole thing wasn't perceived by my twelve-year-old mind. <br /><br />moral: sometimes it's better not to revisit the past.
