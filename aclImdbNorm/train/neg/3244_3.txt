the effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who becomes involved with con artists is so mannered that i have to assume that that was the desired intent. the sets are artificial and at no time did i not feel that i was watching a movie. it seemed like the actors were just reading their lines, rather than responding to one another. while the film has elements of early film noir (except that it is in color) the approach is so exaggerated that i almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre.<br /><br />given that the presentation had no appeal to me, i was at least expecting an engaging story. usually i am pretty slow on the uptake when it comes to stories with plot twists, but you could see what was coming here within the first fifteen minutes. by the time of the, "gee, i forgot the $80,000," moment, i thought to myself that this thing is truly ridiculous. for a psychiatrist with stated experience in gambling addictions to behave so stupidly is beyond belief. if at any stage she had behaved like a normal intelligent person, the whole story would have fallen apart.<br /><br />this wooden production left me cold.
