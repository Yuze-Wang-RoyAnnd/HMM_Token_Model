what this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie. unfortunately with disjointed storytelling, frustrating plot-holes, and contradictory scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly "the greatest monster movie ever." <br /><br />let's start with the good stuff: comedy, acting and special effects. from the get-go, this movie starts off fast paced and cheeky. the opening scene - the monster's origin - is campy and quick, paying homage the the classic 'environmental' disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters. the pacing is fast, which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action. with in the course of 10 minutes you get the 'why', 'where,' and 'how' of the beast and are ready for action. in this the movie delivers.<br /><br />after another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced: the lazy son and his precocious little girl, kind grandfather, and talented sister (aunt) and, of course, the monster. the characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent, allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work. <br /><br />the monster it's self looks great: alien yet familiar - kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid. the effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you 'see it's strings.' even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar, like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd, slipping on surfaces, crushing and eating those in it's path. when the monster's path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment, and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie's appeal begins to unravel.<br /><br />following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity. plot-lines are introduced, then abandoned, characters change their position for no apparent reason, and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent, while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random. <br /><br />as for the comedy, let me say this: i'm willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural. i am not familiar with korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation. however, as an asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in japan for the last 5 years (still here) i'd like to think i have a better grasp on asian humor than the average white-guy. that being said there were many parts of the movie that i understood were supposed to be funny, but, to me, weren't. <br /><br />*********** spoiler************* for example: after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral; everyone is mourning. a new character is introduced - a brother - and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another. they both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder. this competition is, at it's core, funny: two brothers who dislike each-other so much they even compete at a funeral - it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in asian comedy. this subtle slap-stick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but, seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl. ************** end spoiler **************<br /><br />then come the plot holes. there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained, or, worse, are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end. finding out an obstacle isn't an obstacle can be a good thing for a character, but you'd expect some comment to that nature. instead the audience is barraged by moments of anti-climax when problems just 'aren't there' anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start. so i ask you: why even bring it up in the first place? <br /><br />this was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems, and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other. of course introducing new and greater problems is a time-tested story telling tradition, but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation. not in this movie. instead it was as if you get several stories, each only explained 20% of the way and, in the end, the parts never converge to complete the whole.<br /><br />again, i'm willing to accept that a lot of this might be 'cultural.' maybe its in korean story- telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy. maybe it's normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on every-page, but never finishes one. maybe it's ok to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis. or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.
