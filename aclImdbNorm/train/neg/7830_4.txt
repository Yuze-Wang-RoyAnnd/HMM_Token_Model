so far nightmares and dreamscapes has been erratic and disappointing. the first segment, directed by brian henson, may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares, but at least it was well-directed, suspenseful, and visually interesting, with solid acting by william hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini-series.<br /><br />however, the second story in the series was just dreadful, and not in the good way. the screenplay is bad, requiring the shallow, unlikable protagonists to act illogically in order to move the plot, and having characters ramble on endlessly for the purposes of clunky, unnecessary exposition. the acting is overdone and unconvincing, and i felt far more empathy for a cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second. the director used a million tricks to try to make the narrative spooky, but with the amateurish acting and writing, the end result looks like a freshman-year film school project, with camera moves for their own sake, and little in the way of plot or tension.<br /><br />if the rest of the series continues like this, i'll be sorely let down. i look forward to william h. macy's installment, and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment. so far the quality is far too inconsistent to predict either way.
