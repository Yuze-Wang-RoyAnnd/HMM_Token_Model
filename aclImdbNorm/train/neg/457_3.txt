sure, i like short cartoons, but i didn't like this one. naturally, kids would love it. but then again, i'm not a kid anymore (although i still consider myself young).<br /><br />i will not tell you anything about the story, for the simple reason there is no story. how is it possible this dragon of a cartoon was nominated for an oscar?! well... i guess it's because people in the 30's were more happy with not much than now. in the present where we live, everything must happen fast. look at the movies nowadays, and you will come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that doesn't allow men to be slow. that's really a shame. i wish i lived in the 30's, because it seems so peaceful. but every time has got its ups and downs, i guess...<br /><br />to conclude: if you like music (and frogs), you'll have to see this cartoon. otherwise, don't spill your time on it.
