when i first saw a small scene of it in some announcements, i thought the show would be entertaining to watch. the little robot guy does look kinda cute. the style of animation does look sort of familiar to some classic shows. before the show aired, i studied it through some sources. there, i did became slightly dismayed. the three children (tommy, gus and lola) are voiced appropriately but robotboy is an exception. it would have been a lot nicer if he were to be portrayed by a young lad. one good example is robot jones, a robot character from "whatever happened to robot jones?" the show isn't bad really. but the way robotboy is inappropriately portrayed is my only criticism. thus, i don't watch it much.
