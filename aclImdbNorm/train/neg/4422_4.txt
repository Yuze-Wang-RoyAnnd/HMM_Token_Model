this one is a real bomb. we are supposed to believe that merle oberon is the sequestered daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to the tom delay of the 1930s that he is worth supporting as a presidential candidate. poor merle can't go anywhere, but is surrounded by politicians and their quacking, quaking wives and supported only by kindly uncle harry davenport. she joins her two maids on a blind date and gary cooper happens to show up. some shots of rodeo might have enlivened things, a la "misfits," but no such luck with this one. gary later breaks in to a formal dinner, at which merle is presiding, and, though invited to sit down and join the group, reads them a lecture on their snobbery. where did this diffident cowboy's sudden eloquence come from? the most excruciating scene in the film is a phantom party that gary holds in his unfinished house for his absent wife, merle. will it never end? one to avoid.
