i saw "myra breckinridge" when it first came out in 1970. i was a healthy 20-year-old at the time, who loved movies and really liked raquel welsh. on top of that, i had read the gore vidal novel it was based on and thought it was very funny. i saw the movie at a local drive-in and about half way through i was sorely tempted to turn the motor of my car on so that maybe i'd die of monoxide poisoning and not have to see the rest of this shipwreck of a movie. it wasn't "smart" or "trendy", it was gross and sloppy. all the actors were tone deaf and the director didn't have the slightest idea what he was doing. the casting of mae west was one of the worst casting choices in movie history. as one reviewer here said, her role had nothing to do with the movie or book. her character in the book is sexually beaten up by the young stud, which would never do for the legendary ms. west. oh no, the plot is changed so she sexually beats him up, very believable from a 77-year-old woman who looks every day of her age. i could go on, but why? it was an awful movie.<br /><br />bluto
