normally i wouldn't feel qualified to review something i only saw a half hour of, but i'll make an exception for this one.<br /><br />let the dialogue speak for itself! here's some of the bad guy's lines: "i smell...teacher!" "sorry, teacher! you get an 'f!'"<br /><br />bad guy and bad girl ( right after killing 2 cops and stealing a van full of drugs, they're getting hot and heavy):<br /><br />him -"so how do you feel about shooting some innocent bystanders?"<br /><br />her- (purrs) "you sure know how to show a girl a good time..." one generic kid who ran for his life instead of helping someone, gets to sum up his life and personality in this line -"i am a chicken-twit! (this was the usa network version) my old man was right! no wonder he left us..." boo-hoo.<br /><br />(not actually a spoiler ) bad guy (on fire) screams "aargh! fire!"
