a director and his crew head out to the isolated beal mansion, to make a low-budget horror film about the seven mysterious deaths of the beal family that have occurred there in the last century. even with warnings by the caretaker, the director pays no attention to the supposedly cursed house. one of the crew find a book titled tibetan book of the dead, and use some of the passages from it for their script. but in doing so, when red they raise a ghoul from its grave.<br /><br />boring, confusing and tacky all rolled up into one, equals this penniless midnight horror production. what feels like an eternity, it just never seems to get going or demonstrate anything effective from somewhat decent ideas. even though director paul harrison's clunky, tensionless direction did construct a couple eerie, moody and atmospheric set-pieces. but laziness did set it early. the whole film within a film structure takes up most of the movie and in this time little to nothing happens of great interest. nor is it fun. think of bob clark's "children shouldn't play with dead things (1972)", and now we've got older actors in the part. however i found "seven corpses" to be inferior. the script early on has some cutting wit abound, before it ends up being drab, predictable and left with many unfulfilled possibilities. the cheap foundation involving limited sets didn't help matters either, but the mansion's dreary, dark appearance had a creepy air to it. performances from a recognizable b-cast is mainly rigid. john carradine in small part mainly lurks about. john ireland plays a hot-headed director, faith domergue's washed-up actress demands attention and charles macaulay hams it up. the slow grinding premise is crossed between "ten little indians" and your usual zombie set-up. however its not all that engaging, even with its occult and supernatural edge. hell they even throw in some graveyard action, with no prevail. when the rotting ghoul makes its appearance
