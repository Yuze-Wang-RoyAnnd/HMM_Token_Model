i saw this movie primarily to see brooke burke (as jill), who i had meet briefly in la at a modeling trade show, in her first feature film. i was hoping to see more of her, but thought she did very well acting her role. since she is such a beautiful and poised tv host, and model, it was not surprising. i was left wondering why she was killed, and what happened as a result. maybe i just missed it.<br /><br />i wasn't really sure about the genre of this movie, and although i liked the actors i felt like it was for a college audience. i tried to keep an open mind considering horror wasn't my favorite genre, but felt like i had outgrown the gags. it seemed to drag out in some places, leave you guessing in some places about what powers the evil professor had, and, like a lot of other films had an unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />having written a couple of scripts, i know a lot of this is difficult and may come down to personal opinions, how many movies you have seen & studied, and those you relate with at a point in time.<br /><br />in a nutshell, i found it interesting, but not a satisfying plot and ending for me. if jill (brooke burke) would have returned through the portal in the end and kicked everyone's ass that would be a satisfying ending and would earn a higher rating.
