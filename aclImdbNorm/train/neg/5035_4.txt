melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys. but it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this generic '80's slasher film. it's up to the local town sheriff dan burke (bo hopkins, the wild bunch) and his annoying mystery-loving goody two-shoes daughter, marci (dana kimmell, friday the 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings.<br /><br />this film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it's '80's slasher brethren. it doesn't hurt that alesia has a great body (i feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i'm not overly perverted). on the downside, the movie is hampered with a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, a grating theme some that is used a bit too often, and an ending that is a tad anti-climatic. but the good outweigh the bad (barely). give this a rent, but i wouldn't buy it.<br /><br />eye candy: aleisa shirley shows her tits, bush and ass <br /><br />my grade: c <br /><br />code red dvd extras: an intro by star aleisa shirley and director of intruder, scott spiegel; both director's cut & theatrical version of the film; audio conversation with star shirley and director jim sotos; interview with shirley, sotos & bo hopkins; still gallery; theatrical trailer for this film; and trailers for nightmare, stunt rock, rituals, & balalaika conspiracy
