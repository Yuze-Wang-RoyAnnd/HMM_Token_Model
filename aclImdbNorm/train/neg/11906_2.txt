watching "der himmel "uber berlin" as a teen in the late 80's was a profound experience for me - "so this was what the movies could be". along with "paris, texas" and "until the end of the world" it still holds a special place in my heart and mind - a testament to the genius of wim wenders.<br /><br />unfortunately later years has seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with "million dollar hotel" and "land of plenty" hitting a terrible low point. gone are the captivating pictures or music. no search for or display of great insight. all that is left are characters and thinly veiled political statements, that boils down to nothing but clich'es, and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience.<br /><br />has the well run dry? whatever the reason, it's time for mr. wenders to either step it up or stop altogether.
