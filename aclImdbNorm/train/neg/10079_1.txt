when i was 11, grease 2 was like crack. it was a classless, shameful, euphoric, and powerfully addictive experience. my sister and i would watch it, rewind it, and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another. so, if you are an 11-year old girl, and you reviewed this film as "brilliant" or "fun" or "better than the original grease," you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass.<br /><br />if, however, you are not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that grease 2 was anything but an inane, artless, slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production, distribution, and/or consumption.<br /><br />for the sake of criticism, i will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows
