sogo ishii can be a skilled filmmaker under the right conditions, but gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival, a scion of the genji clan. the film-making has the main hallmarks of a low-budget production, including blurry fight scenes and clumsy montages (the kind you might find in an under-produced dorama). the monk benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his destiny lies in defeating the mysterious spirit that guards gojoe bridge at night, but he doesn't realize that this decision will bring him squarely into conflict with nearly every element of society at that time - but which could earn him enlightenment. <br /><br />there's no absence of ambitiousness, however, in its depiction of the conflict between the holy and the worldly. artsy flourishes in some of the photography and editing help to compensate for the loose film-making style. <br /><br />a disappointment.
