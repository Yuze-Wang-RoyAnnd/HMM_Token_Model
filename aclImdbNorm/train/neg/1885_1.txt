if you are looking for a film the portrays the pointless and boring existence of middle class lives caught in a web of non-communication and false ideals, then this is the film for you. if you also what the film to be engaging and keep your interest, then you should probably look elsewhere. there are many films that do this far better. for example, try some of the darker films by bergman. the filmmaker felt that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class he should subject the viewer to one agonizingly dull and vacuous incident after another until the film finally comes to its tortuous and pathetic end. if you value your time there are far better ways to spend two hours, like cleaning your house, for example.
