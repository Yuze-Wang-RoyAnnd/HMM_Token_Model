i wasn't expecting much of this film- a fun little diversion. wuthering heights could be turned into a plausible modern story- nice and soapy, melodramatic and intriguing. but this film decided to throw away the talents of the people involved in a simpering version so watered down from the source material that it's amazing they had the guts to call it wuthering heights at all. it ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are in essence unlikeable, mostly unsympathetic, and frequently cruel to one another. it changes the very nature of certain characters- isabelle, for instance, in the novel, had not a conniving bone in her body- they've stripped her blind idealism and turned her into a scheming whore. heathcliff is an awful person who psychologically tortures most people in his path, but in this version catherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care. the dialog is trite and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver any of it with straight faces. in place of depth or actual emotions, we know they mean something when they scream it in someone's face. i've read criticism of the early 90's version, "emily bronte's wuthering heights" which featured ralph fiennes and juliette binoche, saying that it turned an intensely dark, gothic story into a sudsy bodice-ripper. slightly valid comments, but the mtv version goes a step further, using the basic story structure to deliver chipper beach bums cavorting to really bad music.
