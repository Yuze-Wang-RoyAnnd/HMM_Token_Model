i had to endure teen-aged, high school angst and family conflict for almost all of the show. i really do not care about high-school girls fretting about their relationships. i've spent my time in hell dealing with such issues and i care nothing about fictional teenies going through "lite" versions of the horrors i endured. i want science fiction. that's the only reason i'm here. there were a few seconds of science fiction late in the show. we finally see a proto-cylon. it was good but with one problem. its red eye-dot would lock onto an object of interest. we all know that cylon eyedots always scan back and forth, giving the machine a map of the world. the red eye-dot does not ever stop moving back and forth.<br /><br />i really hope the writers fix this abuse before the second episode.
