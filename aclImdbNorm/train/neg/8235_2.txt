as horror fans we all know that blind rentals are a crap-shoot. sometimes we find a real gem, but many times we find that the film we've just spent our hard earned money on is nothing more than a putrid steamer made worse by the completely undeserved rave reviews and film fest awards listed on the box. such is the case with five across the eyes ( a title i'm sure is a double entendre referring to both the films budget and the compulsion anyone watching it might have to using all five fingers to stab their eyes out ).<br /><br />the story, or, at least what the *ahem* writers think passes for one, centers on a group of teen girls who unwisely decide to go on a backwoods joyride late at night after leaving a football game and run afoul of a crazy woman who plays cat and mouse with them as punishment for what she thinks the girls found in her car after a fender-bender in a gas station parking lot.<br /><br />in fairness, it's an interesting idea. some of the best horrors have very simple story lines. it's in the execution of five across the eyes that this idea falls flat. the film tries to be a cross between the blair witch project with its shaky camera work and the texas chainsaw massacre in its bare-bones approach to the material but succeeds at being neither. what we get instead are redundant scenes of chase, torture, release; chase torture, release, in that order for 94 minutes with long interludes of bitching, moaning, and incoherent rambling acting as plenty of padding in-between chase sequences.<br /><br />the look of the film is incredibly grainy and dark, which, in a better made film might have enhanced the tension and the realism. here it's merely annoying. the characters are undeveloped and the viewer is hard-pressed to find anything to sympathize with them. one character stops to get a first-aid kit and tend to some scrapes on her face while gunshots heard in the background indicate her friends may be getting killed. another girl mutters hilariously dumb lines like "don't go out there, she'll get you, if she gets you she'll kill you and if she kill's you you're dead".<br /><br />it was an accolade from fangoria magazine and dreadcentral.com listed on the box that compelled me to check this one out. talk about a fake orgasm! perhaps my expectations would have been met had this been in the comedy section. i'm all for low-budget indie horror but this one takes the crap-cake. give five across the eyes (or fate; get it?) a pass.<br /><br />razorfriendly gives fate 1 slash out of five /
