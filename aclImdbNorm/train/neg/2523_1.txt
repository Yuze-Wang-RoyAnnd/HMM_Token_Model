r o b o t j o x.<br /><br />burn the master.<br /><br />grotesquely horrible.<br /><br />no ending; no closure.<br /><br />completely and utterly the worst movie ever made.<br /><br />replaces "the adventures of pluto nash" as the worst movie of all time.<br /><br />i hate this utterly unacted, unedited, unscripted, undirected, unproduced mess of a thing called "robot jox" - and i just found out - they made a second one!?!? i apologize to adma sandler (zohar the beauticin) and eddie murphy (pluto nash) for hating their movies. this mess of a thing makes those movies only bad - not terrible horrible and grotesque like this thing. this is the only movie for which i have ever said this - remove it from netflix - now!!! 10,000 out of 10 people found this comment helpful.
