as someone who was staggered at the incredible visuals of "hero," i was anxious to see this film which was billed as being along the same lines, but better. it also featured an actress i like: ziyi zhang. well, i was disappointed on both counts. i bought the dvd of this film sight-unseen, and that was a mistake. it was not better.<br /><br />i realize these flying-through-the-air martial arts films are pure fantasy but this story is stretched so far past anything remotely believable it just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief. a blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents? sorry, that's going a little far. also, the major male character 'jin" (takeshi kaneshiro) was so annoying with his dialog, stupid look on his face and stupid laugh, that he ruined the film, too.<br /><br />despite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes, this story - to me - just didn't have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning. this film is no "hero" of mine!
