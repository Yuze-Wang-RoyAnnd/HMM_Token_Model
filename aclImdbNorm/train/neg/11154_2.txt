this move was on tv last night. i guess as a time filler, because it sucked bad! the movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way. (not bad tits and ass though). but the story is too ridiculous for words. the "wolf", if that is what you can call it, is hardly shown fully save his teeth. when it is fully in view, you can clearly see they had some interns working on the cgi, because the wolf runs like he's running in a treadmill, and the cgi fur looks like it's been waxed, all shiny :)<br /><br />the movie is full of gore and blood, and you can easily spot who is going to get killed/slashed/eaten next. even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed, they didn't do a good job at it.<br /><br />don't even get me started on the actors... very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds. but then again, if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks, then hey, where do i sign up?<br /><br />overall boring and laughable horror.
