if bob ludlum was to see this mini series, he would have cried. this was complete waste of time and money. i have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be, cbs wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was ludlum's work.<br /><br />may be the creator should check out the bourne identity with richard chamberlain and see how good that tv series was.<br /><br />poor mira, blair, anjelica and colm, why did they sign to stoop this low?<br /><br />horrible!!
