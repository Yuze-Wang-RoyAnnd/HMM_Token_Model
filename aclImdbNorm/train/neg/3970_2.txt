okay. look- i've seen lots and i do mean lots of these types of films. you know, the ones where the dvd cover just look so good and scaarrryyy that you just cant wait to see it? well, i got got again. and i'm getting' pretty tired of it. but i digress. it's pretty simple. it sucked(i know, rather juvenile) but it did. andi so agree with the other poster that if we had to sit through the boring thing, why oh why did the lead actress have to be so unnattractive?distractingly so if i may add. and the scowl she used convey unresolved pain/grief over the death of her daughter did little help. i mean, jesus.. oh, but the crawling-on-her-back-demon thingee was pretty neat...
