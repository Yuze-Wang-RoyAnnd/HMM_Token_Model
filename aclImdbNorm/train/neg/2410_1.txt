hood of the living dead and all of the other movies these guys directed look like they got together and filmed this with their buddies who have zero talent one afternoon when they were bored (lines are completely unrehearsed and unconvincing). i find that 95% of amateur movies and 90% of home video footage is better than this film (although the similarities between them warrant the comparison). "hey lets see if anyone is dumb enough to buy our movies!". hopefully nobody else wasn't. my apologies to those involved in the flic as this review is somewhat harsh but i was the dope who read your fake reviews and purchased the movie.
