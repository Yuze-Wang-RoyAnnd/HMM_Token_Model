i am a kind person, so i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1. it was without a doubt the worst movie that i've seen in a long time. there was very little plot and the deeper interesting areas that were touched upon i.e. what jesus may really have wanted us to know, were glossed over and instead we were given heavy visual doses of sadistic punishment inflicted upon our heroine (arquette). total crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would have been more humane to both her character and the audience. the acting was barely there and the direction was uninspired. and, if i saw one more drip of water or dove flying toward the camera, i may have started screaming louder than patricia.
