i'm a fan of both shakespeare and mst3k, so i waited anxiously to see this episode. i'll comment on the movie first, then the mst3k episode. the recipe for this movie: take talented actors, rich and beautiful shakespeare material, and a $1.25 budget. mix well, then drain of all life and movement, until dull and lifeless. serve cold in a big, plain stone cauldron. movie, i give 3 out of 10, because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit. okay, now the mst3k episode. i'll admit it, the first time i saw it, i fell asleep halfway through. i understand that was the reaction of several other veiwers as well. however, when i watched it a second time, i realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and good lines i missed the first time around. the trick with this episode is: listen carefully! it takes a couple of viewings to catch each line. give it a second chance, and you'll see what i mean. mst3k episode: 7 1/2 out of 10.
