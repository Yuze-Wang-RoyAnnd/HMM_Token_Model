a young scientist harry harrison is continuing his late father's scientific research into limb regeneration with flying colours, but his interferingly dominate mother and her doctor lover want to sell off the serum. when he finds out, there is an accident involving harry losing an arm. so, he tries out the serum and what eventuates is a genetically deranged arm that has a mind of its own.<br /><br />oh we've seen this oh so many times before, but what lifts this very campy and quite rubbery shonky junk is the performance of movie icons elke sommer and oliver reed. actually it's not a bad flick by fangoria films; just there are better ones out there, which are similar in vein. "servered ties" simply lacks it own distinctive style. the oddball nature and unpleasant splatter resembled "re-animator" and even a touch of slapstick stuck out like something from "evil dead 2".<br /><br />the comic story is truly whacked out with it's black humour, but it can get melodramatic and a bit in dry in the fun factor. surprises do crop up, especially the flick's final outcome. which is well accepted, as i thought it could have copped out with something more accessible. for a low-budget production the fx makeup can look rigid and very goofy, but there's some grotesque moments that will make you smile than actually cringe. even a brush of sexual tension streamlines the story, thanks to elke sommer's sternly juicy performance as the mother. oliver reed is quite humorously deadpan in a wicked sense and he pulls it off extremely well. they were both immensely diverting as the couple you loved to hate. billy morrisette is delightful in a erratic performance as harry. director damon santostefano briskly paces the film and orchestrates some stylish scenes of gripping and bamboozling horror.<br /><br />yeah it's juvenile and basically silly nonsense, but you got to hand it to it for some undemanding entertainment.
