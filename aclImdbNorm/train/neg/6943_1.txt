this movie is deeply idiotic. a man wants revenge for a crime- but when he enacts his revenge- there is a video camera pointed right at him the entire time. what man with a brain cell in his head would sit there and do this for so long in front of a video camera?<br /><br />just the fact that this script could never even happen except with someone unable to dress themselves destroyed it for me- but it got dumber!!!<br /><br />i am thinking the script writers have some serious habits that are cooking their brain cells and making them miss plot holes you can drive an battalion of armored tanks through.<br /><br />plot: a man seeks revenge for the death of loved ones, but in the middle of the plot something goes totally wrong, and then the unexpected unfolds.<br /><br />if only these people writing this story hadn't been so dumb as to write totally unrealistic plot turns that could never happen this way. to the writers i say- seek help for your serious mental problem.
