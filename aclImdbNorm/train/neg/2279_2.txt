boy what a dud this mess was.but it only lasts an hour and i only paid a buck for it so i'll live....unlike the entire cast of this 1933 clunker who are all dust by now.<br /><br />so anyway a small village starts having bodies turning up that have been drained of all their blood.the local yokels start talking about vampires ,of course,and a little more loudly after each body is found.the town sheriff or constable or whatever he is,played by awesome actor melvyn douglas,tries to tell them otherwise.when he mentions the fact that the dead have one large hole on each side of the neck,instead of two holes close together, the locals simply then say it's a giant vampire bat.the constable insists that vampires do not exist and it must be a human culprit doing the killings.<br /><br />but melvyn doesn't seem too bothered either way.he spends most of his time trying to get into the pantaloons of his sweetie,played by faye wray.also in this mix is the town simpleton,played by dwight frye,who always seemed to have played the same role in every movie he did.he further freaks out the townspeople by catching bats and drinking his own blood.lionel atwill plays the town doctor who seemingly is trying to help the constable solve the crimes.and boy does he ever stink as an actor.atwill is as close to cardboard in this role as he could get.and lionel barrymore is also in this thing....lots of big names to be such a pile of guano.<br /><br />other than the terrible mis-title this movie has,the alternate name,"the blood sucker" is much better,this movie is also dull and plodding and just silly.<br /><br />for me the high point of the movie is watching frye,he nails the freaky town weirdo but other than him this movie didn't offer much.and then when you find out the reason for the strange deaths and see the special effect thing that required all this blood you'll really be let down.<br /><br />bela lugosi did a lot of awful pictures but at least he was fun and interesting to watch.think of this movie as a really bad lugosi clunker without lugosi and you'll get a feel for how miserably bad this mess was.<br /><br />if you can't make a good 1930's horror film at least put lugosi in it.
