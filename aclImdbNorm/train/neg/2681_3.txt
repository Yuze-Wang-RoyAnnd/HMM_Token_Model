a very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting, but where the hell is the ending to this film?<br /><br />in fact, what is the point of it?<br /><br />the scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally, and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storyline.<br /><br />the performances of the cast are questionable, if not believable.<br /><br />did i miss the conclusion somewhere in the film? i guess we have to wait for the sequel.<br /><br />
