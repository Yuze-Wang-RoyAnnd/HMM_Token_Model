this movie sucked plain and simple. okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped, and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist. the rapist is a douche, but the girl victim is partly to blame. i mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff, but when the rapist tries to have sex with her, she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her. and the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything, but when it comes to the rapist getting raped, it's a pretty long rape scene. there is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching.<br /><br />3.2/10
