i had a feeling that after "submerged", this one wouldn't be any better... i was right. he must be looking for champagne money, and not care about the final product... his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him; the editing is - well - just a grade above amateurish. it's nothing more than a b or c-grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an "ok" sound designer.<br /><br />like the previous poster said, the problems seem to appear in post-production (...voice dubbing, etc.) too bad, cause the plot's actually ok for a sg flick.<br /><br />i'll never rent another sg flick, unless he emails me asking for forgiveness.<br /><br />too bad - i miss kelly lebrock...<br /><br />--jimbo
