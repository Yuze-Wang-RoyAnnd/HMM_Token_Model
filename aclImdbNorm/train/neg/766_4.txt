whenever a columbo story deviates from the familiar plot (colorful killer commits crime, columbo smokes out killer, columbo becomes a pest in the process), the writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes. this episode deviates in the extreme, and the result is a major flop.<br /><br /> would you believe: columbo never faces the villain till the very end?!!<br /><br />frankly, i was tempted to turn it off about two-thirds through.<br /><br /> oh, the sacrifices we self-appointed reviewers make!!!
