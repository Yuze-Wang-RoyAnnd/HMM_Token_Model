i really tried to like this movie but in the end it just didn't work for me. i have seen most of kitamura's output and have found it to be very variable. alive, like all of his films has an interesting plot, some nifty sequences and a fair amount of creativity. however, these qualities are in painfully short supply in alive. the plot is cool if not all that original and could have made for a pretty ace film. unfortunately, the pacing is painfully slow and the film takes an age to get going, before reaching fairly predictable places. the action is just about passable, with the final fight pretty cool, and the earlier one about ok. the earlier one is also marred by overspeedy camera-work, making for less coherency. there are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue but the film still drags badly. the characters are neither well fleshed out nor well acted and the setting and general color scheme is drab and boring. the film is not completely terrible and has some points of interest, perhaps judicious use of the fast forward button could improve it. with about twenty minutes taken off the run time this could be a pretty decent sci fi thriller. but the full length film is dull. only recommended to very patient and determined kitumura fans.
