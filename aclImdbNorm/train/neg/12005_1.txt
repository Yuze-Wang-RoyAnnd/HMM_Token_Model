we all have seen some unending epics in our times, but this one really tops them all! the movie is so long and so slow, that, just to put things in perspective, i felt a lot older when i left movie hall, than i entered it. at almost 4 hours length, it could have rather been made into a tele-serial.<br /><br />what starts as a promising comedy slowly loses its pace. nikhil advani has woven the plot around 6 love stories and he cant make justice to any one of them... there is no interconnection between them to start with, and links shown in last 20 minutes just seem to be forced to connect the story.<br /><br />situation is made worse by silly dialogues (most of them repeated in hindi cinema over years)and stupid cinematography.<br /><br />priyanka doesn't realise that she actually needs to play her role rather than just looking glam on screen... an utter waste of beauty without acting skills.<br /><br />and then there is loud-is-humorous govinda & my-face-twists-better-than-jim-carrey akshay khanna who keep belching at the top of their lungs to irritate already tired viewers.<br /><br />only good part in movie is john & vidya's love story & nice acting/comedy by sohail & isha. but they are so good at their roles that just these two couples could have justified the movie without jumbling it with other bunch of characters. their brilliance gets lost in the midst of other substandard plot lines.<br /><br />my guess - director was making two separate movies(may be more!) and some beginner assistant mixed up all the records, beyond a point of sorting them out, so director was left with no choice to show it all as a single movie...<br /><br />watch it only if you want to test your patience!!!
