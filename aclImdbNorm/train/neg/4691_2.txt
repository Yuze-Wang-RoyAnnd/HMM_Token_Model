a real blow-up of the film literally. this british film is boringly made.<br /><br />what an exciting plot! a terrorist places bombs on a train. how could the writers and producers of this stinker turn this into such a dull story?<br /><br />glenn ford, as the expert called upon to defuse the bomb, is given awful writing material to work with. naturally, just as he is called in, his wife, anne vernon, is about to leave him. no wonder we never heard of miss vernon. after such a film, it would be enough to end her career.<br /><br />that elderly man who loved trains and interferes is our 1953 version of senile dementia. i thought it was highly insulting to show this man, even at the end.
