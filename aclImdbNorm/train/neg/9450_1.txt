spend your time any other way, even housework is better than this movie. the jokes aren't funny, the fun rhymes that are dr. seus aren't there. a very lousy way to waste an evening. my kids 4-16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net. my wife left and did dishes. so i finished it alone. it was the worst "kids" movie i have seen. if you want to watch a fun kids movie watch shrek 2, that movie is fun for kids and their parents. avoid this movie. it isn't funny, isn't cute, the cat's makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label.
