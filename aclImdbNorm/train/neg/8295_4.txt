i tend to like character-driven films. i also think hope davis turns in consistently good work, so i had high hopes for this movie. those hopes were soon dashed.<br /><br />the main flaw with this movie is the direction. there are a lot of scenes that are daydream sequences. the movie makes frequent use of the denis leary character as the alter ego of the campbell scott character. it doesn't work for me at all. this would have worked better as a play than a movie.<br /><br />there are problems with the plot as well. it is important that the characters in a movie take a journey and end up in a place different from where they started. i didn't feel that the characters grew in the experiences portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />finally, the editing wasn't well done, either. there was a very big sag in the middle of the movie that was exceptionally boring.<br /><br />except for acting, which i felt was consistently strong, this movie failed in almost every aspect of cinema.
