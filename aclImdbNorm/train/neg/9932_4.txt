dan duryea, a perfectly decent b-movie actor who made lots of lookalike noirs in the 1940s, can't do much with this one: young man is accused of murdering an unhappily married singer; when he's sentenced to die, his wife decides to solve the case herself with help from the dead woman's husband. after a dazzling opening shot, flick quickly settles into b-movie formula. it certainly looks good, but the twist finish is colorlessly handled and the cast (including peter lorre and broderick crawford) is just a bit stiff. based on a cornell woolrich novel, and passable for a single viewing. <br /><br />** from ****
