all hype! what better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can't release their film through a mainstream distributor? consequently, they do it themselves. otherwise, the hype of the film doesn't justify the content in the film. the story is absent and could easily be a short. the acting is poor, but the animation and music is pretty good. otherwise don't waste your time - don't believe the hype! however, if you have the chance to see the film for free, do so. then you won't have to waste money. still, the filmmakers do a good job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their self-indulgent mini-series. otherwise, they're one hit wonders who never had a hit.
