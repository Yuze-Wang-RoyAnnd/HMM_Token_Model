it's a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie. besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments, what's so difficult about capturing the robbers? just eliminate the bank workers, see who was at the bank-from all the cameras' footage angles-prior to the robbers entry and you have those extra 4 remaining robbers among the hostages. where is the suspense every body is talking about? it was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door... seen it many times. at least mr. spike lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting. the movie is not worth it. pronto!
