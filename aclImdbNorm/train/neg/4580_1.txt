i'm still trying to decide if this is indeed, the worst film i have ever seen - a very disturbing problem with this film is that real scientists are interviewed, but their footage is edited to make it look as though they support the ideas of the many bsers who populate this film. the bs to signal ratio of the interviews is about ten thousand to one - at the end, the interviewees seem to be saying, "we want you to _think_ !!", but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research about things they assert as fact.<br /><br />if you feel that you are open-minded, and wish to expand your consciousness, please be open-minded enough to read some actual books about quantum theory: "einstein's universe", nigel calder (a slim volume, not a challenge), "the cosmic code", by heinz pagels. if you can't bring yourself to read a book, please don't complain to reviewers about being "open-minded".<br /><br />to recap, this film is just unbelievably bad.<br /><br />you know what's a really good film which questions the nature of reality? "thirteenth floor", directed by roland emmerich, with craig bierko, gretchen mol, vincent d'onofrio. smart, sexy, thought-provoking.
