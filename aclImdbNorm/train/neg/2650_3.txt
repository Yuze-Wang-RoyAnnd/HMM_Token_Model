as i sat subjected to this televised mediocrity, i wondered why? why did dianne keaton agree to this trash? the movie uses meaningless, contrived plot lines to deliver trash to homes of thousands. the movie takes a political agenda to a new level. the movie was meaningless, and all creditability was lost to the excessive use of stereotype. <br /><br />it was obvious that keaton tried to make this movie worthwhile, but in the end she needs to remember the age old adage that you cannot polish a turd. i hope that you did not waste your new year's day watching another mindless made for tv movie. i now know why the networks started airing series on sunday night, to rid us of trash!
