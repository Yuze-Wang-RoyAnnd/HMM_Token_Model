i watched this movie because i like nicolas cage and well, i found it strange and completely pointless... so i decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the 70s copy of it. wow. what a difference. the original one was way better. i'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement, it's existence did have a purpose. it was really the christian public expressing their fear of paganism. if you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but i don't want to go into details, just, simply put, if you were disappointed and you'd like to know what it should look like, feel free to watch the 70s version, a little dated, but a lot better.
