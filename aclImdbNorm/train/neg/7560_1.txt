how this film could miss so many of the fascinating, complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable. an unbelievably thin and unengaging plot, ankle-deep characterisation/motivation and a really awful soundtrack (replacing tension with vast swathes of noise, replacing the arcane musical references of the original for digitised crashes and roars. then there are the specific references to the original which are merely "plastered on" over the cracks... dreadful. in a world where gormless, brain-dead amerikan remakes of the italian job (a tear appears), get carter (sobs uncontrollably) and alfie have desecrated our screens recently, this one takes the proverbial biscuit. execrable nonsense. how ellen burstyn ever got involved is a wonder... rubbish.
