first off, i'd like to say that the user comments alone left me with tears in my eyes from laughing. one comment that bad sf movies become good comedies is right on the mark. mst3000 made it's living off that.<br /><br />if you look at the angry red planet as the fever dream of a 10 year old comic book reader from 1959, you'll have the handle on this sucker. all the elements are there: the pseudoscience, occasionally logical, more often hilariously infantile. the adolescent boy attitude toward sex, with the "gigolo" captain (good call on that one, guys!) making eyes at the buxom "scientist" with hair so red it's a wonder it doesn't set off the fire alarms. the ridiculous conception of mars as a planet so alien that everything glows red, yet one alien monster has a mouse face, and the blob alien has an eye that rotates like a kid's toy. the comic relief, an overweight astronaut (!) who sounds like he never finished the 8th grade in brooklyn and has a psychotic fixation on his ray gun. and of course, the mere fact that alien = dangerously evil. if these people had met e.t., they would have roasted him in two seconds flat! "ow" indeed!<br /><br />don't get me wrong. i rated this movie low. still, it's never boring (except when the scientist tries to explain everything - only to make it all sound more and more ridiculous), and you have to admit, in your little kid core, it makes you jump a few times. <br /><br />okay, then don't admit it. i guess you were never 10.
