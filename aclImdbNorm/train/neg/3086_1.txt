i once thought that "the stoned age" was the worst film ever made... i was wrong. "hobgoblins" surpassed it in every way i could imagine and a few i couldn't. in "the stoned age" i hated the characters. in "hobgoblins" i hated the actors... and everyone else involved in creating this atrocity. i won't include a teaser to this film, i'm not that cruel. i couldn't subject innocent people such as yourselves to such torment. in fact, any discussion of plot pertaining to this film is senseless and demeaning. words i would use to describe this film are as follows: insipid, asinine, and ingenuous.<br /><br />in conclusion, please don't watch this film. i beg of you, from one movie lover to another... no, from one human being to another, please. for the sake of your own sanity and intellect do not watch it. destroy any copies you come across.
