this movie was on the romance channel, and i thought it might be a goofy 80's movie that would be enjoyable on some level, so my brother and i watched it. boy did it suck. boy gets crush on girl--correction, his *dream*-girl (apparently there is a difference; and i'm surprised he realized she was his dream girl--he was smitten with her from over 30 feet away. i guess that just goes to show the power of dream-girls), boy ends up masquerading as a female to be near dream-girl (creative in the sense that it's a far-out plan, but un-creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions one might think up), awkward situations ensue, a match is made (all of which takes seems to take place around late afternoon--either the location was somehow responsible for this odd lighting, or the actors had to wait until they got off of their day-jobs to come to the set; i suspect the latter). very clumsily done, very pathetic. it's almost never even amusing *accidentally*, so there really is nothing to redeem it. unless you're interested in seeing chad lowe's early days, before he finally got his piece of the pie with his role as the hiv-positive gay guy on the series "life goes on", or gail o'grady who was on nypd blue and probably got to stare at dennis franz's buttocks). but those are unlikely motives--i'd say "systematic derangement of the senses" would be a more justified purpose. i'm surprised i watched it all. i guess it's the kind of thing where, halfway through, you find yourself *still* watching due to some morbid, self-flagellistic inner-issue, and think you might as well finish it so you can tell your friends and family that you actually sat through such a horrible movie, on the off-chance that it'll garner you some sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health. can *you* take the challenge?
