i like billy crystal, and i thought it would be fun to watch this film, since i know he admired alan king and they would be funny together. i thought i had seen all billy's movies but couldn't remember this one, and now i know why. it's so full of clich'es and phony emotion; you can smell each scene coming (and going!). billy doesn't even get to be funny very often. he's too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down. alan king himself is fairly likable, as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies. but what a coincidence that billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place, etc. etc. or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in la. and when the end comes, boy, does it come quickly! almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene. mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor.
