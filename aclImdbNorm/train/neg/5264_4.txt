disappearance is set in the mojave desert as jim (harry hamlin) & patty henley (susan dey) plus their two kids katie (basia a'hern) & matt (jeremey lelliott) along with ethan (jamie croft) a friend of the family are travelling along, they stop at a roadside diner & ask about an old deserted mining town on the map called weaver. no-one claims to have heard of it but it's definitely there & the family decide to take a detour in order to check it out & take some pictures. once at the town they take some pictures & have a look around but when it comes time to leave their car won't start & they have to spend the night there. while looking around they find a camcorder videotape which they play only to discover footage of a scared woman saying all her friends have disappeared, the next morning & their car has disappeared as things take a very sinister turn. what is weaver's secret? will the henley's ever leave there alive...<br /><br />written, co-executive produced & directed by walter klenhard i have to say that disappearance is one of the most frustrating films i have ever watched. for the first 85 minutes it was a pretty good mysterious mix of thriller & horror film but then we are treated to one of the single worst endings ever in motion picture history. the script suggest lots of different things but never elaborates or confirms & i was sitting there genuinely intrigued about what was going on, from the families car mysterious disappearing, the four recent graves, the thing in the abandoned mines, the supernatural sandstorm, the sudden & unexplained disappearance of ethan & his just as unexplained reappearance, the sheriff's sinister motives, the compass in the car going crazy, the crashed plane, the townspeople denying weaver existed & the possible side effects of a neutron bomb being dropped near weaver in the 40's but they are all tossed out of the window & for all we know could have been totally separate random events. everything was coming along nicely & was set up for a big twist revelation but none was forthcoming & instead i was treated to the most ambiguous, strange, surreal & downright frustrating ending possible. if nothing else the ending contradicts much of what has gone before & leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. it's almost as if the makers had these great ideas but then didn't know what to do with them & just made the ending up on the spot. i just felt i put so much effort into watching the film which can be pretty slow at times without any sort of reward & in fact the ending felt more like a kick in the teeth or a good two finger salute!<br /><br />director klenhard does a reasonable job here, the old ghost town has a certain atmosphere & the large expansive desert locations give a good sense of isolation. it's well made but what were they thinking with that ending? nothing fits, nothing makes sense & it's just a huge frustrating mess that after sitting through the thing for nearly an hour & a half leaves you confused & wanting to know more. despite being a horror film there's no blood or gore although there are one or two creepy moments here & there. the film actually reminds of the hills have eyes (2006) remake for large parts as that is what the film is set-up to be before a bizarre ending which does nothing to bring any closure to the film.<br /><br />technically the film is good with high production values, good special effects, sets, locations & cinematography. set in america but filmed in south australia. the acting is fine from a decent cast.<br /><br />disappearance is a really odd film, for a long time it shapes up to be a neat little horror mystery thriller but it never explains anything which happens & the truly surreal ending just throws up more questions than answers. i really can't see anyone making head nor tail of this, i really can't.
