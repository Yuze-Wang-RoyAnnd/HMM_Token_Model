before starting to watch the show, i've heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting. what a deception, the scripts are so dumb that i am quite sure the authors are son and grandson of scoobidoo writers. and what about the sfx and colors, they are so extreme that it is painful to watch, colors are not saturated they are over saturated, like scripts are overwritten and show is overrated. this show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that because these ingredients are the best, they are sufficient. unfortunately for this show, the only two ingredients of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility.
