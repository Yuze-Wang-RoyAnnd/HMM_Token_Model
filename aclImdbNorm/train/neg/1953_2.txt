the first episode of this new show was on today, and it was horrible. not only did shaggy have a squeaky new voice that made listening to his lines torture, but it's so far away from the original concept and animation style that it's barely recognizable as a 'scooby-doo' show.<br /><br />even back in the dark days when fred and velma were gone and scooby's nephew scrappy was there, the team still solved mysteries. this new show instead features shaggy and scooby battling a james bond type super-villain and his henchmen while living in a mansion. there's not even a van called 'the mystery machine' (and the teaser for the next episode which promised a transformers type robot car did not put my mind at ease). how can anyone take scooby doo and make this? <br /><br />the show earns two point for two scenes featuring the whole scooby doo gang, all of whom speak with the correct voices except shaggy, and even then i'm being far too generous.
