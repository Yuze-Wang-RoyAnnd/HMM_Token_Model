i saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real, who would want to see this movie and at the same time i thought that, my girl friend turned to me and said "we have to go see this movie"...enough said so i saw this about 5 minutes go and i tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there weren't even any of those. it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the director has no influence no perspective the same shots were used again and again he did not build up suspense the cast probably were simply told scream cry run fall. i would love to see the script as the first 40 mins was mostly annoying girly giggles and bad music, there was absolutely no character development.<br /><br />the plot is just...well there was no plot it was basically i know we will terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a stalker serial killer, that's brilliant! hmmm the acting was what you expect in a australian soap opera hopeless, that main character the blondie god dam she annoyed me. her longest line must have been half a sentence, and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expression.<br /><br />please listen to me if you have any taste in movies don't go see this, and if your like me and don't have a choice well then i wish you good luck, maybe smuggle in an ipod or magazine. can't believe this film got made!
