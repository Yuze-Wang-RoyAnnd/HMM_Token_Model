sly stallone is hardly the finest actor in the world but compared to his brother, frank...well, roll out those awards now! mullet haired, muppet frank seems to think that every part he plays, calls for him doing the role as an american/italian wise-guy refugee from the 'godfather.' please, somebody make him an acting offer 'he can refuse!' this film just stinks the place out, even by the terrible overacting in this, frank still steals the acting dishonours. all the people compensate for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing their arms about, gesticulating wildly in a style that went out of fashion back with silent films.<br /><br />the plot, what there, is, makes no sense as a meteor lands and turns all the women into sex-crazed nymphets but as this is 15 certificate film, that just means they strip to their underwear and make moaning sounds like dogs on heat. what happens in the end, i'm not quite sure as i was losing the will to live long before the film finished.<br /><br />avoid this like the plague and watch 'deep impact' for a reasonable film about a meteor about to hit the earth.<br /><br />n.b. point of order: when one of the female leads strips down to her underwear, she has her knickers/panties under her suspenders/garter belt, it's knickers over the suspenders to allow women to go to the toilet with less fuss. a trivial point, perhaps, but shows how dumb this film is when they can't even get this right!
