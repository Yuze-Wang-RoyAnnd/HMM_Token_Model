ok, forget all the technical inconsisties or the physical impossibilities of the space shuttle accidentally being launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold. forget the hideous special effects and poorly-constructed one-dimensional characters. just looking at the premise of the story. the very reason for the film to exist in the first place, and you will see just how badly this film was pieced together.<br /><br />i know 9 year olds that look at this insult to the intelligence and just laugh at it. the story is horrible. the acting is comical and the message its trying to show is incomprehensible. and whats worse, is that the cable movie channels keep showing it! its on twice a day every two or three days! why does anyone in their right mind think that people would want to see this painful piece of celluloid multiple times, much less to see it at all?<br /><br />my recomendation is dont even bother spending the energy to watch this thing. its just not worth it.
