i have grown up with scooby doo all my life, my dad grew up with scooby doo. we have just watched the first episode of the travesty that calls itself shaggy and scooby get a clue. what planet are warner bros on allowing this shambles to air. the characters could have been drawn better by my younger sister. the story could have been better written by my 3 year old twin cousins (who are scooby doo fans too). scooby and shaggy just aren't!!!!! if anyone but casey kasem does the voice of shaggy it just isn't gonna work folks!!!! trust me.<br /><br />this program was disgraceful. what's new scooby doo is much better. why change a winning format. bin this piece of garbage and go back to the true scooby
