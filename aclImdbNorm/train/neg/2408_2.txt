this movie is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re-animates the dead. he first uses it on his brother when he is shot dead in a drive by. his brother then infects the other gang members.in some scenes the zombies are seen walking very slowly and in other scenes they run pretty fast which makes little sense. the acting is mediocre but the story doesn't help the film. the makeup consists of blood on the face of the zombies. the budget for this film i'm sure was very limited. i believe the film could have been better made had the story been more original and with a better budget. if you wan't to see a good zombie flick don't see this one.
