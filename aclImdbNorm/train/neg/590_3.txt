i was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror. the basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasn't able to excite, really scare or shock me - there was one part in the entire film that i thought was gruesome but even that didn't redeem it. i did get to like the character of kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end, the character played by jeremy sheffield was not actually needed for this film and i think the director/writer got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose, if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on kate's part, it may have worked - jeremy's acting was wooden to say the least and i felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry - or lack of it. such a shame. disappointing.
