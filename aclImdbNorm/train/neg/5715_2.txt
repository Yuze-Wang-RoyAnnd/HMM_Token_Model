'say yes' is one of those flicks that you keep hoping is going to get better, but it never does. it's the kind of 'motiveless psychopath decides to menace an innocent couple' crapfest, so beloved of straight to video film-makers. <br /><br />the dialogue is clunky and, in several places, poorly translated. the acting is uniformly poor, especially from the villain of the piece, played by joong-hoon park. he seems to think that by not blinking and trying to talk in a deep voice he is making his character seem threatening, when all it really does is make him seem a bit simple.<br /><br />the plot deserves special mention, as it is idiotic beyond all belief. the 'heroes' don't think it overly strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them. the 'heroine' twice manages to miss seeing the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her. the villain gets past a police checkpoint (while wearing a shirt covered in blood, and a bloody head bandage) by showing the cops a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving. the villain is punched, clubbed with a shovel and stuck through with a pitchfork, but never seems to be impeded by these, rather serious, injuries. and don't even get me started on that terrible 'twist' ending. sheesh.<br /><br />the only plus point in this film, for me, is sang mi chu. who is very pretty, but really no more than a mediocre actress.<br /><br />overall, this film comes off like a poorly written, flaccidly acted and shockingly directed attempt to copy 'the hitcher' and 'spoorloos', but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent in everyone involved.
