this film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the dvd. however, the resulting movie is absolutely dire! admittedly, this is not the worst film ever made, or the worst film this year, but it came damn close!<br /><br />the main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? the story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, but the film is a mess. what starts out as a mildly interesting "comedy" (a word i use in the loosest possible terms), then goes totally in reverse, and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller. nicole kidman should know better, and ben chaplin is wasted! as are matthieu kassovitz and vincent cassel, whom i can only presume did this for the money.<br /><br />this is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect. it's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive benny hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty. a film to be avoided, unless you absolutely have to see kidman or chaplin in every one of their films!
