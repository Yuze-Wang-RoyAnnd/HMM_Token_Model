i gave this movie a rating of 1 (awful). the only reason that it should even get a 1 instead of a big -0- is ben kingsley, who always shines not matter what terrible material is thrown his way.<br /><br />mira sorvino is so out of her element here that as a viewer one simply can't get over the fact that she is even in such a piece.<br /><br />stupid, stupid story and horrible production. do not waste your video rental $.
