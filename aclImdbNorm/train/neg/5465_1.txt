this film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie i have ever seen. it is about as fun as doing hard manual labor with stomach cramps. the movie starts out bad (i would rate the first few minutes of the film a 1/10) and then it get progressively worse, minute by minute. the only way to rate it at all would be some kind of abyssmal spiraling negative number that grows for ninety, long minutes. unfunny is not a real word but it best describes the humor in this video. somehow the video manages even to make cute, scantily clad females and sex look grotesque and distasteful. this movie is amazingly bad. i would say it would be better to be locked up with the titanic theme playing over and over and with buscemi's character from escape from la droning on in your ear than to watch this movie. the sequels are not nearly as bad. if you have to rent a troma film, get tromeo and juliette or combat shock. i would rather watch 5 tony little infomercials back to back than to see class of nukem high again. don't get me wrong, it took some kind of criminal genius to make a movie this terrible and if ever a movie deserved an award for being awful, this is it.
