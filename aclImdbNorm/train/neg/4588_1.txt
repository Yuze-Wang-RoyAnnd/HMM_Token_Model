i created my own reality by walking out of the theater i was roped in by my girlfriend into going to this dreck with her mom. we (my g-friend and i) walked out about an hour into it. what a load of pseudo scientific new age jargon.<br /><br />sub atomic particles are thoughts? by taping labels to bottles of water and blessing it by a buddhist monk it grew little pretty crystals? a drop of 25% in the murder rate in dc happened when a bunch of folks meditated. wow, what a rigorous scientific study. i'm sure that someone ate cheerios for four days straight during the same time. should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the murder rate? <br /><br />hogwash, hooey, bull pucky! <br /><br />btw- it was funded by the ramtha cult, the leader of which was one of the "experts" which were interview by the filmmakers. no ulterior motives here, right?
