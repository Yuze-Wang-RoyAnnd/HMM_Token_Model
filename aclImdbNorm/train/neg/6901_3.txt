the most positive thing i can say for this dull witted local "comedy" production is that it's inoffensive. in fact it's so astonishingly bland that one wonders how many dozens of re-writes by committee it went through to have such a complete removal of personality. it's not witty, it's not entertaining, it's not insightful, and it's not charming. it's just a staid, laughless, progression of four losers who must change their ways - and their attitudes towards women - to be allowed to attend their best friend's wedding.<br /><br />with acting that would be sub par for the local amateur dramatics society, a plot line so tired it'd make a forty third season of 'allo 'allo look fresh, and jokes about as humorous as watching decaying vegetables, sione's wedding nonetheless scored ten (yes 10) nominations in the nz film awards recently.<br /><br />fortunately, somebody saw sense and it didn't win any.
