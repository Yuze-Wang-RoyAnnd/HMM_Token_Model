a bit of a disappointing film, i'd say: the acting was stilted, somehow. in many cases, i just couldn't feel that the facial expressions matched the words spoken or the intent of the scene. an angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) character should make the viewer believe that he's angry (or sad, happy, frustrated). that doesn't happen here.<br /><br />the comment about the writers assuming you already know the characters was apt. they do things and say things which come out of nowhere: the character andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to each other at dinner; then he blows up and storms out, telling his father "don't touch me, you f***!". maybe, if we'd seen the prequel, we would understand where all that comes from, but there is no prequel, so we're somewhat at sea as to the reason! <br /><br />one odd, quirky thing that andrew does is to go to an old stone quarry, sit down on the edge overlooking the "still water" below; then he reaches into his jeans pocket and extracts a pack of cigarettes and lights one up. he did this same thing three times during the film; i guess we're supposed to see this as some tortured act of being alone and angry? maybe once, but three times? it might even have been four times, i lost count.<br /><br />to be honest, there is the fact that he's recently found out that he's adopted; this happens very early in the film so there's no sense of any dramatic change he might be undergoing because of this discovery. it's not really clear if that's why he's so bitter or if it's about something else.<br /><br />i guess there is a sort of lynchian feel to the film but should a first-time director really be trying to scale such a mountain so early in his career?
