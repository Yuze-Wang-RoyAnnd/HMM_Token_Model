this hodge-podge adapted from a gore vidal novel (actually one of the great american writers) makes the magic christian and valley of the dolls look like fellini art-works. raquel welch, with an incredible body (and she's actually not very tall) in a lead role (except for kansas city bomber when she was quite good) playing rex reed's (bad movie reviewer; not critic) alter-ego, only to be surrounded by drag queen (great chick) mae west, horny john huston, a young and "naive" farrah fawcett (pre-lee majors; what a shame), and other various creep-azoids to pretend to spoof way too may things has nothing going for it except inter-spliced old films clips (i.e. widmark in kiss of death, lena horne)...just so they can continue to bleed the life out of everyone.<br /><br />a 2 out of 10. best performance = ?. it's so bad, it's worth seeing!
