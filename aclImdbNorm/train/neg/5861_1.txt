i saw this film when it first came out in 1978, when i was a sophomore in high school. i took a date to see it. i didn't "get any," needless to say, because the film was so bad! joan rivers' career never tanked as badly as it deserved after making this awful, unfunny crap. in fact, unfunny isn't a severe enough term: this film is anti-funny! you walk out feeling like any laughter that might have occurred was beaten out of you before it could happen. this isn't worth watching out of curiosity, or out of any sense of it being "so-bad-it's-good." not even the gang at mst3k could've made this worth watching! the fact that billy crystal's career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle.
