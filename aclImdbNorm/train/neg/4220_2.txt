a short review but...<br /><br />avoid at all costs, a thorough waste of 90mins. at the end of the film i was none the wiser as to what had actually happened. it's full of cameos (stephen fry (3mins), jack dee (30 secs), the "philadelphia" girls) and some vaguely recognisable people but it just doesn't make any sense. whether the story just got lost in the edit i don't now but jeez...<br /><br />put on a dvd instead or go to bed and get some rest!!!<br /><br />2 out of 10 (for the cameos and a morris minor car chase)<br /><br />
