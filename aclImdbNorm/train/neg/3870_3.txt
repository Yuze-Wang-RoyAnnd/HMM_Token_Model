underneath the dense green glop of computer graphics there gleamed the astounding art and skill of ichikawa somegoro. alas: it got lost in all the goo. the scenes of old edo -- with the courtesan, drifting on the sumida, rehearsing and acting in the nakamura-za -- were all exciting and engaging, taking you back to an interesting and rich era. the action on the kabuki stage, in which somegoro excels and excites, was more enriching than any of the absurd high jinks that followed. the skill, the energy in the audience, the colors of the sets, were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over plot and performance. what a wasted opportunity! one of the best kabuki actors alive, and he gets lost in the dreck.
