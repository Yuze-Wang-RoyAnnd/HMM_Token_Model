*** warning - this review contains "plot spoilers," though nothing could "spoil" this movie any more than it already is. it really is that bad. ***<br /><br />before i begin, i'd like to let everyone know that this definitely is one of those so-incredibly-bad-that-you-fall-over-laughing movies. if you're in a lighthearted mood and need a very hearty laugh, this is the movie for you. now without further ado, my review:<br /><br />this movie was found in a bargain bin at wal-mart. that should be the first clue as to how good of a movie it is. secondly, it stars the lame action-star dolph lundgren. that should be the second clue as to how good of a movie it is. i'm still shocked that it was even put on dvd (who would waste their money doing such a thing?), though as you might imagine, there aren't any extras or bonus footage on the dvd. in fact, there's not even a menu; the movie just starts playing.<br /><br />first, the writer for this movie deserves to be tortured and killed. it has one of the worst scripts ever written and is plagued with terrible one-liners; remarkably unbelievable, fake dialogue; and inappropriate comments (like lee's comment on lundgren's. err. manhood, which i'll mention later). there isn't one single sincere sounding line in the entire movie. the dialogue and plot go hand-in-hand, as the script and plot both progress in an entirely nonsensical fashion. the two cops hate each other for no apparent reason at the beginning, and then for again no reason at all, lee's character pulls over to the side of the road, runs around to the other side of the car, and says `i'm not going to let you go alone, 'cause despite myself, i like you! and i don't want to see you get killed!' . or something to that extent, anyhow. there are disgusting one-liners, mostly said by lee. for instance, when duking it out with a bad guy, lee says `you have the right to remain silent . you have the right to be dead!' lastly, i'll mention the entirely inappropriate and nonsensical comment that lee makes about lundgren's nether-regions. when bad guys start to attack after a seemingly random love scene between lundgren and carrere, and lundgren decides to fight them off in his underwear, lee says to him: `incase we die, i just wanted to let you know that you have the biggest dick i've ever seen on a guy.' . yes, he actually says that. it makes no sense and isn't even possible (lee never actually sees lundgren naked, so how would he know?), but the writer threw it in the script anyway. the entire movie looks like some kind of action video game, and lee even admits it. after lee and the underwear-only lundgren defeat all of those bad guys, lee makes a comment that is also truly beautiful: `wow, this is sort of like a video game; we just defeated the first wave!'<br /><br />second, the plot of this movie is despicable. it suffers, in my opinion, mainly from the fact that it just doesn't exist. the trailer for this movie - which imdb has available for viewing, by the way - makes it sound like the movie is about two cops trying to stop the japanese yakuza from taking over lost angeles. this is extremely misleading, however, since the movie has practically nothing to do with that at all. they make very brief, vague references to the yakuza trying to start up a methamphetamine business with local drug dealers, but the entire movie actually revolves around a poorly-written attempt for kenner (lundgren's character) to revenge the death of his parents, whom the yakuza leader (named yoshida) killed when he was only 9 years old. the entire plot can basically be summed up like this: yoshida wants kenner dead, kenner wants yoshida dead, and the two try two kill each other. and of course all the while kenner's sarcastic sidekick (named johnny and played by brandon lee) acts like an ignorant idiot, and tia carrere gets naked. twice.<br /><br />the acting is one of the worst parts of the entire movie. the dialogue is so unrealistic, and their entirely insincere portrayal of it emphasizes this even more. you'd expect poor acting from action stars anyway, but this movie highlights some of the most unimaginably bad acting ever recorded.<br /><br />finally we get to the heart of the movie's baseness: the flagrantly bad action. there are so many astoundingly bad, unrealistic action sequences in this movie, it's just downright impressive they managed to fit them all in. although lee has his fair share of bad scenes as well, most of the truly terrible action involves lundgren. for instance, lundgren nonchalantly takes on four or five kung fu bad guys one-handed, without spilling his tea. then, when surprised by an oncoming speeding car, lundgren casually leaps over it. or how about when he reaches through a closed door, grabs the villain on the other side, pulls him back through the door, and beats him up? or when he picks up tia carrere, gently walks (not runs) backward through a glass door that shatters around him, and leaps down a one-story height with tia still in arm, only to then lift up an entire car without the slightest effort and uses it as a barricade to shield them from bullets? all of the shameless gunfights are terrible as well, with lundgren and lee killing every bad guy instantaneously, while the rain of bullets from their fifty attackers never seem to hit either of them. that is, of course, until the final fight scene of the movie. lundgren gets shot point blank in his bare chest in a region that even if it did manage to miss his heart, would still immediately begin to fill lungs with blood and kill him within a matter of seconds. despite this, lundgren remains in top-notch condition and manages to duke it out in the middle of a parade with yoshida, the evil super villain. and of course the passing people in the parade dressed as samurai are carrying real, fully sharpened katanas, which the two use to sword fight. now in addition to his bullet wound, lundgren gets several deep slices in his chest and arms. does this stop him? no, of course not! in fact, a few seconds later after easily killing the evil yoshida (who gets pinned to a dartboard-like wheel and then bursts into flames for no reason), lundgren casually walks off with tia and lee as if he wasn't injured at all. god, it's terrible.<br /><br />all of these factors are then mixed up with an entirely unnecessary, gratuitous nude scene every five minutes, including topless women at a party, the beheading of a topless woman, women at a strip club, nude women at a japanese spa, and the pointless hot tub and love scene with tia. not to mention the trip to the bizarre sushi bar, at which rich japanese men are eating sushi off of naked women. which, by the way, prompts lee to say with much fake enthusiasm that after defeating the bad guys he and lundgren will `go eat fish off those naked chicks!' which, of course, is followed by a disturbing high five. and we can't forget the terrible editing either, like when the villains are crushing a man trapped in a car at a junk yard, and the editors left in a really obvious glimpse of a prop dummy. the credits also list an enormous list of stunt workers, which implies that a lot of the action probably wasn't done by the movie stars after all.<br /><br />in the end, this movie repeatedly outdoes it self with brazen badness. it is illogical and impossible, and as a result, remarkably entertaining. if you're looking for any kind of thoughtful cinema, this movie will make you want to die. if you're looking for a good laugh and a good time mocking bad movie making, this movie will delight you. as an actual movie, i'll merit this movie a 0.5 out of 10. as an entertaining way to waste an hour and eighteen minutes, however, this beauty takes the cake.
