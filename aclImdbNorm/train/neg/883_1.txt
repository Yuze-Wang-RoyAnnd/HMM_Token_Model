the problems with this film are many, but i will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones. first of all, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about manhattan life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and tv, was about something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. the story lines were thin or nonexistent, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialog, and expressed emotion was absolutely, and totally fake. it finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that i walked out (something no uncommon for me in recent years.) i would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program, but i believe the (at one time, pre-amelia, talented)director mira nair took part in this disgusting travesty, so perhaps the directorial talent in america has descended en masse into the cesspool.
