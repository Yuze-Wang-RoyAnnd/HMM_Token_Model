ok, i like b movies...i know what b movies are supposed to represent. but this is just awful. i am amazed it got such a decent overall score. the only redeeming qualities of this flick are the (mostly) marginal splatter effects. don't get me wrong, gore abounds in this flick - but few effects really jumped out at me (like the anal "probe"...that was great!).<br /><br />i believe this movie was filmed on a camcorder. c'mon - rent a betacam at least, i've seen porn with better production values (and better acting as well).<br /><br />acting - sucked! but not in the troma or full moon sort of way.<br /><br />story - contrived! but thats what you get from films like these. very loose!<br /><br />sets & props - sucked! my 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on halloween.<br /><br />dubbing and dialogue - sucked! horrible voice acting (i shouldn't even call it acting) and every other word is "s**t" or "f**k".<br /><br />there are tons of good classic and b rated horror / splatter flicks out there and they are not that hard to track down. do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this crap!
