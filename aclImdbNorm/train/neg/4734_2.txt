you like beautiful girls? yeah me too. what is there bad to say about beautiful girls/women? nothing imo, so why would i give this movie only 2 stars out of 5, although it got the "talents" of chiaki kuriyama and aya ueto? <br /><br />if i really wanted to watch beautiful people, i'd watch mtv or something that's why. this is a movie, a so called action movie nevertheless. so by definition it does not even really need a plot right? i'm not agreeing 100%, but let's say yes to that. so what does it need? 20 minutes footage from part 1 (i might be exaggerating a little bit, but it felt like more than 20 minutes ...)?! that would be "no". but then again you never know, the people who watched part one might not know what they ate this morning for breakfast, so hey let's remind them ... hey maybe remind them even twice? just to be sure they won't forget ... at least until the credits roll, of course!!!! <br /><br />so forget about the story, about character development, about real emotions, about the "acting" (and no, i don't think women in skirts walking and/or fighting is accountable for acting!) ... what does that leave? yes the action scenes. the action scenes are not bad and that's the reason i gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1! i was giving this movie a chance, but it was a waste of time ... you have better things to do/watch, believe me ...
