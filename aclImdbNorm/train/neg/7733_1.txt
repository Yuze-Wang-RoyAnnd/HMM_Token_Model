what a disgrace! i was checking this out hoping it would be an undiscovered james garner gem and what a stinker it turned out to be! the production quality was fine, but the plot was undeniably lame and i can honestly say that i am only a couple hours older and a lot dumber now. the movie really had no redeeming qualities and if this kind of stuff keeps coming out, it will give hallmark a bad name. for those of you who insist on knowing what it was about, it's about nothing, and in this case, it's not a good thing. we are subjected to watching one old ornery woman who is one of the dumbest creatures ever to roam the earth, who happens to be married to a real sweetheart who is probably the only person alive that could put up with her. she drags him through one mess after another, gets him into one embarrassing situation after another, and is proud of herself the whole time. then the movie ends. what a relief that was! not worth the time it would take to watch it, so do yourself a favor and skip this one, you'll be glad you did if you knew how bad this one really is.
