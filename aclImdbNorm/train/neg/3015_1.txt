this is a bad movie. not one of the funny bad ones either. this is a lousy bad one. it was actually painful to watch. the direction was awful,with lots of jumping around and the green and yellow hues used throughout the movie makes the characters look sickly. keira knightly was not convincing as a tough chick at all,and i cannot believe lucy liu and mickey rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid. the script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across a chalkboard. if you haven't seen it,don't. you are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel .i have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults. this one is just a waste of time.
