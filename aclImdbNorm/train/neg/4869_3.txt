this film failed to explore the humanity of the animals which left me with an empty feeling inside. [spoiler ahead] i was not convinced that dr. d really had a compelling reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends. whereas babe (the original) bucked the trend of big-budget hits by focusing on the human virtues of the animals vs. their humans counterparts, all the animals in this film were nothing more than comical caricatures which one would gladly stuff in the meat-grinder (even more so if one could understand their pointless babble). without eddie murphy's zany behavior, this film would be a flop.
