if you seen rodney dangerfield's previous movies and performances, you'll recognise several of the jokes made in this odd piece of dreck. written like a sitcom, this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout, from the self-help doctor played by the aways sexy-as-chopped liver molly shannon to the 'i'm fat, and therefore funny' john linette. the 5 wives themselves are likeable enough, and if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it might have worked. instead, it comes off like a male fantasy that's trying hard not to be politically incorrect.
