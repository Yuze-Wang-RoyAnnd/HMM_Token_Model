bugs bunny accidentally ends up at the south pole while trying to vacation in florida. where he meets a little penquin, which he tries to save from an eskimo. this short tries and the penquin is adorable, but in the end it's a bit too light in the laughs department. the eskimo isn't really that great of a foil for bugs and i just seen a lot better bugs bunny cartoons frankly, even other shorts when he's paired with other unknown antagonists. so i can't in good conscience recommend this one. however it is nice to see it in it's uncut form. this cartoon is on disk 3 of the "looney tunes golden collection volume 1" <br /><br />my grade: c
