if you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend your $9 on a used textbook, not this movie. i'm a little worried that the money i spent is being used to buy kool-aid for shipment to guyana. <br /><br />i don't think the directors really got any point across, but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several: 1) science can explain everything we do, meaning that our lives are deterministic; 2) science can't be used to explain everything we do, meaning that we have free will; 3) science is, like, really cool, brother; 4) we are god; 5) the world exists only in our minds; 6) sarah norman is a tough role to follow and 7) here, put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you'll see some really groovy stuff.
