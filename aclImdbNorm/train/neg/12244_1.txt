this film is awful. the cgi is the very cheap gray blob cgi. the crocodile looks like a large gray smudge. the worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive. it is mostly a photo-shopped cgi that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the cgi smudge across the screen. this is one of the worst examples of cgi effects that i have ever witnessed, and i have seen lots of the very bad sci-fi channel movies.<br /><br />aside from the terrible lack of special effects, the cast is composed of the typical low-cost actors who probably work as waiters/waitresses at local diners while they wait for their big breaks. perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the villains headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building (and crushing kate) the croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water. no laws of physics can apply to this movie or the special effects. at least there is honor among crocodiles.
