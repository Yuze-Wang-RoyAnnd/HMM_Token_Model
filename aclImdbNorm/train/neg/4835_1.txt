kathryn bigelow and mark boal are already preparing a sequel about a young us corporal in afghanistan. he also happens to be a highly-qualified surgeon and is roaming freely around kabul, operating on wounded nato soldiers. on a particularly difficult mission, he casually picks up a sniper rifle and shoots osama bin laden from a distance of about 3000 yards. he is then finally promoted to sergeant, but is unable to decide between a sniper and surgeon career, so he quits from the army altogether. one year later, frustrated with civilian life, he joins the navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform.
