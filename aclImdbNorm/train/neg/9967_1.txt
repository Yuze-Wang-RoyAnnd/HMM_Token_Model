<br /><br />this movie sucks. ridiculous "school" athmosphere, unbelievable students that are very bad and behave like criminals but then later after the "good teacher" nick nolte taught them they became as good and as quiet as kittens.<br /><br />if this works for you, it doesn't for me. 0 out of 10
