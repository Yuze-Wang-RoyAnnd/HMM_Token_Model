this movie is like the thousand "cat and mouse" movies that preceded it. (the following may look like a spoiler, but it really just describes a large class of movies) there is the passionate, wise main character, his goofy but well-meaning sidekick with his ill-placed attempts at humorous comments, the initially-hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable "unlikely" love story, the loved ones taken hostage, and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal minions. everybody has seen tons of these movies already, and "national treasure" is like any one of them, with only a slightly modified wrapping. every turn of the story was easily predicted (and i can assure you i am not the sharpest tool in the shed). i am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theater from a hollywood movie, and if you have ever felt that way too, heed my warning; stay miles away from this movie.
