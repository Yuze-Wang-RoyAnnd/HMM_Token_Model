the concept of this made-for-tv horror movie is ludicrous beyond words, but hey, it was the late 1970's and literally all stupid horror formats were pretty damn profitable, so why not exploit the idea of a satanically possessed dog? the plot of "devil dog" is easy to describe to fans of the horror genre: simply think of "the omen" and replace the newborn baby boy with a nest of german shepard pups! seriously, i'm not kidding, that's what the movie is about! during the opening sequence, members of some kind of satanic cult buy a female dog in heat only to have it impregnated by satan himself. you'd think that the lord of darkness has other things on his mind than to fornicate with a german shepard and take over the world one evil puppy at the time, but apparently not. exactly like little damien in "the omen", one of the puppies is taken in by model family and grows up to become a beautiful and charismatic animal. but lucky
