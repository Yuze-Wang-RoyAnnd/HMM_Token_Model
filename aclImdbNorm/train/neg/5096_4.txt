kurt russell (as steven post) works as a mail-boy for struggling tv station ubc (that's united broadcasting corporation); he is going nowhere at work, offering ridiculous projects like "abraham lincoln's doctor's dog" to studio executives - because lincoln, doctors, and dogs are popular. programming director joe flynn (as francis x. wilbanks) wisely rejects mr. russell's proposals, but has no idea how to pick a hit tv show. his secretary heather north (as jennifer scott), who does double duty as russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee who bugs the heck out of russell when he wants to watch tv. turns out, the monkey watches all the popular shows, and can easily pick the hits. russell discovers the chimp's talent, and uses him to advance his own career. understandably, things gets hairy for russell and the cast!<br /><br />raffles the chimp (handled by frank lamping) performs well; raffles does look bored and/or distracted during a few scenes, when the chimp is supposed to look interested; these could have been corrected with re-takes or editing. a mild satirical edge is present - imagine a monkey picking hit tv shows! and, it's a monkey who gets a beer during the commercials (drinking in a disney film)! a look through the cast will reveal s bunch of fun tv actors to recognize and try to place. you could make a drinking game, in honor of raffles' beer-guzzling, by guessing actors, and where you've seen them before. here's a start - hey, isn't that "dr. bellows" from "i dream of jeannie"? down the hatch! <br /><br />**** the barefoot executive (1971) robert butler ~ kurt russell, joe flynn, john ritter
