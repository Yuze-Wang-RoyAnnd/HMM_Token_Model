oh man, what was sam mraovich thinking? what was anyone who was involved in this "film" thinking? mraovich is the head of nearly everything of "ben and arthur": director, writer, producer (also executive producer!), caster, lead star- you name it, he did it. and he (mraovich) sucks more than anyone has ever sucked in every department of film making.<br /><br />so what is wrong with this film? everything. the film is about two gay lovers, ben (jamie brett gabel) and arthur (mraovich- *groan*). ben and arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people. to make things worse, ben's crazy "ex-wife" (they don't exactly divorce), tammy (julie belknap) is steaming mad that ben's left her for another man and demands ben that they get back together (saying that she can be gay, too!) and arthur's christian devoted, excessively hypocritical, equally batty as tammy brother, victor, is hell bent on making arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after he gets kicked out of his church.<br /><br />the film is absolutely chock a block with so many goofs (ie. ben and arthur fly to vermont to get married- they go there on alaska airlines and vermont has palm trees; they fly back on a fedex cargo plane- hope they were comfy in a wooden crate, plus many, many more) and plot holes to boot (victor calls killing arthur "the final plan" which later changes to "the final deed"; arthur and the private (intern) detective drive the same car, blah, blah, blah). the "actors" are all very bad and are way, way over the top; the script is laughably horrible(one such example is "i don't make sense? you don't make sense! i make sense, that's who makes sense!") and there so much more wrong with the "movie" that i can't write them all down.<br /><br />however, the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about "ben and arthur" is that sam mraovich thinks that he has created something that is truly fantastic (see his fake reviews for "ben & arthur" and obvious comments by him on youtube.). mraovich is narcissistic and his arrogance blinds him from seeing how awful anything with his name on it really is.<br /><br />so, to conclude, forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie ever- "ben and arthur" will knock them right off that title, even paris hilton movies look like "the dark knight" compared to the monstrosity known as "ben and arthur".
