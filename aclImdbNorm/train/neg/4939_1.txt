peeew this stinks! as everyone knows it's based upon some geico insurance commercials; what no one knows is why?! those commercials were amusing on first viewing at best; hardly fodder for a series. (the talking geico gecko -- that's another story. now that would make for an intriguing series!) and why on earth did abc -- as reported in the press -- actually agree to buy the cavemen character rights from geico for this? after all, the idea of cavemen struggling in the modern world is hardly unique to tv; phil hartman had a recurring saturday night live role as the unfrozen caveman lawyer over a decade ago. and that's how a concept like this works best -- as an occasional installment. but a regular series? fuhgeddaboudit. (a 1960s series called "it's about time" also used the cavemen in the modern world concept. it lasted one season.) <br /><br />one of the show's directors, who was also responsible for the geico commercials, was recently quoted as saying: "we were so excited when we were shooting our commercials because we felt like we had something that was very unique and we had bigger stories to tell." wrong.<br /><br />in the annals of bad tv, this is destined to take its place alongside 1972's "me and the chimp" as one of the all-time worst. the lead actor in the embarrassing chimp fiasco actually went into shame-by-association hiding after it was abruptly canceled. no doubt our cavemen friends will follow suit.
