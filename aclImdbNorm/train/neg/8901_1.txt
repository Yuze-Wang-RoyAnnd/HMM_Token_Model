i'll make this short and sweet....this movie sucked!!!!!!<br /><br />i watched part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the greatest films ever, gave it 9 out of 10 stars. so i thought perhaps part 2 and 3 would be good sequels, i was wrong. this movie bored me to death and was so different from the first one, it had the plot continue and thats it. it was like bad outtakes from part one or something.<br /><br />i love walken, but i felt sorry for him here. i was so happy about glenn danzig being in this film, but don't blink you'll miss him. there was a full cast full of crappy actors and people i don't like such as eric roberts and jennifer beals. however, it was a breath of fresh air to see ethan embry, he's one of the funniest people on earth.<br /><br />this movie will make you like the first one a little less, so don't watch it because you feel you owe it to yourself, being a fan of part 1. i am gonna wait a few days before i watch part 3 and i pray it is better than this crap.<br /><br />the last scene of the movie with the lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown on film. fast forward or skip to that if you can't stomach the first part.<br /><br />1 out of 10 stars - this was awful!
