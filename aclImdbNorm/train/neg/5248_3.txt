"die sieger" was highly recommended to be one of the few good action movies made in germany. i watched it last night and i must admit, that i am deeply disappointed. if that is supposed to be "the last best hope" for entertaining and challenging german action cinema, well then there is not much left.<br /><br />"die sieger" tries to be sexy, daring and furious but it is nothing of that kind. the characters are wooden and stereotype and whenever they do something unexpected (which doesn't happen too much) the act against their nature. that makes it hard - for me almost impossible - to follow them or even identify with them.<br /><br />most of all i think the film is very bad cast. there is not one character in whom i believe. maybe the superior officer at the swat unit - but that's about it. those people that try to look like or act like special units, like elite cops - i don't believe them. not for a second.<br /><br />the story is not so bad after all. but i think it's badly told. you don't get to know the bad guy at all - for example. and when after a "very dark" show down karl simon (the good guy) asks his already dead opponent "why? ... what for?" i did ask myself that very same question, knowing, that dominik graf wouldn't have the answer.<br /><br />i sincerely hope - no - i believe that germany can do better, even with action films.
