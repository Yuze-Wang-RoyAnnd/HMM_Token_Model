this is just usual indian garbage that gets turned out as cinema, as indians we can proudly boast that we have the biggest cinema industry, however it also the worst.<br /><br />how can other poor countries have films with real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies and we just keep on pumping out garbage. take a look at russia, iran, china and latin america, look at the brilliant films they have and we get crap like kisna!!<br /><br />get real people, no wonder the international community in general laughs at indian cinema.
