***spoilers*** let's start with the "good" of this film--the serviceable acting of cynthia rothrock and richard norton. the rest of the acting is awful (this isn't aided by the atrocious script). the worst culprit is the villain, buntao, the head of an asian crime syndicate (played by frans tumbuan). i was laughing my head off as he was expressing his "fury" over having lost a bunch of money; horrid performance. patrick muldoon isn't much better, and his "it's a hostile takeover" line (that's the remainder of the title of this film) was delivered about as badly as one could do it. there are no other main characters, but no other actor/actress distinguished him/herself in this film. we next come to the plot. this should tell you all you need to know: in the original "rage and honor," cynthia rothrock, who plays chris fairchild, was a teacher in the inner city. now, she's a c.i.a. agent (or was it some other governmental agency--sorry, but this film was so bad that i don't even remember). hmmm...i can imagine what that c.i.a. application process was like. interviewer: what past job experience do you have? chris: i was a teacher. interviewer: okay; you're hired! i only give it a "2" because of some decent acting and a nice plot twist at the end (though we know that tommy (muldoon), the secret villain, will be caught).
