i really looked forward to this program for two reasons; i really liked jan michael vincent and i am an aviation nut and have a serious love affair with helicopters. i don't like this program because it takes fantasy to an unbelievable level. the world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 mph by a westland lynx several years ago. the only chopper that was ever faster was the experimental lockheed ah56a in the 1960's. it hit over 300 and was a compound helicopter, which means it had a pusher propeller at the end of its fuselage providing thrust.<br /><br />in short, no helicopter can fly much over 275 because of the principle of rotary wing flight. and the bell 222, the "actor" that portrayed airwolf wasn't very fast even by helicopter standards. and it didn't stay in production very long.<br /><br />there was a movie that came out during this time period called "blue thunder" that was much more realistic.
