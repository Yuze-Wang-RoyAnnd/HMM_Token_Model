to say that thunderbirds is a horrid, forced, in-your-face, ugly looking, nasty to listen to and painful to watch film wouldn't be saying enough. there are only two reasons i can think of why you'd watch this film: 1; you've seen thunderbirds when you were young (like i did) and are curious as to what it is like but you will really only be watching to find out how badly they screwed things up. or, 2; you're seeing it with someone under ten years old.<br /><br />thunderbirds manages to cock up everything it attempts. the list goes on and on but there are other more subtle, humiliating things that are painfully obvious when you think about it. from the off, thunderbirds is wrong, wrong, wrong. the whole moral message and 'goal' is set up in an excruciating way: jeff tracy (a new low for bill paxton) tells his youngest son alan he's not yet proved himself to be a thunderbird after alan randomly and stupidly decided to go down into tracy island's bowels to fire up thunderbird one. the whole film is then a series of events and miss-fires consisting of alan trying to prove himself whilst his father and other brothers are trapped in space aboard thunderbird five.<br /><br />the film relies on kid actors to carry the film: a 16 year old alan tracy (corbet), a 16 year old tin tin (hudgens) and a 14 year old fermat (fulton) who is brains' son. to say that watching the 'adventures' they get up to is painful is an understatement. frequently trying to act and utilise the script whilst combating the evil 'hood' (kingsley) in ridiculously unfunny and hammy ways acts as the entertainment for the duration of the film; it only differs when everyone's in a different location. also, the whole 'mind control' thing was very tiresome and basically dragged the film down as it was overused and offered a way for our heroes to see a weakness in the hood
