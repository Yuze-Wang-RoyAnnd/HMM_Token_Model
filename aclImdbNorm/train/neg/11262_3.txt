adrian has just gone out of the asylum, being rich and with no parents, his life seems empty. one day, he meets gonzalo, a poor boy whom mother is prostitute. desperate for earning some money, gonzalo helps adrian to search about his life and who where his parents. this is a movie from a new director, and it is perfectly clear in most of the film: scenes not correctly directed, dialogues a little forced, some incoherences in the script...anyway, the ending is unexpectedly well done (well, just a little) and that saves a little the film. actors are known and with great quality, nevertheless, they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting; all of them have done better papers in other film. the film results boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking how much time will pass until it ends. of course there are lots of worse films, but, sure, there are many many better ones.
