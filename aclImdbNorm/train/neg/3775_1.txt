as other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. the colors are comic book bold. i think the director got carried away with his "artistic vision" over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content. despite its stellar cast, the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent. madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre-release press. a good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album "i'm breathless (music inspired by the film dick tracy)" which was a stratospheric hit (due in large part to the inclusion of dance-hit "vogue" - which is not in, nor has the slightest relation to this film). i'd guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie-ins to madonna's "i'm breathless" album.<br /><br />if you watch it at home, by end-titles, you'll think "there's two hours out of my life i'd like to have back." save yourself the wasted time - do not bother with this.
