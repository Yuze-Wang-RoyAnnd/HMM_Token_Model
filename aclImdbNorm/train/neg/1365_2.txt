the concept of the legal gray area in love crimes contributes to about 10% of the movie's appeal; the other 90% can be attributed to it's flagrant bad-ness. to say that sean young's performance as a so-called district attorney is wooden is a gross understatement. with her bland suits and superfluous hair gel, young does a decent job at convincing the audience of her devout hatred for men. why else would she ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute just so she can arrest cops who try to pick up on them? this hatred is also the only reason why she relentlessly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this crappy movie. watching young go from frigid to full-frontal nudity does little to raise interest, but the temper tantrum she throws standing next to a fire by a lake does. watching her rant and rave about her self-loathing and sexual frustration makes love crimes worth the rental fee, but it's all downhill to and from there. despite her urge to bring patrick bergin's character to justice, her policing skills completely escape her in the throes of her own tired lust and passion. patrick bergin does a decent enough job as a slimy sociopath; if it worked in sleeping with the enemy it sure as hell can work in this. but i can't help but wonder if the noticeable lack of energy young brings to the film conflicts with his sliminess. i'm guessing it does and the result is a "thriller" with thrills that are thoroughly bad and yet comedic.
