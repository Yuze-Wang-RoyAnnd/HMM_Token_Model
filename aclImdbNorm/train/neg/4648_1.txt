this is a bad b movie masquerading as a mockumentary. the porn documentary filmmaker in the movie has almost as much screen time and dialog as any other character. that completely destroyed any "documentary feel" that they may have wanted to create.<br /><br />the fact that the film is not actually a mockumentary is the least of it's problems. the film is not funny. the film is not sexy. the film doesn't have anything insightful to say about the porn business. it's not even particularly salacious. while there's simulated sex, the amount of nudity is mild for an r rated film.<br /><br />someday, someone will make a good mockumentary about the porn industry. this is not it.
