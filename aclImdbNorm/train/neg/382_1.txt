hail bollywood and men directors !<br /><br />really this is the ultimate limit in utter sacrifice made by indian woman !!<br /><br />viewing the current state of affairs in india where the wives are becoming more vicious day by day and are very possessive about their husbands - the directors ..also can be called uncle scars (refer movie the lion king) came up with a very new concept on how both the kept and the wife can live together happily ever after sharing everything between themselves ...including the spermikins !!<br /><br />story line : married couple - very happy - but accidentally a mishap happens and wife has a miscarriage - lost the foetus along with the capacity of ever becoming a mother !<br /><br />now in in india, the in- laws usually drive away the daughter- in- law if she fails to give them an heir ! so the wife hits upon a major plan - surrogate mother...but the scientists intervened - "sure artificial insemination" - no said the artist (director actually) - "neighbourhood will come to know that the daughter - in - law is barren so they are going for surrogate mother !!<br /><br />neighbours ! society !! gosh the same ones who watch fashion tv day and night - watching girls between the age group of 14 to 40 ...al in bras and panties - well those neighbors suddenly take an upper hand in family planning and decision making !!<br /><br />so the wife sends away her husband to a beer bar where girls are dancing on the stage - all mostly uneducated and illiterate - but men love such women as they can satisfy their egos a lot !<br /><br />he hires the lead dancer in the pub - asks her to bear his baby - in exchange for money - she agrees - she comes home - becomes pregnant - wife and kept - both co-exist in the same house - in the mean time the prostitute also gets a taste of household life - so much caring people around - she misses them all and cries silently !! in the mean time - no one in the family comes to know that the real daughter in law is roaming around with a pillow beneath her petticoat !!- the mother or other elderly people never took her for check-ups - nor did they try to feel the baby's movements in the womb !!
