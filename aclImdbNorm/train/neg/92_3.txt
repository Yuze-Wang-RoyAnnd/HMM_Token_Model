really, i can't believe that i spent $5 on this movie. i am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad. it had zombies in it right? was i wrong! to be honest the movie had it's moments...i thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. overall i think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. the movie could have been better if we could see some boob but i had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.
