what is happening to itv drama. first, "losing gemma" quite simply the worst tv drama i have seen in years, and now "perfect parents" a complete shambles from start to finish. whoever is responsible for commissioning this drivel should be receiving there p45 by special delivery.<br /><br />in most drama/thrillers, a requirement to suspend certain levels of belief is necessary so that the the plot line can develop, but "perfect parents" took this to a new level,i suspended so much belief by the end of this nonsense i felt i had been force fed on a lorry load of "magic mushrooms", it was like the scriptwriters had decided to try and create a "drama by numbers" involving some serious issues - religion, education,greed,fear,murder,paedophillia the only trouble was as the great eric morecambe once said when playing a piano, "i'm playing all the right notes, just not necessarily in the correct order". for your next script guys, i suggest you try reading a few more books on script development than "script writing for dummies".<br /><br />due to the ridiculous script and the utter lack of tension in the direction, the acting was suitably low key, not the fault of the actors as the cast was top notch. but i suggest that all of the actors involved in this sorry piece of drama should instruct their agents the next time the postman attempts to deliver a script from itv drama department, make sure the letterbox is firmly nailed shut!!
