i went into this film expecting it to be similar to the matrix or pi. boy, was i wrong. yes, there is a poorly written, poorly acted plot in the movie (with cg animated cells and peptides to boot). however, the real focus of the film are the "expert" talking heads spewing out new age feel-good hogwash in between plot segments.<br /><br />sure, it stars off innocently enough. there is a little bit of real quantum physics in the beginning. it states, for example, that electrons exist as both particle and wave, and that an atom is mostly empty space. however, the movie takes a giant (and unscientific) leap, saying that sub-atomic quantum effects happen on large scales as well. the talking heads take it even further. according to them, the following are true:<br /><br />-when columbus arrived in the caribbean, the natives were unable to see his ships because their minds were incapable of perceiving something so different. -meditation can reduce the murder rate. -with positive thought, you can walk on water. -your thoughts can change the formations of ice crystals in bottles of water.<br /><br />and hey, that's only in the first 40 minutes!<br /><br />watching the movie was torture. this film felt like a movie they would show you to get you to join a cult. after doing my homework, i realized that it basically is just that.<br /><br />on the other hand, this could be seen as a campy comedy (albeit one that's not funny).<br /><br />save your time and money: don't see this movie.
