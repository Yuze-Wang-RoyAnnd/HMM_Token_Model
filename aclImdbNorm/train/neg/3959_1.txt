this, is not one of those films it is one of the biggest pieces of tripe i have ever scene, the camera work is trying to be flashy but it really just crap the whole thing looks like the red shoe diaries, but without the sex, the only reason i bought this was i wanted to try out dvd and this was the cheapest one i could find, possibly the worst buy of my life and could have put you off dvd forever, the soundtrack is really tacky and most of the movie is made up of endless repeats of clips from the first two films, why anyone would want to make a movie as awful as this is beyond me, if they had really attempted to make an original movie and failed i would be nicer in this review but they don't they just got the rights to reproduce stuff from the first two and then edit it and repeat it into this film with about maybe under 1 3rd original footage which is about up to the standards of film school students, do not buy this movie. the only entertainment this dvd can offer is if you were to stick it in the microwave and watch the flashing lights! utter utter utter uttter unbelievable garbage! 0/10 if only the voting system would allow that.
