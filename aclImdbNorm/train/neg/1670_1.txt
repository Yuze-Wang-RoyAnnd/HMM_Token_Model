the movie's premise is spooky: a woman gets pregnant when kissed by a stranger in a bar.<br /><br />but as soon as the movie begins, a horrible opening scene establishes that this is a c type sci-fi tv movie. it's a big star trek and a bit x-files, but more than anything else it's boring.<br /><br />when the movie kicks into action everything is predictable and cliche. it looked more like a 2 parter in a bad sci-fi tv series. no suspense and no thrills, but not for a lack of trying. just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters.<br /><br />don't waste your time.
