as has been stated countless times, "the hills have eyes 2" is not a remake of the (generally disregarded) mid-'80s sequel to wes craven's 1977 original. but wishing to give this postmodern sequel-to-a-remake the official stamp of diminishing returns, craven himself (a double threat alongside his son, jonathan) has decided to pen a film that is of the same quality--in plain english, horrible. former music-video director martin weisz takes the reins from alexandre aja, and is clearly in way over his head--yet one wonders how anyone could have created a watchable film from the cravens' screen writing 101 scrawl. not only are the characters (in this case, a gang of goofball national guards(wo)men sent to investigate the turbulent hills of the original remake) completely obnoxious and prone to really annoying genre pitfalls (played without a lick of irony, mind you), but they are constantly cracking jokes that aren't funny. after viewing their total ineptitude during a training exercise, their fate against the repulsive, roaming cannibals is painfully obvious. only this time out--as in the original '80s sequel--the script is so simplistic (barely existent, actually) that any potential subtext is jettisoned in favor of upping the ante in repulsive shocks (we're treated to a combo childbirth-murder during the opening credits, plus a gratuitous rape for those who haven't ejected the dvd by the midpoint!). even the mutants in this outing are personality-free freaks of no memorable stature--the tacky, rubbery-looking makeup fx seems, like the rest of the film, to be trying to hide its face from embarrassment. i really groaned at the lame 'surprise' at the end of aja's otherwise excellent film, and the producers quite literally go for broke at the end of "hills 2," setting the stage--very lamely setting the stage--for a third installment...yet the cravens and weisz have created a film that is such a cynical bastardization of what made the 1977/2006 versions work that they'd be hard-pressed to find an audience after this insulting slap in the face.
