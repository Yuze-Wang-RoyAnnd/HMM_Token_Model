want a great recipe for failure? take a s****y plot, add in some weak, completely undeveloped characters and than throw in the worst special effects a horror movie has known. let stew for a week (the amount of time probably spent making this trash). the result is corpse grinders, a movie that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotically low places.<br /><br />the movie utterly blew. my words cannot convey how painful it was to watch. this is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of. this is not plan 9 from outer space. this is a long, boring, sad waste of time. corpse grinders ii is the biggest waste of energy and talent i have ever seen. i depresses me when i realize that people actually took time out of their lives to act in this shit, if you can call it acting. but than again, when you have poor direction, poor storywriting, poor everything, acting is the last thing to criticize.<br /><br />this movie is like a huge, disgusting turd that you yearn to quickly flush out of existence, fearful that a friend or loved one might somehow see it. i really with i could somehow destroy every copy of this film, so it will not pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers. thank you, ted v. mikels, for giving me new found respect for every movie i have ever seen. you have shown me what is truly awful, and why i should appreciate all those movies that are merely crappy or boring.
