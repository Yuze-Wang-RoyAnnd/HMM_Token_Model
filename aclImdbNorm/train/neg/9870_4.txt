i had several problems with the movie: <br /><br />(1) the screenplay -- specifically, kim basinger's voice over: movies are not books; they should *show* the action rather than have a voice over *tell* us what's happening. occasionally i find a movie with a voice over that works, but here it seemed more of a lazy way of writing the script. in fact, it sounded to me as if she was practically reading excerpts from the novel in her voice over.<br /><br />(2) i felt no emotion in the relationship between jessie and brother thomas and also felt that alex carter's acting was pretty bad. that's a significant failure for me in defining jessie's and thomas' characters -- with no connection between them, it seemed to me as if she just wanted a stud and that for him it was a matter of being sex-deprived. if it had been properly done, the relationship between them would have given much more context to the story.<br /><br />(3) with the book, i understood jessie's mid-life crisis. in the movie, it seemed more like just plain boredom.<br /><br />on the plus side, i didn't think the movie was so bad as for me to turn off the tv . . . though that thought did occur to me.
