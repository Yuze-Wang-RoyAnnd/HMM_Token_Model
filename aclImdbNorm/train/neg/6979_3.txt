i watched this movie also, and altho it is very well done, i found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children.. the terror on this mother's face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking. and the sad thing is--internally she dies. eventually she goes back to the applacian mountains. all the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not conceal the grief she has. i remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed. i'm surprised this movie takes place in detroit, because when i watched it i thought for sure the people had come to cincinnati, ohio. this also was a route for the poor from the mountains.
