ummm, please forgive me, but weren't more than half the characters missing? in the original novel, valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and then attempting several times to escape. he breaks parole and is pursued relentlessly by the police inspector javert. along the way there are many characters that weren't in this version. some worth mentioning would be fantine, cosette, m & mme. thenardier, eponine, marius, gavroche, and enjolras. the only character with the same name is javert. i was confused and frustrated throughout the whole movie, trying to see how it was in any way connected to victor hugo's epic novel.
