whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in hollywood at all (not even live there), and those actors need to find another job. the most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life... and i only kept watching to see if it would get better which, unfortunately for me it did not.<br /><br />even at the end, the credits gave me anxiety. i guess there weren't a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly... very slowly.<br /><br />this movie is definitely a great "how not to make a movie" guide. too bad i can't give a 0.
