revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films since, in fact, most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events. unfortunately, what this film lacks in drama is compensated for by an overabundance of boredom. one cares not who wins, loses, dies or lives--just end it as soon as possible. this is due in large measure to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology. scenes of paris and the french countryside have a cardboard quality about them. they might better be done on a bare stage and left that way. one cannot expect the amazing effects of "the house of the flying daggers" or "the golden compass," but , after all, this is a 2002 digitally mastered production. characters seem to enter a scene for the sake of entering a scene, so much so that one loses count of the number of times character enter and leave rooms. in my view, this film turns the french revolution of the 1790s into the "papier-mache" revolution of a "papier colle" world.
