ok..this movie could have been soooo good! all generations have been exposed to thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie. the craft themselves and tracey island were realistically transferred to the big screen, whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with. sophia miles was, simply, fantastic, as lady p and bill paxton, whilst not exactly who i envisaged jeff tracey being, was solid enough...but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machines.<br /><br />it's not so much the fact that the movie was centred around the children that made me feel like jonathon frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film, it was the fact that alan tracey was so obnoxious in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brothers...who were at least 19/20. seriously, these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the case.<br /><br />the film didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical. it tried to pay homage whilst satirising and it just generally fell flat on its face. 3/10 (2 for the machines, 1 for lady p)
