never saw the original movie in the series...i only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980's as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified. this movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now. anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie. it was, however, a movie that would make some walt disney movies look dark. really, this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen. the only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm, other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid. the story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water. not really worth watching i would however like to see the original, granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80's, but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70's "the town the dreaded sundown".
