i wondered why i didn't like peggy sue got married more than i did, when it first came out in 1986, with all the hype. somehow i found nic cage's character off-putting. way off-putting. then the plot didn't seem to make sense. then by the end of the credits, the question came to mind: what point was this movie making? what was it saying? the answer, unfortunately, was not much, if anything. i really don't think this movie aimed at making a statement; unless it was "your life is your life, you're gonna make the same mistakes no matter what, so keep your eye upon the doughnut, and not the hole". not a very profound statement, and i'm sorry, not profoundly made in this movie. the writing simply isn't that good. the direction is uneven, and is strangely overblown at times. kathleen turner was the best, and in my opinion, only worthwhile thing in this movie, and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre, unexplained circumstances, with a script that had no apparent statement to make. <br /><br />she also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason i didn't enjoy this movie more. she states in her autobiography that cage made a point of fighting his uncle coppola's direction every step of the way, doing it "his own way" (not a good idea for a new actor), and putting on a goofy voice she called "stupid". his voice was annoying, abrasive and unnatural, and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy. i understand what he was attempting to do: play a young-guy "hot shot" who is not as hot as he thinks he is, setting up his own karma for future failure. but he goes overboard, the way he does it is abrasive, not effective, and if he had listened to his uncle instead of "fighting the man", we would have had a more enjoyable film. cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person, and those scenes are more watchable than others. but if i had to watch the movie through in its entirety, i would find myself wanting to pay someone in l.a. to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected (put-on) scenes. <br /><br />the movie doesn't aim for a statement, doesn't make a point, is great to look at except when cage is doing a demented elvis impression (but without the voice), and is, ultimately, confusing and a waste of time. given all this, kathleen turner surely deserved an oscar in this flailing mess of a movie. i can't recommend anyone spending two hours watching this, unless you like turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes. believe me, you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes, and it will make just as much sense. <br /><br />kathleen turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her cage comments, which proves that she's strong enough to be honest, and to hell with other people's comments. you go, turner! i'm not particularly a fan of this actress any more than i am of any other first-rate actor or actress, but her candor is refreshing. cage's acting can be good to annoying, and here it doesn't work. at least, in this film, now we know why.
