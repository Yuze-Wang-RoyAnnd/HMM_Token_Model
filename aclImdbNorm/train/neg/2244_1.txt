there are two points i need to make clear right at the beginning. first of all we all know what this year's oscar's were really all about this year. it was the academy's way of showing people that they are no racist,and never have been. they wanted to clear all preconceived notions about themselves. secondly, it's kinda pointless to make remarks about the show, because really, what difference will it make? but, it's fun to write about it. this is the year i became fed-up with the oscar's! i will never watch the show again. every year they do something wrong. before crowe wins for "gladaitor" when they real winner should of been ralph fiennes for "sunshine". if you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it and you'll agree. "eyes wide shut" when released receieved no nominations. and as far as this year goes, well, the bad choices were all over the place! baz lurhmann gets no "best director" nomination! are you joking!! "a beautiful mind" is up for "best make-up"???? "training day" gets nominated?? the movie was awful, and it seemed like washington didn't even turn in a performance, all he proved was, he knows how to use four letter words! that's what h won the award for! take away the language and i bet he was almost playing himself! i liked "gosford park", i really did, but why 7 nominations? and how on earth could they not give it too altman! i mean, c'mon, if there just giving the award to people to clear up any bad feelings, what about altman? the man has been in the public's eye for 32 years now and no oscar! there were many, many things that bothered me about this year's oscar's, but, i'll live with it, as long as i never have to watch another show again! the highpoint ( and the only one) of the show was when woody allen made his first appearance ever to the award show. that will go down as one of the greatest moments in he history of the show.
