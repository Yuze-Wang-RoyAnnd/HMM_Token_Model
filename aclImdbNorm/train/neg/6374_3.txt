this movie was a littttle confusing at first. i usually like gina phillips, but this one i have to say was a bad choice just like her doing the movie ring around the rosie, that one also not one her good movies. jeepers creepers was way better. anyway, faye dunaway was good. she totally creeped me out and at the end, that was crazy. it was about jennifer cassi(phillips) who comes to her twin sisters funeral. she stays at a house that her sister owns and her grandmother(dunaway) lives at with an aunt named emma. mary ellen(dunaway) is kinda sacrificing her relations to stay alive and as long as she wants to live, she can't die. even if jennifer tries to kill her, which she tries. ravens have a weird part in it. when the relations go to sleep, the ravens eat there organs, so they can't go to sleep. but they do. basically it all crazy and mary ellen will never die and her relations will be buried, but not dead, b/c they have to suffer forever so mary ellen can stay alive. yeah, i hope this helps. if it doesn't, sorry. love ya.
