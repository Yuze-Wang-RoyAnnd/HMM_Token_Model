this is a low budget roger corman horror/creature flick. a dinocroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok. an engineered croc first kills one of its own then gets the taste of human and becomes a fast growing terror after escaping. none of the characters have any depth, but then they are not the focal point. we only get a few glimpses of the huge two-legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best "kill" scenes in a small budget film.<br /><br />my favorite scene is of a moronic character trying to use a three legged dog for bait and becomes croc food himself. nothing left on the pier but ankle top feet. with no real stand out roles: jane longendecker, bruce weitz and charles napier. most pathetic is matt borlenghi and an obnoxious professional croc hunter costas mandylor. i was most impressed with the alluring joanna pacula as the respectfully feared dr. p. dinocroc is redeeming as a crock of pickles.
