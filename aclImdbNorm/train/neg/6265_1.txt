i happen to be the director's nephew. it's taken me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and i can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies of all time. my uncle doesn't even have a copy of it anymore (i asked). i'm looking forward to bringing him a copy.<br /><br />currently the film's average rating is 1.9/10. as far as i can tell, that should put it somewhere in the mid-30s in the imdb "bottom 100," however with only 206 votes, it hasn't yet placed.<br /><br />it's sad that the film doesn't even get the respect of a bottom 100 title.<br /><br />anyhow, i'm giving copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts. best/worst gift ever?
