was convincing the world that he didn't exist...<br /><br />this is a line that is probably remembered by a lot of people. it's from the usual suspects of course in relation to kaiser gold..i mean sose..<br /><br />i got another one like that: -the dumbest trick a director ever pulled was trying to convince an audience he actually had a storyline-<br /><br />this movie is one of the saddest pieces of film-making i have seen in a long time. it starts out so well, with really fantastic cinematography, great acting and a very smart premise. but alas, the only way this movie is heading is on a course of self-destruction. and it does so, not by a single blow but with nagging little wrist-cuts.<br /><br />pay no attention to the comments here that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain this donut. with enough booze in my brain i would probably be capable of explaining the very existence of mankind to a very plausible degree. i have seen and read about a dozen totally different ways people explained the story. and they vary from a story set totally in someones head, playing chess with himself, to a cunning way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means resembling chess gaming.<br /><br />and that's all jolly swell. but at the same time it is a painful giveaway that there is something terribly wrong with this story. and apart from that, it is in any case a blunt rip off of a score of movies and books like "fight club, kill bill, casino, the usual suspects, snatch, magnolia and shachnovelle. and we are not dealing with kind borrowing here, it's a blatant robbery.<br /><br />what ultimately goes wrong here in this movie is that the storyline swirls like a drunk bum on speed. if this movie was a roller-coaster ride, you'd have crashed into the attraction next to it shorty after take off. there are so many twists in this movie which will never be resolved, that if it was a cocktail, you'd be needing a life supply of hurl-buckets to work of the nausea after drinking it. nothing is ever explained and when you finally get some grasp of the direction you think it's going, you get pulled in yet another one.<br /><br />i guess this story wasn't going anywhere on paper and ritchy must have thought that is was awesome to make a movie out of it anyway, being the next david lynch or something.<br /><br />1/10 for totally violating one's own work (ritchy: seek professional help). what could have easily been a gem instead becomes a contrived art-piece, food for pseudo intellectuals to debate on at sundayafternoon debating-clubs. <br /><br />spare your soul and stomach, avoid at all cost!
