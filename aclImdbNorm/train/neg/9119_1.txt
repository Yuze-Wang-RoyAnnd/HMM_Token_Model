i actually saw this movie in the theater back in it's original release. it was painful to watch peter sellers embarrass himself so badly. the story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow, and the ending was ridiculous. it was just sad to see how the mighty had fallen. i won't say that i'm a huge peter sellers fan, but i did thoroughly enjoy the pink panther series and i felt that he gave a strong performance in being there. but this film should never have been made. from what i've read, he pursued producing this film against the advice of the people around him. fine, but that still doesn't excuse the studio actually releasing the film.
