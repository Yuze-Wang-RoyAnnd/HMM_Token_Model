honestly, who in god's name gave this movie an 8.1 rating?? i guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted. otherwise this movie sucks! this movie is nothing more than an amateur, or possibly student, film. i'm a movie fanatic, and have seen terrible movies, but there was literally nothing redeeming here. the story and acting was the worst i've ever seen. the props, including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects, where just as bad as everything else. i'm all for bad language in movies, but the f-bomb was dropped about every third word and i think we might have a winner for the most use of the f-bomb in any movie ever. the movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film. i'd expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country, but it doesn't belong on a dvd.<br /><br />do not buy this movie. do not rent this movie. all i can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon. this is valuable time that you will never get back. unfortunately for me, that time is lost, but it's not too late for you. if you decide to rent this movie, consider this my warning.
