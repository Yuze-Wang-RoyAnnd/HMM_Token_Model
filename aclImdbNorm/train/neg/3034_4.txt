this movie has a slew of great adult stars but fails to get you interested in a way an adult film should. among all the stars you couldn't get your kicks from any of the scenes. the movie is shot in a dream like middle age set which is embarrassingly cheesy. the acting is worse than keanu reeves, the sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor talk about their kid in college, and the dialogue is the worse i have seen in a movie. the plot also was worse by ten fold. i'd stick to the amateur route. the audio commentary was useless since it's a skin flick but even then that was bad too. unless your a diehard jenna jameson fan there is little here. 4/10
