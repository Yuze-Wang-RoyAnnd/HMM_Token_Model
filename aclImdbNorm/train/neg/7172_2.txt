a good cast and they do their best with what they're given, but the story makes no sense, the characters' actions are inexplicable, and there are too many moments of unintentional humor, as when a man is killed by being pierced with pieces of a phonograph record or when they get the witch drunk to a hip hop beat and then hit her over the head with a bottle and she grabs her hostage and pouts off. the scene when the two witch and her victim (played by the same actress) are in the house together sets up like a 3 stooges routine, and the plot begs the question: if the witch wants to possess this other woman's soul, why doesn't she just do it instead of leading these people on this elaborate chase? not to be missed is christopher walkin's eyeglasses and his automotive explanation of the afterlife (paraphrased): "the ancient egyptianas - they wee materialists. they expected the body to last through eternity, like a used car that you souped up. but the druids, they knew you couldn't drive in the afterlife. you had to get out and walk." huh? the ending is absolutely indecipherable. seems like they just ran out of film.
