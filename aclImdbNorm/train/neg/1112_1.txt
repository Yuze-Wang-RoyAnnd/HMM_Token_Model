i enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the biscuit. the script and dialogue is laughable. the acting was awful, where did they get them from? music was ok i have to say. luckily i didn't buy or rent the movie but its now disposed of.<br /><br />i was geared up at the beginning when the stranger (martin sheen) started to tell his story. i have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between hopalong and tex where hopalong shot tex's finger off and told him to practise for 40 years to reach his league. but thats where it all went pear shaped thereafter. i had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better, never did.
