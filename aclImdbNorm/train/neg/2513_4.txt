when i first saw this film, i thought it should have come from the children's section - it's very fun and at times humorous, and is actually quite a good story, but it severely lacks the "romantic chemistry" that actors like meg ryan and tim robbins are capable of delivering. i must note that walter matthau is perfect for the part of albert einstein, and his performance is extraordinary, but that's the sole exception. this film appears a bit forced, the directing lacks substance, and oh yeah...the music is ridiculously awful, it didn't put me in a very good mood. but if you are not expecting a smart, well-crafted comedy/romance tale, then this certainly can be entertaining, like i said..it should be in the children's section. einstein and his buddies are a good relief from tim robbins' boring, almost tense quest to steal meg ryan's heart. a very conflicting film, but as long as it's not taken seriously this can be an alright movie.
