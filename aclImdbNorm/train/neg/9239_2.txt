heavenly days commits a serious comedy faux pas: it's desperate to teach us a civics lesson, and it won't stop until we've passed the final exam. fibber mcgee and molly take a trip to washington, where they see the senate in action (or inaction, if you prefer), have a spat with their senator (eugene palette in one of the worst roles of his career), get acquainted with a gaggle of annoying stereotypical refugee children, and meet a man on a train reading a book by henry wallace. henry wallace!! a year later, he was considered a near communist dupe, but in 1944, he was a-ok. add in some truly awful musical moments, a whole lot of flagwaving hooey, and a boring subplot about newspaper reporters, and you've got a film that must have had philip wylie ready to pen generation of vipers 2: d.c. boogaloo. drastically unfun, heavenly days is another reminder that the devil has all the best tunes.
