while i recently gave operation petticoat a positive review, i really didn't like this film even though it had so many similarities. both were made just a few years apart, both starred cary grant and both were wwii comedies. however, the overall tone and style of the films were quite different. kiss her for me, overall, just seemed like a cheaper film--with poor writing, little energy and some very broad performances--even when compared to operation petticoat. i think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting jayne mansfield. the combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this a-budget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio. plus, there wasn't much chemistry or energy in pairing her with cary grant--an actor generally loved for his grace and class. it's sort of like pairing sir lawrence olivier with marjorie main.
