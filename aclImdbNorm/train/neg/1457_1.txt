i watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts. actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities. anyone who watched this film now probably think of hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some chicago gangster. i can only to say that there is much better films about hitler and germany in those years and that rise of evil is very much under average. i can recommend german film downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of switzerland actor bruno ganz in a roll of adolf hitler.
