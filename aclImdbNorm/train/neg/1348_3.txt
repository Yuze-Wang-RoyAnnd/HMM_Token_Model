this animated inspector gadget movie is pretty lame.the story is very weak,and there is little action.most of the characters are given little to nothing to do.the movie is mildly entertaining at best,but really doesn't go any where and is pointless.it's watchable but only just and is nowhere near the calibre of the animated tv show from the 80's.it's not a movie that bears repeat viewing,at least in my mind.it's only about 74 minutes long including credits,so i guess that's a good thing.unlike in the tv show,the characters are not worth rooting for here.in the show,you wanted inspector gadget to save the day,but there,who really cares?anyway,that's just my opinion.for me inspector gadget's last case is a disappointing 3/10
