as a lesbian, i am always on the lookout for films relating to gays & lesbians. however, with this kind of crap out there--it would be enough to discourage any audience.<br /><br />i kept waiting for something to happen--anything!--a story to develop, or just for it to make some kind of sense. neither occurred. it was just meaningless scenes, unconnected in any way with anything. the film failed to conveyed any kind of story or depth to the character.<br /><br />after an hour or more of this nonsense, i simply turned it off.<br /><br />don't waste your time on this absurdity.<br /><br />1 star - and it doesn't even deserve that.
