"grey matter" aka "the brain machine" but the video people thought better of that; the screen says 1972 but imdb says 1977; it's that kind of movie. the government has some kind of overriding interest in this 'brain machine' project that has drafted four people - who turn out to be, roughly, a philosopher, a horny priest, a crackpot veteran and a patriot who got an abortion - to sit in a shrinking room with a computer that can read their horrendous secret thoughts. in the end the government takes over the lab by force and everybody dies. here is a movie that is incompetent in every important way; my s*** has better production values than this. it held my interest, though, just to see what exactly these exploitation filmmakers thought they were doing, dabbling in four-guys-in-a-room character drama. the answer: a tract about how science is inferior to god. thanks a lot. it's like opening a kinder egg and getting your 30th goddam jigsaw puzzle. the priest is played by james "roscoe p. coltrane" best, the philosopher by gerald "the republican simon" mcraney. also featuring very, very, very long establishing and transition shots in great quantity, this moves almost as slow as the liberal convention.
