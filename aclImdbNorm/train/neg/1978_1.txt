pathetic is the word. bad acting, pathetic script, cheezy dialog and hip hop music & fashion...what the hell was up with that? the directer of this movie acts as bad as the movie he made. if someone would have taken some time and effort to rework the whole thing, it may of had a chance. bet the studios are still trying figure out how they could screw up up so badly.<br /><br />the absolute best thing about this movie was stacey dash...the asian chick wasn't too bad neither. these too gals carried the whole movie. if it weren't for them i would have destroyed my copy of this movie.<br /><br />if any of those who have not seen this yet and had a notion to, don't waste your time...you'll only regret it later.
