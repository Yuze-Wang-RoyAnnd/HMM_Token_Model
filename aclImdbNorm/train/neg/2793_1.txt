this ranks way up there on my top list of worst movies i've seen so far on starz on demand. they seem to pick up every straight to dvd crap-fest they can find and put it on here.<br /><br />why? who knows! apparently anyone with a digital camera and a shoestring budget can come up with a horror movie and get it put on tv. to be honest, this looked terrible from the moment i saw the trailer--but i did give it a real chance.<br /><br />i always try to have an open mind about low-budget movies. some of the best movies i've ever seen were films that worked around their low budget or in other cases only required that low budget to be great.<br /><br />this is not one of those movies.<br /><br />you know the plot by now, i'm sure, if you're reading this. either you heard about it on starz on demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this page out of boredom. it's about a pathetic and whiny girl we get to know for all of 3 minutes in an incredibly bad "heavy metal" music video. whoever put it together must have thought it looked really interesting, but it really, really doesn't. anyway, she kills herself. then she possesses someone. then some killing starts. it's really unmemorable and as completely average and boring as possible. when the first gunshot goes off in her apartment it quite seriously sounds like a piece of popcorn popping. was that the best sound effect they could come up with? i could find a better sound effect to use for free, (with no copyright,) on the internet... right. now.<br /><br />don't let the other reviews claiming this is a 10 star movie fool you. they are obviously either distributors of the film or maybe even the director trying to con you into thinking this piece of junk is worth buying.<br /><br />laughable.
