of all movies (and i'm a film graduate, if that's worth anything to you), this is the worst movie i have ever seen. i know there are probably some worse ones out there that i just haven't seen yet, but i have seen this, and this is the worst. a friend and i rented it one night because denise richards was on the cover. talk about being young and retarded. she's uncredited! her role was unbelievably small! how did she make it on the cover!? imdb doesn't even list it in her filmography. this movie was so bad, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it, and slipped it inside the case. it read something like "please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally bad movie!"
