"a gentleman's game" uses the game of golf in a country club setting to illustrate an adolescent's discovery about honesty, prejudice, and other life lessons. several times i thought i knew where this film was heading, only to be proved wrong. unfortunately, i'm not so sure that the filmmakers ever knew where it was heading, either. the defining moment in this movie is probably the scene in which gary sinise mocks "the karate kid" and debunks any notions that he's going to become a mentor to the adolescent golfer. it's refreshing, in a way, that this movie refuses to follow most of the simplistic and over-worked movie formulas. however, too much of it still comes off as contrived. at the drop of a hat people drop all pretenses of civility, or fail to stick up for the things in which they believe, or are exposed for something far less respectable than their place in society assumes. unfortunately, there is often no resolution to these moments. and except for the fact that the club serves as backdrop for them, there is no real continuity or linking of them. it's a shame that the writers and director could not salvage a better film, especially given some of the talented actors and potential in the setup.
