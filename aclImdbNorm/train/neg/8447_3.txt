i don't know what i missed here, but i can't believe all these positive comments by so many people on this film. i thought it was silly, and a bit over the top. i did like the performances of gregg henry and michael rooker, however the others were just... boring.<br /><br />now i like b movies, i really do, but this was a bit further down the alphabet for me. i saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to "army of darkness" and "shaun of the dead", as well as "on par with the re-animator". you must be joking. i didn't find this film funny, it tried, it did make an effort, (possibly too much of an effort), but it failed in my opinion. by the time i was hit with the 3rd or 4th one-liner i was rolling my eyes and checking my watch.<br /><br />there were definitely homages made to several other films, which is always cool, kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans. but here it may have just been a lack of original thought. admittedly there were some nice special effects, good gore, but that can't carry an entire movie. the mutated grant looked like a cross between jabba the hut, and in the early stages of mutation- chet from "weird science" (after he was turned into the monster) and one of the alien creature/children from "the explorers". it just didn't work. i thought it looked like something some kid from grade 5 art class could have designed. then there was brenda, the woman that grant impregnated and chained up in the barn. when help finally arrived she looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped. the design once again was totally unimaginative. a round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle. *yawn* <br /><br />now about the zombies- the more movies i see with zombies in them these days the more i wish george a. romero had a patent on them and was the only writer/director allowed to make movies about them. he's the only person so far to do it right, with the exception of edgar wright and simon pegg (but that was a comedy). oh, and danny boyle, but they were a different style of zombie. maybe mr. romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan, groan and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid, and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were re-animated. the people of "wheelsy" just didn't have the proper motivation... they were horrible zombies.<br /><br />so in the end i give "slither" a 3, for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes.
