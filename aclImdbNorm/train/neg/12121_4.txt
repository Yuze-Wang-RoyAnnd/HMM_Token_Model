tony goldwyn is a good actor who evidently is trying his hand at directing. "a walk on the moon" appears to have borrowed from other, better made films. the present story takes place in the late sixties at a summer resort for working class jews not far from woodstock. the screen treatment by pamela gray doesn't have much going for it, so it's a puzzle why mr. goldwyn decided to tackle this film as his first attempt at direction.<br /><br />the kantrowitz family is spending some time at the resort. we see them arrive at the small bungalow that is going to be their temporary home. marty, the father, comes only for the week-end; he works in what appears to be a family small appliance business repairing television sets, mostly. in a few days the first man will walk in space, so the excitement is evident.<br /><br />the kantrowitz women are left behind. pearl, marty's wife and her mother-in-law, lilian, spend idle days in the place until the "blouse salesman" arrives. pearl goes browsing and she finds much more than a shmatte; she gets the salesman as well. it appears that pearl and marty have no sexual life at all. after two children, pearl, who appears to be sexy and with a high libido is ready for some extra marital fun.<br /><br />that is the basic premise for the film, which becomes a soap opera when the young daughter, alison, decides to play hooky and go to the woodstock festival nearby where, horror of horrors, she witnesses her own mom making out with the blouse salesman! what's a girl to do? well, stay tuned for the grand finale when all the parties are happily reunited by the little son's bedside when he is stung by wasps and the salesman comes to apply some home remedy, and daddy is called from the city, after knowing about pearl's betrayal with the younger stud.<br /><br />poor diane lane, she went to make "unfaithful" later on, which is the upscale version of this dud. viggo mortensen is the salesman who caters to his lonely female customers whispering little somethings in their ears! liev schreiber as marty, the cuckolded husband, doesn't have much to do. anna paquin plays the rebellious alison and tovah feldshuh is the unhappy nana, who would like to have stayed in the city watching her soap operas instead of witnessing first hand one that is playing in her own backyard!<br /><br />watch it at your risk, or pop the dvd in the telly when you have a fun crowd at home and you really want to have a laugh, or two dishing the film.
