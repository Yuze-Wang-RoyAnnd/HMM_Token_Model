i give this movie a 3 as it is worse than the cult movies that deserve a proper 2. it does not make sense to you? well, it doesn't have to. this is another vampire movie with a stupid plot, no, let me rephrase, incredibly idiotic plot, where space cowboys (complete with cowboy hats) battle a space race of moron vampires.<br /><br />does it get any uglier than this? the only good thing in this movie was natassia malthe, with her stunning norwegian beauty. god, i wish michael ironside and the deluise brothers would stop accepting dumb roles in dumb movies! i mean, at least seaquest was nice! i know mr. ironside from a lot of movies, he has acted in 164 movies at this date!! it's true that he was rarely in a major role, but still!
