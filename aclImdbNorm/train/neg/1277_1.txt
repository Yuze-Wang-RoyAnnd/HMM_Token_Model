this movie still chills me to the bone thinking of it. this movie was not just bad as in low-budget, badly acted, etc. although it certainly was all of those things. the problem with this movie is that it seemed to be intentionally trying to annoy the viewer, and doing it with great success. what i want to know is, is this supposed to be a horror movie? i mean, it's definately horrifying, but not in the way horror movies are supposed to be. i could see the first segment trying to be horror and failing, but what the hell is the second segment? it's just annoying. the third segment is like watching an artsy student film, which amazingly enough makes it the least painful segment. it's an atrocity that this movie isn't way low on the bottom 100, so get your votes (1/10) in people!! i know some people gave this good reviews, but, well, they're lying in a sadistic attempt to trick you. trust me, it is impossible to like this movie. the only benefit of this movie is an amazing life-extending effect: it feels like you've been watching this movie for years after only the first half hour has passed.
