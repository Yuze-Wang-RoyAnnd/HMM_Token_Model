this is probably one of the worst "wanna be a low budget hit films" to credit the dinosaur genre. the film is so predictable you could go away, cook yourself dinner, go answer the phone or whatever and when you're back you'll know exactly what has happened. the special effects are so poor you would have thought lego bricks were used and the "super fast" dinosaurs were so tame that it makes a pet dog look like a super predator. the acting is over cooked. they try so hard, yet there just isn't enough character behind them to get into the characters and as for the scientist... yeah okay we know exactly whats going to happen to the blonde chick in glasses. stereotypical was created for films like this. if you want to watch this film, i suggest you aren't in as a serious mood as the cast and crew obviously were. and if you are really really into dinosaurs and know everything in the world about them, don't watch it, you might break the screen - the facts are that far off.
