the cars in this movie are awesome. the acting in this movie is awful. the plot and driving scenes don't make much sense and are equally bad. if you get really bothered by movies where someone shifts and suddenly goes ridiculously faster, save yourself the trouble and money. good movie for racing fans? well, there is a part where they make the mistake of referring to a nascar driver as a rally car driver. if you can't tell the difference, go watch it, you'll have a blast. it really comes down to this, there are really really really nice cars in this movie, they are driven horribly and are completely unrealistic. the acting is horrible mainly because of the extremely bad plot. if you want to see hot girls, turn on mtv or vh1 instead. i am disappointed that such nice cars would be represented in such a bad movie. if the class of the cars were to match that of the movie, they should be racing with rusted bicycles.
