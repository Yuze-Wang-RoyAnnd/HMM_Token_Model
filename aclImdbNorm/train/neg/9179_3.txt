it is cheese. if all you want is a video game, complete with what look like straight-from-the-computer cutaway sequences for action the film was too cheap to actually make special effects for, this is it. my friend and i actually had a great time seeing it, since the theatre was mostly empty and we could heckle a bit. this movie really requires heckling.<br /><br />plot? there was a plot? ok, some stupid college or later types get invited to "the rave of the year" and go to one of the san juan islands ("if they'd only stayed back in seattle, they would have survived." - direct quote, or nearly.) to attend. they get there and everyone is gone, and the site is somewhat wrecked (but hey, the keg is still full!). with the help of a crusty old captain and a coast guard woman (who acted only slightly less tough - and slightly less well - than cynthia rothrock), they fight lots of zombies (some which spit acid), get an earful of freaky legends, and mostly get killed. that's about it.<br /><br />it's not quite as bad as demonicus, but not by much, and still better than severed (they are sort of my own personal alpha and omega for bad movies - the former is bad but fun to heckle, and the latter is just too freaking bad to watch more than once). on the other hand, if you're expecting a video game movie as excellent as resident evil, run away!!! run away now!!!<br /><br />ok, some real big questions (without too many spoilers): since when did spanish ships of the 18th century venture into the pacific northwest????? why is anyone in the pacific northwest smuggling guns, and to whom - canada, for crying out loud??? why is a rave on an unnamed (oh, excuse me, it's called "isla del muerto", shya, right) san juan island - and outdoors, still keeping in mind this is the pacific northwet. and the rave has about 30 people in attendance - "the rave of the year," my patoot.<br /><br />lucky thing there's lots of hatchets around. lots of them. everyone has them. must be a hatchet sales outlet nearby.<br /><br />finally, while the movie started out playing with a little "parody" (with nudges at i know what you did and jaws), it didn't carry it through near enough.<br /><br />ok, really finally - when the introductory comments (in a voice-over, no less) casually mention that one of the characters "gave up her boyfriend to focus on her fencing" you can be darn sure there'll be some fencing by the end of the movie. not good fencing, but a couple of people hacking at each other with swords, anyway.
