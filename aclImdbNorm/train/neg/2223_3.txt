trite, clich'ed dialog and plotting (the same kind of stuff we saw all through the 1980s fantasy movies), hokey music, and a paint-by-numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore fans.<br /><br />what saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful crutch of bakshi's work, the rotoscoping, and the fact that frank frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him. this is frazetta...in motion. the violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword & sorcery movie of the period.<br /><br />i like to watch this with the sound off, playing the soundtrack to the first conan movie instead.
