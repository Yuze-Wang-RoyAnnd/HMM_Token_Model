i dislike this movie a lot. if you've read the puzo's books, or at least have watched very closely the two first movies (specially the first one), you're going to agree with me.<br /><br />compared with the corleone's saga presented by puzo's novel, the script of this film is, sometimes, even ridiculous. the characters and the relationships among them are distorted. the story ends up reaching nowhere, although it appears to go to some direction during the movie.<br /><br />it is understandable that different times should be expected for the corleone's saga in the 90's, and that we would not gonna find things the way they were before. but, in the other hand, i don't know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies, in contexts when they didn't fit. why this? it sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the original film's qualities.<br /><br />what will never be understandable is the fact that mario puzo, coppola and al pacino joined together to make this. a man who directed pieces like apocalypse now and godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies. so does al pacino, for being the actor he is. but mario puzo shouldn't have written this. how come? he damaged all his previous work. what a shame, my friend. the puzo's novel "the last don" is a 90's story about the mob, and it is great. we can never tell the same about the plot for the godfather iii.
