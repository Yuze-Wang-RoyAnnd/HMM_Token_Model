this movie is little more than poorly-made, fetish porn, and this is saying a lot considering the similar crap that was made in that era. this was recommended to me by friend as a "unique film experience." he was right. i suppose he meant that as a joke. not disgusting, not even that shocking. just mediocre acting and poor attempts at shock art. a little bit of camp value, though i don't believe the makers of this film intended this. and yes, as a previous reviewer mentioned, it's sex with a guy in a bear suit. don't spend a lot of money on this. try to borrow it, if you must see it. or contact me, i'd be happy to sell you my copy for half price.<br /><br />i may have to see another of this particular director's films, as he seems to have a certain following. but if it's anything like this, i will again regret another 2 hours of my life gone forever.
