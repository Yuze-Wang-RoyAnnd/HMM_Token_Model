this italian film from the '70's is not even in the class with dog soldiers, the howling, or even that awful american werewolf in paris, but...it is fun to watch. i'm talking about watching the lead actress, a stunning blonde, run amok in her birthday suit. we're talking about graphic, complete nudity...it's obvious that she is a real blonde...humma humma humma!! the story is a hoot, the sfx are childish, and the acting (for the most part) stinks. the only redeeming value of this movie is all (and there is a lot) the nudity & sex scenes. tame by hbo standards, but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on saturday night. ok...here's the spoiler...there is no werewolf (except in the opening scene of the heroine(??)'s ancestor. the girl just imagines that she's a werewolf...in other words, a clinical lycanthrope.
