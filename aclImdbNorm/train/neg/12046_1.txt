i had high hopes for troy and i am so bitterly disappointed. the film was directed so badly it made my stomach ache. the pacing was so slow, the dialogue laughable and the film - well apart from a nice fight scene between achilles (pitt) and hector (bana) - the rest was shallow.<br /><br />and why, oh why does hollywood always insist on rewriting stories to fit 'consumer approval'. agamemnon didn't die in troy, the war lasted 10 years and achilles was killed by paris outside the walls of troy with an arrow to the ankle! it annoys me that such a classic story as this is turned into a soap.<br /><br />and don't even start me on the 'lack' of chemistry between helen and paris. she was the woman the war was fought over and it didn't even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other. no sparks, no emotion, no hope.<br /><br />i have to say in the films defence brad pitt, eric bana and peter o' toole acted very well with a bad script but that isn't enough to save this awful movie. <br /><br />can anybody tell me where the lb200 million budget went? maybe in all the trees they used for the funeral pyres - where did they get all those trees?<br /><br />i am so disappointed it hurts.
