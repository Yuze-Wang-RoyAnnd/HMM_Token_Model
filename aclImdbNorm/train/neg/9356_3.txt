marilyn miller made only three films before her untimely death - the marvelous sally (1929), the comedy her majesty love (1931) and this trifle - sunny (1930). it is quite poor both as an early talkie and as an attempt at a musical - although she has four dance numbers, she only sings two songs (who? and one man alone). the rest of the score including the spritely title tune are jettisoned, although we can hear the latter in the background scoring. miller looks overweight and amateurish here - no star quality at all. even her dancing is cloutish. the film is very badly written, stock full of stale and unfunny jokes and stupid situations. if you're interested in miller as a performer, by all means, check it out, but for general entertainment, stay away.
