acting was weak, but in a horror flick, i can live with that if the story is good. it wasn't. the initial event was an clumsy and obvious ploy to exploit most people's adoration of kids. ok, fine. fast forward to the "place in the country" where they will recover emotionally. i like the revelation of the ghosts. ok, cool--this will be a supernatural kinda horror story, with rotting things partly in our world partly in...where ever. then the action starts pulling like a three headed dog in a flurry of cats and birds--is there an evil force trying to attack them directly? is there an evil force trying to attack them indirectly--make people do awful things they wouldn't really do? oh, wait, no, maybe the whole region is some kind of psychic echo chamber where ambient discord can reverberate into murder? ok, hold on--maybe it's really just one little mentally tangled "delbert"-style redneck boy who misses his mommy and is on some kind of spree like a k-tel norman bates knock off? oh, yeah--extra points off: the only black character seems to be the grandson of an "our gang" pullman porter. the actor plays it as straight as he can given the crummy dialogue, but the fact is, his purpose is "y'all done betta get outa heah, boss!" at least they wrote him smart enough to gtf outta there. the bit with the little girl being silenced and pulled away was definitely creepy, as was the chick in the shower. those were just two of quite a few really delicious tidbits in this movie. the problem is that they are combined in disharmonious ways, like a bite of steak, a bite of chocolate and a bite of a gummi bear. each is great on it's own, but mixed up? bleah! such potential. wasted.
