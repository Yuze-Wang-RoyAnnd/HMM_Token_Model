ironically, although he can do the "splits", thomas is a complete stiff as an actor. <br /><br />this film is seared into my memory as one of the most side-splittingly cheesy and incompetent movies i have ever seen. as such, i'm actually rather fond of it. <br /><br />still,the only reason this gets more than one star is that thomas is great shape, and it's fun to see his tiny, muscular body performing various feats of gymnastic skill on the oddly shaped rocks and poles scattered about the east european country side (including the infamous "pommel horse" shaped well cap in the middle of a village square that thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various insane villagers). but let the poor guy open his mouth and try to emote, and any illusion that he might have a film career is immediately dashed to bits. <br /><br />thomas at least had the excuse that he wasn't really an actor. everyone else in the film - actors, director, editor, camera guys, etc. is at least as bad, or even worse, and most of them are professionals. so kurt doesn't come off quite as badly as you might think. <br /><br />i hope poor kurt took the money and ran. if anyone ever asks him to perform in a martial arts film again, i'll bet that thomas kicks the guy in the face.
