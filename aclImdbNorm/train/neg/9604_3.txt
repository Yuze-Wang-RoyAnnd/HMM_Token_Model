first thing i noticed in this movie of course, was the unnecessary amount of nudity. it's not oozing nudity or anything, but a lot that was not needed. annik borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf, and believes their fate are destined to be the same. which actually i found quite interesting. the original wolf man was intended to be a completely psychological movie, but universal threw in the actual wolf man you were never supposed to see for n extra buck or two. i find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf interesting. unfortunately this is not the film i was searching for.<br /><br />instead we know shes not a werewolf from the beginning, so there's no thrill or twist, also they attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario. they fail there too adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality. at first i was excited upon reading the description of the film. but i slowly realized it was a cover just so they could expose the main characters breasts as often as possible.<br /><br />annik borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role, or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role. since the character danniele has no brains and is just a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a wolf, it takes little skill to play. she has moments were her performance breaks through for a creepy moment but is quickly ruined by the poor camera work and light. the idea is great, but hideously executed throughout the film. 3/10
