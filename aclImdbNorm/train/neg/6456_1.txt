well, what can it be said about this disaster? i watched it because it aired on cable. i regret for wasting my time but at least i didn't waste money. <br /><br />the creature is the cheesiest you can get! please, you need to be very generous not to get angered by the cheap halloween costume. oh well, there are also displays of horrible acting, f/x, and dialogues. the confrontation with the creature is unbelievable, you can't get a more pathetic scene. <br /><br />this is the worst you can get from direct to video flicks. "creature unknown" makes full moon pictures movies look like "halloween". <br /><br />avoid this one at all costs, please. the only "positive" thing about this trash are the sexy women.
