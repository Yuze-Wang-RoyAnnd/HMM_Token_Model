caught this by accident on a t.v. showing - and could hardly believe how utterly awful the whole experience was. by comparison, the original "a man called horse" was spell-binding because it held one's interest throughout. but this piece of nonsense - words fail me. it was bad enough to have some kind of a "story" presented with all the impact of a wet loaf of bread, but that error was compounded by the obvious lack of subtitles throughout whenever the so-called "sioux" spoke. for goodness sake, couldn't the film-makers have found enough north american indians who were also actors and near-actors to perform as "indians" in this farrago instead of the imposters they actually used? i also found it quite embarrassing watching richard harris cavorting all around the countryside at the obvious behest of the director standing just behind camera, telling him to run and jump from pointless point a to pointless point b just to make up film footage and minutes. absolutely terrible in all respects!
