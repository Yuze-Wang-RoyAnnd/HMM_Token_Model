i got this in the dvd 10 pack curse of the dead. you gotta love those bargain packs. for even if they don't feature true remastering, restoration and all that hoo-ha, and the films are generally in full-frame pan and scan format, there's no denying that there are always a few gems included. and by "gems", i mean there's always some good crap to be seen, especially if the films are from the '70s as the mansion of madness is.<br /><br />my copy is called mansion of madness, but when the title screens roll it's poe's dr. tarr's torture dungeon. doesn't matter, really, as crap is crap is crap, no? yes! but saying this film is completely worthless is not true at all. there are some funky elements here and there, and obviously the flick did have a decent budget.<br /><br />the opening title sequence is cool with its colored negative run through a cheap tv look. the dialogue is always hilarious. near the beginning of the film, the horse and buggy driver gets out to move a dead tree stump in the middle of the road. "what strength!" says our hero. funny, then, that this dude should later not be able to fight off the wacky woodsmen when they come to make freaky fun. you'll completely forget that this guy was even in the movie until he crops up again later near the end. that's how memorable these characters are.<br /><br />the best part about mansion of madness, however, has to be the wacky music and screwball hijinks that the good guys have to endure. it's like bad cartoon music that a three year old would find enjoyable. and why all the weirdo slapstick, anyway? i'd say my fave moment had to be when the horse and buggy is ambushed by the forest freaks when they pull a stupid looking homemade ghost up by a stick in the middle of the road and make the buggy stop. what the hell? oh yeah, there's plenty of boobies to be seen, too, for those of you that dig such things. boobies, bad dialogue, and wacky music. that best sums of mansion of madness for me. it's well worth at least one viewing, and may be a lot better if you've had a few to drink or whatnot. i can't say i was ever bored watching it, but i can't deny that it's also a barrel of poop. kinda like magical mystery tour but with a plot, but not. hmm.<br /><br />and mr. chicken pwnz.
