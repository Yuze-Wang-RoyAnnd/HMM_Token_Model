or anyone who was praying for the sight of al cliver wrestling a naked, 7ft tall black guy into a full nelson, your film has arrived! film starlet laura crawford (ursula buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group who demand the ransom of $6 million to be delivered to their island hideaway. what they don't count on is rugged vietnam vet peter weston (cliver) being hired by a film producer to save the girl. and what they really didn't count on was a local tribe that likes to offer up young women to their monster cannibal god with bloodshot bug eyes.<br /><br />pretty much the same filming set up as cannibals, this one fares a bit better when it comes to entertainment value, thanks mostly a hilarious dub track and the impossibly goofy monster with the bulging eyes (franco confirms they were split ping pong balls on the disc's interview). franco gets a strong eurocult supporting cast including gisela hahn (contamination) and werner pochath (whose death is one of the most head-scratching things i ever seen as a guy who is totally not him is shown - in close up - trying to be him). the film features tons of nudity and the gore (tempra paint variety) is there. the highlight for me was the world's slowly fistfight between cliver and antonio de cabo in the splashing waves. sadly, ol' jess pads this one out to an astonishing (and, at times, agonizing) 1 hour and 40 minutes when it should have run 80 minutes tops. <br /><br />for the most part, the severin dvd looks pretty nice but there are some odd ghosting images going on during some of the darker scenes. also, one long section of dialog is in spanish with no subs (they are an option, but only when you listen to the french track). franco gives a nice 16- minute interview about the film and has much more pleasant things to say about buchfellner than his cannibals star sabrina siani.
