this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen, but i really can't recall when i've seen a worse one. i thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation. what it really was is a soap opera, and a bad one at that. they overplayed the 'conflict' card to the extreme. the first hour or so seems like a shouting match, with some implausible scenes thrown in.<br /><br />*possible spoiler*<br /><br />the 40-or-so minute 'memorial' scene (with requisite black umbrellas and rain) to fictitious crash victims was lame, and i thought it would never end. <br /><br />avoid this one at all costs, unless you revel in 'conflict'.<br /><br />
