to confess having fantasies about brad pitt is a pretty tough admission for an heterosexual to make. but what can i tell you? maybe is that famous extra something that everybody talks about and makes a star a star. it crosses that barrier. it pulls you into unknown sensual and emotional territory. brando had it in spades, montgomery clift, gary cooper, james dean of course and in more recent times, tom cruise, jude law, johnny depp, ewan mcgregor and billy crudup. women fell in love with garbo, dietrich, katharine and audrey hepburn, grace kelly, marilyn monroe, julie christie, charlotte rampling, meryl streep, vanessa redgrave, julia roberts and very very recently natalie portman. but brad pitt has, singlehandedly, redefined the concept. he is the only reason to go out, get in the car, find parking, buy a ticket, popcorn and get into a theatre to see "troy" if you liked epics in the "jupiter's darling" style you may enjoy this. but if you don't, go all the same, we want to keep brad pitt in business.
