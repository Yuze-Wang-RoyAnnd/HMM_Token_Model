being a film studies graduate i would like to think that i have seen a diverse range of films, some good and some bad, but i would have to say that 'summer rain' is by far the worse film i have ever seen! i chose the film in the hope that it was going to be a great british classic such as 'secrets and lies' or 'lockstock' but oh no this was so bad that my flat mates and i ended up laughing and cringing at the ridiculous acting and cheesy script (reminded me of a bad 'theatre in education' school production). the main characters michelle and gary began to annoy us from the start. 'michelle' the main character who lives with her two friends has the type of face that you would never get tired of slapping and gary was so wet (he kept breaking down in tears every 5 minutes) that by the end of the film i really didn't give a damn about either of them. all i could think was ' i paid lb3 for this pile'. i have never written a review before but after watching this film it has spurred me on to warn people of this disastrous production. so please avoid at all costs. thanks for reading.
