this movie was awful in the worst way: you just didn't care. you didn't care what happened in the plot; you didn't care about the characters. everyone was devoid of heart. i ended up walking out about an 45 minutes into it because i simply didn't want to subject my mind to it any more. there is far too much sex in the film. sex can be okay; it can even make the movie (hence karma sutra) but the intercourse here was not beautiful or sexy. it was just ugly. don't see this film.
