okay, now, i know there are millions of americans who believe in the rapture: that moment when all people born again in christ will be raptured up to meet god and all the rest of humanity will be left on earth to perish in plagues and fire and the heartbreak of psoriasis as the antichrist battles it out with jesus (in an uncharacteristically warlike mode). and i know the books were best sellers. . .among believers, anyway. and i mean no disrespect to all that.<br /><br />but i have to say, they stuffed this movie into a sack and beat it with the suck stick.<br /><br />i'm sure the books are much better. really.<br /><br />the plot needs no reprising. if you've watched this movie, chances are you read the book. i may be one of the only people on earth who actually watched this just for the sheer bad-moving-making experience, and i wasn't disappointed. especially not by kirk cameron, the creepy little "growing pains" gremlin, who came of age on that show, found christ, and decided that the show should reflect his christian values. well, kirk, your career has gone to the dogs, but now you can be happy that you're spreading the word of god in movies so bad, they never even make it to theatrical release. well, that's not strictly true: i guess this was the only movie ever made that went to dvd first, with a voucher for a free viewing of the movie when it was briefly released in theaters! i still have the voucher! how many people do you suppose showed up? i don't know about you, but it never came to my town. of course, i live in nyc, where we godless liberals sit around tearing pages out of the bible and use them to roll joints. so there you go. in fact, i'll bet out of three million people on manhattan island, not one would be raptured.<br /><br />check out the supplementary materials on the dvd, where you'll learn the creepy behind the scenes details of these movies. . .the cast and crew all must be of the same religious mindset. they don't come right out and say this, but listen closely to what the filmmakers say. it's like a bunch of pod people got together to make a pod movie. how creepazoid is that? honestly, this stuff just preaches to the converted, doesn't it? can you imagine anyone who doesn't subscribe to the whole apocalypse thing watching this, slapping his forehead and saying, "holy hoover dam! i better get saved pronto!" anyhow, i'm hooked. i gotta see the rest of these christian fiasco movies, especially the one with gary busey, which i think is tribulations. at least busey has an excuse for taking the part.. . .he cracked his head on some pavement when he crashed his motorcycle.<br /><br />oy.<br /><br />oh, and one more thing. what's with all the shots of poor,innocent dogs whimpering, their leashes dragging uselessly along the ground, because their owners have been called to heaven? what's up with that? are we supposed to feel badly for the dogs, and if we do, what are we to make of god? doesn't it irk people that there's no room in heaven for man's best friend? foo.<br /><br />this is one more reason i'm agnostic. good night and good luck.
