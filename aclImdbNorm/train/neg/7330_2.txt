kill me later" has an interesting initial premise: a suicidal woman (selma blair) on the verge of jumping off the top of an office building is protects a bank robber (max beesley) who promises to "kill her later."<br /><br />the actual execution of this premise, however, falls flat as almost every action serves as a mere device to move the plot toward its predictable conclusion. shoddily written characters who exhibit no motive for their behaviors compromise the quality of acting all around. lack of character depth especially diminishes selma blair's performance, whose character shawn vacillates from being morose to acting "cool" and ultimately comes across as a confused dolt. this is unfortunate, as under other circumstances ms. blair is an appealing and capable actress.<br /><br />compounding matters for the worse is director dana lustig's insistence on using rapid cuts, incongruous special effects (e.g. look for an unintentionally hilarious infrared motorcycle chase at the end), and a hip soundtrack in the hopes of appealing to the short attention spans of the mtv crowd. certainly ms. lustig proves that she is able to master the technical side of direction, but in no way does her skill help overcome the film's inherent problems and thus the movie drags on to the end. clearly, lustig has a distinct visual style; however it is perhaps better suited to music videos than to feature film.<br /><br />the producers (ram bergman & lustig)can be commended for their ability to realize this film: they were able to scare up $1.5 million to finance the film, secure a good cast, and get domestic and foreign distribution. this is no small feat for an independent film. yet given the quality of the product, the result is a mixed bag.
