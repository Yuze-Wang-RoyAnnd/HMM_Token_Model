this series has its ups and occasional downs, and the latter is the case, here. there's an agreeable amount of spatter, with an inventive implementation of the baby cart's weapons, but the editing film is a seriously disjointed, the film-making itself rougher than usual. at times, the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the "cub," who nearly gets lost early on. all in all, disappointment.<br /><br />that said, there's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers. this installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy, who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him.
