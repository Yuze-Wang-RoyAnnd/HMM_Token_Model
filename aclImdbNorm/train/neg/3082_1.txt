good lord, what were they thinking??!!!!!! here is your spoiler warning, even though i don't think it'll really matter. you won't be seeing this piece of trash anyway.<br /><br />a group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people, who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them, and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies. in other words, the whole thing is really stupid.<br /><br />you know it has to be bad when even mike and the bots can't save something!! and they didn't! i know, some of their lines were funny, like what to add to the sign "hit" and the hand comments, but, geez, this was pretty dang sad.<br /><br />all i can say is do not watch this piece o crud. it is not worth your eyes.
