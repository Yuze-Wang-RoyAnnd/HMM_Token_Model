i don't know where to begin. the cast is full of people who've never done anything before or since. debralee scott is listed on cover boxes, but does not appear in the movie at all. the writing is quite bad, even for college films. it's obviously very low budget, with one scene at the sorority house having extremely choppy editing.<br /><br />the characters are pretty typical for college films - timid guy, nerd, suave black guy, tough guys, guy with mustache, attractive girl, small town girl, etc. the featured teacher is about what's you'd expect... middle aged heavy set guy who gets sidetracked easily.<br /><br />if you wan't to see a college flick, stay clear from this one. it's so bad, it's not even funny.
