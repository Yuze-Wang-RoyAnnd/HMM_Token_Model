this is an interesting idea gone bad. the hidden meanings in art left as clues by a serial killer sounds intriguing, but the execution in "anamorph" is excruciatingly slow and without much interest. there is no other way to describe the film except boring. the death clues are the only interesting part of "anamorph". everything connecting them is tedious. willem dafoe gives a credible performance as the investigator, but he has little to do with a script that is stretched to the limit. several supporting character actors are wasted , including peter stormare as the art expert, james rebhorn as the police chief, paul lazar as the medical examiner, and most notably deborah harry, who is featured on the back of the dvd case, yet only has a couple lines spoken through a cracked door. not recommended. - merk
