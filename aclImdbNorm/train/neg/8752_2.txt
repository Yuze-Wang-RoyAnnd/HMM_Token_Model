i watched this movie really late last night and usually if it's late then i'm pretty forgiving of movies. although i tried, i just could not stand this movie at all, it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on. although i know it's suppose to be a comedy but i didn't find it very funny. it was also an especially unrealistic, and jaded portrayal of rural life. in case this is what any of you think country life is like, it's definitely not. i do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute, but the french guy was really fake. i do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story, but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it, it's just too annoying.
