when a friend gave me a boxed set of "12 amazing scifi/horror movies!" i was understandably a little cautious. but, since the item was a gift, i really didn't truly pay my common sense much heed. after all....movies for free! so what if they are a little ropey. after much consideration, alien intruder was the first of those movies. ironically, it was first choice because it looked the best of the bunch. all i can say is, if this is the best of them, i shudder to think what the rest are like.<br /><br />on the surface, it had some good things going for it. four (count 'em!) actors that i was familiar with. billy dee williams, tracy scoggins, maxwell caulfield and jeff conaway. i told myself..."billy and tracy have been in some good scifi (star wars and babylon 5, respectively) so they wouldn't sign up for a turkey. max is a veteran soap actor who never really managed to break into film....but not too shoddy an actor. an jeff....well...he's done the good and the bad as far as films and tv go." i was soon to discover that jeff had decided to add "the ugly" to his repertoire of movies.<br /><br />the first clue was in the opening scenes. jeff mugs his way with gusto through an "i'm mad" scene before finally killing himself. an amusing cameo performance, really. unfortunately this is, without much exaggeration, the highlight of the film. it goes downhill from there.<br /><br />next up we have the commander of the mission (williams) who is being sent out to see what happened to jeff and his crew busy picking his new shipmates from among the ranks of the criminal element. but this assortment aren't so much the dirty dozen - more like the unconvincing foursome. plus, one of the crims, a computer hacker, is shown in his cell working away on a laptop computer. isn't that a bit like letting a murderer run a gun shop in the slammer? pretty lame prison, if you ask me.<br /><br />when they finally take off the effects are truly horrible. it looks like the spaceship model was knocked up in an afternoon by some bored 8 year old who had parts left over from his airfix kits.<br /><br />but the horror doesn't stop there. whilst on route to the area where jeff's ship vanished, the criminal crew are rewarded for their good behaviour by being given weekends of virtual reality, in which they indulge their male fantasies. all well and good, and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to the "alien menace" which begins to appear there. but did they have to drag it out for quite sooooo loooooong? alien intruder? alien boring, more like.<br /><br />finally they make it to g-sector and the alien presence makes them fight against each other for her affections until only good old max is left. the ending, in truly optimistic rubbish film vein, hints at a sequel - as if! also making an appearance in this movie is a character i'll nickname the "sweatdroid". he's supposed to be an android, but apparently that fact was lost on the make-up crew, who provided him with sweaty features at any opportunity. but don't worry, he's just there to make up the body count numbers at the end.<br /><br />williams and scoggins, to be truthful, do very little in the film. they only just barely stay awake, let alone act. and, as i mentioned earlier, jeff gets an early trip to the showers, so his manicness isn't allowed to enlighten much of the film. max tries his best, as do a couple of the other cast members, but the movie is just direly atrocious, to be honest.<br /><br />the one, and only, half-way imaginative thing this movie offers is the ship naming convention. they are all named after musicians - holly, presley, joplin. the rest of the film is bland and uninspired.<br /><br />made in 1992, i had thought, on initial viewing, it was one of those 80's straight-to-video jobs. looks like they still made crap movies well into the 90's, it seems.<br /><br />it's best avoided. even as a beer n chips movie this film is a stinker, but at least you can fast forward it, i suppose.
