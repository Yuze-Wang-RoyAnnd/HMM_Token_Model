how is it possible that a movie this bad can be made. bad acting. bad script. just an embarrassment all around. this is just one bad clich'e after another.<br /><br />this movie actually has some big name stars in it. unfortunately they're singers and not actors.<br /><br />this movie made hardly any money for a good reason. the appeal of black cowboy movies just isn't there. it's a shame they didn't have a good story to tell. <br /><br />this movie actually has some big name stars in it. unfortunately they're singers and not actors.<br /><br />this movie made hardly any money for a good reason. the appeal of black cowboy movies just isn't there. it's a shame they didn't have a good story to tell.
