just had to write that one liner, but it really is. i love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry i've seen in recent years . i have praises for everyone involved in most aspects except the most important one, the script . it is a weak story about a petty criminal. no amount of fine acting or black and white film styling can make up for a total lack of substance. i love kevin spacey and i hear he's gonna do another film about the general. my advice is don't waste your time.
