prom night is about a girl named donna (brittany snow) who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night. and by doing so killing her family, friends, and her enemies. <br /><br />now before i begin let me say have you been tired of pg-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately. are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'oh my god' and talking about girlish things. and are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. and the last thing are you tired of the us remaking asian, japanese, and chinese films. that pretty much sums up prom night but i'm still not done with the review.<br /><br />the only reason to see 'prom night' is to crack a laugh at the kills. if not, don't see prom night. you never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall. and by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7. so not only aren't they scary but it's obnoxious. by the time i met the cast i think i was ready to hurl. too much girl talk, too much guy talk, and lots of 'oh my gosh. it's our prom'. i understand it's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate. <br /><br />if i were to put prom night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films i'd be the first one too. i'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on dvd for cheap and quick. seriously don't spend your money or the time for dull acting, cheap scares, and a 'night to die for' when watching the film.<br /><br />1 star out of 10. (p.s. if i could give the film zero stars i would).
