if it were not for the "oh so gourgous," natassia malthe, this b- movie would not have been worth one sector of my tivo disk space! in what low rent, back lot warehouse was the supposed space port filmed in? "continuity people!" it's a basic principle in real movie making! by night an alleged space port and by day (night and day on a space station?) a warehouse!??!? people please! the only thing i will commend this movie for, is the wardrobe dept. for continuously, keeping natassia in those tight shape revealing outfits! even the women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the outfits that she obviously spent some time getting into, each day of filming! the sci-fi channel would have been better off showing spaceballs! at least there would have been some real humor in watching something so unbelievable.<br /><br />p.s. michael ironside, please fire your agent asap! you are so much better of an actor, to be even associated with this level of movie making.
