there is a really good movie lurking just beneath the surface of the layers upon layers of cheese that is "the pagemaster".<br /><br />i found this out when i watched this again this morning after neglecting it for years and years. i remember hating it with a passion when it first came out, but this time, i found that the special effects are quite good. the plot is just "the neverending story" with a creativity-endectomy, but it's an okay little flick for anyone who just wants some really awesome eye-candy. the animation is amazing, and i especially liked how the animators let their characters look and act a bit more surrealistic than the norm. i'm giving it a grade of three as i *would* have given it a two (just for parody value) if i had ever decided to watch this movie expecting it to absolutely blow my mind story-wise.
