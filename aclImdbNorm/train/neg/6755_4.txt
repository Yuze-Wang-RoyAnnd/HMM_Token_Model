maddy (debbie rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she bargained for when she goes to a pool party with a handsome coworker. when her date and his friends jokingly say they belong to a `murder club,' maddy takes it seriously and moves straight up to `level 3' by bashing in the brains of a woman in a parking garage (for denting her car!). but is maddy also the one donning a plastic mask and killing off other members of the group or has someone else lost it?<br /><br />the plot of this film (originally titled make 'em bleed) is very poorly conceived, full of holes and spirals completely out of control before a ludicrous, out-of-left-field twist ending. some of the dialogue is downright laughable. i didn't have a problem with rochon's performance, but the supporting cast was atrocious. however, i managed to sit through this full moon release thoroughly entertained. there's plenty of skin and blood and it's the perfect type of flick to sit around with a group of your buddies and pick apart. horror fans may also enjoy the cameos from brinke stevens and lloyd kaufman (as debbie's parents) and julie strain (an early victim).<br /><br />score: 4 out of 10
