the premise is ridiculous, the characters unbelievable, the dialogue trite, and the ending absurd. <br /><br />believe me, i'm a fan of kevin kline, but watching him do a pepe le pew accent for 2 hours as a supposed frenchman is not nearly as amusing as it sounds.<br /><br />for her part, meg ryan is once again as perky and adorable as a (take your pick): kewpie doll, baby, puppy, kitten, whatever you happen to think is the cutest creature on earth. she also bears not the slightest resemblance to a real human being.<br /><br />this movie strikes me as an opportunity seized by buddies lawrence kasdan and kline to vacation in paris and the south of france while being well-paid for it. so i can't really blame them.
