i can hardly believe i watched this again last night after more than 25 years...<br /><br />some time back, i watched 6 fu films in a row... boris karloff, and all 5 chris lees. the last 2 lees, both directed (and i use that word loosely) by jess franco, were abominable. at the time, i skipped this one, remembering that, in some ways, it was even worse.<br /><br />well, i watched it. never again. you know what's worse that an abominable film? a really well-made piece of s***. and that's what fiendish plot is. it is a very good-looking movie. great production design, sets, costumes, music, photography, editing, mostly good cast, some decent acting...<br /><br />...and absolutely, positively, one of the worst scripts in movie history!!!!! aaaugh!!!!! the first minute of the film is so deceptive... one might mistake this for a decent movie. and then they start singing "happy birthday to fu"... and it goes downhill. having burt kwouk (of whom his master says, "your face-- is familiar.") accidentally pour out fu's elixir vitae to put out a fire, resulting in his being condemned to torture, burial and having one of his ears cut off, was the closest thing to funny they had. it was like someone decided they wanted to do a "campy" film-- so ridiculous it would be funny. ridiculous, it is... funny... it ain't. at all.<br /><br />it's sad, because it's clear in the first few minutes that someone did a lot of research into the fu manchu series in order to get so much of it "right". with a different script-- either a really funny one, or a dead serious one, they might have-- could have-- should have-- had a classic on their hands. a film that could have made one forget the horror of those jess franco atrocities... instead of making one want to dig them out as masterpieces, by comparison.<br /><br />there was a period in the late 70's when a whole slew of classic 30's characters were revived in movies that were universally awful. buck rogers, flash gordon, tarzan, the lone ranger, charlie chan, even doc savage. i'm not sure, this one may be the worst of the lot. it took great self-control not to fast-forward over whole sections of it, especially any scenes containing sid caesar (fbi chief who was also al capone's cousin-- you see what i mean?). it isn't just that the ideas in the film aren't funny... they often make no sense whatsoever. like when they "audition" police officers to impersonate the king and queen, and we wind up seeing people "audition" dance-hall routines like singing, dancing, and riding a unicycle. how many drugs did the writers of this thing have to take for any of this to make sense to them? <br /><br />as i said, a shame... and a real waste of all that talent, including that of peter sellers (who played both fu and nayland smith), burt kwouk (who'd been in a chris lee fu film in his time), helen mirren (the police woman who shockingly falls in love with the villain and damn near steals the last half-hour of the film!). i begin to wonder if anyone will ever make a "proper" fu manchu film, or if fans will have to settle for karloff's being almost the only one?
