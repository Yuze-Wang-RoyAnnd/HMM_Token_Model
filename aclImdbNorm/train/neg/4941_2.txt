i actually didn't mind the geico commercials the first 50 of so times i saw them and even found them to be a bit wry and amusing, but seriously! this is the best thing that these people could come up with?!? this show sucks! it is bland and feels like watching an episode of "the office" with the characters disguised as cavemen (i know a lot of you will hate me for saying that but "the office" just does not do it for me). okay, i get it: we have the poor slob just trying to keep his nose clean and he has a crappy boss who hates him; the pseudo-intellectual who really just has a barely-functioning intellect; and the dopey one who just wants to be accepted, but so what!!! i have worked with these people and found them just as annoying in real life as i do on tv...why would i want to waste another 1/336th of my week watching more of those type nominates?!? please call your parents and ask them if they dropped you on your head if after thinking about it, you still delude yourself into believing that this is entertainment.
