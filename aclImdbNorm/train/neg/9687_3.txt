this is a baffling film. <br /><br />the beauty in sexual relations between men and women is shown degraded by a set of men and women who can only be described as a collection of oddballs and misfits.<br /><br />greenaway acknowledges his inspiration to fellini's film "8 1/2" but whereas fellini is a titan of world cinema, greenaway is not.<br /><br />he has none of the maestro's lightness of touch nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with a deftness of clarity.<br /><br />he is pretentious, the film being divided into chapters with a written introduction to each, as if the viewer has to be guided into the film except that the written notices only stay on screen for a few seconds, not long enough to be read by the audience with the result that they are mostly ignored.<br /><br />as for the women, only two can be described as lookers, palmira, played by polly walker and giaconda played by natacha amal. the rest ooze with ordinariness. both the women and the men retreat from the harsh light of reality into the dim shades of fantasy.<br /><br />greenaway obviously wants to make the point that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness. the women themselves are depressing since they render their services in exchange for money. relations between men and women are debased into a commercial transaction.<br /><br />there is no sense of joy or happiness or love in the film, indeed there are several scenes that are deeply unpleasant :<br /><br />the suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son, philip and storey emmental played respectively by john standing and matthew delamere. the callous disregard of both men that giaconda is carrying their child, she in fact, gets pregnant twice, the first foetus being aborted and the second time, she is sent away to a destination chosen by the men from a flight book. both men having sex with a woman who has no legs, (the half woman in the title). the beastiality that exists between beryl, played by amanda plummer, with a pig named hortense. father and son sharing women between them. women enjoying being beaten sexually. the father sleeping with the corpse of his dead wife.<br /><br />mercifully, none of these scenes are shown sexually, only hinted at.<br /><br />the hinted degradation of women is such that there cannot be any wonder that the film was booed at when it was first premiered at cannes. what is more extraordinary is that the actresses in the film lined up to defend it, showing yet again that there is no limit to the naivety of women and that women will fool themselves into being exploited by men.<br /><br />greenaway's directorial style is pretentious, it is a triumph of style over substance, a depiction of film as art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense.<br /><br />greenaway tries to attain the sublimity of surrealism but only succeeds in showing the banality of human relationships.
