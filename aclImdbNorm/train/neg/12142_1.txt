please, for the love of god, don't watch it. now saying that, i know what you're thinking, it can't be that bad can it? if everyone says it as bad as they say, i have to watch it! don't do it! it'll be like looking at a horrible accident involving little babies and a gasoline tanker! you'll be scarred for life...the image will never leave you! i could only watch a half hour of this before becoming violently sick. the acting is the worst i've ever seen, and i've seen barbwire!!! if you do risk ripping your eyes out and rent this movie...don't say i haven't warned you! the cover and storyline are a trap!! zombies? satire? shaun of the dead was great! this movie must be the same....right? no!! the writing = crap directing = garbage acting = there was no acting. still not convinced? then forever your soul will be tormented!!!
