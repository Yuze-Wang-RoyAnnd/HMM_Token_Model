what on earth has become of our dear ramu? is this the same man who made sarkar, satya, and comapny? i refuse to believe so. if aag was ramu's most ambitious project, he has clearly jumped off the high cliff he has ascended by giving the industry some of the greatest works of all times. this movie is made to fall like a brick. i was cringing to leave the theater, but i was forced to sit because i wouldn't have been able to take my car out of the parking lot before others also left. else, nothing would have made me sit beyond interval.<br /><br />this movie is nowhere close to sholay. it doesn't even come near it within a mile. i believe ramu surely loves the godfather more than sholay, since sarkar was a classic piece of work. i read ramu's interview a couple of days back, in which the interviewer said that ramu doesn't sleep for more than 4 hours a day, that too not at a stretch. i completely agree with this now, as his lack of sleep has probably taken its toll on the movie.<br /><br />there is no power in the performance. amitabh bachchan doesn't even look scary. he looked more terrifying in the few posters and wallpapers i saw earlier. ramu's favorite nisha kothari did a fantastic job in sarkar because she didn't have many dialogs (in fact none if i remember clearly). she opened her mouth in this movie, and has found a place in history. the new guy playing jai's role seems to have that brash look, but didn't manage jai's role at all. i cant go on... im sorry... my pain is too big for me to manage right now.<br /><br />i promised myself throughout the movie that i will watch the original sholay once more just to see that it is still there.<br /><br />bottom line: horrible movie. the media and critics are going to cook ramu's goose. and just to remind all readers once more, i am one of the biggest ramu fans, and even i cant spare him for this act.
