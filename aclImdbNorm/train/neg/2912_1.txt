"meatball machine" has got to be one of the most complex ridiculous, awful and over-exaggerated sci-fi horror films that i have ever came across. it is about good against evil and a coming-of-age tale, with the aim of to entertain with bloody, sleazy and humorous context. because of that the violence isn't particularly gruesome and it doesn't make you squirm, but the gratuitous bloodletting and nudity does run freely. the performances by issei takahashi and toru tezuka is the worst i have seen, if that was not enough it is also directed by an unheard of director called yudai yamaguchi. this movie just have it all, it is bad to the bone!, a must see for every b-movie freak!!!... simply: an enjoying and rare gem.
