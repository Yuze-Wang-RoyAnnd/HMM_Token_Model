i rented this thinking it might be interesting, and it might have been an interesting story except that is was told in such an uninteresting manner. hard to follow, strange editing, disjointed storyline, the characters mumble, all in all a dreadfully dull waste of time. i just couldn't get into it and didn't care what happened to the characters - not even ian holm could save this film. unless you need a cure for insomnia, i'd skip it. 3/10, and that's being generous.
