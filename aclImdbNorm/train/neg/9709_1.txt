30 seconds into the opening credits, i had this feeling that this was going to be a bad movie, but i didn't know just how bad. then the actor playing the evil nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and i decide that in order to survive this movie, we'll have to turn the volume down, make up our own dialogue and double the speed on the dvd. but that didn't help. about half way through we turned it off. now, i've lived through some very bad movies before, both with and without the aide of "mystery science theater 3000" and "svengoolie," but there are just some movies which i doubt even the bots can save. the biggest part of the movie that bothered me the most was that the people hypnotized into believing they're zombies had rotting green skin. i guess they were all hypnotized into death, then hypnotized into rotting themselves. stick to the real b-movie cult classics like "plan nine from outer space."
