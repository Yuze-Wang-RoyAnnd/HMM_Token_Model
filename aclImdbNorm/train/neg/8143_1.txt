i had the distinct displeasure of seeing this movie at the 2006 vancouver international film festival. i have been attending this festival for over 5 years, and i have certainly seen some poor movies on occasion. however, 'first bite' has reached a brand new low in film. in spite of being shot in beautiful locations, with the occasional, exquisite close up of fabulous food, the movie contorts an excessive number of plot twists and stilted characters until i was practically begging for it to end.<br /><br />the lead actor, david la haye, completely failed to show any character development throughout the movie, portraying a pompous chef from beginning to end. additional sub-plots, such as eating disorders, were developed so poorly and completely did not fit within any context that the movie had shown up to that point.<br /><br />a theme of mysticism was used as a poor attempt to conceal a movie that achieves nothing, goes nowhere, and completely disappoints.
