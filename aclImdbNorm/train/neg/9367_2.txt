the plot sounds vaguely interesting ... a scientist (bateman) discovers how to transplant animal eyes and optic nerves into other animals, like humans. a young man (monteith) is blinded saving a coworker at work - the scientist gets a call from a doctor that the young man is a good candidate to be the first human recipient. the recipient starts becoming more and wolf-like, but the effect is nothing more than "weird eyes" and running at night with dogs! (for the whole movie) the budget is too low, the dialogue too stilted (i laughed out loud at some of the ridiculous talk), and the acting too inept. long portions of the movie are nothing more than dreamy looks, eerie music and interspersed clips of wolves in the wild. way too long even at 90 minutes, boring, and devoid of ideas.<br /><br />the military want to use the eye transplants to give wounded soldiers back their eyesight, and presumably want to militarize the technology. there's a silly subplot about a beautiful indian girl (korey) who thinks she can help, using indian wisdom about the wolves. they make love while music heavy on drums and indian chanting is heard - crazy, man! the love making takes place immediately after a gruesome murder - who edited this turkey?! a grouchy "medicine man" who spouts platitudes seems to do little, except for adding atmosphere.<br /><br />here's two ridiculous scenes. a worker at the research lab goes into the animal room to discover the monkeys have been let out of their cages. she gets scared, looks left at the monkeys, turns right, turns left, turns right, turns left .. this goes on for a while (who edited this??). run out of the damn lab! it was so stupid i started laughing. another ridiculous scene - our hero is at home, escapes out a window as the heavily armed military arrive - he leaves the window open, the military guys go to the open window, look out the window, they say "looks like he was here", and leave! he went out the open window, guys!! crazy.<br /><br />near the end of the movie, military guys are firing machine guns over and over at trees, when obviously nothing is there - easier to place the squibs i guess. they have 6 machine guns which have cut down trees, but decide to fight our hero with 1 knife!!! shoot the guy!! who wrote this trash?? there's a pointless confrontation at the end, and believe me i'm not spoiling anything for you - there's not enough plot to spoil.<br /><br />i figure the whole thing was a tax write-off or a rush job to make use of unused budget money left over from some better movie.
