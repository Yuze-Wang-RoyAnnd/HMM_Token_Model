"valentine" is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list (think "halloween", "friday the 13th", "scream", and "i know what you did last summer"). it certainly isn't as good as those movies that i have listed about, but it's better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first "friday the 13th" film. one of those films was the 1981 canadian made "my bloody valentine", which i hated alot. "valentine" is a better film than that one, but it's not saying much. the plot: a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film. then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up, then they're picked off one-by-one. the killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge. but is it him? or could it be somebody else? "valentine" has an attractive cast which includes denise richards, david boreanaz, marley shelton, jessica capshaw, and katherine heigl. they do what they can with the material they've got, but a lackluster script doesn't really do them any justice. there are some scary moments throughout, however. <br /><br />** (out of four)
