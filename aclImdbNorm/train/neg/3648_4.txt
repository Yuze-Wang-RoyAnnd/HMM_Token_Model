a childless couple (brooke adams, jeff hayenga) go to a doctor (james karen) to try to conceive. it works but adams slowly becomes aware that there's something seriously wrong with the baby...<br /><br />pretty interesting idea is thoroughly done in by a lousy script--the basic idea is ok but becomes screamingly predictable towards the end. i saw every "twist" coming. the direction is poor--he seems to have no idea how to shoot a basic scene. the production values are--to be nice--lousy. very shabby. and, the gore scenes are too unpleasant (i almost turned it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach) with lousy special effects. the film completely derails at the end when it becomes quite clear they had no idea how to end this film.<br /><br />some good acting makes it somewhat bearable. adams, hayenga and karen are all good at their roles and kept me watching but that was about it. this film barely got released in 1991 and still remains unknown--it's easy to see why. i give it a 4.
