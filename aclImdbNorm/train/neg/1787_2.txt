i liked batman: dead end. a dark edgy film-noir setting for batman was perfect. batman: dead end is good. this is not.<br /><br />first of all let me start off with the acting. none of it is really that good. the best would probably be clark bartram as batman. but that isn't saying much. he is good at first glance, and then you realize he is what he is, a body-builder who happens to be a tolerable actor. but mainly the problem is that batman doesn't belong in the daylight, he looks like a freak running around in a bat suit. instead of a horribly scarred man trying to make up for past mistakes. the daylight also reveals an irritating dorky scowl on bartram's face which never leaves and unoticeable in batman: dead end, probably because of the darkness of short which is so desired in this trailer. bartram seems to think that scowling and stubbornly shaking his head is acting, it's not, it's quite the opposite. it's called posing, something real actors avoid like the plague.<br /><br />something i never understood why collora casted body-builders as the leads. it makes much more sense to give the role to an actor who can manage it, instead of a bodybuilder who can kinda manage it but hey he looks so much like the comic! of course, they might have done better if collora's dialouge didn't leave much to be desired.<br /><br />the entire trailer (yes, trailer. there will not be a full-length film) is more centered around superman then batman. but everything on the superman side is corny, cloying and amateur. michael o'hearn (superman) is one of the worst actors i've ever seen. he stands around, smiles, says his lines. that's about it. although i'm not surprised since he is just a bodybuilder they hired and possibly received a few acting lessons. once again i say to collora, cast actors. not bodybuilders. actors will be so much more compelling that we will forgive the fact they don't look exactly like the comic book.<br /><br />the costume is what you would expect superman to wear. as for the batman suit. well, i guess it only looks good in the dark. i say this because in some shots the suit looks like something you would buy from a halloween gift shop.<br /><br />superman flies in this movie. but that isn't a good thing. these shots look especially amateur. this and a lot of the entire "film" looks like it was shot in their backyard with a vhs camera.<br /><br />the best shots are a shot of superman catching a car in his hands. and the final shot of two-face and batman at the very end. for those of you who have seen the trailer. you know what i'm talking about. now if only he could have stretched that shot through the entire trailer.<br /><br />finally i ask. why if you're trying to show your ability as a director, would you make a trailer as a short film? this proves nothing when it comes to being an actual director handling story. my only piece of advice for collora here is, there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and being able to work in marketing.<br /><br />batman: dead end didn't feel amateur. i can't figure out where this went wrong.
