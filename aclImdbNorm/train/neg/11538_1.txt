a truly horrible film that left me feeling sullied by having watched the forty minutes or so i could stand. not the actors' fault, but the writer/director, producers, financiers, etc., need a very stiff talking to. maybe it thinks it is profound. it isn't. this rape and ultra-violence, unlike that central to clockwork orange, has nothing to say about or add to the sum of human understanding. it's no straw dogs, either, to which i have seen it compared. rather it feels like something pete walker might have turned his hand to, yet even in saying that i'm probably being a bit unfair on pete walker.<br /><br />revenge is a powerful human desire, but the bedroom window has more to say about that and male emasculation than this pitiful effort.<br /><br />i don't think it's particularly misogynistic, merely too gleeful in its depiction of certain details -- the blood running down ga's leg post rape, par example. it's neither challenging nor confrontational, though i'm sure the film-makers consider themselves very 'daring', just deeply unpleasant.<br /><br />is this as high as we can aim? is this why those involved wanted to make films? ( i did write in here the latin phrase which translates as oh the times! oh the customs! but the new spell-check on imdb wouldn't let me post until i had removed it. likewise i had to remove square parentheses. get it sorted imdb.)<br /><br />where is the lofty aspiration? the noble impulse? when you look at british film - the joyful comedies of ealing or the boulting brothers; carol reed's work with graham greene on fallen idol, our man in havana or the sublime the third man (a film which has far more to say about evil than a thousand straightheads); the work of powell & pressburger; or if you want to talk about sex, violence and male emasculation look at "the offence' dir. sidney lumet, from an original play by john hopkins; check out "tunes of glory" for something worth making, that has something to say.<br /><br />unlike the foregoing, straightheads is, alas, an altogether hateful waste of celluloid.
