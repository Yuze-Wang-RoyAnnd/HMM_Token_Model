1st watched 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10(dir-michael almereyda): weird story about a druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. at least i think that was the relationship. a kind of eerie quality is held throughout this film not unlike stephen king's the shining. the difference is that there was campiness in nicholson's performance that isn't at all in this film. this is all taken very seriously until near the end when some lame one-liners and attempts at litening up the mood don't work at all. the performances are not the problem here, but the story is. everything doesn't seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film. there is a very small throwaway performance by christopher walken as the uncle of the granddaughter which, of course, gives him top-billing in an attempt to sell the film. don't buy into this gimmick and avoid this film.<br /><br />
