the slackers as titled in this movie are three college friends dave, jeff and sam(devon sawa, michael maronna and jason segel respectively), who are about to graduate from university without sitting through an honest exam but making it end successfully. this continues until the very end when unlikeable but the most likable character of the movie nathan(schwartzman) figures out what they are up to. nathan starts blackmailing in order to make up with his dream girl as he cant pursue that in normal conditions. the only problem is when the trio starts to work on it, dave falls in love with the gorgeous and good hearted angela(james king) unfortunately, not a brilliant genre movie. schwartzman makes to watch the movie easy as his performance is brilliant. king's performance is average, i think she was hired just to be around with her gorgeous look. the slackers is reminiscent of american pie with a different direction. jokes are as shallow as in american pie. but aren't they all used? i think this movie is a warning to the filmmakers of the genre that they are running out of originality. overall, a few smiley moments but a horrible movie in terms of acting(except for schwartzman) and subject. * out of *****
