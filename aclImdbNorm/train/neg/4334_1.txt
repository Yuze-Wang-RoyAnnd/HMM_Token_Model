this movie had potential and i was willing to give it a try but there are so many timeline problems that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow being treated like such an idiot.<br /><br />rise to power is set in the late sixties. carlito's way is set in the mid to late seventies. for this movie to be realistic, it would have to be set in the fifties, if not the late forties.<br /><br />rise to power has no sign of gail (pennelope ann miller), no sign of kleinfeld, no sign of rolando that carlito supposedly ran with in his "hey-day". none of the primary characters in the original film were in this movie. we're supposed to believe that carlito met all these people in the span of a few years.<br /><br />rise to power ends with carlito walking down the beach talking about retiring in paradise which is what he wanted to do in the original film. also, the pre-quel creates the rocco and earl characters - what's supposed to happen with them since they are clearly not in carlito's way? it's also hard to understand how carlito could have the relationship with the italians he has in the original film watching the events of rise to power. where are the taglialucci's in this film? there is probably seven years between the two films and he spends five of them in prison. it's like trying to put a square plug into a round hole.<br /><br />it is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making some bucks by making an average gangster film and throwing a character called carlito brigante into the story. the film had some good moments but i think they would have been better off leaving this movie to stand by itself instead of trying to make it a prequel to carlito's way.<br /><br />if you feel determined to see this movie, the only advice i can give is to not think of the movie as a linear pre-quel. think of it like the spaghetti westerns with clint eastwood's man with no name, in other words two movies that have the same character but aren't necessarily connected with each other.
