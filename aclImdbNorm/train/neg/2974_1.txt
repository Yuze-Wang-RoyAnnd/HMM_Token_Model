i'm a nice guy, and i like to think of myself as genre-tolerant. and, i guess by that, i mean i try to consider a movie in the context of the genre that it resides in. if nothing else, that saves me from feeling like i should be saying really nasty things about people or films, which i don't like doing.<br /><br />the plot in this one was patently obvious, the production values very low and sets, uhm, simplistic. the acting rose into "good for a high school play" territory from time to time. my feeling was this was filmed in a day -- please tell me it was.<br /><br />worst of all, the sex , while reasonably plentiful, was fairly mundane, hampered by, at least in my copy, a "sound-over" that was inconsistent with the action (climatic moans and shrieks while lying on a bed undoing a bra???). there was definitely no "edge" to it at all--nothing distinguishing or interesting, and with surprisingly quick cuts.<br /><br />my vote is a "1" then, with the following summary statement: would have been better if the filler stripper material at the club was expanded, and the rest of the movie condensed.
