this movie is a total dog. i found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so i wouldn't feel like i'd totally wasted my money--and my time. the writing in this film is absolutely terrible. it's a shame it's not up to the standards of other hale storm movies.<br /><br />they should have saved the money on getting d-list actors like fred willard and gary coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right. even gary coleman wasn't properly utilized for his role.<br /><br />this movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was--including the subplots. after viewing this movie, i'm left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of napolean dynamite-like humor, where it's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery. unfortunately, this movie fails to deliver the lines, the characters, the delivery or the humor. i should have gone to the dentist instead!
