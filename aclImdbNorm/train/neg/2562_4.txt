let me start out by saying this movie has 1 funny point at the very beginning with the exchange between the narrator and george: narrator:huh? wait a minute! who the heck are you? george: me new george. studio too cheap to pay brendan fraser. narrator: how did you get the part? george: new george just lucky, i guess. <br /><br />sadly, that's the only funny part in the entire movie.<br /><br />it was still entertaining...but then again, i'm easily entertained...<br /><br />i wouldn't say this is the worst movie i've ever seen (that title goes to the terribly un-funny disaster movie...), this movie falls #7 on my bottom 15 list...<br /><br />if your a small child who is easily entertained, you'll enjoy this movie. if you're a movie-watcher who wants a good, funny movie, you'll end up shooting yourself halfway through this one..
