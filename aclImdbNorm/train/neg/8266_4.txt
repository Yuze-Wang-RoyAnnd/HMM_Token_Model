what the *bliep* is it with this movie? couldn't they fiend a better script? all in all a 'nice' movie, but... it has been done more than once... up till the end i thought it was okay, but... the going back to the past part... *barf* so corny... was waiting for the fairy god mother to appear... but wow, that didn't happen... which is good.<br /><br />i loved big with tom hanks, but to see such a movie in a new form with another kid who wished that he/she is older/bigger; that just is so pas'e<br /><br />just watch till it comes out on tv. don't get me wrong, but it ain't all that
