<br /><br />one would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role, to be a funny movie. this is not the case here. i laughed out loud once throughout the whole movie, and that wasn't even during the final comedy-scene (which one would also expect to be the funniest). this is one you can watch when it comes to tv, don't spend any other money renting it.
