okay, i remember watching the first one, and boy did it suck. after watching it, i just laughed it off and told myself, "oh boy, just another low budget b-movie. i'll never see a part 2 to this one." then, about 1 1/2 years later, there came part two. it sucked even more. but, i just laughed it off again and said, "there's no way i'm ever gonna see a part 3 to this one." then, about 1/2 a year later, part 3 came out. i was stupid enough to rent it and boy, i just snapped after watching it. god, i never actually realized how much movies can suck these days. just save yourself $7.50 and don't rent the whole series. trust me, it's worth every penny.
