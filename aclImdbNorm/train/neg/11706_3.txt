a novel by remarque. a cast that looks great on paper. a left-wing refugee struggling to remain in paris between the wars. a gestapo officer undercover.<br /><br />it's a pity there's no synergy here. the bits and pieces never coalesce.<br /><br />stories about left-wing refugees in france don't have to be this dull. read arthur koestler's memoir "scum of the earth" (if you can find it). or his chilling "dialogue with death" (ditto).<br /><br />to me, the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details.<br /><br />the leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados, the norman apple brandy. i welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself. it certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly. but, according to the film, it's only sold in cheap, low-class saloons. vive le tabac parisien! that's what i say. references to intoxicating liquors do abound here; that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenarists.<br /><br />i enjoy films set in france because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable full-size alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background. i wasn't disappointed. this time it was for byrrh, a very unusual choice. this film would rate a 10 if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze murals.<br /><br />the film's indifferent score is by louis gruenberg. gruenberg is best known -- if you can call it that -- for his opera "the emperor jones", based on the o'neill play. it premi`ered at roughly the same time as the film version starring paul robeson. the opera survives today in a recording or two by lawrence tibbett. it should surface again soon though; they're running out of potentially marketable operas to revive.<br /><br />opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since charles boyer's character operates under his "czech" aliases. two of them are "wozzeck" and "gunther", both prominent roles in german opera. is that just coincidence?<br /><br />name-dropping just seems to be part of this film. notice that they call up "himmelstoss" on the phone. himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in remarque's earlier "all quiet on the western front".<br /><br />well, the in-jokes are all in place; guess there wasn't time to develop any drama.
