<br /><br />what is left of planet earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. they must eat bugs and insects, or whatever, after a poison war, or something, has nearly wiped out all human civilization. in these dark times, one of the few people on earth still able to live in comfort, we will call him the all knowing big boss, has a great quest to prevent some secret spore seeds from being released into the air. it seems that the all knowing big boss is the last person on earth that knows that these spores even exist. the spores are located far away from any living soul, and they are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. <br /><br />the all knowing big boss wants the secret spores to remain in their secret protected containers. so, he makes a plan to send in a macho action team to remove the spore containers from all of the protective systems and secret location. sending people to the location of secret spores makes them no longer a secret. sending people to disable all of the protective systems makes it possible for the spores to be easily released into the air. how about letting sleeping dogs lie?! <br /><br />the one pleasant feature of encrypt is the radiant and elegant vivian wu. as the unremarkable macho action team members drop off with mechanically paced predictable timing, engaging vivian wu's charm makes acceptable the plot idea of her old employer wanting her so much. she is an object of love, an object of desire -- a very believable concept!<br /><br />fans of vivian wu may want to check out an outstanding b-movie she is in from a couple years back called dinner rush. dinner rush is highly recommended. encrypt is not.
