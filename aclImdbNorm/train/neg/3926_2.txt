this italian movie is basically a soap opera with skin.<br /><br />the vhs box said it was rated "r" but the into on the actual tape inside said it was "x." the latter makes a lot more sense because there is a short scene near the end that was shocking. even in the dark, you could see dutch actress marishcka detmers performing all sex on this guy - and, yes, you could see his penis in her mouth. i read somewhere that this was the first time where a "mainline actress" had done something like this on screen.<br /><br />detmers parades around in the nude on several scenes but her face was even better than her body. she looked beautiful. unfortunately, the movie is ugly....a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite detmers' looks.
