"the fallen ones" falls under the waste of life (wol) category. i am sad that i am now two hours older was not entertained. my other family members also watched this movie and threw demeaning comments at the screen and rooted for the mummy. i felt sorry for the actors (wagner). i have read other negative reviews and cannot add anything else to this movie other than it could be reduced to 25 minutes so it could take a 30 minute slot on tv without any loss of plot. it reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients but when served is bland with no flavor at all. in my humble opinion, the 42 foot mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing him with several people who want to denigh the facts and want dna samples for evil reasons. the heroes are discredited and tossed on there ear by their colleges. later after everything was screwed up by the evil people. the heroes would save the day and prove everyone wrong.
