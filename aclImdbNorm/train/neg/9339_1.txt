i thought they should have called this movie "whites" instead of "heights". godawful...the kind of film that makes people hate new yorkers. people who are so self obsessed and think their lives are so important...give me a break. such a lily white cast that glenn close was the most ethnic character in it, this film was crying out for someone real to come in and steal it...and so they introduce, get this, a character even whiter than the rest of the cast (i thought he was an albino at first)who's supposed to be welsh!i'm still trying to decipher that accent! intellectually dishonest...this movie is the kind of film that's able to fool so many people into thinking it's worthwhile because it has the trappings of something more ambitious. better to fill the theaters with mi5-10 than with this pretentious crap...must have been a better play because you can't fall off the floor.
