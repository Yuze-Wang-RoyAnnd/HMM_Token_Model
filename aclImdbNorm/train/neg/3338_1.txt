it took 9 years to complete this film. i would think that within those 9 years someone would have said,hey, this film is terrible. i've seen better acting in porn movies. the story is tired and played. abused child turns into serial killer. how about something new for a change. how about abused child turns into a florist? at least that would have been a new twist. why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea (especially unoriginal movie ideas) thinks that they can be a director? i do admire the fact that they stuck with this film for 9 years to get it completed. that shows tenacity and spirit. with this kind of drive hopefully next time they can focus it on a better script. if you want to see a failed experiment in indie film making from a writer/director from michigan see hatred of a minute. if you want a good movie from a michigan writer/director stick with evil dead.
