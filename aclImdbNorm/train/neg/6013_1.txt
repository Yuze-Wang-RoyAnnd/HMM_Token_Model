i've read every book to date in the left behind series, and the movie hardly does any of them justice. sure, i've seen worse movies, but this was incredibly disappointing. this movie would have made a good mst3k episode. the script was a horrible adaptation of the book, and it felt like the actors were reading their lines, instead of actually saying them. the characters were stiff and unlikeable. the effects were cheesy, and looked terribly fake. the ending was awful. first of all, it didn't even go all the way through the first book. second, it made no sense. if you hadn't read the book, you'd have no idea what was going on. it had to have been the most cheesy, film student-like ending i've ever seen in a movie. i'm upset that i actually paid money for this movie. if by some miracle, it does get wide release, they ought to totally overhaul it and let hollywood take over. those two wannabe film producers, and the wannabe director should leave movie making to the professionals.
