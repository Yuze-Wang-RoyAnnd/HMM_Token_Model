i will stat of with the plot alice, having survived the previous instalment of the nightmare series, finds the deadly dreams of freddy krueger starting once again. this time, the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of alice's unborn child. his intention is to be "born again" into the real world. the only one who can stop freddy is his dead mother, but can alice free her spirit in time to save her own son? this movie did start of really well as we see alice dreaming of being amanda kruger who get stuck in room and get raped by 100 manics then she being rushed to hospital but then she not longer the pregnant lady but then she amanda giving birth to freddy again.<br /><br />alice and dan are the only two people to return from the 4th movie and then have gotten some new friends its' no long before freddy start to kill again, i did like the first dead it okay, not as good as the other deaths or dreams.<br /><br />freddy himself didn't seem to be scary in this movie at all, the nightmare were just boring really they were not scary or creepy at all.<br /><br />acting in movies was okay for a 5th movie in the series but overall i think this movie was really dull. (still not worst movie of the series, freddy dead is the worst)<br /><br />4/10
