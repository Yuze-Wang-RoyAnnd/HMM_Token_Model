this film might have weak production values, but that is also what makes it so good. the special effects are gross out and well done. my favorite part of the movie had to be chrissy played by janelle brady. she is super hot and also has a good nude scene. robert prichard as the leader of the gang is hilarious, as are the other members. this film is actually trying to make a point, by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad. 4/10 fair comedy, gross out film.
