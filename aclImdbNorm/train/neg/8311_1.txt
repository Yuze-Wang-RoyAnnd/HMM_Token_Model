what this movie fails from answering is how wrong this war is (and most us wars recently made only to get some oil).<br /><br />how many innocent civilian casualties there has been, how many lives perished and how blatantly stupid the perpetrators are.<br /><br />so, let me ask you - if american soldier kills women and children apart from enemy, its ok, but if government accidentally kills their own forces by deadly chemicals while killing many civilians as well, it is not? your logic fails, gentleman.<br /><br />i'll give it 5 for the solid performance and 1 to everything else, 3 in total.
