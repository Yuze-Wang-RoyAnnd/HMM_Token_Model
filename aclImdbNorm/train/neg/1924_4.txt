dr. seuss' how the grinch stole christmas / (2000) ** (out of four)<br /><br />if you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional dr. seuss classic fable, don't see "dr. seuss' how the grinch stole christmas." if you are old enough to read this review, then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture. it contains lots of colors, creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction, joyous load noises, and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village whoville. unfortunately that is where the movie's positive elements end; the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for jim carrey to cackle on screen while giving a devilish grin, all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to do.<br /><br />many people recognize the story of how the grinch stole christmas from whoville, so i will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read. however, i will say that the movie's story is executed in three major acts; the development of the grinch and setting, the whoville festival, and the dr. seuss vision of the mean one robbing the who's from their christmas. there are many familiar names within the credits here, but no familiar faces. like in "battlefield earth," i just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup and costumes. regardless, there is snl's molly shannon as betty lou, the wife of bill irwin, the later playing lou lou, the father of little cindy lou, played by taylor momsen. jeffrey tambor is the whoville mayor, anthony hopkins lends his bellowing voice for the film's narrator, and christine baranski is the grinch's lone lost lover.<br /><br />the filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little cindy lou. the screenplay by jeffrey price and peter s. seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape; there is little if any focus by director ron howard and the screenplay is predictable, too extensive, and contrived. the only character given any distinctions here is the grinch himself, all of the other characters are puppets of the plot, shapeless and uninteresting. and the dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic. example-grinch: oh, the who-manity!<br /><br />the movie's redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer michael corenblith, the costume designer rita ryack, and the ample makeup department. "how the grinch stole christmas" is a very good-looking production. the sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative; it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream. the people of whoville are plastered with makeup, to the point in which we cannot tell the actor reciting the humorless lines. although dazzling, i really can't give credit to the performances, for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their place.<br /><br />jim carrey is one actor who i can talk about. his performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself he is way too egotistic as the grinch, too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of seuss. surprisingly, although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences, no laughs come from jim carry's zany silliness. it is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for carry to overplay his part. this factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy, which is only a pale shadow of the original christmas classic "how the grinch stole christmas."<br /><br />after this movie, historians should check the coffin of the late author, dr. seuss may have rolled over in his grave.<br /><br />
