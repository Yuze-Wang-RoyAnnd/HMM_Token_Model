ok. not bad movie making if it were from an original script. but it is not!<br /><br />which part of "in this story there are no women, except for foulata and gagoola" introduction by haggard did the producers, directors and writers not understand? i mean, it is pretty plain english. i understood it at age 10!. the beauty of ksm is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds, the colonial africa, the unforgiving desert and kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. that should be more than enough for even the most mediocre of producers to work with. but, nooo, they have to throw "romance" into it. pathetic. suggestion to all you poor souls who actually thought this would be close to the book. give it up. until a peter jackson wannabe comes along and "does it right" you may as well keep re-reading the tome. btw, there is a sequel book (actually a pre-quel) called allan's wife. it gives background to the story of quatermain. it is a bit creepy but good.
