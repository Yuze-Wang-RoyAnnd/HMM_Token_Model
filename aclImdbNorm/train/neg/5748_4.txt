i have to say i hated this movie. i don't like to say that because gerard butler is in it. about a half an hour of boring conversation, sorry to all who actually care about the plot, i started fast-forwarding to gerry's scenes. i really don't know the ending, i was that bored with it. if gerry wasn't in it, i probably either done one of two things: fell asleep or turned it off, but gerry is the bright light of this movie, as he is with most of his earlier movies. if you're a fan of gerry's don't worry, he's as adorable and precious as he always is, but if you actually want to watch the movie for the plot, good luck because you'll need it, either that or lots of coffee or soda to keep you awake! <br /><br />4/10...and that's just because the casting director had the sense to put gerry in this movie, even though they had no idea of how to spell his name!
