'thunderbirds' was an immensely popular sixties show that has transcended the years and generations to the point it is still as popular now, with both adults and children alike, as it was in its heyday. so, one would deduce the chance to produce a live-action feature film with a million pound hollywood budget was an excellent opportunity to revive the series as has been done with 'spider-man' and 'the x-men'. but a terrible storyline and bland acting obliterated this opportunity and it was soon apparent all that was destined for this film was a trip to the bargain bin of the kiddies' section.<br /><br />instead of a film focusing on the five tracey sons, their father and trusty geek brain striving to rescue people and protect the world from villains, our hero in this drudge is a malcontent and bratty thirteen-year-old alan tracey, fourteen-year-old tin-tin and ten-year-old brain-box fermat, son of brains (yes, brains' son despite this being a man who could surely never score a woman if he tried; maybe he grew the kid in a petri dish). as one can tell from a run-through of our three lead characters, this 2004 remake 'thunderbirds' was clearly aimed at entertaining only children under twelve instead of trying to appeal to a broad age-range as those involved in the much superior revival of 'spider-man' did. the plot itself was so bland with clunky, awkward dialogue and weak jokes that probably wouldn't amuse brighter pre-teens. the scriptwriter seemed more interested in ripping off 'spy kids' (which was at least quirky and original) instead of remaking the show people know and love.<br /><br />although sophia myles and ron cook were excellent as miss penelope and parker, they only had about three lines between them so their presence was barely felt. bill paxton's jeff tracey was just boring and there was only the slightest of mention of the other four tracey boys while anthony edwards and ben kingsley, as brains and the hood respectively, were just embarrassing. the hood, in particular, is not at all threatening or sinister and instead comes across as a campy, two-bit stereotypical villain as limp as a piece of rotting lettuce.<br /><br />brady corbet, who plays alan tracey, may well be a good young actor but it was hard to see that in a film where he plays a whinging brat who just grates and the same goes for vanessa anne hutchinson as tin-tin since the most she gets to do is look pretty and be all for 'girl power'. ironically, it is young soren fulton's fermat who is the only interesting character of the film as fulton delivers a natural and relaxed performance.<br /><br />'thunderbirds' the series will be forever remembered as an excellent show that proves puppets can give solid performances! 'thunderbirds' the film will be forgotten by most and remembered by a few as one big flop.
