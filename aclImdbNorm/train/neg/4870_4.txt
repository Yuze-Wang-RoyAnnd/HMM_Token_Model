the movie is bad. nothing special - just a "kid" movie with no serious thing in it. there is though one reason to watch this for: the animal talk. some of them are so funny in what they say, you just can't stop laughing. so if you want to hear a dog in the dog pound saying "i'm keyser soze", or another animal saying "you're a dead cat walking", or many other funny one liners, see it. cause there's no other good movie to watch it. vote: 4 out of 10.
