interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event, even though he did save many other captive children. the film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen patrolling the hallways, bathrooms and even class rooms. in other words, the high school is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal. dolph lundgren,(sam decker) plays the soldier/school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field. however, the principal asks him to have a detention class as his last duty as a teacher. it is at this point in the film when all hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete bomb. try to enjoy it, if you decided to view it !
