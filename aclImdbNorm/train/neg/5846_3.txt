yes, this is one of those movies, so terrible, so insipid, so trite, that you will not be able to stop laughing. i have watched comedies, good comedies, and laughed less than my wife and i laughed at this movie. the other comments give the idea well enough. the characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on, the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge, the acting-- oh the acting-- talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses.<br /><br />but the rat, yes, the big rat. why we didn't get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me. often the 'big one' isn't shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money. i surmise, however, that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed up like a woodchuck with third-world dentistry.<br /><br />the most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. after figuring out that the rats couldn't stand loud noise (migraines from the bad acting?), the main dude rigs up a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy. if you've ever wanting to see a pair of rats waltz while blood squirts out of their heads like a geyser, this film is for you. really, you need to rent it and see for yourself.<br /><br />but not for more than 99c, ok?
