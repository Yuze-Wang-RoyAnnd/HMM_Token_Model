is there anything that happens in this movie that is not predictable? i think not. basically the movie is clich'e after clich'e and really nothing ever comes as a surprise. it makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension. so for a thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also as a drama it's a failure. this is because the movie its story is highly unlikely. i mean, no way this could ever happen in real life, as in the same way as the events occur in this movie. so the movie has a real suspense and credibility problem.<br /><br />but it truly are the clich'es that killed the movie. it was cringing stuff at times. everything is so formulaic in this movie. the predator is portrayed as a cool heartless, almost psychopath like sexual frustrated boy and the victim as a naive young woman, who acts like she didn't see any of this coming. everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and all seemed to happen for a reason. such as the sequence in which the 'predator' fixes the 'victims' broken car. that has got to be one of the oldest clich'es out of the book. i knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point. i tried to look as if the teacher and the student were really growing toward each other trough the eyes of the other persons around them. it was so incredibly obvious and cheap that i almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point. the movie is filled with moments like these.<br /><br />the title might suggest that this is a cheap porn movie but this in fact is a sappy made for tv movie. which means that everything is slowly happening and the movie spends halve its time on character development and unnecessary sub-plots to make the movie even more drama like.<br /><br />i'll admit that elizabeth berkley is pretty good acting in this movie. she makes some of the clich'es and events look even almost realistic at times. her hollywood career is as good as over after appearing in the paul verhoeven movie "showgirls", so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies- and television series like this one. it's a waste of her talent and she surely deserves better. all of the other characters are a disappointment. corey sevier plays the clich'e pretty 'untouchable' rich boy and the way the husband of the main character is portrayed is even worse. he looks more like a sexual frustrated predator than the true predator of the movie. he basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence. he wakes up, he wants sex. before he goes to sleep, he wants sex. he gets home, he wants sex. it might be a realistic thing but i don't know, it just didn't feel right for a movie like this one and the story in general.<br /><br />a clich'e filled movie and i can't think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie. it's predictable and therefor also lacks in suspense and credibility. not an 'horrible' movie and it certainly is a watchable one at times but all the weak and clich'e elements in the movie also make this far from a recommendable one.<br /><br />4/10
