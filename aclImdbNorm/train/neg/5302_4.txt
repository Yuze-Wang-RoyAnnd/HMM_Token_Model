dewaana as a film goes through the usual clich'es. man and woman fall in love and marry, husband is supposedly killed by a family friend who wants their family fortune, woman remarries and surprise surprise husband no.1 reappears. the movie is reminiscent of yash chopra's chandni and countless others. divya bharti and shah rukh khan give good performances. amrish puri as a villain goes through the motions and is nothing more than a standard bollywood villain the music by nadeem shravan is superb, all the songs were brilliant. my favourites are sochenge tumhe pyar or koyi na koyi chahiyye. dewanna is an ordinary movie that goes through the motions.
