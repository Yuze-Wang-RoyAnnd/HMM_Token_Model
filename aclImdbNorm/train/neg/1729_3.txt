... and how they bore you right out of your mind! the crater lake monster is one of the classic bad films from the 70's made with no actors of any note, an embarrassing script, woeful direction, and a tireless desire to fuse "horror" with light comedy. this movie introduces a paleontologist who finds drawings of an aquatic dinosaur underneath crater lake...a meteor falls from the sky, and an aquatic dinosaur of the claymation variety begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants surrounding crater lake. the whole matter is taken care of by steve our local sheriff. much of the film - when not showing pools of blood left behind from what we imagine must have been the beast dining - is spent following the bumbling antic of two guys named arnie and mitch who run a boat rental place. they try so bad to be funny, that we get lines like, looking at a business sign, mitch saying to arnie "you spelled bait wrong, it's spelled b-a-t-e." the laughs were rather scarce here. we then see them get drunk together and imagine a tree trunk to be the dinosaur. laurel and hardy watch out! the dinosaur looks fake, but the movie is fun in a bad way. and at the very least, the lake is beautiful.
