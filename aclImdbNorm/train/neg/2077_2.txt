needed an excuse to get out of the house while paint dried - left the movie after an hour to return and watch the paint dry.<br /><br />i don't recall ever walking out on a movie before, but i really tried to stay. the script was not up to the cast and just kept "going and going" badly - come on! uma thurman doing this stuff? fairly lame special effects. these were older characters and actors doing superficial horny 20-something lives - just sort of annoying and wrong feeling.<br /><br />this review is base only on the first hour - it might have gotten better. i just had to get home and see if the paint dried a darker shade than when it went on.
