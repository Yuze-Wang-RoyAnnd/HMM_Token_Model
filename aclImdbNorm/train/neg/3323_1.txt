i've been watching a lot of cartoon or animated movies because i have a baby girl who likes to watch tv. i began to watch this movie to see if i would like my little one to watch it... and no. at the beginning i thought it was such a cute movie like the bambi movie, but all the way it was like insinuating the ducky was a homosexual. the info said that they were making fun of him because he wasn't good at sports, but that was not the case. it just seems like a movie made for kids to learn to be okay being gay. it was also very sad, as far as the ducky's dad and all. i don't know, i guess if you're gay you'd like it, but i don't think i'm going to watch it again with my little one.
