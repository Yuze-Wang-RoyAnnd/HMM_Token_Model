i really wanted to like this western, being a fan of the genre and a fan of "buffalo bill," "wild bill hickok," and "calamity jane," all of whom are in this story! add to the mix gary cooper as the lead actor, and it sounded great. <br /><br />the trouble was.....it wasn't. i found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes into this, being bored to death. jean arthur's character was somewhat annoying and james ellison just did not look like nor act like "buffalo bill." cooper wasn't at his best, either, sounding too wooden. this was several years before he hit his prime as an actor.<br /><br />in a nutshell, his western shot blanks. head up the pass and watch another oater because most of 'em were far better than this one.
