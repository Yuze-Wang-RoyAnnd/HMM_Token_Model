yes i have rated this film as one star awful. yet, it will be in my rotation of christmas movies henceforth. this truly is so bad it's good. this is another k.gordon murray production (read: buys a really cheap/bad mexican movie, spends zero money getting it dubbed into english and releases it at kiddie matin'ees in the mid 1960's.) it's a shame i stumbled on this so late in life as i'm sure some "mood enhancers" would make this an even better experience. i'm not going to rehash what so many of the other reviewers have already said, a christmas movie with merlin, the devil, mechanical wind-up reindeer and some of the most pathetic child actors i have ever seen bar none. i plan on running this over the holidays back to back with kelsey grammar's "a christmas carol". truly a holiday experience made in hell. now if i can only find "to all a goodnight (aka slayride)" on dvd i'll have a triple feature that can't be beat. you have to see this movie. it moves so slowly that i defy you not to touch the fast forward button-especially on the two dance routines! this thing reeks like an expensive bleu cheese-guess you have to get past the stink to enjoy the experience. feliz navidad amigos!
