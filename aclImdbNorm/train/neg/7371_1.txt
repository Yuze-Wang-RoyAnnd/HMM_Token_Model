steven seagal....how could you be a part of such an awful film? i rented this movie because your movies usually have been pretty clean. i have lost a lot of respect for you being in an awful movie such as this one. very, very poor taste! i am embarrassed that i even rented this movie. steven, if you keep acting in movies like this one, i believe that your career is over. my husband and i have enjoyed watching many of your movies because you always can "get the bad guy" with a few hand maneuvers and make it clean...and also the language is pretty clean in your movies...but this one is something else. i will think twice before i rent another movie of yours.
