this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen. jessica simpson not only lacks any acting skill, but the script is incredibly shallow and lame. you actually hear serious dialogue that goes, "i love you more." "no, i love you more." i stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, i couldn't take it anymore. her "southern girl charm" just doesn't work and is really quite annoying; her attempts at slapstick humor fall flat and she delivers lines like she is reading the script right off the page.<br /><br />poor luke wilson. did he not read the script before agreeing to do this, or did he fall for papa joe's (jessica's dad and also the producer of the movie) promise of big profits? hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another movie like this. luke wilson is actually a good actor - i hate seeing the pained look on his face as he suffers through the bad dialogue.<br /><br />also, i think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or hired by papa joe to give the movie a better rating. no one in their right mind would actually find this movie engaging.<br /><br />jessica has lots of money, right? maybe buy some acting lessons?
