this was an awful movie! not for the subject matter, but for the delivery. i went with my girlfriend at the time (when the movie came out), expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression. what we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression, with no uplift at the end. the previews and ads made no mention of this! plus, for all that they played up whoopi goldberg, my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! again, the previews say nothing about this! (not that you would expect that, but it's just more of the problem). if i had known how depressing this movie would be, i would've never have seen it. or at least, i would've been prepared for it. this was a bait and switch ad campaign, and i will never see this movie again!
