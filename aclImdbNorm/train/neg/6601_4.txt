i can see why laurel and hardy purists might be offended by this rather gentle 're-enactment', but this film would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures of classic l & h. bronson pinchot and gailard sartain acquit themselves reasonably as the comedy duo and there's a reasonably good supporting cast. i enjoyed it.
