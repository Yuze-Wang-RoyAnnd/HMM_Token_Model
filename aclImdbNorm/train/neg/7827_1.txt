first, let me just comment on what i liked about the movie. the special effects were fantastic, and very rarely did i feel like i was watching a video game. there, that is the last nice thing i have to say about this film. in fact, i would just like everyone reading this to take note that i can't even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing. <br /><br />i have innumerable complaints about the film, but four major complaints jump to mind. my first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the "plot twist" (if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away) where lois's 5 year-old son turns out to be the super-powered child of superman. when the crying super-child throws a piano at lex's henchman to save his mother, i almost got up and left the theater. singer could have made a much better superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently super-powered illegitimate child. it's been 5 days since i saw the movie and i still want to vomit. <br /><br />my next major complaint has to do with the fact that superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space. it doesn't take comic book guy from the simpsons to point out what's wrong with that. i don't know how many comic books brian singer has read, but when superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any superman-related projects ever again. the concept is as ridiculous as making a dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun. why not just have superman eat kryptonite? he can eat it and then brush his teeth with it, and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. that's not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re-entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground. <br /><br />my third major complaint has to do with the fact that singer slaps movie-goers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie. i have to take issue with his characterization of superman as the only son of a god-like jor-el sent to earth to be a savior. jor-el wasn't all-wise, he was just a scientist. and he didn't send his son to earth to be a savior, he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode. i'll buy the christ allegory if brian singer can show me the part in the bible where god sends christ to earth because heaven was about to explode, and then radioactive pieces of heaven become christ's primary weakness. furthermore, the "crucifixion" scene where luthor stabs superman in the side with a kryptonite "spear" just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until i'm too brain-dead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future. they might as well rename this movie "superman returns: the passion of the christ."<br /><br />and speaking of luthor, my last major complaint has to do with singer's depiction of lex luthor. lex luthor is a shrewd, cold-hearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for president (which he does in the comics) than try to destroy the world. the man wants money and power; he wants to be in charge, not wreck everything. yet the luthor we see superman returns, as well as all the previous superman movies, is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world. if singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the (quite awful) previous superman movies, this film might not be such an unbearable travesty. maybe singer's next project can be a batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of batman from 1960s tv show. zam! whap! pow!!<br /><br />to summarize, i don't know what i hate more, the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews. everyone is entitled to their opinion, but if you don't hate this movie then your opinion is wrong. i sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you haven't already. don't see it, don't buy it when it comes out on dvd, don't rent it...basically don't contribute any money towards it in any way. this movie does not deserve to make any money. in fact, i think that for every person that sees this movie, bryan singer should be fined 45 billion dollars. if you're a superman fan and you really want to see this movie, just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you'll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time.
