so far after week two of "the lone of beauty" i am a little disappointed.<br /><br />some of the acting is good, as long as we except that it is only drama.<br /><br />i am unsure how people can feel that this fictional drama is "factual" coverage of the "thatcher" years - it is okay as drama, but i feel the award winning book is still much better.<br /><br />i wonder if the bbc will ever give us the follow up and the next part of the drama and the years that follow with "things can only get better" finishing with 2006 and the fact that we are still waiting! with that promise from a government that is full of sleaze.
