i was not expecting much going in to this, but still came away disappointed. this was my least favorite halestorm production i have seen. i thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but i only snickered at 3 or 4 jokes. is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over? what was up with the janitor in heaven scene? fred willard has been hilarious with some of his christopher guest collaborations, but this did not work. they must have spent all the budget on getting "known" actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget. it looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark. does it really take that much film to show someone actually shoot and make a basket, as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball swishing through a basket? i try not to be too critical of low budget comedies, but if you want to see something funny go to a real church basketball game instead of this movie.
