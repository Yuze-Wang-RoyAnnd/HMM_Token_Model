seriously, why do american and frech actors pretending to be czechs need to speak perfect english with a fake russian accent? i am a man, so i enjoyed the gratuitous nudity--but a soft porn flick would have more of that, and at least wouldn't pretend it's artistic.<br /><br />all the political statements where painfully didactic- has the director heard of subtlety? the acting was also woody and melodramatic, and the comic relief was never funny. the characters were very shallow, and i just couldn't identify with them at all.<br /><br />the bit where i did laugh was when they cut the actors into archival footage of the demonstrations in prague - and they were black and white and then sepia to match the footage-just ludicrous.<br /><br />i read many of kundera's short stories (not the unbearable lightness of being), and there are good things about his style of writing (although his themes are one big male fantasy)-and i have to say, the film did not convey any of the goodness of kunderas style.
