saw it at ucsb's reel loud festival and was *shocked* that it won the golden reel award. i wasn't the only one, considering the audience had mixed reactions to the piece. i thought there were many other better flicks out there, but then i learned that the judges were heavily rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy crap. while the cinematography and editing are on par with many other shorts out there, the storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece. seems as though "serious" student films need to include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle, and eventual suicide -- nick and kate cops out and includes all three. please, be more original!<br /><br />oh, and it might be my outsider's opinion, but the guy from montecito sounds a little fake. does anyone else thing so?
