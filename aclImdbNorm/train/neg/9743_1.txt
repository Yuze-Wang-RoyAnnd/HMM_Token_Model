with that line starts one silly, boring british sci fi film. the great vorelli from the movie "devil doll" builds a teleportation machine only to have his funding cut off by blanchard, a bearded man who has a thing for bow ties and men with large eye brows. when his experiment fails, the good doctor learns that lembach, the man who controls all of the grants in the world, will be staying in london for a few days. he attempts to project himself into the house of blanchard with the help of his comely lab assistant, sheila. needless to say something goes wrong and he winds up looking like a rat. the rest of the movie is devoted to the good orange haired doctor walking around london shocking people with his mutated hand and wearing a diaper on his face. there are some more killings, some modest paper work, and finally, the doctor vanishes to where ever rat faced doctors go. thankfully no one decided to make a sequel.
