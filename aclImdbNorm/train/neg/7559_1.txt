this has got to be one of the worst fillums i've ever seen and i've seen a few. it is slow, boring, amateurish - not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot. the actors do not act. i can't blame them - they have been given a script of such utter banality all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes which has nothing to do with the evil goings on in summersisle.<br /><br />there is not one moment in this film that rings true - not an honest line nor a single instant where one is moved. the nicholas cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations. i have no doubt that i was seeing a suffering man up there but it was nicholas cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career.
