bad movie for sure. it's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects, a lot of hasty scenes (the airport one for example), and a real unfunny time. (charles dance) is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in (last action hero). (eddie murphy) is doing a non-comic joking, and i heard that this sunk had already succeed, big time success??!! i'll never understand why or how ?! in one tv interview i've heard (eddie murphy) himself, when he was nominated for an oscar 2007, regretted it in a comic way !! <br /><br />one of the comments said (hey...it's the 1980s !). well, no my friend. it's the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of razzie movies all over the years whether it's the 1980s or the 1950s ! <br /><br />there are 2 reasons made me write about this movie. the first is that i'll never forget the long tan fascinating legs of (charlotte lewis) especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house, wearing just a blue shirt and oh boy the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be. but how odd ! as i've watched her in following movies and she wasn't that beautiful again ?!! anyhow the second reason is that i've found this movie's title lately at my list of the worst 100 movies ever!<br /><br />the bottom line: bad movie, greeeeeat legs.
