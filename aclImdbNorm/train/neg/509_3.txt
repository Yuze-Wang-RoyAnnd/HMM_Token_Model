this film is about british prisoners of war from the world war ii escaping from a camp in germany.<br /><br />i find "the wooden horse" disappointingly boring. the subject could have been thrilling, suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled, but "the wooden horse" is told in a very plain way. it's a collection of plain and poorly told events, with no suspension and thrill. the first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so plain, with not enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge. the latter half of the film is even worse, they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase. and could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film! i am disappointed by "the wooden horse", it wasted the potential to be a great film.
