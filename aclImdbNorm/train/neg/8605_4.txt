this is a mildly interesting late 80's gore fest featuring some nasty slugs with a taste for human blood. if you can get past the ridiculousness of the whole thing you might actually get some minor enjoyment out of this. the acting is awful and the plot is simply there to hold the movie together between gory slug attacks, but the movie isn't a complete waste of time. the special effects are actually quite good, and the gore is well done. it reminded me of the remake of the blob, probably because of the sliminess of it all. all in all, you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time, but i wouldn't suggest seeing this movie unless you've got a strong stomach and are into this sort of thing.
