a friend once told me that an art-house independent film ran in a cinema when- upon the closing of the film - audiences were so enraged they preceded to tear up the cinema seats. of course, my imagination ran amok, trying to conjure up the contents of such a piece of work. well,now my imagination can be put to rest.<br /><br />i am a lifelong andrei tarkovky fan and an ardent admirer of his work. i have come across many people who thought tarkovsky's films are slow-moving and inert. opinions being what they are, i found this not to be true of the late director's wonderful works, which are wrought with meaning, beautiful compositions, and complex philosophical questions. upon hearing aleksandr sokurov called the heir to tarkovsky, i was excited to experience his films.<br /><br />with the exception of the open air ride through the fields (stalker), this movie has no kinship to anything tarkovsky has done. it does not seem to possess the slightest meaning, even on a completely mindless level. it's supposedly "gorgeously stark" cinematography is devoid of any compositional craft. there is a no balance, no proportion, and the exposure meter seems to be running low on batteries in the freezing snow. the main character is so inept and indecisive, it makes you wonder whether his father might have been alive if he made up his mind sooner.<br /><br />i am also not adverse to non-plots or story lines that progress on multiple non-linear fashion. but there isn't even a non-story here. one must surely enter the viewing of this film with a shaved head if one were to exit it with nothing gained and nothing lost, as hair-pulling would be the only possible answer to a pace that could make a tarkosky time sculpture look as if jerry bruckheimer had filmed a charlie chaplin short.<br /><br />i won't rule out that this may be one of sokurov's stinkers (tarkovsky's solaris), but to conclude that he is one of tarkovsky's heir-based on this film- would be to call paris hilton the successor to aristotle. c'mon guys, don't be afraid to say it. no amount of big impressive words is going to magically bring this corpse of celluloid back to life. i don't profess to fully understand russian culture and i probably don't have russian values, but i immediately picked up on tarkovsky's work as something magical, a treasure and a gift to viewers.<br /><br />if it didn't have sokurov's name on it, and it aired on say, saturday night live, i'm pretty sure nobody would "read" all these magnificent analysis into this wet noodle of a flick.
