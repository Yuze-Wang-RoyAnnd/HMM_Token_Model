when many people say it's the "worst movie i've ever seen", they tend to say that about virtually any movie they didn't like. however, of the nearly 700 movies i can remember ever seeing this one is one of two that i walked away from feeling personally insulted and angry. this is my first movie review, by the way, and i registered with imdb just to rave at this movie's badness. i went to see it when it was in the theaters (myself and my two buddies were 3 of 5 people there), and after 15 years i can't remember very many specifics, but my attitude upon leaving the theater is still crystal clear.<br /><br />---spoiler alert---<br /><br />oh my, where to begin. fat loser left at altar, goes on ski weekend, meets blonde bombshell who takes an interest in him, takes him home to meet the family, they're all cannibals and he's the main course, pathetic attempt at a dramatic escape, kicks all their butts and runs off with the brother's girlfriend, they live happily ever after. puke. firstly, the gags are so bad that it took me a while to understand that they were trying to be funny, and that this was a comedy. the special effects, what few there are, look like they were done 15 years earlier. the big dramatic ending was so hokey and poorly acted that it was nearly unbearable to watch (he knocks out the entire cannibal family with rakes laying in the lawn, that stand up tom and jerry style when they step on them). i'm sure that there's much, much more, but i have no intention on seeing it again for a refresher.
