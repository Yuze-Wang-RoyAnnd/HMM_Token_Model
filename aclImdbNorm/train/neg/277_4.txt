lillian hellman's play, adapted by dashiell hammett with help from hellman, becomes a curious project to come out of gritty warner bros. paul lukas, reprising his broadway role and winning the best actor oscar, plays an anti-nazi german underground leader fighting the fascists, dragging his american wife and three children all over europe before finding refuge in the states (via the mexico border). they settle in washington with the wife's wealthy mother and brother, though a boarder residing in the manor is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends an awful lot of time down at the german embassy playing poker. it seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus, and when we realize what the heart of the material is (the wise, honest, direct refugees teaching the clueless, head-in-the-sand americans how the world has suddenly changed), it seems a little patronizing--the viewer is quite literally put in the relatives' place, being lectured to. lukas has several speeches in the third-act which undoubtedly won him the academy award, yet for the much of the picture he seems to do little but enter and exit, enter and exit. as his spouse, bette davis enunciates like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage, but the role doesn't allow her much color. their children (all with divergent accents!) are alternately humorous and annoying, and geraldine fitzgerald has a nothing role as a put-upon wife (and the disgruntled texture she brings to the part seems entirely wrong). the intent here was to tastefully, tactfully show us just because a (wwii-era) man may be german, that doesn't make him a nazi sympathizer. we get that in the first few minutes; the rest of this tasteful, tactful movie is made up of exposition, defensive confrontation and, ultimately, compassion. it should be a heady mix, but instead it's rather dry-eyed and inert. ** from ****
