after watching khakee i felt i'll get to watch another good film but sadly the film is a joke and actually trying hard to introduce aryeman afterall his father keshu is the producer<br /><br />rks spoke so highly about the film during promotions, saying the film has meat unlike films released that time, i wonder which films was he talking about<br /><br />the film is actually a typical masala film with loads of comedy, romance, action everything jumbled<br /><br />the ease at which the kids kidnap the family, is one of the funniest parts ever, imagine kids kidnapping dawood's family<br /><br />the end is a complete jumble mumble with sudden change of characterization<br /><br />rks gives his weakest film till date, except some bachchan scenes the film is a bore<br /><br />music is boring<br /><br />amitabh tries to give the role his all, he does his part well, though not his best though he contorts his face too much when pulling a trigger and does a weird look while smoking the cigar his dubbing too isn't matched properly at times<br /><br />akshay is there for some minutes and just repeats his act and hams<br /><br />aryeman seems expressionless, tries too hard but overdoes it in some scenes<br /><br />bhumika emerges the best of the lot<br /><br />the rest are okay
