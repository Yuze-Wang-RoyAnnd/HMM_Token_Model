vipul shah has done some really impressive work as a filmmaker in the past. 'waqt - the race against time' and 'namaste london' were entertaining and interesting to watch. 'singh is kinng' was fun, which he produced. his latest outing as a filmmaker 'london dreams' comes up as his careers weakest fare.<br /><br />'london dreams' has a mediocre storyline, it's about how success turns friendship into hatred. agreed, it has the potential but when you watch 'london dreams' you wonder what's happening? this film has maybe the worst climax in recent times. vipul shah the writer puts vipul shah the director down. <br /><br />the first hour is boring, the second hour is better; but again the climax is horrendous. how can anyone forgive a person who decided to destroy you? i won't. ajay devgn suddenly decides to go to india and ask forgiveness to his diaper buddy, thanks to his uncle om puri. when he reaches india, rather than slapping or abusing him salman welcomes him with band baja and says he was the reason behind the entire fiasco? was vipul shah's intension to show salman's character as a god? if yes, than you've failed completely. the only question i want to ask vipul shah is that, would you welcome a person who destroyed you with such a great reception? write what you feel, don't fool us {the audience}, we are sensible enough to understand what's good or not. <br /><br />this is a musical but the music by shankar-eshaan-loy is terrible. not a single song stays in your mind. <br /><br />salman is superb though. he carries the film on his shoulders and does really, really well in the emotional scenes. but again his character is shown as a god, which makes him look like a retard in the end. ajay is equally good, but salman has over-shadowed him completely. asin is wasted, and what is a great talent like om puri doing in this film? rannvijay hams, though aditya roy kapoor excels. brinda parekh is alright as the vamp.<br /><br />on the whole, this dream remains a dream!
