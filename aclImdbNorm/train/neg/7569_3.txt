it definitely fits the time period as the axis & allies were playing espionage games throughout most of north africa & the rest of the world. it's not the best of films, but certainly not the worst of the budget films as described previously from the compilation war classics. <br /><br />duncan"cisco kid" renaldo was actually very good in one of his first feature films. i really enjoyed the performance of harry parke (credited as parkyarkarkus). why he never got any bigger roles is beyond me. he played the perfect buddy/partner role and saved the movie...imho.<br /><br />as said, this film was part of a budget package from superbox-mart entitled war classics. eight movies for eight bucks, which included other never-heard-from-films that has some decent stars trying to pay the bills.<br /><br />this script is...well, not so hot. the editing & cinematography is...worse. if you can by-pass all of that and want to see the future cisco kid & a great sidekick that sadly never fulfilled his true potential, definitely pick it up! otherwise, there's other ww2 films to watch.<br /><br />-thunderossa.
