this movie should have never been made. from the poorly done animation, to the beyond bad acting. i am not sure at what point the people behind this movie said "ok, looks good! lets do it!" i was in awe of how truly horrid this movie was. at one point, which very may well have been the worst point, a computer generated saber tooth of gold falls from the roof stabbing the idiot creator of the cats in the mouth...uh, ooookkkk. the villain of the movie was a paralyzed sabretooth that was killed within minutes of its first appearance. the other two manages to kill a handful of people prior to being burned and gunned down. then, there is a random one awaiting victims in the jungle...which scares me for one sole reason. will there be a part two? god, for the sake of humans everywhere i hope not.<br /><br />this movie was pure garbage. from the power point esquire credits to the slide show ending.
