remembering the dirty particulars of this insidiously vapid "movie" is akin to digging into your chest cavity with a rusty, salted spoon. perhaps "home alone 2: lost in new york" (1992) was a bit on the predictable side, but this pathetic excuse for a film is just one of the most shameless bids at commercialization i have ever heard of. a boy fighting off spies/terrorists when he's home alone in a chicago suburb with the chickenpox? ridiculous! why did this film have to be made? i am the kind of person who believes even terrible movies are not wastes of time, but rather learning experiences. however, this is actually a waste of time. it should be avoided at all costs.
