when i first saw this film in cinema 11 years ago, i loved it. i still think the directing and cinematography are excellent, as is the music. but it's really the script that has over the time started to bother me more and more. i find emma thompson's writing self-absorbed and unfaithful to the original book; she has reduced marianne to a side-character, a second fiddle to her much too old, much too severe elinor - she in the movie is given many sort of 'focus moments', and often they appear to be there just to show off thompson herself.<br /><br />i do understand her cutting off several characters from the book, but leaving out the one scene where willoughby in the book is redeemed? for someone who red and cherished the book long before the movie, those are the things always difficult to digest.<br /><br />as for the actors, i love kate winslet as marianne. she is not given the best script in the world to work with but she still pulls it up gracefully, without too much sentimentality. alan rickman is great, a bit old perhaps, but he plays the role beautifully. and elizabeth spriggs, she is absolutely fantastic as always.
