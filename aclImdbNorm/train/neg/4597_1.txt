having endured this inaccurate movie i will admit that it is a more modern telling of the story than previous versions. yet, it is so inaccurate and has has been made so politically correct that it made me mad after watching it. davy crockett was very poorly represented by billy bob, who i thought would have probably been better cast as sam houston given both men's love of oratory. i think self-absorbed dennis quaid(an actual texan) would have been a perfect crockett and it would have definitely fed into his starved sense of self-worship. as a texan and a true believer in the texas mindset i feel davy crockett was the quintessential texan even though not born here. our unofficial motto is "it ain't braggin' if it is a fact" was made for crockett. and that last scene at the alamo where crockett is the last survivor has to be the biggest insult to davy crockett ever made. to even suggest that this giant of a man and seasoned fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous. three different eye witness accounts place him dead amid the bodies of a dozen or more dead mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand to hand combat. finally, that lame ending to the movie supposedly depicting the battle of san jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 texicans vs 700 mexican soldiers when there was actually closer to 1,500 well trained mexican regulars. every texas school kid who pays attention in their first texas history class knows the battle took the mexican army by surprise during siesta time and the mexican army was so confused they could not form ranks and fled as they were not trained to fight frontier style hand to hand.
