this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen. i'm not exaggerating, i told the guy at blockbuster that they should take it off the shelves. the only thing interesting about this movie is the box. on the box it says "from the director of the boogeyman" so i figured...eh whatever, if this was made recently i'm sure the directing at least won't be too bad :-\, but after i saw the movie and looked at what "boogeyman" they were talking about, it's some nonsense from the early 1980's that he made. great way to rope in unsuspecting viewers.<br /><br />anyway, i think that they just liked the name "zodiac killer", and didn't bother to research any of the actual zodiac's crimes or his mo, or even the years that he was active. all of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the zodiac and the "stories" about the original zodiac take place several years after the actual zodiac's crimes did. they also compare the zodiac to "vampire of dusseldorf" fritz haarman throughout the movie and talk to fritz's "son" quite often. the zodiac and haarman were nothing alike, and it makes more sense to compare him to btk who also shot people, not a man who killed people by chewing through their necks. none of the haarman facts are correct either, just a bunch of jumbled nonsense. his son even says "don't forget, his name was fritz haarman with 2 t's"...his actual name just has one! i think that the writer/director simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest ones that came up were the zodiac killer and fritz haarman. "ooh those sound like cool names, let's make a movie about them without doing any outside research! great idea!"<br /><br />perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from dsm-iv and getting cured of it. "i was also diagnosed with dsm-iv and have since recovered", etc. for those of you who don't know, dsm-iv is the psychological manual for mental disorders. if anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some serious problems! haha.<br /><br />anyway, my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time list, and it's rare that a movie ever reaches that point. but, if you are interested in watching a totally non-fact based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring, full of inexperienced actors, and not completely rational, i'd say check out this movie.<br /><br />...oh, and i liked how the killer "tear gassed" a few of his victims with dry ice. nice touch...
