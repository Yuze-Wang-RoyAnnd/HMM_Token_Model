what a terrible movie. rotten tomatoes had a good rating for this too. don't be fooled by the positive comments; it wasn't scary. it wasn't funny. it wasn't clever. it won't even hold your attention. i just wasted 2 hours of my life viewing this crap-fest. the computer generated monster was interesting to see the first couple times. after about 15 minutes it no longer entertained. the dialogue was terrible, must be a translation thing. another negative that stood out was the idiot americans. 3 were portrayed and they were all lacking character, intelligence and judgment. now i will write a couple of lines to pad this since we have to have 10. the employees at the video store should have slapped me for bringing this title to the counter.
