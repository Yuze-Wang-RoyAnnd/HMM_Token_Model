this is not horror, as the first part was: this is ("campy") light and humorous entertainment. like in so many sequels, the action starts right away with no explanations. but there's boobs, so i don't complain. and real boobs that is. if i understand correctly, those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in u.s. of a. which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is pamela "bruce's sister" springsteen.<br /><br />this cannot be thought without the first movie, so i compare this to it. again there is too small clothing (mainly pants) and funny hair, it's not hard to tell what decade this film is made in. again there is really strange characters, this time even more visibly "pathological" ones. especially the personnel of the camp. it's like some mental rehabilitation summer camp. people are older: most of the actors must be at least 25, but i think they're supposed to be 16 or something. some "methods" used by the evil dyke are quite unpleasant. actually this movie don't have much in common with the first part, and this is worse than it in every way.
