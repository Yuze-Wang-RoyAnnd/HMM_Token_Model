i tried to like this program; i really did. i even bought the pilot film, first on vhs and later on dvd. however, i couldn't get into this story because its two main characters: "david" (bruce willis) and "maddie" (cybill shepherd) just seemed to in love with themselves, for one thing. i admit was some clever dialog in the shows, which was a key part of the success of the tv program, and i did appreciate of lot of that dialog. <br /><br />basically, this was almost like the old screwball comedy movies of the '30s and '40s with male versus female. you get lots of arguing, accusations, yelling and screaming. a lot of people apparently love that sort of bickering, but i hate it, so i never got on the moonlighting bandwagon. <br /><br />only allyce beasley as the hapless aide "agnes," was entertaining. it's too bad she had such little air time. shepherd was nice on the eyes and i suppose women would say the same for willis, but too much arguing between the two finally turned me off.
