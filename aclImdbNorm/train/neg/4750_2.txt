i'd give it a 2/10.<br /><br />i was really, really disappointed.<br /><br />the storyline was poorly developed, for instance, the incidents were too short and brief, hence the moral was not clearly brought out. i thought brenda song did a fine job, but shin koyamada seemed to have a difficult time handling his role. i could see the need to put in western elements in the show, however, there are certain parts, where chinese elements were needed too! the villain for example. his physical appearance resembled a robot, instead of something out of the chinese culture. the final and the worst flaw, were the incorrect, and distorted facts placed in the show.<br /><br />others may point out that this is a 'kid's show' and hence, there is no need for the such high standards. however, there are other disney shows, such as mu lan, which have been much better in terms of story development and presentation.<br /><br />in conclusion, i feel that disney movies should be better researched and better planned. a good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves to depend on.
