ridiculous-looking little boogers that spawn foam and reproduce themselves. so far for the horror-elements this movie has. all the rest of munchies plays out like a really retarded comedy that's so stupid you won't find it funny anymore after about 15 minutes. i can imagine little kids cheering for these little boogers, but adults will be left with only those supposedly "smart" references translating to on-screen stuff like capt. kirk's log entries from star trek, the most well-known scene from e.t., a blatant statement from the filmmakers going "look! we're cashing in on gremlins' success here!" and a cardboard cut-out of clint eastwood telling us... what about his western movies exactly? that last one was totally lost on me... oh yes, and chemical waste disposal in caves seems to be a bad thing. don't know where they got that idea from.<br /><br />not to say that munchies is the most insufferable film to sit through, for that matter. it's just really, really dumb. and if you manage to crack a smile while watching it, you'll probably feel as dumb yourself for having done that after the film's finished.<br /><br />good badness? yes, but only if "dumb", "retarded" & "ridiculous" are criteria you're looking for. 3/10 and, well, uhm, 6/10.
