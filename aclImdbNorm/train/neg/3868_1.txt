if you are studying welles and want to see just how far he fell after citizen kane, this film will prove it. the cheap excuse of making the protagonist a self-admitted dummy to explain how he might fall into such a half-baked scheme fails to explain the absurd courtroom theatrics and ridiculous plot twists that eventually ensue. don't be taken in by the high rating of this film in the db as i was; all i can guess is that there are a lot of die hard old welles and hayworth fans out there.
