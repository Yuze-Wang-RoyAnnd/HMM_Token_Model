well. where to begin. let's just say this; avoid this movie at all<br /><br />costs. it's based on a cartoon series. the movie makes the cartoon look<br /><br />like hamlet. filled with emasculated actors who seem embarrassed to be<br /><br />here, lousy camera work, terrible music, and enough product placement to<br /><br />make you want to never visit yahoo! again, this movie is really the<br /><br />bottom of the barrel. to quote the new yorker, matthew broderick and<br /><br />rupert everett mug their way through this picture with the gay abandon<br /><br />of men who have spotted a rare species of paycheck in the distance."<br /><br />they should pay us some of the millions they earned for watching it.<br /><br />awful.
