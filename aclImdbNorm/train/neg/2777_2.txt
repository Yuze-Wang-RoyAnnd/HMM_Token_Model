unfortunately, this has been showing on star movies here in thailand for the last week or so. it's complete rubbish acting. as another member said, this movie is a good example of 'how not to act.' i haven't seen a movie so poorly acted in a long time. the actors (can you call them 'actors'?) are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog. i would say that in order to truly understand how bad the acting is, you would have to see the movie... but that would be akin to torture.<br /><br />i cringe as the leading lady delivers her lines, and the rest of the cast with their accents (fake or contrived) is equally heinous. another actress with the fake british accent was pretty, yes, but good lord was her accent terrible. mix that with her (lack of) acting and you have a disaster. she should just have said nothing and i could have accepted her as the pretty girl. oh my, we just got to the scene where the leading lady's lover says "really me?" after a forced crying scene from her. laughable. no, really, i just laughed out loud.<br /><br />the sets and the art directors offer some saving grace to the film. some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are rather nice (minus the actors).<br /><br />the old magic potion lady? what?! another member mentioned the 'modern' love song that was in the movie. totally inappropriate for a period piece set some 500 years ago.<br /><br />i understand the movie was considered 'big budget' in thailand at the time of it's production. i would be seriously upset if i were the producer of this movie. just goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good (or even mediocre) film.<br /><br />i would give the king maker a 1 out of 10, but the costumes and sets make save the film from such a rating. 2 out of 10.
