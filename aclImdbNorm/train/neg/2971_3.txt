batman mystery of the batwoman, is, in a word, stale. <br /><br />the plot goes that a mysterious female vigilante ("batwoman") is intruding on batman's turf, and while batman is trying to combat a penguin/bane/rupert thorne threesome, he's trying to figure out who the mysterious batwoman is. <br /><br />there is nothing strikingly wrong about this, but there is nothing really special about it either, noting really made it stick out. <br /><br />mask of the phantasm had bruce's long lost love re surface and mess with his head.<br /><br />subzero was a major event in the life of mr freeze. <br /><br />even the batman beyond movie spin off, return of the joker, dug deep with the characters involved. <br /><br />but mystery of the batwoman had some minor subplots, a lot of formula topped off by a mediocre setpiece on a cruise boat. frankly, this thing is more scooby doo than dark knight, lacking the punch and bite that the animated series had in it's prime.
