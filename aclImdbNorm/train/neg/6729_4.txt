evidently lots of people really like this, but i found it infantilising and reasonably offensive codswallop, saved from oblivion by jane russell and a couple of memorable musical numbers, especially the opener (but there's a marked dip in invention later on). i don't get on with monroe - she's supposed to be playing a dumb blonde who ain't that dumb, but she just comes over as dumb. russell can't quite convince when she claims never to have been in a gymnasium, but is otherwise rather wonderful. the men are staggeringly uninteresting, as is the plot. by no means atrocious, but so patchy that, if this is a classic, god help us all.
