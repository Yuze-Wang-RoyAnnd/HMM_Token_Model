at first, three words: read the book! really guys - this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters. i loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film. it was ludicrous, with half a heart and the story bad explained. the novel - in the first place! - wasn't meant to focus on an adventure! that's only the surroundings. in the film, the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat! additional, the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious! they screwed it up! ... i'll never watch it again!
