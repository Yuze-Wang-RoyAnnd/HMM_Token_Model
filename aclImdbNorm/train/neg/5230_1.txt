although robert "knox" benfer has his fans, i'm not one of them. his films are asinine and amateurish, and and just not very funny, unless you're a 14 year old with an underdeveloped sense of humor. <br /><br />he's certainly not famous, as him immature fans would like you to believe, by harassing people at wikipedia, or stuffing the ratings votes here at the imdb. he's certainly not been profiled by any major media outlets, which speaks volumes about his and his creation's "fame".<br /><br />benfer does have some slight skill at limited animation, but he needs to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write some actual funny material before he'll be taken seriously as a real entertainer. as of this moment, though, he's just a kid with a camera, and it shows.
