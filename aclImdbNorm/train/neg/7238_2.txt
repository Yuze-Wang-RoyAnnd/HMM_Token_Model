the interplay between the characters is a moral disaster. you end up disliking most of the characters and you don't particularly like any of them.<br /><br />even the two main characters played by david and gwen are so badly written that you really don't care one bit about them. the movie has no plot, no direction and no purpose. the single redeeming quality of the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the messed up lives of a few losers - and that's hardly stimulating even as an afternoon waste.
