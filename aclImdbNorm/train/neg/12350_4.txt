hmmm...where to start? how does a serious actress like demi moore got involved in such crap? "first blood" might be rated as bull***t but this type of nonsense is just rambo with tits, point. of course if you are interested in the crapstory (demi moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the navy seals) that is the most stupid clich'e one i can think of, you'll say "gi jane" is a great movie. just the performance from viggo mortensen made this movie bearable but hell, i can't think of demi moore being rambo (especially not during the last, useless, 30 minutes). ridley scott doesn't deserve the credits to make this movie one that comes up for women with equal rights, it's just brainless propaganda for the american army and to make it more attractive they dropped moore in it. awful movie.
