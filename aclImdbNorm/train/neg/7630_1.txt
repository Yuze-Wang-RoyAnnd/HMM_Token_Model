a boring movie about a boring town in the 50's. how can anyone think this is a classic? the producer pretty much ended his career by pushing his girlfriend, cybil shepard, into several movies that were way above her acting ability. i think this movie gives an insight to how bad peter bogdonovitch's future movies were going to be. cybil shepard's career took a dive after being in several movies that peter bogdonovich produced. it wasn't until "moonlighting" that her career started to come back. i thought the acting was poor rendition of the, "graduate". i have noticed that this movie hasn't been shown in the us. the only place i have watched it was overseas in europe late at night.
