i really looked forward to seeing nana after seeing renoir amazing debut work, whirlpool of fate. i had read that nana was generally considered his best silent film so i had high hopes. sadly this felt like a huge step backwards.<br /><br />catherine hessling is the main problem with this film. her acting is over the top, even for a silent film. her acting is more like what one would expect in a film from the early teens, not the late 20s. she usually has the same face, which reminds me (sorry to say) of someone with constipation pains. it was also very difficult to believe that any man would fall for this femme fatale. there was nothing charming about her at all.<br /><br />the film was also quite long drawn, the camera work was uninteresting (aside from a shot of a horse race) and the editing was dull. the story reminded me of pabst's pandora's box. it is interesting to compare the two because there are only 3 years between these films. pandora's box simply scores on every level where nana fails.<br /><br />this film is only for renoir completists or very serious silent films buffs.
