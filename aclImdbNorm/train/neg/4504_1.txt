a slow, tedious, and one dimensional movie! good casting with clich'ed dialogue, boring story line, and soulless direction from mr marshal! the conventional and predictable story of the most famous form of prostitution from the asian continent, lacks heart, new insights, and depth. the lead character looks out of place due to her tiny phisique and phony looking contact lenses. the lexicon employed by the geishas sounds forced and a bit too sophisticated for their limited exposure in the ways of education. the story goes on and on for hours trying to convince you this little, boring, flat chested asian girl is the ultimate geisha, they actually say in the movie "she is destined to become a legend" i say hardy the case! the movie is just plain boring, it is beautiful to look at, it has a very few interesting moments as many as you may find by going out for cigarretes. basically, if you don't believe the messenger you wont believe the message, and this girl didn't fill the shoe! borin, boring, skip it!
