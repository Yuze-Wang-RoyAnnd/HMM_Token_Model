this movie forever left an impression on me. i watched it as a freshman in high school and was home alone that night. i think i lost all respect for robert reed as an actor having been a huge fan of the "brady bunch". i also thought the role of chuck connor was horrendous and evil. however, this movie made such an impact on me that i am now a volunteer in the women's state prison doing bible studies and church services and trying to change womens lives, one at a time. what fascinates me is that so few people actually watched this movie. none of my friends watched it and my family is clueless to this day when i discuss this movie because they didn't see it.
