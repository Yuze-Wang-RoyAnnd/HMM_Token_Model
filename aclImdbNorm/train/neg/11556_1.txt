oh, those italians! assuming that movies about aristocrats with weird fetishes, castles drowned in gothic atmosphere, and back-stabbing relatives trying to get their hands on an inheritance are inherently interesting to all! if you've seen one film of this type, you've basically seen them all (the mst3k favorite "screaming skull" fits the mold, too)...and "the night evelyn came out of the grave" is formulaic, by-the-numbers, and dull as hell. even the luscious erika blanc is put to waste here.<br /><br />zero/10<br /><br />
