you don't need to write a script for this trashed outrage! you just sit back and watch a pair of moonshine women and guests duke each other out before a riotous audience exposure at "the jerry show"! violent and obnoxious, this cash-in on the real jerry springer program reveals everything that the over-rated hyped talk show doesn't show to you on the air - - unless you have a collection of uncensored videos made by the producers of "cops". even the outside world of springerland reveals the most amateurish acting of the decade! this goes to show you that the gong show movie had a central character in a motion picture turkey. change the channel! rejected<br /><br />
