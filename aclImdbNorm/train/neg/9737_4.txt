bizarre tobe hooper exercise regarding an unfortunate young man(brad dourif)with the ability to set people on fire. this ability stems from parents who partook in atomic experiments in the 50's. they die of spontaneous human combustion and it seems that what sam is beginning to suffer from derives by these pills his girlfriend, lisa(cynthia bain)gives him to take for rough migraines. in actuality, lisa was told to manipulate sam into taking the pills by lew orlander(william prince), pretty much the young man's father who raised him from a child. lew has benevolent plans..he sees sam as the first "atomic man", a pure killing machine in human form. sam never wanted this and will do whatever it takes to silence those responsible for his condition. as the film goes, sam's blood is slowly growing toxic, green in color instead of red. it seems that water and other substances which often put out fire react right the opposite when sam's uncontrollable outbursts of flame ignite. come to find out, lisa has sam's condition whose parents also dies from shc. dr. marsh(jon cypher), someone who sam has known for quite some time as his physician, is to insert toxic green fluid into their bodies, i'm guessing to increase their levels of flame. nina(melinda dillon, sporting an accent that fades in and out)was sam's parents' friend and associate on the experiments in the 50's who tries to talk things over with him regarding what is happening. and, rachel(dey young)is sam's ex-wife who may be working against her former husband with lew and marsh to harm him and lisa.<br /><br />quite a strange little horror flick, filled with some pretty awful flame-effects. dourif tries to bring a tragic element and intensity to his character whose plight we continue to watch as his body slowly becomes toxic waste with fire often igniting from his orifices. there's this large hole in his arm that spits out flame like a volcano and a massive burn spot on his hand which increases in size over time. best scene is probably when director john landis, who portrays a rude electrical engineer trying to inform sam to hang up because the radio program he's calling has sounded off for the night, becomes a victim of shc. the flick never quite works because it's so wildly uneven with an abrupt, ridiculous finale where sam offers to free lisa of her fire by taking it from her.
