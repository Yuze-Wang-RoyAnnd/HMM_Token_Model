this drummond entry is lacking in continuity. most of them have their elements of silliness, the postponed wedding, and so on. however, this has an endless series of events occurring in near darkness as the characters run from one place to another. the house seems more like a city. there's also leo g. carrol who is such an obvious suspect who no-one seems to even look at. he is a stranger and acts rather suspicious, but drummond and the folks don't seem to pick up on anything. still, it as reasonably good action and a pretty good ending.<br /><br />i know that algie is supposed to be a comic figure, but like nigel bruce in the rathbone sherlock holmes flicks, he is so buffoonish that it's hard to imagine anyone with taste or intelligence being around him. is there a history behind him that will explain how he and drummond became associates?
