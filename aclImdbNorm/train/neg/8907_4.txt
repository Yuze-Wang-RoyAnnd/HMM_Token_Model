i rented this on dvd yesterday and did not realize it was a "character study" type of movie, so i struggled to watch about an hour of it before hitting the stop button.<br /><br />even with a character study theme, i just could not get into this film at all. perhaps it was my mood in wanting to watch something else, or maybe i had other expectations, but setting that aside, i tried my best to move on to finish watching, but gave up. the actors played their roles well, but the global combination did not come together to keep my interest. about the only interesting thing was the sergeant's gun being stolen and he hurried to buy another one, and spray painted it black to appear as police issue. i think this movie should have been entitled, "who stole the sergeant's gun?" scenes were well done but putting them together i once again felt robbed for anything cohesive to keep me viewing.<br /><br />since i didn't finish watching it i'd say there is some merit to renting this film ... maybe. to me, it was a waste of good viewing effort and time. i'll leave it up to you to try it, but it's not one i'd strongly recommend.
