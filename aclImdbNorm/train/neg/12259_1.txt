a movie about a bunch of some kind of filmmakers, who want to make a documentary on a new kind of surfing in shark-infested waters. as an absolute fan of movies including some kind of vicious animals or monsters, i thought this might be my kind of movie... it wasn't!!! this should be more of a guideline of how not to do it! it has a lot of accidental humor in it and the evil beast is an incredible joke, in the final scene it goes after the main characters *rolling*, the feet are obviously waving in the air! it looks ridiculous! good for a laugh though. if it were only for the lack of talent between the actors, the embarrassingly stupid dialogs and the hilariously stupid crocodile, it would be at least worth a laugh, but it gets worse: i'd guess, the people in charge of this movie noticed how weak it was, so they though up the old idea of "sex sells"... totally, i mean totally without any reasons one of the main actresses shows her breasts to the beast. and somewhere towards the beginning there's some kind of meaningless "makeout". this is the last ingredient making the movie absolute trash to me. it's incredible how people actually spend time producing such rubbish! if you are seeking for a real waste of time: watch this movie!!!
