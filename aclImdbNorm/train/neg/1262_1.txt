this film has a weak plot, weak characterization, and really weak special effects that i question why i lost valuable life by watching it. it has random characters who add nothing to the story and seem like excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the film. the robots are sad and the main "hero" 'bot is turned on by a huge knife switch. if this movie weren't so bad it would be laughable, but there's nothing funny about it. the main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters, and he is killed. it's sad when you root for the bad guy, because he's the best one to cheer for. when all is said and done, this movie was better left on the cutting room floor, or never funded at all.
