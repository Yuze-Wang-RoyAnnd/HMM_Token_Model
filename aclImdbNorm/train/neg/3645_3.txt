a youth gets a bad hair day, goes out on a hill, and falls into where he can't escape. then, he meets mr. atlas, a "mythological" dude from 2,000 years ago as his very best friend, and an arnold schwarzenegger look-and-sound-alike. his herculean strength helps the boy out of danger, and later adjusts to modern life. so what's the big deal? this is the lousiest idea for a "family" outing! either way, this one shouldn't have been attempted at all, really! our fictional character of might and brawn is nothing more than a typical stranger who appears ordinary to the rest of the universe. to add to the blasphemy is the lack of anything new or appealing, and before you know it, there is some attempted violence that doesn't qualify this as "family" entertainment. the scene where atlas complains of his undershorts is gaggling, though. just spend a nice, quiet afternoon in the park for a change.
