if i had realized john wayne was in this movie, i would not have watched it. it's demeaning to the japanese, unfortunate for hollywood and embarrassing to any thinking person. but then, most john wayne movies are like that. hollywood in the fifties still believed that everybody in the world loved americans when the truth was (and still is) somewhat different. the movie deals with the nineteenth century isolationism of japan. maybe it's hollywood that should be isolated.to put it as succinctly as possible, this film is appalling jingoistic claptrap.(sort of a madama butterfly with bad music.)
