with this movie only running 61 minutes and nothing all that good on television, i decided to pop revolt of the zombies into the dvd to pass the time. even while realizing the era from which it was coming, i was sorely disappointed. it started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score (what - no brooding music?) and then the rather slow moving opening sequences. gosh, i figured a movie about zombies - even from the 1930s - would have some chills to it (white zombie, with bela lugosi, certainly did) but this had none. zero. it was scarcely even dramatic (except for the few moments with the burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate the mesmerization of someone). like the equally dull king of the zombies, this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own, but nothing more.
