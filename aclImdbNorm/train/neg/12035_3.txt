i expected this to be a lot better. i love tim burton's work, so i was really excited to see these online short films. well, they weren't at all what i had expected.<br /><br />i don't really know what exactly it is i don't like. i guess they're just sort of dull. the sound bothers me, and most of the characters, although i loved roy the toxic boy, and stainboy.<br /><br />the match girl episode probably bugged me the most, although it was pretty funny.<br /><br />i also don't like the way some of the characters die. like how match girl basically set the gas station on fire, or how the girl who stares died, in general. roy's death was amusing, surprisingly. death by a car freshener. very original ;-) that made me laugh so hard...<br /><br />there are some things that aren't appropriate for kids. just some language and gore. that's about all i have to say! 3/10
