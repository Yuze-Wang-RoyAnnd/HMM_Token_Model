the shirley jackson novel 'the haunting of hill house' is an atmospheric tale of terror, which conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion. the atmosphere is well set out, and the chills are staged well. a haunting masterpiece.<br /><br />the 1963 chiller 'the haunting' stays closely to the book, but also adds its own details to the plot. fortunately, these are very few, and so the terror of the book and the chills are executed even better on the screen. the black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie. excellent! <br /><br />and then, jan de bont made this. in 1999, the remake of the haunting hit the cinemas - if you could call this a remake. why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself, but for the moment, lets look at the film itself.<br /><br />it starts off averagely, as most horror movies do. the set used for hill house is beautiful, and oddly mysterious, and for a few minutes, it seems as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair re-telling. and then, the first scare comes: a loose harpsichord wire slashes a woman's face (dr. marrow's assistant). this is hilarious, and truth be told, it nearly had me in tears.<br /><br />from then on, the film just spirals downwards. the acting seems to become somewhat wooden as the film goes on, with owen wilson's character being particularly irritating (so it's such a relief when he's decapitated by the flue).<br /><br />the special effects practically make this movie,, which is a shame, because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated. examples of these are many, so i won't bother listing them.<br /><br />so, all in all, i, along with hundreds of others, strongly recommend that you watch the original chiller, or, as an alternative, buy the novel by shirley jackson. but please, stay away from this. and, if you do decide to watch this, watch it on the tv (as a lot of the channels love to screen this film, and not the original) or rent it cheap, but please don't buy it, whatever you do. don't waste your money!<br /><br />final rating: 4/10
