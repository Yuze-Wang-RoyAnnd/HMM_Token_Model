saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970's and hated, hated, hated it! easily the most booooring movie i have ever seen in my life. don't know where leigh got his inspiration but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to get them to open their mouths and communicate. the title says it all because there are no saving moments in this movie, just long, long silences with people unable to articulate what they are (presumably) feeling. if you want to watch something that will drive you to drink then this is the one for you. if you have nothing better to do for two hours then stick a fork in a toaster: the experience will be infinitely more pleasurable than anything you will get from this! yes, leigh came up with a lot of really worthwhile stuff much later in his career but give this one a miss.
