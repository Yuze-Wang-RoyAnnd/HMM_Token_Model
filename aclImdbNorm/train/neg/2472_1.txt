anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies. this movie was an insult to watch, the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography. the blair witch project had better cinematography and i hate that move with a passion! the storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie. someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination, okay thats all good and fine. but they still could have done better things with this script than what they did. i mean come on, the indian in the store. did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the indian and the entire story about an indian spirit called wendigo? which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here, so you think okay creepy ghost scenario, but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy. that was so lame it goes beyond pathetic. the ending left you wondering not only what happened to otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of omg!!! why the hell did i just waste my time watching this!! this is a move that i recommend not to watch, there are definitely better quality films out there that won't insult your intelligence! thank god i never had to pay to see this movie, i would have demanded my money back! for those that were easily entertained by this movie.... it's very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie.
