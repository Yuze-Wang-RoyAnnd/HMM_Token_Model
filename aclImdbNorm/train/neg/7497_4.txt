after seeing the trailer for this movie and finding out spike lee was directing, i was excited to hear about this event. i wasn't alive at the time, i didn't live in new york, so i expected more of a history lesson than anything. what i got was some interesting acting, a lot of sex, and about 30 minutes worth of film that actually had anything to do with the son of sam. i guess the film wasn't about the son of sam, but it was a peek into the summer of '77. label me disappointed.<br /><br />
