in a movie that follows a struggling actor, played, evidently, by a struggling actor, this does no favours for chris klein. he struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display, what could only be described as, a bland leading man. the story exists, but that is all, and fails to show any basic start, middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happened.<br /><br />one bright light in the midst of this is fred durst, who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co-stars and does a semi-decent job of bringing the backward character of legde to life. whether fred can re-create this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but i'l be watching out for him in future.
