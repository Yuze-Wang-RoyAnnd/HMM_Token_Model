i wanted to like magnolia. the plot reminded me of grand canyon (which i liked). 4 different lives/stories that come together at the end but magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and i was lost. i almost turned it off right then and there but i felt i should hang in there until the end, little did i know it would be another torturous 1 1/2 hours. thank god i rented instead of seeing it in the theatre. i almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours. the biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene. my dvd player still hasn't forgiven me and i don't blame it one bit. it was a unique movie, but a bad, boring, and pointless movie.
