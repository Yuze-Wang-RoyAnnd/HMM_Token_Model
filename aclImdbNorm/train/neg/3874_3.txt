this film was so predictable, that during the entire time you're hoping that the obvious suspect is innocent, and there's some other big twist still coming. however... it doesn't. he just continues to act creepy, and she continues to ignore it. mary found very incriminating evidence at his place, and she still trusted him? and what was that "baiting the trap"? there was no trap. she confronted him, he said "excuse me. i have to go kill someone" he left, and that was the end of it. they make attempts to use other suspects, (like that one older carnival girl at the end) but they're completely underdeveloped. actually, all the characters are underdeveloped. they have no depth, and the setting is just plain strange... who hangs out in a recycling factory?? its choppy and nothing is well developed. for example: when she leaves his place after having the beer, and he finds the pics and she runs out and he catches her and they end up having sex in that car... what was that? her reactions weren't portrayed. in the car she acted scared like it could have been practically rape- but then all we see is her showering the next morning. booooooooo it could have been so much better.. sooo much better.
