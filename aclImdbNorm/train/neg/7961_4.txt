five years after the original creepshow, another inferior horror sequel is penned by george a. romero and stephen king: creepshow 2. this time there are only three stories instead of five. none of the three stories is really original or distinguished either. the first story is a horror staple, formulaic story about a wooden indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners. the effects are really neat in this story, but it's just too familiar to be compelling enough. george kennedy and dorothy lamour play the elderly store owners. the second story, "the raft", is a stephen king story. it's about four teenagers that unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. soon the kids are screaming for their lives as a watery blob does each of them in for no apparent reason. however, instead of being suspenseful, the kids are saddled with bad dialog and dopey-headed behavior, preventing us from really caring about what happens next. there is also some unintentional humor in this segment. the third and final story is "the hitch-hiker", which is actually a retread re-adapted for creepshow 2. the original story, by lucille fletcher, was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film. then it was adapted for a famous twilight zone episode featuring inger stevens. "the hitch-hiker" works the best out of these three offerings, but it's not without its problems either. lois chiles plays a cheating spouse, who ends up running over a hitch-hiker, or so she thinks. however, we don't know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her. as in many average stories of this type, the characters exist merely to tell the stories with their twists and turns. the wrap around story with the bullies seems a bit out of place. tom savini appears as the "creep" in this installment. the good thing is there haven't been any more sequels. *1/2 of 4 stars.
