from the q & a before and after, this is what i could gather: some irish guy wants to make a movie. nothing in particular, just any movie. so, one night at a party, he hears some ex-roadie tell him a classic bit of rock n' roll lore; the one about how gram parsons' corpse was stolen from lax by his loyal roadie so he could honor parsons' wishes that he be cremated out in joshuatree. wow!<br /><br />what a great idea for a movie! rock n' roll (well, country), grave robbing, escapes, friendship, the 70's! i guess we could get johnny knoxville from "jackass", cause it's kind of a prank, right, and knoxville wants to do "a movie" too. why he must have thought he had the next "snatch" on his hand!<br /><br />but this story's not really that exciting...we need something for knoxville to struggle against.like a psychotic girlfirend after his money! but parsons' was married at the time. that's o.k., no one knows that. besides we could get christina applegate. but what if the audience doesn't like the idea of stealing a corpse.well, we'll get his dad to join the chase, but give permission in the end. but parsons' dad killed himself when he was 10, in fact his orphan status, and tragic childhood, are key parts of the parsons mythology. mythology? we're making "a movie!" this is creative problem solving.<br /><br />it's an uncomfortable experience for anybody even vaguely knowledgeable on or interested in the subject. applegate's presence is doubling jarring. first her invented character is a beverly hills bitch before her time -she might as well have walked around the whole movie a cell phone in her hand, and secondly, what kind of man would parsons be if he ever associated himself with that kind of harpy? facts aren't just distorted or left out, but reversed. they could have easily found the villain they wanted in parsons stepfather, who was attempting to whisk the body back to his home state where law would favor him in dividing up the considerable inheritance.<br /><br />and the music, oh, the music i love. the music is hacked up (the bridge of a song here, the chorus there), forced to the background, and in the end, horribly covered by the hippest new indie band, starsailor. my girlfriend asked the unnecessary, but irresistable question after the movie --was anyone up there, the writer, the producers, the director, actually a gram parson's fan? well, no. he'd never actually heard of gram parsons, but of course, blah blah blah, i learned to love it, and here's some factoids i read in a bio online. another guy vouched for parsons' coolness by saying he and keith richards tripped on acid together and wrote "wild horses" together, a mixed up bunch of facts as off-base as the movie. another person asked, wasn't it morally questionable to rewrite history when most people would only know about it from this film? well, he had the real roadie's permission (he was even set) and the parsons estate gave permission, and all these other people who got paychecks said it was great.<br /><br />but what i really wondered was, and asked in the embarassingly trembling voice of a truly impassioned parsons geek, was, if the movie's so cheaply made (a million), had they not considered the original gram parsons fanbase as an audience? the director and writer seemed to think he was a nothing figure with no fanbase, though i doubt any mojo magazine reading, country-rock 70's music fan would agree. but a bunch of brits made it i guess, and they just didn't care about cosmic american music, or even knew it existed. this isn't just not a truthful parsons flick, it's not even in the right spirit -it doesn't even fit the legend. at the very least it should have had the sentimentality of one of his songs. and plenty of people would love to be told.<br /><br />i should mention the movie was received well from the bunch of stoned college kids, just off the slopes, and into johnny knoxville. but if you're a parsons fan ignore the title, it's just a movie for jackass fans.
