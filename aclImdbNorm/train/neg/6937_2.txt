the subject this latest adman-turned-movieman tries to tackle in his debut (ad)venture is quite an age-old topic of discussion by almost any cultural standard -- timeless romance (pun intended).<br /><br />however, the exploration (and exploitation for desi auds) falls woefully short as the usual inclinations to 'pepper, spice and sugar' up the usual masala mix of b/g score, dialog, dance, drama, etc creates a nice-looking package with not much inside.<br /><br />in the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen scene has been repeated at least 8-9 times. further repeats follow thru-out the movie (after all the lead character's a cook). but therein lies les problemos -- no story! hah, no wonder. someone forgot to write a script.<br /><br />amitabh puts in a cheeni jyada (more) amount of over-acting. really when is this guy ever gonna stop?? how many 60-somethings prance around like that even when teased by a nubile 30-something??? timeless mind yes, but surely what about the not-so-ageless bod? and sole? sorry, soul?! reasonably good acting by paresh rawal who has the only sensible role in the film. the director lacks any sense of realism getting all caught up in his new-fangled discovery of a hot new idea. nowhere are we presented with any real-life problems or issues such a pair might face, other than actually getting married which is only the initial obstacle. the sub-plot of a little kid with cancer (the bachelor boy's first love) goes nowhere and whatever little bit of poignancy this otherwise insipid presentation would have evoked is quickly killed off along with the girl's character.<br /><br />anyway, nice try but not quite there yet.
