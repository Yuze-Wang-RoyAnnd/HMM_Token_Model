1937's "stella dallas" with barbara stanwyck hasn't exactly aged well--how anyone thought a semi-updated version of the story would work now is a real puzzler. perhaps they thought jaunty, cheerfully brash bette midler could make something out of it, but this hoary script defeats her. plot about a female bartender having a baby out of wedlock, and years later giving the young girl over to the child's wealthy father so she'll have a shot at a better life, can't escape tatty, old-fashioned trappings and sentiment. midler works best with a movie director who can control her excesses, but that fails to happen here; stephen collins is stolid as the man who changes her life, but trini alvarado is well-cast as midler's daughter. this is what used to be referred to as a "woman's picture", a wallow, but it doesn't pass muster because it stays too faithful to its 1930's origins. *1/2 from ****
