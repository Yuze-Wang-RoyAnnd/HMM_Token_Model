why does this movie fall well below standards? ultimately, the answer lies in the poor, humourless script. a slim/average looking travolta (looking rather dapper in black i must say, even with a huge mullet) and gross both act very well as two young-ish 'slick-dressed' but nevertheless dimwitted new yorkers eager to open their own nightclub. other than that, the rest of the film is just boring to watch. it is so dull that it's really not worth knowing what happens in the film's climax on any level. kelly preston obviously exudes sex appeal and the sexually charged dance with her husband-to-be travolta is one of the film's few pleasures. charles martin smith is quite fun to watch as struggling kgb honcho "bob smith". personally, i think the movie would have been better if the plot was altered a little so that the settings did not change from ny to 'indian springs, nebraska' (which is in the former soviet union?)--you'll understand if you see the movie... apparently, this movie was filmed in 1986 ready for a 1987 release. i guess paramount stalled on releasing the movie until january 1989 because of the unbelievable plot. it was reported they deemed it "unreleasable". nevertheless, this $6,000,000 film garnered a little over an embarrassing $163,000 in revenue as it was released only briefly in places like texas and colorado before heading straight-to-video. this is testament to the overall bad quality of this movie.
