this has to be the cheapest film made in 21st century. it is all the way low quality, but at the end it falls below... everything. all the cheap tricks - like flashing and darkness - are used to hide those crappy computer effects.<br /><br />all the actors are below average, especially the main character anne fletcher (simmone mackinnon). there is a scene, where anne is asked: "why you seem so careless?" the correct answer is, because she can't act. no matter what happens (the world is about to be destroyed, her friend is dying, she is fired), she has the same stupid grin in her face.<br /><br />it is not only the movie, which is b -quality. it is also the back cover description (at least in finland). the text mentions things like lorica gray -vessel, capital -vessel and main character garrison harper and anna (not anne) fletcher. the description sounds like a different movie, both featuring character called fletcher and sea monsters
