an absolutely wretched waste of film!! nothing ever happens. no ghosts, hardly any train, no mystery, no interest. the constant and brutal attempts at comedy are painful. everything else is pathetic. the premise is idiotic: a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no-place, because their train was held up for less than 3 minutes. what? and the railroad leaves them no place to stay, in a heavy storm? i think not. oh, they can walk 4 miles across the dead-black fields. umm, yeah. sure. or, they can force themselves on the railroad's hospitality, and stay at the 'haunted' train station. a station which proved to be nothing but deadly boring, utterly without ghosts, interest, or plot.<br /><br />so very terribly dull that this seems impossible.<br /><br />this ought to be added to the lost films list !! aargh !!
