i was drawn to this movie, curious to see how they have adapted hubert shelby's brutal novel. i thought that a literary piece of such depth, with a rich tapestry of characters, horrid situations, and social critique could not translate into a bad movie. i was wrong.<br /><br />this flick is a terrible movie experience, not for its content, but for its form. director ulrich edel executes, in my sincere opinion, a terrible directorial job that does no justice to the original book. no wonder edel is a tv director; this movie looks and feels like a bad "made for tv" flick. some of my views on this bomb (**spoilers ahead**):<br /><br />- lack of directorial creativity. the scenes are slow, feel slow, look poorly shot, and barely ever move from an anchored position. the only liberty they take is in the cinematography area, with a nice dark tone. other than that, the movie has the same technical creativity as a tv soap-opera.<br /><br />- all the actors do a terrific job at portraying these miserable characters. the problem is that the adaptation does not tackle a basic element in the development of the plot: motivation. all these characters move around like robots, without a clear motivation for their action. they seem to do things out of the blue, like robots, for no reason at all. edel misses every opportunity to enrich character development by not exploring the character's motivations, and by avoiding developing each character's personality to its full extent.<br /><br />this lack of character development is blatant on tralala. jennifer jason leight does a great job playing this trashy prostitute, but her alcohol-induced decision to let the sailors violate her is not explained. it looks extremely stupid, as we see this character doing this out of the blue. this is a clear example of poor character development.<br /><br />the movie also has many secondary, token characters that do nothing, feel nothing, and add nothing to the plot. i would have liked to learn more about harry's wife, for instance, and the interaction between the two. that's another missed opportunity.<br /><br />edel only approaches character development with harry and his fixation with his gay lover, only to screw it up at the end, not clearly explaining -again- his motivations. the thugs are also a joke in their lack of development.<br /><br />- the soundtrack is one of the worst i've ever experienced. terrible job by mark knopfler. i seriously expected more from the former leader of dire straits, but his job in this movie is seriously lacking. at times, like in the battle between the union workers and the police, the music seems totally disconnected from the movie. it also feels completely poor and anachronic; i could swear the whole soundtrack was made with a casio toy keyboard. it distracts from the actual action.<br /><br />- the book adaptation by desmond nakano is so literal that eliminates the point of the story. it feels as if they tried so hard to keep the action-by-action storyline in the book, that they forgot to actually develop the characters and, once again, explain their actions and motivations.<br /><br />i seriously can not recommend this movie, not even to a shelby fan, because it can ruin the original book. it's a very uninspired effort in adapting the novel, and shows very little creative input.
