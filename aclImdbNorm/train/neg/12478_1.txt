i had to give this film a 1 because it's that bad, but don't make this think that i didn't enjoy watching, because i laughed and laughed, and i even had a few questions. so half of the time i was laughing, half of the time i was saying "what in the hell is going on?" or "why would someone do this?" et cetera. i mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects, the 80's style nude scene/battle/dialogue/nude scene, and the way that the warrior's swords flap in the wind when they ride their horses. and there's some crappy model effects (those aren't supposed to be real trees, are they?) and i still don't understand this guy that they find in the cave, what in the hell is he? a friend of mine told me about these movies and i thought i would give em a try, and i basically liked the film as people like ed wood films, i have no real enjoyment of what the film was meant to be, i look at it in my own hilarious way. so don't let this distract you if you really thought this was an action movie, it is, i just liked it for other reasons. it's much, much worse than evil dead, so it can actually make you think as though you are wasting your life by watching it (which came into my mind a few times). i guess the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks, have some friends around, and laugh at this film. maybe this is a bit harsh, but i don't think so, rent it and you'll see. yo.
