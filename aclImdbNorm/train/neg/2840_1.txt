two old buddies are sent to japan to get back results of a genetic research containing videotape, which is stolen by the black suited ninjas at the beginning of the movie. first they just have to learn some ninja skill, because "only ninja can beat the ninja."<br /><br />sakura killers tries hard to be enjoyable ninja-flick but fails that badly. the whole movie is just so hollow and predictable that is hard to say anything good about it: same plot has been seen in different variations dozens of times before, characters are too briefly drawn, direction is dull and script doesn't offer anything surprising, even in the ending scene, which by itself reduced movie's (trash)value.<br /><br />even 80's ninja-flick-fan, who understands the esthetic of trash-movies, is hard to find this movie even barely enjoyable. it simply doesn't offer anything new to viewer, neither in visual level nor in plot. shurikens are thrown and katanas are swinging, but it's not enough to lead the movie direction it meant to be and recurred similar fighting scenes numbs even the most calloused viewer after the first 30 minutes.<br /><br />it's hard to recommend movie to anyone. even franco nero's clumsy performance in "enter the ninja" falls behind sakura killer's american-ninjas. even in visual level movie doesn't have any balls and it's waste of time to try to find any great fighting scenes in this movie: there isn't any. in all, one of the most futile ninja-flicks, i've ever seen. doesn't interest even in curiosity. trust me on this one.<br /><br /> 1/2  out of 10.
