i won't waste a whole lot of time of this one because as far as i'm concerned it isn't really a movie to start with, just a careless mish-mash of borrowed footage and embarrassingly amateurish new footage made solely for the purpose of pasting the whole mess together and call it a "boogeyman" sequel. literally 80% of this film is stolen from its far superior predecessor "the boogeyman", a film that the writers of this garbage apparently didn't even bother to watch because they couldn't even get actress suzanna love's original character's name (lacy) right. and to add insult to injury the killer is invisible in the original footage and visible in the new footage, apparently they think their audience is as stupid as they are. 0 out of 10 and i wish imdb's rating system went that low, the most callous and blatant attempt to rip off people's money i've even seen, you have been warned!
