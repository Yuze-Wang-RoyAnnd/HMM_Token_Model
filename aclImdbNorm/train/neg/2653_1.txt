i could not believe how awful this film was; i rarely watch commercial tv, but thought "well, diane keaton is always worth watching". i stand corrected. everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame.<br /><br />i realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age, but the script to this was so inept, clich'ed and baffling that i am surprised it ever got into development or that ms. keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow's ear. none of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable. the acting looked like exercises in a beginning class - i stared in open-mouthed horror through most of this wondering "what were they thinking?". very, very sad that it has come to this. don't waste your time.
