i rented this tape a couple of years ago, and boy did it suck. from the commercials, i was lead to believe that this was a movie about a guy who had no no luck with women, and that was where the comedy would lie. boy was i wrong. the jokes were vulgar, and they were just not funny. don't bother. 1/10
