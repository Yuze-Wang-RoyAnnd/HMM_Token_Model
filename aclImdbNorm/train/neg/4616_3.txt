this movie has not aged well. maybe it's just the impact and artful characterization, acting, and directing that we've seen with the sopranos, but i just viewed prizzi's honor for the first time, on dvd, alone.<br /><br />the experience of watching it with an audience 24 years ago must have been quite different, but i have to say, i was just appalled at the ending. not just the violence of it, but the mere idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending.<br /><br />i enjoy a good shocker, but this seemed so out of character... also, when was this move supposed to be set? the cars all seemed like they were from the 1960s, and yet the world trade center towers {completed in 1973} were clearly visible in many cityscape scenes.<br /><br />another way in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person.<br /><br />somehow, mid-1980s audiences found this film charming and funny. mid-eighties, meet the late oughts: only of you can live.
