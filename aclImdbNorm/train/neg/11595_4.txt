star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning <br /><br />alice, having defeated freddy at the end of the last film, is now trying to re-adjust her life. but her unborn child is carrying a demonous presence- freddy, trying to come out into their world again.<br /><br />it's interesting to note the directors who got their big breaks directing freddy films- charles russell (eraser, the mask) renny harlin (the long kiss goodnight, cutthroat island, cliffhanger, die hard 2) and here stephen hopkins (lost in space, predator 2.) but while russell and harlin made a good job of it, hopkins imo has made something of a podge with this entry, that should be quickly forgotten.<br /><br />the story is clearly being stretched as far as it can go here, with freddy ludicrously a father himself and the ridiculous looking demon baby. even at about an hour and a half, it all gets rather tiresome, and of course, not scary at all.<br /><br />the "bon appetit, bitch" catch-phrase is the only memorable point of this other wise very forgettable entry. *
