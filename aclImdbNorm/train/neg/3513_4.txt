jeremy northam struggles against a "total recall" clone script and disposable romantic by-play to bring life to a confused character. lucy liu graduates her acting from a wooden start to a workman-like finish. you can't fail to laugh when viewing her interviews on the dvd when she uses the term "femme fatal" and "romance". french film-noir actress she is not and they lack chemistry together.<br /><br />this movie fails, not in the plot or the action sequences but in the lack of attention to detail in the films photography and ham-fisted portrayal of the world of technology surrounding the main protagonists. little attempt is made to dress the scenery to represent any contiguous filmic landscape or period. automobiles are very 1990's and the architecture barely modern with open plans that hint at a restricted budget rather than conscious set dressing techniques.<br /><br />the technology is positively hilarious. massive "2001: a space odyssey" mainframes fed by man-portable cd-rom's with data collected for some unexplained reason, in spite of the proliferating communications network that even the most un-savvy technologist today would obviously be aware. there is an obvious lack of research done here and given the open-source nature of the cyber-community, research would have cost little more than a bulletin board and personal time.<br /><br />dvd interviews also reveal the original movie name was "company man" but this likely ditched in order to cash in on matrix hype. the "cypher" title has only the slightest link with the movie. terry gilliam would have done wonders with this concept; and completely re-written the decalogue.<br /><br />this is tele-movie quality and extremely disappointing for a movie length production. it might have made a good sub-plot for "alias".
