this is an interesting left turn for reel 13 indies. two harbors is a b&w 75 minute film from minnesota that features non-actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life. i applaud the boldness of the reel 13 programmers of thinking out-of-the-box when selecting this film. i just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with. as a matter of fact, i wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself (not that two harbors is completely without merit, but i'll get to that a little later). <br /><br />as is common with independent films, two harbors is limited in terms of location. there are only two real locations
