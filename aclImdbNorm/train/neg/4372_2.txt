i love don knotts, let me just say that up-front! he is an enormous talent and the best at what he does, which is portray a nervous, lovably befuddled loser thrown into a position of authority. he is fabulous in this role as roy fleming, the reluctant astronaut, but the film is pretty dull, really, even though as a kid my brother and i delighted in watching this and his other films. it's still worth watching but really it's a film that is best enjoyed by children. i'd categorize it as 100% family-friendly and something you could sit down and watch with your kids on a family night.<br /><br />as with all of knotts' films, there's a great cast of beloved character actors and you can't help but smile when knotts gives one of his shaky, open-mouthed stares, no matter how old and jaded you are.<br /><br />from an adult perspective, one thing i think that is great about this film is how it captures nasa in the 1960s -- all the new modern buildings, the hope, the optimism, the future! and i was surprised at how suave and studly leslie neilsen was back then. only complaint about the story is roy's love interest, a rather threadbare, unlikeable woman who can't give him the time of day until he becomes a big shot -- if you're like me, you'll be hoping that he gives her the shove-off at the end. beware -- you'll be whistling the theme tune for days after watching, it's that catchy.
