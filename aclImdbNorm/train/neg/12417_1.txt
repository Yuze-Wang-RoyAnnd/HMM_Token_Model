any film which begins with a cowhand shagging a female calf can't promise much. as for the stereotyping of the kibbutz as it was 50 yrs ago, well i was there and it just wasn't like that. ok every kibbutz had just a small piece of something shown in the film (like youngsters raiding the kitchen at night) but you can't show the whole kibbutz as being full of all those - shall we say - naughty traits. each kibbutz had its own problems, but hardly any kibbutz had all of them. the views of israel were great. i still remember my youth in that garden of eden called the emek (valley). yes, and the acting was good too, so you see it wasn't all black - just a wrong portrayal - probably on purpose too.
