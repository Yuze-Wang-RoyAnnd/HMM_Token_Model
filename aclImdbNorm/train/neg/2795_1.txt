cassidy(kacia brady)puts a gun in her mouth blowing the back of her head out on boyfriend neal(jason dibler). cassidy was the lead singer of a "demons and death" rock band who couldn't shake the sad feelings of her boyfriend's neglect towards her(you know, i can find other reasonable ways to solve this other than putting a bullet through your head). she returns, however, possessing the soul of dora(jill small)her friend who is to replace her on vocals so that the group can finish the album halted by cassidy's untimely death. but, cassidy made a deal with the dark one and souls are to be collected..she's consumed by this anger towards mainly neal, but all the band members or anyone within the music studio get dead when they fall prey to whom they believe is a rather distraught dora..not cassidy returning for payback.<br /><br />lousy micro-budget horror flick looks cheap, has a cheap cast who should make plans in another line of work, and boasts cheap kill-scenes which aren't effective one bit.
