i would of enjoyed this film but van damme just does the same old same old rubbish time after time. poo knickers fight scenes as per usually. the only thing this loser left out was the russians normally end up being killed in the end. this film is utter doggy do do of the highest nature, please please please van damme get some acting lessons, you need them. anyone who likes van damme has issues, it seems sad that the only way van damme ever gets any acting work is when he co writes the film, co produces the film and does the screen play for the film. avoid van damme and his slicked back nasty wig. i give this film a two out of ten, because the one with the the sandman was better. to add insult to injury i wasted a quid on this manure
