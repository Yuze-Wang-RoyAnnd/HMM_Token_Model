this movie has some fatal flaws in it, how someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is unbelievable. then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the dr.'s office, is just bad writing or bad editing. <br /><br />very very very predictable movie. <br /><br />i am not sure how this film got made, except it is was filmed in canada, and probably received a government grant. <br /><br />i must say the person playing aaron, cory monteith, did a good job.<br /><br />unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television then i would say it will kill some time, but otherwise, it is a movie no actor would want on their resume.
