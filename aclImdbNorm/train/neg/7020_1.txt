watching smother was perhaps the longest not-quite-90-minutes of my life. there wasn't a laugh to be had; in fact, i don't remember ever cracking a smile. diane keaton was horridly unfunny as a middle-aged chain-smoking dog hoarder, the textbook overbearing mother character, a relentlessly irritating woman who clearly suffers from some kind of personality disorder. she is manipulative, conniving, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic, and worst of all, boring.<br /><br />i suppose i should briefly mention the other characters, but why bother? it was just a long string of movie clich'es--the dippy, socially inept distant relative who's just trying to break into "the industry", the gruff and long-suffering but somehow still lovable father, the mild- mannered wife who just can't take it anymore (but eventually moves beyond the discord and resignedly comes home), the herd of unhousebroken dogs who like to chew throw pillows while everyone is away, etc.<br /><br />god, what a snore. i've never been a diane keaton fan and smother only reminded me why. overacting is overacting, no matter how many pictures you did in your prime. her attempts at physical comedy were especially humiliating. what was the director thinking?<br /><br />while i like dax shepard and can even sometimes tolerate liv tyler, their performances were so lackluster and dull that it was clear that neither actor gave a damn about this movie. that was okay, because neither did i. keaton's endless self-absorbed prattling was intolerable and at times shepard's dislike for her seemed genuine. by the end of the movie i wanted to slap her myself.<br /><br />awful.
