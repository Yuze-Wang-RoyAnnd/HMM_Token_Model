spoilers ahead -- proceed at your own caution.<br /><br />my main problem with this movie is that once harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers -- with relative ease -- he continues to cave into their demands. and then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped, he decides to wire his classic car up to explode (with the money in it), which makes us take a pretty tall leap of logic.<br /><br />okay, so he wanted to keep his affair with cini out of the public eye due to his wife's involvement with the da campaign. this i can see, but why not hire someone to slap these turds around a bit, or even kill them once he'd determined there was no actual blackmail evidence (e.g, cini's body?) this was a pretty interesting movie for the first 2/3 of it. after that, it sort of falls apart.
