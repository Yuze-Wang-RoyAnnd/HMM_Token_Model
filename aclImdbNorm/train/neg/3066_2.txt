this is a terrible remake of a marginal, but well liked, movie from the early 70's. i have seen the original at least 6 times. the 1997 version is a 20 minute movie 'crammed' into 2 hours or whatever the runtime is. cheesy storyline, which by the way, is completely different than the original. the major government involvement was far-fetched. there is no flow from one scene to the next. in the original you could go get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up. <br /><br />it only took a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car. it takes many times longer than that in real life. car guys notice this stuff. also, the fool or fools that chose to trash a 1968 charger and abuse a 1970 challenger should be shot in the heel with a dull bullet. the fact they aren't 'car people' is painfully obvious, and their passing will not be grieved. <br /><br />the actors lacked any emotion, everything was cut and dried. one step above a monotone. a barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic.<br /><br />last but surely not least, the radio dj made the statement that the challenger hit the bulldozers at 180 or 185 (??). that is total garbage. can you say aerodynamics, or lack thereof?? hahahaha!! this movie is a joke. don't waste your time watching this one.
