i had a really hard time making it through this move. it was extermly slow and at times wondered when the plot of the movie would actually come to life.<br /><br />this movie seemed to flow to slow and i kept on wondering when it was going to end. i am normally a person who likes a good indie file every once in a while but this did not satisfy what i was looking for.<br /><br />it seemed they tried to make to much out of this movie. at one point it seemed to turn political which i am not a big fan of in movies. if you are looking for a slow moving movie with little to no plot then this is the right movie for you. as for me i felt i wasted 2 hours when i could of been doing something else.
