1) i am not weapon expert, but even i can see difference between u.s. army riffles in wwi and wwii. in movie we can see privates, armed with "m1 garand" (invented in year 1932!), not authentic "1903 springfield" (aka "silent death"), who privates use until wwii. difference - m1 can load 1,5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire rate! m1 was semi - automatic, springfield requires reloading after every shot. little difference?! 2) german army uniforms has borrowed from 1940 year too. especially - helmets. german helmets until end of wwi have significant pike on top, we cannot see even one in movie. and if we make little additional search in archives - how much truthful is this "true story"? i am surprised, how much "truthful" can be film directors in a pursuit of cheap propagation.
