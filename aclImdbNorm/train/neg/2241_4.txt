i remember rather enjoying this a few years back but coming to it again, i wonder why. i guess it always looks good and the girls do rather well but the men do rather let the side down. why oh why in so many english films about sex do we have to have such inept men along side the pretty girls? what is more this begins predictably enough as a sex farce similar in vein to the confessions films but about a third of the way through (whilst we are beginning to enjoy the presence of the lovely me me lai) the film asks us to start taking it seriously. not only that but the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forced and just look stilted. in short this is neither as innocently silly or as intelligently serious as it seems to intend. richard o'sullivan maybe, as such a central figure, could have helped but i reckon this to be one of his worst performances. just worth it for the ladies.
