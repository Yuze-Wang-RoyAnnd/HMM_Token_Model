this movie makes me think the others i've seen with combs were an accident. the plot had more holes than i think i've ever seen in a movie purporting to be something more than a "b" movie. the acting was so laughable that not even the memories of combs' past campy triumphs were enough to save it. considering the script i have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. i am thoroughly upset that i paid blockbuster prices for this trash. the fact that it was made for television was something that would have helped me avoid this atrocity and frankly something that movies this poor should be required to warn you of. avoid this movie no matter what.
