every now and again you hear radio djs inviting listeners to nominate movies that the listener can't stand or never watched all the way through. this is the movie that i think of...days later.<br /><br />it's got something to do with a play by shakespeare. not sure, but i think i bailed on this movie some 20 odd minutes into it...think i realised that my toenails wouldn't clip themselves, and they were looking at me imploringly to get cut.<br /><br />this movie just seemed boring and pretentious to me.<br /><br />even though this is the first movie i've given such a low score to (which i've actually attempted to watch), i wouldn't want to put you off other movies by it's english director, peter greenaway. i remember thinking that his "the cook, the thief, his wife and her lover" was a truly great british film even though its content was at times stomach churning-a brilliant movie, but i can understand why people would balk at seeing it.<br /><br />another good film by greenaway was "a zed and two noughts". again, it had some content that pushed the boundaries of good taste, but was intriguing nonetheless.<br /><br />the other film that i usually think of too late for such radio show topics is "brazil". never managed to watch that all the way through either-kept falling asleep!<br /><br />unless you have a taste for self-important movies which are off-puttingly highly stylised, laboriously paced and difficult to follow, then steer clear of prosero's books.
