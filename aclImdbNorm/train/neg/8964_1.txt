those familiar with the two previous cube films pretty much know what they can expect: a small group of people trapped inside a bunch of booby trapped rooms, paranoia, bad acting... this one is a bit different though. roughly half of the film takes place outside the cube, where we get to watch the people watching the people inside the cube (or at least five of them).<br /><br />i guess cube zero aspires to explain what the deal with the cube is, but you really don't get to know much more than what was covered in the two first films. sure, there's sort of an explanation in there, but it feels pretty lame compared to what was suggested in the first film.<br /><br />cube zero looks rather cheap (as did its predecessors), and the fact that it shows more than just a couple of empty rooms only emphasizes this feeling. i also fell pretty confident in saying that there's no risk that any of the actors will win any awards in the foreseeable future. they have brought back the traps from cube 1, though, (by that i mean that they're almost the same ones, which is a bit of a shame).<br /><br />i know that many people kind of appreciate this film and its ties with the first one, but i just feel that it's a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that wasn't that great to begin with.
