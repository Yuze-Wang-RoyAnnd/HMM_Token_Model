this is a film that makes you say 2 things... 1) i can do much better than this( acting,writing and directing) 2) this is so bad i must leave a review and warn others...<br /><br />looks as if it was shot with my flip video. i have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me. i have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video; must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film. one of the worst 3 movies i have ever seen. hopefully the writers and director leave the business. not even talented enough to do commercials!!!!!
