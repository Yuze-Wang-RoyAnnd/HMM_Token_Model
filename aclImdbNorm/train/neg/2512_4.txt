tim robbins is oddly benign here, cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s new jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be albert einstein's niece! although he's on-screen much of the time, robbins cancels out the inner-workings of his intense persona and fades into the background (it's easy to forget he's even in the picture!). lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick, that being walter matthau playing einstein (who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character). otherwise, it's sugary and sunny, directed rather drowsily by fred schepisi, who shows heart but no wit or brains. meg ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and robbins is charming, like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother. ** from ****
