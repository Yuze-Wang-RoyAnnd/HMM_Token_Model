the sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine. this movie is no cabarnet and certainly no casablanca. i agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sit-coms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy. but let's look at the obsolete theme of the movie.<br /><br />with the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom. since watch on the rhine, author lillian hellman has been exposed as a bidenesque plagiarist with her so called real-life story "julia" from her book "pentimento". as one of the most odious of a plethora of western-based ussr apologists, it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir america to action to save the bloody soviet dictator stalin and international communism from the fascists, who had just proved their military superiority in spain.<br /><br />as one reviewer correctly noted, this is not a pro-american play and movie, as lillian went to her grave an american-loathing communist. this film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the american left then, just as now the full mooner left of the daily kos and michael moore has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy america.
