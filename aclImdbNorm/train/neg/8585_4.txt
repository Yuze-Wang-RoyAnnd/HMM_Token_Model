well, i guess i'll have to be the one to say "the emperor has no clothes." when i saw this show listed for pbs last night i was both hopeful and apprehensive. i loved "morse" (even going so far as to buy the complete dvd set) and felt that, while i always liked kevin whately's sgt. lewis character, the show was john thaw, period! after watching the new "inspector lewis" (as it is billed here), i am more convinced then ever that i was right...whately is fine (even though he looks awful (both badly aged and too fat), but he simply doesn't have the charisma to carry the show as did thaw.<br /><br />and as for his "sidekick" fox, well...perhaps the reviewers here from england can understand what he's saying, but i for one mostly could not.<br /><br />as for ms. innocent...all i can say is that i miss james grout.<br /><br />i'm sorry to say that they should have left "morse" rest in peace.
