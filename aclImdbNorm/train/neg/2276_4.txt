class of '61 <br /><br />aspect ratio: 1.33:1<br /><br />sound format: stereo<br /><br />in 1861, class members from the west point academy are torn apart by the outbreak of the civil war.<br /><br />gregory hoblit's ok historical drama makes an obvious point - virtuous men are rendered blind by conflict - though the production seems a little stilted, despite authentic period detail and a cast of talented newcomers (clive owen, christien anholt, josh lucas, andre braugher, laura linney, etc.), toplined by dan futterman as a conscientious southerner who takes up arms in defence of slavery, pitting him in direct conflict with his former northern friends. the movie's emphasis on such a misguided - though sympathetic - character is particularly brave, but the drama is otherwise flat and superficial, and hoblit's direction is efficient rather than inspired.
