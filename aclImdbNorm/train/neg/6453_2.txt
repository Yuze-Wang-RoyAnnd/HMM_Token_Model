there's hardly anything at all to recommend this movie. chase masterson is always nice to look at and actually can act, though her role in this clunker is a waste. unfortunately the rest of the cast ranges from bad to mediocre. in a lot of films like this someone will shine through the material and you make a note of them for future reference. no such luck here. creature unknown" a clich'ed monster-on-the-loose flick with the kids getting knocked off one after the other. the monster is a man in a rubber suit which hearkens back to the days of paul blaisdell. so bad it's good! the rest of the show is just so bad it's bad. a little humor might have made this more palatable, but everyone plays the deadly dull material straight up. there is a twist or two at the end, but by then you won't care anymore.
