the reason the dvd releases of this film are in black and white is because nobody can get their hands on a color print of this public domain film, a modest sea story at best.<br /><br />distributed for television thru allied artists, dvd's (or vhs) on the market at this time for this title are all coming from the same 16mm television print. films distributed for television prior to 1963 were often distributed in b/w prints, because the bulk of viewers did not have color sets anyway. striking b/w prints for television was also cheaper, as it often involved quite a few prints to cover all stations running a film on a syndicated basis.
