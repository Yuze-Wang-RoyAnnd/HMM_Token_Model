in the recent movement to bring asian films over to america, this is the last movie that should be released here. being a big fan of asian movies from all genres, i was browsing the net and came across this soong to be re-released into the us market so i decided to check it out ahead of time and rent this at a local video store.<br /><br />trust me...the action scenes are incredibly disappointing, crouching tiger and iron monkey completely blew this movie out of the water. jet li would fall asleep watching the fighting sequences. if you're looking for martial arts entertainment, your time would be better off with a jackie chan flick!!!<br /><br />moreover...you think you're going to watch a martial arts with about a girl engulfed in vengence for her parents death but surprise!!! a good hour of this movie in the middle has is filled with dialogue, an absense of action, the lack of devloping a tangent plot, pretty much nothing to do with the premise we are exposed to. it has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer/director dedicated no time in elbaorating, and yet dedicated a portion of the film dragging the issue. would of been much better off if they had just cut that whole hour and developed the story in itself through another film and focus on the martial arts aspect.<br /><br />speaking of which, i really don't believe the choreographer of iron monkey, did the action sequence in princess blade. i was completely insulted in the frequent usage of slow motion and quick camera changes to portray the assassins physical swiftness. i just didn't buy it.<br /><br />please...i'm warning you to please do not waste your time/money with this movie. the premise is intrigueing, and the trailer might even tempt you but i am positive that this movie is not suited for the public (maybe in japan but not in the states) and will be the worst film brought over to the states from the asian film industry.
