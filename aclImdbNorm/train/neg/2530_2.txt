this film was abysmal. and not in the good way as some have claimed. first off the main character is a very unattractive gingerman. second - wtf is going on with this van love. the plot, basically, is: boy wants sex so buys a van (which, in fairness is quite cool). unbelievably given that he looks like a newt he scores with lots of chicks! and he fails with some. then he scores with a really hot chick and realises he loves this dowdy bird who played hard to get. then he drag races with the hot chicks boyfriend. and he tips his van. at which point danny devito saves the day. although he didn't need to because in tipping the van the ginger kid crossed the line first. i gave this 2 *'s as i'm willing to assume that there's some sort of 70's vanning subculture i'm not getting and also because there's some 70's boobage too.
