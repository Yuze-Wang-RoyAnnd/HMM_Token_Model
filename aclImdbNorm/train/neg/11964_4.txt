billy crystal co-wrote, co-produced and stars in this extremely safe and comfy comedy-drama about fathers and sons, adult irresponsibility, and growing old. billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha) which causes him to seek out his estranged father (alan king), a movie-extra who fancies himself a big star. the script is sub-neil simon nonsense with one-liners galore, a flat, inexpressive direction by henry winkler (stuck in sitcom mode), and family-conflict at the ready. crystal and king try their best, but king is over-eager and frequently over-the-top. jobeth williams has another one of her thankless roles, but manages to bring her innate, down-home class to the proverbial girlfriend character. it's a comedy, i guess, but one that blinks back the tears...shamefully. ** from ****
