there are no spoilers in this review. there's nothing to spoil.<br /><br />no plot, nothing; most clip shows at least try to tie the clips into the plot by some tenuous stretch, but this didn't even do that. clips, three lines to lead into the next interminable sequence of dull clips... ok, so perhaps they were short on production time, but they'd have been better off skipping this episode entirely. what a waste of time.<br /><br />i'm not sure how this got made, in fact. scrubs is usually much better at subverting tropes, but somehow this got through....<br /><br />thank heavens they were back on form by the next episode.
