i was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received, but after viewing it i was terribly disappointed. slums is a totally unfunny film mixed with a todd solondz type of disturbing family reality sans todd's brand of humor. the story drags along and each scene is worse than the last. maybe i missed the point, but if this film is an example of every girl's growing up experience i am glad to be a man.
