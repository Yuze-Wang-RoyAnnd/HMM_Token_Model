overall performance :- at last the long waiting aag hits the screens. unfortunately, it couldn't set progressive fire in the audience. the first best thing to talk about the movie is the idea of remaking the mighty sholay. and varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie. if he repeated the same ramghad backdrop, people will again say there is nothing new in this. different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy. right from the start of his career with siva in telugu, he had been using the same lighting and kind of background. i seriously dunno this guy varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis godfather. it's all dutch dutch dutch dutch. why would some body use so many dutch angles and extreme closeup shots!!!!!!! the shot division is lame. characters couldn't carry an emotion, performances are not to their mark, storytelling is worse, background is really really terrible.<br /><br />babban:- amitabhz been over prioritized to his job. varma produced great villains like bikumatre, bhavtakur das, mallik bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of hindi cinema. there's no comparison of gabbar with babban. babban is a more psycho rather than a villain, still he has a soft corner for his brother ( it's a gift in this movie). amitabhz performance is not to his mark. his appearance itself is pathetic. the scar on his nose, symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema. what ever they worked on babban is not successful. babban is no comparison with gabbar.<br /><br />narsimha:- the first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands. if varma did that , it would be like teaching abcd to a bachelor degree holder. itz good he opened the secret early. but the flashback is pathetic. varma couldn't use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark.<br /><br />durga:- the only character with betterment. this character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story.<br /><br />heroo, raj, ghunguroo:- no body bothers or at least considers these character. the utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz. these characters carry nothing to this movie.<br /><br />ramgopalvarma:- his quality is degrading, diminishing. aag totally can be treated as a c grade movie. sholay is a fire of revenge, problem of a town, meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by dharmendra. aag never carried an emotion with its characters. storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters. don't compare aag with sholay, still u will not like it.<br /><br />if you dare watch this movie. you will be burnt alive in ramgopal varma ki aag
