very funny to watch "beretta's island" as kind of natural trash-film.it is like answer to jess franko's type of b-movie.bodybuilders strikes back (!face to face!) to pushers.the very very very stupid strike!action: unbelievably bad directed firing(shooting) scenes look even better than hand-to-hand fighting.chasing scenes ridiculous.saving beauties scenes incredibly stupid.erotic scenes are very unerotic.the main luck of film is pretty landscapes and festival scenes.don't miss:arnold schwarzenegger's joke at start of film and list of franco columbu's kin at the end. special attraction: naked bosom.almoust forgot - franco can sing!
