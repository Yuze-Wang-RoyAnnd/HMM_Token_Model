based on a self-serving novel by one-time girl friend and groupie of f. scott fitzgerald, gossip columnist sheila graham wrote this trashy story. gregory peck carries on in shameless excess as a forceful be-drunk-or-be-damned alcoholic; in contradiction to the gentle and soft spoken real scott fitzgerald. focusing on fitzgerald's hollywood writing era, late in his life, the much-honored author was, in fact, living a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when aa was not yet well known. fitzgerald was none-too-proud to be recycling his flapper stories in order to support both his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (in college). living in a small apartment and driving a second hand chevrolet his life was 180 degrees different than as portrayed in this movie.<br /><br />virtually every 20th century-fox movie made during daryll f. zanuck's leadership, as well as virtually every film directed by henry king, was a work of excellence. beloved infidel was the exception.
