plan b has the appearance of a quickly made, unedited, sloppy script for a movie with the attempt for an outing for the actors involved - an outing that should have been nixed from the start. it is just another mafia-based 'comedy' that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those participating.<br /><br />joe maloni (paul sorvino) is the crime boss more concerned about clothing and appearances than about his business of control. his personal assistant mario (anthony desando) is dumber than dirt and his ignorance is supposed to be funny. maloni has whacked one of his debtors (who just happens to be married to bookish fran - diane keaton) and maloni takes fran on as his assistant to work off her dead husband's debt by being maloni's 'hit man'. fran is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to carry out maloni's assignments, electing instead to transport her 'whackees' to florida to hide at her brother james' house until she can figure out what to do next. this alternative to killing the three candidates is called plan b, plan a being to kill them! the ending is wholly predictable just as is every line assigned in the script to the characters.<br /><br />diane keaton has made a lot of fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and comediennes, but here she screams and rants and twitches her way through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch. paul sorvino is, well, the paul sorvino type cast from other mobster films. the supporting cast is likewise allowed to play to the balcony in the broadest slapstick, pratfall fashion imaginable. what is supposed to be a comedy ends up being just silly and overdone. director greg yaitanes needs to go back to tv sitcoms: had this flimsy story been compressed into a half-hour gig it might have had a chance. grady harp
