starts really well, nice intro and build up for the main characters but after about 5 minutes, the charm is lost.<br /><br />the character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from american pie and loser without the supporting cast or innovative storyline that made the pie movies more of a commercial success.<br /><br />let's be honest - heder's acting was pretty poor. keaton, daniels and faris did their best but had no substantial plot or script to get their teeth into the movie just plods on without any pace or clear logical storyline justifying its length.<br /><br />the ending is about as predictable as they come - so predictable i've ticked the spoilers box for this one line.<br /><br />my advice: avoid at all costs unless you really really have nothing else to do/listen to or watch and even then you'll feel the producers just cheated you out of an hour and a half of your life.
