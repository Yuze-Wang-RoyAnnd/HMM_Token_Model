plot = melissa is a new girl in town, she's fifteen years old and her birthday is coming up in one week. since melissa is beautiful, every boy in town wants to hook up with her, but the few that manage to catch her interest mysteriously die.<br /><br />to be honest the real reason i wanted to watch this film is because dana kimmel of friday the 13th pt 3 was in it which isn't a proper reason why to rush out and see a movie. when i started watching it i realized that "sweet sixteen" isn't a very good slasher, it's really dull and boring and just doesn't go anywhere. after over an hour, only three murders have occurred and the story hasn't really developed in any possible way.<br /><br />the movie is nicely shot with quite nice photography and good directing but just as with many other slasher flicks from the 80s, the movie suffers from being too dark at times. the acting is actually pretty good though and melissa's character is easy to sympathize with, even though she's a complete slut.<br /><br />the story line isn't completely rubbish but it's just way too dull to keep you interested, the only things that kept me interested was melissa she was stunning and dana kimmel whose really sweet and cute in this movie.<br /><br />all in all pretty dull slasher flick that doesn't go anywhere i'd definitely wouldn't recommend it to slasher fans.
