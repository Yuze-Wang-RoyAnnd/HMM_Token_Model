i was always curious about this film because it is so tough to find, so when i stumbled upon it on ebay i forked over the $10 and bought it, now i understand why its so rare! this film is so bad, so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the ending credits, which show all of the cut scenes where they fumbled their lines, are literally the movie's highlight. the film is about a psychic (pettyjohn, cast for one obvious reason, her topless scene) whom uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality. when she pulls in some kind of box like object the military nonchalantly throws it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it, and gee, what do you know? surprise! a kid in a foam-rubber monster costume pops out, instantly kills the soldier with a scratch across his face, then escapes to a nearby city. but rather than deploy half the armed forces of the county to find it and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to pettyjohn and ray to find it on their own, but no matter, this movie blows all its credibility long before then. this barely escapes being voted a 1 by me only because of unintentional laughs, somebody needs to alert the producers of "mystery science theater 3000" if they don't know about it already! 2 out 10, really, really bad!
