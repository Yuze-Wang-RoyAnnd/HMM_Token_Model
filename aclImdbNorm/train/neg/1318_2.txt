a sentimental school drama set in denmark, 1969, "we shall overcome" offers a pathetic danish take on us culture. frits (janus dissing rathke), a flower-power obsessed, naive 13-year-old, exits with half his ear hanging off from brutal master lindum-svendsen's (bent mejding) office. lindum-svendsen, a school director, portrayed as a fascistoid tyrant, has the local community in control. lindum-svendsen's gone too far this time, and with his father, recovering from a mental breakdown (sure, there wasn't enough drama already..), and overly stereotyped hippie music teacher mr svale ('hi, call me freddie'), frits stands up for justice.<br /><br />tell you what. it's so unconvincing, over-(method-)acted, and so full of misery, that as a 'family' picture this grotesque -filled with clich'e's- excuse for a movie fails miserably to convince non-scandinavian audiences. sorry, kind danish readers, to crash like this into your sentimental journeys.. but it's definitely not a tale about a 'boy becoming a man by fighting the system'. the boy never becomes a man, but rather remains a naive, big eyed cry-face. if you call a church of small minded small town folk, led by a dictator like cartoonish character "the system", i'm sorry if i'm missing something.<br /><br />if you're into family pictures, go see happy feet instead..
