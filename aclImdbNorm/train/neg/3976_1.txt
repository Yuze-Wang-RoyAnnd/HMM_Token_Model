the plot was dull, the girls were sickening and the supposed italian male lead had clearly never heard an italian accent.someone said the boys were cute in this film but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre people. there were literally no redeeming features about this film.<br /><br />i think this is a graveyard for actors that will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of the olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reason.<br /><br />i hope the olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business. they have no place in it.
