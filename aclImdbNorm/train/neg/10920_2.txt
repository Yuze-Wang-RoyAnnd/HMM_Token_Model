this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen.<br /><br />i have to disagree with another commenter, who said the special effects were okay. i found them pretty bad: it just wasn't realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story.<br /><br />maybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story. the archaeologists are looking for "the set". they do not bother to tell what set, or what is so special about it. that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california, while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egypt.<br /><br />if you're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert, take the effort to actually go to the desert. the beginning - the ancient ceremony - looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert.<br /><br />the action-level was constant throughout the movie, no ups and downs, no climax. it made the movie look short, and that's certainly a pro for this particular movie.
