i had no expectations other than to be entertained for 90 minutes, and that is exactly what i was.<br /><br />of course it is campy, of course some of the dialog wasn't perfect, of course the "special effects" were a bit hokey. that is exactly why i enjoyed the movie so much. it is a perfect fit for this genre of a 70's horror classic.<br /><br />the talent needs to start some where, that goes for the actors and the crew, and what better piece of material to sharpen your skills on than this.<br /><br />i for one look forward to another film from these producers and directors.
