i have nothing against religious movies. religious people need something to watch on a saturday night, i guess. but what really ticks me off is when the write-up on the dvd box does not indicate this fact to the potential viewer. passing off religious propaganda as entertainment is not cool, bro.<br /><br />and even if i was a religious person, i would have to agree with most of the other posters here, this movie was a mess. poorly directed, poorly acted, poorly edited, and the attempt at a soundtrack was hilarious. the fake accents were terrible, the characters were mainly stereotypes, and continuity was out the window. the only reason we sat through this lame waste of time was that it was too late to watch another movie instead. should have just gone to bed.<br /><br />absolutely no redeeming qualities to this movie, unless you are the religious type who will immediately endorse anything that will preach your beliefs to the unbelievers, even if it's a pile of garbage. if you aren't, avoid this at all costs. do not be deceived by the box write-up.
