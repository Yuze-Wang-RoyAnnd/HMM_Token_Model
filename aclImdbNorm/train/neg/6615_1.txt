once in a while in indian cinema there comes along a movie like sholay that changes the way the audience perceives a good movie. and den just once in a while(hopefully) we have a rgv ki aag that breaks all the standards and creates one of its own. a standard so low, it can never be broken. ram gopal varma manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a dish so stale u can smell it from a distance. to take a classic like sholay and assassinate it is totally unforgivable and i can't believe he almost called the movie rgv ki sholay. although sholay had a lot of folklore elements in it, the movie managed to build on its plot by merely defining the characters so distinctively that they lived on forever. what aag does is take these characters and mess them up so badly u'll need a contest to pick the worst. the realism element is totally missing and what the movie ends up providing is a bunch of "actors" parading along in a plot less and seemingly unrelated set of events. one star for this film is a ridiculous waste of a vote. its time for rgv to wake up to the reality of his failure and conjure up another "different" plot that can be categorized under cinema.
