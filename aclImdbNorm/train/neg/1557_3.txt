the movie is basically a boring string of appalling clich'es which do not offer a real cross-cultural insight. the middle eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way: there obviously are mud brick villages, dirt tracks in the middle of the desert, women clad in black robes and belly dancers. i wonder how camels and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture. the personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and many situations are hardly credible. <br /><br />the original idea might have been interesting, but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight, you should skip this movie.
