hilariously obvious "drama" about a bunch of high school (i think) kids who enjoy non-stop hip-hop, break dancing, graffiti and trying to become a dj at the roxy--or something. to be totally honest i was so bored i forgot! even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and--as a drama--failed dismally. we're supposed to find this kids likable and nice. i found them bland and boring. the one that i really hated was ramon. he does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great. excuse me? he's defacing public property that isn't his to begin with. also these "great" kids tap into the city's electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building. uh huh. so we're supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and fun.<br /><br />i could forgive all that if the music was good but i can't stand hip hop. the songs were--at best--mediocre and they were nonstop! they're always playing! it got to the point that i was fast-forwarding through the many endless music numbers. (cut out the music and you haver a 30 minute movie--maybe) there are a few imaginative numbers--the subway dance fight, a truly funny santa number and the climatic roxy show. if you love hip hop here's your movie. but it you're looking for good drama mixed in--forget it. also how did this get a pg rating? there's an incredible amount of swearing in this.
