elephants dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community. and while it was a very interesting idea in concept, in reality it has failed miserably.<br /><br />the film is beautifully rendered, which is probably the only redeeming factor. a huge problem with them, however, is the vast overruse of light bloom. it's horrible, although i guess it helps give the film a dreamlike quality.<br /><br />one thing to note is the terrible voice acting. while proog's voice actor is at least semi-competent, emo's voice actor is horrible. i guess when you have a budget that basically amounts to zero, you can't afford to hire real voice actors. to me it seems like they hired one of the animators to do his voice.<br /><br />as a whole, the movie doesn't really go anywhere. to me it seems like it's more of a "look what we can do" kind of movie instead of a real film. the plot goes nowhere and fails at really showing any interesting point. the whole movie feels like it was made as an excuse to make interesting looking areas.<br /><br />overall, it may be worth a quick download from the official site, but don't expect anything except pretty graphics.
