bangville police supposedly marked the debut of the keystone kops, named after the studio they worked for. in this one, however, they don't dress in the silly cop costumes or drive the fast-paced car that's their trademark. anyway, mabel normand is a farm girl here who's begged her dad for a calf. she later sees some strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police. one answers and the chase is on. next, mabel slams her door just as someone is coming in. turns out it's her mother who jumps to the conclusion robbers are in there! so while mabel blocks her door with furniture, the mother and father try to fight their way in! this was perhaps the most amusing part of the short along with some explosions of the cop car. this was a short 7 minutes that went by so fast it's over before it's begun. the only real characterization that's developed is mabel's who exudes charm with just her face and big eyes and seems so optimistically cheery here except, of course, when she's frightened. it's easy to see why she became a star. it's largely because of her that i'd recommended seeing this at least once and why i'm giving this a 4.
