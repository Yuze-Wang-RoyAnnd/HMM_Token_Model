this is a fair little show about the paranormal although it feels as if art bell and his ilk figured out how to carve a career out of the attitude that carl kolchak exemplified. of course there probably wouldn't be an x-files if this show hadn't prepped this audience for it so well. darren mcgavin is not exactly the super-heroic type but he is a plausible(enough) guy to deliver heroic deeds. check out his work on some of those old alfred hitchcock presents. here he is the main attraction, there doesn't seem to be a girlfriend or wife who's a distraction. in fact there isn't a whole lot of sex appeal to the show. something i'm noticing as well is that the pacing isn't really suspenseful in a typical way. there's a lot of throwaway humor to this show. sometimes its just pokey to get to the climax. there's a thread from this show coming all the way up to the present mad men show in terms of style. not that david chase writes mad men but the people that worked under him on the sopranos definitely have emulated and inherited his serio-comic tone.
