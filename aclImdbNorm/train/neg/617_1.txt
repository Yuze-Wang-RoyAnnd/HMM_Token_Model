first off, let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie: "this entire movie had to have been a dare. you know, like, 'dude, i bet you couldn't make the worst movie ever'". with this movie, they've made a good effort at achieving that title. the effects are, of course, poor. the plot/dialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every b horror movie ever made. the actors, i'm assuming, are supposed to be in college. yet parts of it (especially at the beginning) make it seem like they're supposed to be in high or middle school. it makes no sense. the scarecrow going around killing people isn't the least bit enjoyable. (spoiler: at the end, when they chant lester's name and he reappears, the black guy and scarecrow are both laughing, probably out of relief they were on their last scene, and at the cheesy dialogue.)
