the school nerd marty (simon scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion (set by them also) where his face is scarred by acid. years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school (since closed) for a reunion. what they didn't know is that marty is inviting them back to kill them. then a storm starts, they're locked in the school and marty starts to take revenge.<br /><br />pretty silly. the murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school--but that's about it. the humiliations inflicted on scuddamore are more than cruel (he's stripped, has his head dunked in a toilet and gets burnt) and are just uncomfortable to watch. considering scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible to view. also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity. there is full frontal of scuddamore (surprising for any movie) but one girl decides to take a bath alone...after they know a killer is wandering around after them! and then there's the couple that has to have sex. this is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them. it ends with a twist which had me groaning and rolling my eyes then another twist which had me wanting to throw something heavy at the tv! the acting is bearable--not good, but bearable. caroline munro is in this too. she's a very beautiful woman but not much of an actress.<br /><br />this gets a 3 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere. otherwise it's run of the mill and forgettable. scuddamore's tragic suicide has given this film more attention than it deserves.
