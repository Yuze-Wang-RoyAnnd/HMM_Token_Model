i love seth green. his appearances on that 70s' show is always worth watching but last night, i felt the show needed to overhauled. four single young guys inherit a new york city apartment that most of us would die for. the grandmother must have been an heiress to have such space in the first place. so i felt the need for realism should have been brought out. anyway the plot about four best friends getting this apartment was not believable. i would have been thrilled if they had to move in with one of their parents which would have provided great humor and dysfunctional about the show's set up. there did not seem to be much humor in it. i am only watching it because it falls before my name is earl on a winning thursday night. i think they should go back, scrap this series, and start over. we need more family involved series. how about seth and his friends move in with his wacky parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place down. they could have dabney coleman play the father and christine estabrook, play the mother and dysfunctional siblings. the list of possibilities with somebody like seth green are endless and the network is blowing it.
