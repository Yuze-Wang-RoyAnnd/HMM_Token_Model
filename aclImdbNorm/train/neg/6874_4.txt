jean-marc barr (being light, the big blue, dogville) has directed and interpreted this strange movie which is the second installment of some kind of trilogy. i might be wrong but i don't think this movie's part of the dogma '95 manifesto, though it really looks like it. i'm not really sure of what i think about this film. all actors are good. they deliver pretty good performances, especially rosanna arquette and jean-marc barr. the story is somehow interesting. but i don't know, there's something about the movie that i don't like. the sex scenes are way too long. it goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of crap i don't know exactly where it stands. sure it's not a bad movie, but i won't suggest people to see it neither i'll tell them not to watch. just do as you want. if you feel curious and you're open-minded, give it a try, you might like it.
