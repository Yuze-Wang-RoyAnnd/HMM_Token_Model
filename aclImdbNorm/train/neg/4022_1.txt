this movie was horrible. i watched it three times, and not even the whole thing. it's just impossible to watch, the story line sucks, it's depressing, and utterly disgusting. i don't write spoilers for anything, so if you want to know why it's so disgusting, see it for yourself. the only good thing about this movie was john savage, his dialogue at the beginning, and some funny parts in the movie. the little kid in this movie is annoying, and the whole situation is bullshit. i saw this movie at movie stores around america, so i assumed it would be a good movie. jesus christ, was i wrong!!!! the acting is all horrible, and the nudity itself is lame and nasty. another thing is, starr andreef, the other main character, hasn't been in such bad movies in the past, in fact, she was in some pretty good ones. same with john savage. this movie sucks!
