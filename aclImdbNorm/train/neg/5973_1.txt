this movie is another fine example of what jerry bruckheimer, since about 1997, seems to be best at--hyping up a movie a year before its release and not coming through with a quality movie. i'm no film critic, but this movie was as predictable as they come. every attempt at a joke, every attempt at a touching moment, and the pitiful attempt at a love story, was exactly what i was predicting in my mind. do yourself a favor and save your money on this one.
