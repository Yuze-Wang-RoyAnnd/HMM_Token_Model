i loved the first two movies, but this movie was just a waste of time and money (for me and the studio). i'm still wondering why they made this horrible movie. the thing with the plastic gun and with the toy car, that can go into another house are ridiculous. joe pesci and daniel stern in the first two movies were so funny, but the terrorists in this one are so stupid and not funny. believe me this movie is just a waste of time.
