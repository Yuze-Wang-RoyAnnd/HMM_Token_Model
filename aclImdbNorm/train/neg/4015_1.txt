a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like "debbie does dallas". nowhere close. i think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in porn industry ever. even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time. but i read somewhere that back in those days, porn had to have some "artistic" value. i was unable to find it though. see it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream, or can appreciate art in porn movies. i know i am not. but the director of the movie appears to be a talented person. he even tried to get simon & garfunkel to give him permissions to use his songs. of course, they rejected.
