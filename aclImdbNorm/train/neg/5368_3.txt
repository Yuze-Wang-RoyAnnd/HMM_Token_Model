private practice is supposed to be a medical drama. so i guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines. just by watching house, i "solved" two (out of nine) medical mysteries before the doctors did. boooring. seriously, if you are a lazy writer, why not copy some cases out of older er episodes or some obscure brazilian medical soap? house is recent and popular - recycling their ideas is hard to get away with...<br /><br />second biggest complaint: these people are supposed to be forty-somethings, right? then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15-year-olds? is three weeks (ie. three whole damn episodes) of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend doesn't want to be your "friend with benefits", it's maybe not because he wants to hurt you, but because he doesn't want to risk your friendship? the character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way - the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you can't really buy into the supposed "drama".<br /><br />and i won't even start complaining about what the show did to everyone's favorite addison as we got to know her in grey's anatomy... on a sidenote, don't you think it's funny the way addison ends up lusting after loser pete (sorry, but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with mozart's requiem is a loser, phd or not) and derek ends up entangled in a relationship with whiny, irritating meredith miles away in rainy seattle? apart from that little fling with mark, they seemed to be perfect for each other. sometimes i think shonda rhimes' subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships, our first choice is often the right one...
