there were some scary scenes, which i've always liked more than straight out gore, but otherwise this movie was rather weak. there were too many questions left unanswered, and when they tried to explain anything in the movie, it was still rather unclear. after watching this movie i still seemed lost in a lot of ways. it sort of reminded me of silent hill a few years back. that movie was also unsatisfying, but still better than this because it did try to work and the story did actually make sense. this one, not so much.<br /><br />the acting for the most part in the abandoned was decent, but the movie dragged on an on, and never really gave any type of satisfying conclusion. like i said above, there were some creepy scenes, but otherwise, this movie was a mess. sorry, i can't recommend it.
