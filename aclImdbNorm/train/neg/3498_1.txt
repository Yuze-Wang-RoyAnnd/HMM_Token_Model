i had just watched one episode of this program and i couldn't even get to the end of the program. every minute i had watched this program my i.q must of dropped about 10 points. this is basically like a children's program but with swearing. not even the swearing and the insults she tells other people made me laugh. anyways the story must of been written by a monkey and the people who actually put this script for this program through for filming must of been held at gun point and had no choice but to film this retarded, disappointing, horribly acted program. sarah silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some god damn acting lessons.
