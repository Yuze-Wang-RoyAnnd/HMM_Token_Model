hey look, deal with it, there are much better portrayals of the hardship of black america than this. although i think this story is weak, my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story, which i have mentioned, blows.<br /><br />this was made in the mid-80's and is horrible in the music/score department. it's funny to see oprah as a latter-day crack-whore type.<br /><br />the scene where bigger stuffs elizabeth mcgovern into the incinerator. pure classic cinema. first off, i don't care how drunk you are, you will react to 1200f degree flame (no matter how bad your acting). but they really milked that scene...it was comical. i'll tell you what though, i had great satisfaction in seeing elizabeth mcgovern burn in a faux death; she annoys me.
