i am an avid b-rate horror film buff and have viewed my fair share of slasher pictures, so i have a substantial gauge to judge this film by. it easily ranks in the upper echelon of the worst horror films the 1980's has to offer. it isn't as scary as night of the demons, it isn't as gory as re-animator and lacks the camp value of there's nothing out there. that being said, this film has no value. keep in mind, the movie artwork is for a completely different film. the stills shots on the back of the dvd box aren't taken from this film.<br /><br />violence: $$$ (there is plenty of violence but we've seen it all before. a murderer kills nubile students and the occasional facility member by slitting throats and all the other tired methods of murder that horror films utilize).<br /><br />nudity: none <br /><br />story: $$ (the story focuses on francine forbes - who wisely changed her name to forbes riley after this film was made - who accepts a job teaching at a university. people start to die and forbes believes the killer is targeting her. is it her new heartthrob with a checkered past or the libido-crazed student? to be honest, it is impossible to care because the script doesn't flesh out any character outside forbes).<br /><br />acting: $ (terrible on all levels. this slasher has the feel of a school production -high school that is because college students could make a better flick than this. forbes showcases a modicum of talent as does seminara as one of the students, but everyone else is of the "extras" caliber of acting).
