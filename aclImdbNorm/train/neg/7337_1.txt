painful. painful is the only word to describe this awful rendition of such a fun and interesting shakespearean play. i gave it a shot but was terribly disappointed and couldn't bare to even finish viewing it. to the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this twist of much ado was, i pity you and your bored brain. may your pretenses about young viewers be lifted without retribution. please do not even bother with this gut wrenching, disgusting excuse for a performance of an acclaimed shakespeare drama. you will be forced to induce vomiting and will require a commode close to the television with which you choose to watch this crap because involuntary defecation will take place.
