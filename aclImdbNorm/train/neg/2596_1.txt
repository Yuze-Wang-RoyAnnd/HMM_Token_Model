dear god! i kept waiting for this movie to "get started"... then i waited for it to redeem itself... and when it did neither, i just sat there, dumbfounded that: 1) it could possibly be this bad, and 2) that i had just wasted a couple of hours on just sheer stupidity. i had faith that drew couldn't possibly have made this bad of a movie... and boy, did i ever lose my faith! don't bother with this one! drew tried, but the movie was poorly written, poorly acted, and just poorly conceived! i can't believe a script this bad ever got funded! it had a million chances to actually do something with the idea, (the word "concept" is too big for this movie to even qualify for!) and it still didn't go anyplace! its just pitiful! where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasn't the worst, baffles me! because believe me, if it got any worse i'd have slit my wrists before finishing it!
