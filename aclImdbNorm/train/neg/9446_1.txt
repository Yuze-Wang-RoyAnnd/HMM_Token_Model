an absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's book. crude and inappropriate humor, some scary parts, and a sickening side story about the mom's boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book (3-8) yr olds. don't waste your money, your time, or your good judgement.
