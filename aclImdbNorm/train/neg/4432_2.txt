tatie danielle is all about a ghastly old hag who torments her loving and oblivious family out of sheer spite. there's a bit of subtext that might be about france's colonial past but it's mostly just danielle doing the sorts of things (like deliberately abandoning a small child in a park) that would soon have a man picking up his teeth with broken fingers. sadly, that doesn't happen here. it looks good and the acting is fine and there's nothing really wrong with the concept but it's just so smug. god, does this movie love itself. pity it isn't nearly as clever or as funny as it thinks it is. the only impetus in the show - sorry, movie - comes from danielle getting nastier and nastier, and the only surprise comes from watching the increasingly improbable ways she does this. that's right: just like in a sitcom, which is what this is, with the added 'bonus' of delusions of grandeur and a 110-minute running time.
