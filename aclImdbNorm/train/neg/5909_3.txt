the opening 5 minutes gave me hope. then meyers proved he only had one good idea for the rest of the movie. absolute lowest common denominator humor. painful viewing. a complete chore. written no doubt in less than a week, just like the first one. give meyers the hook and lock him in a cell with adam sandler and will farrell. and don't let him out until he's developed a decent script for something, anything. he has it in him. these austin powers things are just embarrassing. <br /><br />let goldmember sink without trace.
