deathstalker is perfect for b-fantasy movie fans; this barely 80-minute travesty of film-making features everything hecklers can ask for--non-existent plotting, terrible acting (save for at least a raspy-sounding old lady), laughable scripting and schlock editing, and bargain-basement style background settings. there are no characters that come across as likable or interesting (in particular, the lead doesn't have anything appealing about him), and the actors assembled barely do anything to rise above the f-grade material. if that's not enough, then how about the lack of a compelling plot (which this movie has nothing of the sort) to make deathstalker qualify as a major turkey? i was also offended that the women in this movie barely serve any purpose other than to 1) be topless and/or scantily clad; 2) get raped; 3) have sex with the hero; 4) all of the above. in addition, the background music is hideous; a bizarre mess of electronic noise, cheesy choral bursts, and blaring orchestral cacophony. ear numbing and eye numbing all in one packed with nary a thing to keep one interested, deathstalker is probably best suited for folks looking for something to laugh at (and believe me, there's plenty of that in here). otherwise, i do not recommend this 100th-grade conan wanna-be to anyone in the least.
