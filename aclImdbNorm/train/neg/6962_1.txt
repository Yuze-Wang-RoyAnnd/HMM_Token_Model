how can such good actors like jean rochefort and carole bouquet could have been involved in such a... a... well, such a thing ? i can't get it. it was awful, very baldy played (but some of the few leading roles), the jokes are dumb and absolutely not funny... i won't talk more about this movie, except for one little piece of advice : do not go see it, it will be a waste of time and money.
