you remember the spice girls movie and how bad it was (besides the songs), well their manager simon fuller (also this band's manager) makes the same error putting s club (another of my favourite bands) in their own film. s club: tina barrett, jon lee, bradley mcintosh, jo o'meara, hannah spearritt and rachel stevens (what happened to the seventh member, paul cattermole?) basically ask their boss for a break, they go on, and while there they see themselves on tv! three of them swap, and vice versa, half discover they are clones made by a greedy scientist, and the other half just get themselves in trouble. also starring gareth gates as a clone of himself. this film may have more of a plot than spice girls' film did, but besides the songs "bring it all back", "don't stop movin'" and "never had a dream come true" this is no goo reason to see this film. not too long after the band split for good. adequate!
