lynch. the man has some really great stuff! he knows how to disturb us, then reward us by getting us think in different ways. this, however, is altogether different. dumbland's reward is 1% absurd comedy, earned by enduring 99% stupidity. i may have laughed once, but somewhere around episode 4 i just started watching on fast-forward. didn't miss a thing. i felt relieved when it ended, and that's part of the point with this series. it's an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations, rounded out with annoying animation, voices and sound. but recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make dumbland worthwhile.
