this was an awful movie. basically jane march was a half-korean north korean spy sent by kim jong il to do something horrible to the american forces in south korea. she becomes a maid for an american military family, they all regard her as being korean even though she looks more white (i believe the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 southeast asian, not at all korean), and the teenage boy of the household starts out hating her and ends up sleeping with her. the way korea and the u.s. military in korea is depicted is completely insane. of course, the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men who've never spent a day in korea prior to this movie and had no intention of showing any real insight into life in korea for either koreans or american gis and instead just tried to fulfill their pathetic asiaphile fantasies without any regard to how completely unbelievable it made the movie. anyone who's ever been to korea will know this is utter garbage. in the end the north korean honhyol spy-girl gets killed, in an obvious "paying for her sins" way. very bad film with a made-for-tv feel to it.
