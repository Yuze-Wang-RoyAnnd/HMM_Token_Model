ok, the story - a simpleminded loony enters a life of bored to death young chick and her kid brother and wreaks havoc in their lives - is mildly interesting one. anyway, ideas are nothing (everyone has some...) - the execution is everything.<br /><br />this is what bothered me with this flick. and it did bother me immensely. the rhythm (directing, editing) was slow, the pace was uneven and the climax expected. we have seen those frigging highways five, six, seven times - why? norton character's troubles were seen as a childish game, not enough deep to understand his problems / soul / blah and to root for or against him. is he a coward, a manipulator or just a loony? references to the "taxi driver" were ridiculous and unnecessary and for certain not in favor for this flick (or to e.n. for that matter).<br /><br />and imho, it is cowardly executed at the end. cheap emotional tricks for teenage lovers somewhere in mid america. this guy should have killed the kid, blamed the father, create a real havoc. or the kid should have killed the father at the end etc., but no, we have gotten cheesy ending where kids miss the loony, the father is puzzled over his own life and relationship with them and the loony, of course, dies. the happy dysfunctional family stays unharmed, safe and happily bored again so we could enjoy our pop-corns, undisturbed.<br /><br />and that scene where the loony enters the movie, oh my god, i would have to think long and hard to find something stupider than that! you do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew. creators of that movie probably thought that was a good idea but it was more than annoying. again, if you're a 16 years old girl somewhere in kansas nowhere or whatever-where and dream about having sex with a crazy man twice your age, ok, then you might enjoy this movie and its "message".
