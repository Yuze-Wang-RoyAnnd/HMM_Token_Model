it was almost unfathomable to me that this film would be a bust but i was indeed disappointed. having been a connoisseur of pekinpah cinema for years, i found this dvd, drastically reduced, for sale and thought it was worth a shot. the opening few credits, iconic to pekinpah fans, has the inter-cutting between man and animal, but here we have non-diegetic ambient noise of children playing in a schoolyard while a bomb is being planted. fantastic suspense. then, when the perps, caan and duval, travel to their next mission, duval drops the bomb on cann that his date last night had an std, found only by snooping through her purse while cann was being intimate with her. the ensuing laughter is fantastic, and is clearly paid homage to in brian depalma's dressed to kill, at the short-lived expense of angle dickenson. the problem with the killer elite is that after the opening credits, the film falls flat. even bring me the head of alfredo garcia has stronger production value, a bold call for anyone who knows what i'm talking about. i use pekinpah's credits as supplementary lecture material, but once they are finished, turn the killer elite off.
