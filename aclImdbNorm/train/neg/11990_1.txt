i wish i could give this movie a zero. cheesy effects and acting. the only reason to see this movie is so you can see how bad it is. lets start with the kid who plays brian. what a geek! i couldn't believe the mullet! then there was the talking to himself. i guess they couldn't just have the movie be silent, but still. of course they had to have him skinny-dipping too, not something i wanted to see. but jared gave a great performance, compared to the special effects department. everything from the bear to the crash was something i could do myself, and better. i seriously doubt that gary paulsen had anything to do with the production, seeing as the movie was not even called hatchet. finally, i do not think the writer had ever read the book, seeing as nothing was the same. i think the book was great, but this movie stunk like a smelly goat!
