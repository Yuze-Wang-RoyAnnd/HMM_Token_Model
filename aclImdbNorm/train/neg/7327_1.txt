heavy-handed moralism. writers using characters as mouthpieces to speak for themselves. predictable, plodding plot points (say that five times fast). a child's imitation of britney spears. this film has all the earmarks of a lifetime special reject.<br /><br />i honestly believe that jesus nebot and julia montejo set out to create a thought-provoking, emotional film on a tough subject, exploring the idea that things are not always black and white, that one who is a criminal by definition is not necessarily a bad human being, and that there can be extenuating circumstances, especially when one puts the well-being of a child first. however, their earnestness ends up being channeled into preachy dialogue and trite situations planted to move the plot along. the decent production values and interesting use of documentary-style camera footage are not enough to accomplish their aim when the script and the acting fall flat.<br /><br />logic is often compromised for the sake of creating tension: soid first tries to blackmail pablo into participating in her documentary in exchange for helping them escape, then in the same breath basically tells him not to trust her because she's not helping them out of altruism. well, duh. and for a man on the run, pablo is far too swayed by a temper tantrum. cristina's well-being is so important to him that he's fleeing capture and jail or deportation for her, but he's willing to risk all that to appease her when she doesn't want to go to mexico. right. talk above over-permissive parenting. third, when pablo's employer charlie gives the phone to detective bright, she is remarkably unprofessional, especially given her seniority - did she really think she was persuasive? oh, yeah, i would have turned myself in. cch pounder's detective wims could wipe the floor with her.<br /><br />to be fair, i'd like to list the things i liked. um, i liked the midget. and i liked the fact that the midget was named sexy. there's cross-dressing, always a plus; juvenile cross-dressing, no less! harry is infinitely cuter than cristina. but my favorite moment in the film has to be when cristina kicks detective not-so-bright. i also find it interesting that, in a heavily minority cast (which i much appreciate, by the way), the black character is the racist one. too bad it's just thrown out there and not further explored.<br /><br />there's a distinctive, unconventional score, but it's nonetheless generally context-unspecific, not enhancing mood or tension in any scene, except the pathetic, anguished wailing every time the main character is in anguish, as though they think his acting doesn't show it enough: 'just in case you weren't sure, he's upset, and we have the musical cues to prove it.'<br /><br />stilted, clich'ed dialogue results in a depressing lack of subtext; everything has to be spelled out in dialogue, even when the body language had been up 'til then conveying it just fine. for example, every impassioned speech pablo makes, and mrs. knight's lament that her child won't be crawling into bed with them in the morning.<br /><br />'papi, tell me about mama again' - what shameless, blatant exposition introducing the generic dead wife! (she's always the most beautiful woman the widower had ever seen, the kindest he had ever met. why can't we see a man cry over a woman like shakespeare's - she may be fat, ugly, obnoxious, but his love for her is deep as oceans? now _there's_ a story which would move me.)<br /><br />the police always being literally one step behind them gives many scenes the out-of-place feeling of a french farce. most boring foot chases ever - bright and lightning are so out-of-shape and easily-fooled (he certainly isn't quick as lightning, and she, well, i don't feel the need to spell things out). some guy dragging along a small child outrunning a bicycle cop, complete with macho biker picking a fight but then being felled by a child? to quote margaret cho, that's so sad. would we ever see this on 'cops '?<br /><br />hackneyed and over-the-top deus ex machina: as an employer, would you really waive checking his green card just because he can quote the author of the inspirational saying on a poster behind your desk?<br /><br />plus several scenes, including the above, threaten to devolve into porn: 'well, i'll do this favor for you, as long as you do something for me...' i can almost hear the bowm-chicka-bowm-bowm.<br /><br />when the parents view the footage shot of pablo's remorse, the grieving mom's freak-out is the most real the movie feels. unfortunately, this is diminished by the fact that she looks completely swayed by his emotional speech right up until she goes ballistic. a more ambivalent look would be more convincing here.<br /><br />i'm in constant awe of the stupidity of the main character doing things for the sake of plot: holding up a convenience store without a mask, visiting the dead girl's grave. and why doesn't the mother recognize his face from when she saw him before he drove off?! 'you seem awfully familiar...'<br /><br />what is the purpose of that wholly unnecessary, somewhat gratuitous scene with soid and the artificially-enhanced bartender? character development? tch. too little, too late.<br /><br />speaking of unnecessary traits that never went anywhere, detective lightning's saying skeptical detective bright must be a scorpio shows how little he really knows about the occult. and i don't think that believing in fate quite qualifies as voodoo mumbo jumbo.<br /><br />at the end, when bright holds pablo as he dies - wait, why does she care now? her character is as inconsistent as soid's. what, she has to shoot him just because she said 'stop, or i'll shoot'? (she's cared _so_much_ about her integrity thus far.) he was unarmed. there was no need for lethal force. what's wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize him?<br /><br />finally, cristina's childlike acceptance of her mother's death giving dr. knight peace over his daughter's death - so forced. and the contrivance of the family whose child was killed becoming cristina's new family... it angers me that she could be a 'replacement' for their little girl. it's also unrealistic that a white couple would take in the latino daughter of the man who killed their own daughter. i'm not saying there aren't generous, loving people who would do that. i'm just saying that the characters here are never developed far enough for me to believe that _they_ would do that.<br /><br />i find it offensive that another imdb reviewer said that of course as a woman she was moved by the sappy scenes. i am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that don't wax sentimental in a manufactured manner.<br /><br />co-writer, co-director, co-star nebot said himself he wore too many hats during this production. too many cooks may spoil the broth, but one cook alone just might end up making an after-school special.<br /><br />in conclusion, this film's title has less to do with the story and more to do with the feeling of regret, helplessness, and loss accompanying the revelation that you will never see your money again.
