just when i thought i would finish a whole year without giving a single movie a "bomb" rating, a friend brought this notorious turd to my house last night. i feared the worst knowing its reputation, and it was as god-awful as i'd anticipated. this is a mexican-made mess, dubbed into english, and produced by k. gordon murray. it's got terrible sets and effects, and features a rather frightening santa who doesn't operate at the north pole, but instead from a cloud in outer space, and who doesn't have little elves helping him make his toys but rather all different groups of children from practically every country there is. the opening sequence, where st. nick chuckles heartily as he observes monitors showing all these kiddies working hard while singing terrible holiday songs in a variety of languages, seems to go on forever, and with no story. obviously, this santa claus doesn't observe the child labor laws!<br /><br />eventually we get some nasty and slinky red-suited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to earth, just to make little kids naughty and turn santa's christmas eve rounds into a nightmare. watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience, and it's bound to frighten little children and turn them off santa claus and the holidays forever. oddly, the name of jesus christ is mentioned often in this christmas film, which somehow makes it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on. this easily makes my personal list of the "worst movie i've ever seen", but i'm sure that's nothing unique.
