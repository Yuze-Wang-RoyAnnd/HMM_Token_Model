everything in this film is bad , the story , the acting , the effects but its funny , funny , funny !!!scott valentine with the army uniform thats ten sizes too big is so bad with the permanent attempt at a scowl on his face as the leader of a special ops group its hilarious ! the ''terrorists'' are as scary and realistic as the ''raptors'' , this is so phoney and bad at everything it tries you have to laugh .the part where the giant t-rex who somehow snuck on board a ship and then somehow got below is blown up and you see the metal pole sticking up where its head was is the perfect ending .if your into bad films , this is the pot of gold , the mona lisa of b-b-bad !!!
