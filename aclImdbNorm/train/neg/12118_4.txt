in 1972, after his wife left to go her own way, elvis presley began dating linda thompson. miss thompson, a good-humored, long haired, lovely, statuesque beauty queen, is charted to fill a void in elvis' life. when elvis' divorce became final, linda was already in place as the legendary performer's live-in girlfriend and travel companion until 1976.<br /><br />this is a gaudy look at their love affair and companionship. linda whole-heartedly tending to her lover's needs and desires. and even putting up with his swallowing medications by the handful and introducing her to her own love affair with valium. at times this movie is harsh and dark of heart; a very unattractive look at the 'king' and his queen.<br /><br />don johnson is absolutely awful as elvis. over acting to the hilt is not attractive. stephanie zimbalist lacks the classiness of linda, but does the job pretty well. supporting cast includes: john crawford, ruta lee, and rick lenz. watching this twice is more than enough for me, but don't let this review stop you from checking it out. for most elvis fans that i have conferred with, this is not a favored presentation.
