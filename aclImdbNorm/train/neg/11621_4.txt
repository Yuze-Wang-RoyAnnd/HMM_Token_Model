i was interested in seeing this movie because i knew it was christian based. the director had a good idea/intentions when making this movie but it could have been better. i can understand why someone would still have feelings for who they believe is the greatest love of their life. however, i didn't understand why the director made his friends so insensitive, mean and rude. the main character kept apologizing to his friends when they were the ones mean to him. they weren't understanding at all and they used god as a reason to explain their behaviors. the main character, nor anyone else didn't know if the ex-girlfriend was divorced, still married etc but they were against him resolving old feelings that needed to be dealt with. his friends were suppose to be christians and should have been portrayed as being supportive whether they agreed with his decision or not. so many times we do things in life where we don't apologize to those we have hurt in the past and when he was trying to do this they were all against him. the ironic part was his new female friend accused him of having stalking behavior for simply looking up an old friend, when she did a really odd thing to get a hold of his name, address and phone number...she seemed to be the stalker!. she didn't seem like a friend at all but was only looking out for herself. god is love...and i think god wants people to be with the person they were meant to be with and i feel the movie did a terrible injustice by making it seem like god doesn't care about true love...only that you stay with someone you made a bad choice with. we all make mistakes...it's all about what steps you take to make amends. like i said the movie had potential but i was tired of the one-sided point of view being constantly repeated and jammed down the viewers throat by his so-called...well-meaning friends. this movie didn't hold true to the christian belief of love but i give it a c for its effort.
