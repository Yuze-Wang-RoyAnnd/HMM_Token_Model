much like orson welles thirty years earlier,mike sarne was given "the biggest train set in the world"to play with,but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything more than watch his train set become a train wreck that is still spoken of with shock and a strange sort of awe. despite post - modern interpretations purporting somehow to see it as a gay or even feminist tract,the fact of the matter is that it was a major disaster in 1970 and remains one today.how anyone given the resources at mr sarne's disposal could have screwed up so royally remains a closely - guarded secret.only michael cimino ever came close with the political and artistic armageddon that constitutes "heaven's gate".both films appeared to be ego trips for their respective directors but at least mr cimino had made one of the great movies of the 1970s before squandering the studio's largesse,whereas mr sarne had only the rather fey "joanna" in his locker. furthermore,"heaven's gate" could boast some memorable and well - handled set - pieces where,tragically,"myra breckinridge"s cupboard was bare. simply put,it is overwhelmingly the worst example of biting the hand that feeds in the history of hollywood.
