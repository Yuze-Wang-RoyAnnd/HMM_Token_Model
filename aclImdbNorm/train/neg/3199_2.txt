joe don baker. he was great in "walking tall" and had a good bit-part in "goldeneye", but here in "final justice" all hope is gone...the dark side has won. <br /><br />as with most of humanity, my main experience with this one was on mst3k, and what an experience it was! mike and the robots dig their claws deep into baker's ample flesh and skewer this flick completely. it's obvious they were just beginning with "mitchell" on their anti-joe don kick and here lies their continuation on a theme.<br /><br />it makes for a funny experience, though: there are plenty of choice riffs. my favorites - "john rhys-davies for sale", "it's 'meatloaf: texas ranger'", "none of them are sponge-worthy", "why was she wearing her prom dress to bed", and my favorite - "'son of a...'? what? what was he the son of: son of a preacher man?"<br /><br />by itself, "final justice" is, as joe don puts it in the movie, "a big fat nada". but here, it actually has some entertainment value. you get a chance, catch this version of "final justice".<br /><br />two stars for "final justice". ten for the mst3k version only.<br /><br />oh, and try not to visit malta when joe don's in town.
