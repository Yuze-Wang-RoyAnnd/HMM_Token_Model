oh dear, what a horrid movie.<br /><br />the production was so cheap and nasty... remember the shot from "the natural", where the lightning hits the tree (leaving a glowing stump) that roy hobbs makes a bat from?? well the producers of this movie used that same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch slammed into the house.<br /><br />i wonder if they paid to use the footage from the natural, or did they just hope that no-one who would watch the film would pick it up ?<br /><br />then at the end where they were getting trying to get away in the truck. such over-acting in the cabin. <br /><br />a really bad film, a really bad film.
