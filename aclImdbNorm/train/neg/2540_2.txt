i thought i had seen this movie, twice in fact. then i read all the other reviews, and they didn't quite match up. a man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this town to study alleged bigfoot sightings. i still feel pretty confident that this is the movie i saw, despite the discrepancies in the reviews. therefore i'm putting my review back: if you like the occasional 'b' movie, as i do, then return to boggy creek is the movie for you! whether it's setting the sleep timer, and nodding off to your favorite movie-bomb, or just hanging out with friends. boggy creek, the mute button, and you've got a fun night of improv. look out! is the legend true? i think we just might find out, along with a not-so-stellar cast. will there be any equipment malfunctions at particularly key moments in the film? does our blonde, manly, young hero have any chest hair? will the exceptionally high-tech technicolor last the entire film? you'll have to watch to find out for yourself.
