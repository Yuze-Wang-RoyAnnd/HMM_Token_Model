with no affinity towards any type of filmmaking, and a healthy appreciation of documentaries, i can honestly say i was angry at myself for bothering to sit through the entire length of "20 dates". i won't waste your time with the plot, you may read other reviews. i will say though that berkowitz's hyper, woody allen-style narration was extremely annoying. you either wished he'd lay off the coffee or ingest some tranquilizers. and it's potentially apparent to berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea, as parts of it details his trials to finance the documentary. forgive me for disguising insults as compliments, but i'll give credit to berkowitz for having the skills to convince some idiot to finance this horrid piece of ****. i appreciate the boundaries & intentions of the film here, but even when regarding the standards berkowitz sets for himself, he fires off and misses on all levels. in closing, i'm sure many of these female companions were not at ease going on a date with a twitchy wanna-be filmmaker, and therefore i question the film's sense of authenticity. hey myles, i loved your film the first time i saw it... when it appeared as an episode of seinfeld or was a film directed by woody allen or kevin smith.
