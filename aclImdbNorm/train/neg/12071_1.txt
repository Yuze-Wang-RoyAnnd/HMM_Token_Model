terrible...just terrible. probably the worst film i have ever seen. and i did see some pretty bad pictures, throughout the years. the sound sucks so does the quality of the picture, the direction, the acting...etc, etc. the only good shoots( meaning funny, because they're so bad ) are the special effects. overall there are about 5 minutes worth of laughs. the rest of the flick gives you brain damage.
