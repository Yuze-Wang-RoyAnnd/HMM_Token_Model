i got the dvd very cheap and i'm a total drewbie, and thats probably the only constellation where this movie could ever interest anyone.<br /><br />an early drew movie, she's looking great, and she gets a quite lot of really cute scenes of her, like a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, quite a number of sexy outfits etc. she does never show the friendly charm we know from her more recent movies.<br /><br />the movie itself is pretty average or sub-average, and much more looking like being made for the tv than one for the cinema. there is no real horror or tension built up and the dialogs are often cheesy.<br /><br />the most interesting part is probably the end because i honestly don't understand it. but maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway. but at least you don't get the end you would be expecting, and it also comes much sooner than one would have expected.<br /><br />overall i think this movie is exclusively for drewbies.
