oh dear, oh dear. i started watching this not knowing what to expect. i couldn't believe what i was seeing. there were times when i thought it was a comedy. i loved how the government's plan to capture the terrorist leader is to air drop in one man, who is unarmed, and expect him to capture him and escape with a rocket pack. if only it were really that easy. i've finally found a movie worse than "plan 9 from outer space".
