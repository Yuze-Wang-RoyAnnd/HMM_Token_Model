having seen the first ten episodes, i must say this show sucks. <br /><br />what bothers me the most, is that the show was shot in canada. i know it's cheaper, but they should have shot it in california, so we could have had scenes in the desert. that would have been more true to the movie. the first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains, with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold. that does'nt feel very egyptian. what worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient egypt. here it feels like they're running around fighting aliens in a canadian forrest. and it's so lame that appaerantly, on other planets, the fall comes as well. you can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside vancouver. it just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb. <br /><br />and then there is richard dean anderson. he is no kurt russel. sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy russels performance a little bit, but he is just not as cool as russel. and not nearly as good an actor as russel. and russells way of playing o neill, well he was much more cynical. andersons o neil, is way too soft. i liked it that russels version just did'nt give a s*** and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie. <br /><br />michael shanks does a really good job as jackson though taking over from james spader.<br /><br />teal'c is a really annoying character. he is jaffa. not a jaffa. just jaffa. aaaarrgh!! a former bodyguard of a pathetic ra character, seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far. teal'c speaks talks and acts like a robot. i've seen better acting from jean claude van damme.<br /><br />and the fact that teal'c and the ra character and the people they saved in the movie, can speak english all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb. what made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters. <br /><br />as for the special effects, they are really good in the pilot. but the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap. especially a planet they visit with crystals. it's so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background. it's an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap. especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds. <br /><br />the x-files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993. that was 4 years before sg-1 started. and they did'nt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode, that sg-1 supposedly had. they must have spend all the money on catering. because i don't see it on the screen. <br /><br />incredibly boring and pointless show, that could have been great if they had shot the show in hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters.
