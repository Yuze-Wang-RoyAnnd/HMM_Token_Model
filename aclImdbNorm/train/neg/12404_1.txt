i must say this movie is a mork and mindy knock off, when watching it i got the chills, i even wet myself a little. when that korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time. any way back on track chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being. some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of christmas past. this movie is so bad i put my new born child in a box and left it in mr. norris mailbox. he can raise my kid i'm not letting him into a world where he thinks chuck norris is a karate expert ill let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life.
