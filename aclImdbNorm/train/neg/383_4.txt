the plot line of no one sleeps is not a bad idea, and the subject matter is of quite a bit of interest. but, throughout watching this film, we were saying aloud, "these filmmakers go to the trouble of finding good locations, the lighting is good, makeup and hair are good...why is the sound so bad?" throughout the film the sound was echoy, garbled and much of the dialog was unintelligible.<br /><br />there is some good acting in this film, and i think jim thalman is really a good actor. this story, with some of the same actors, would have been worth doing as a high-budget film.<br /><br />i just can't reiterate enough - if you have a limited budget, dedicate more to good sound. sound is as much a part of a film as the image, and it's worth doing right. could've earned a 6.
