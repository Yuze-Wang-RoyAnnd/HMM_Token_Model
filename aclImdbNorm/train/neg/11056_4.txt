i was so disappointed in this movie. i don't know much about the true story, so i was eager to see it play out on film and educate myself about a little slice of history. with such a powerful true story and great actors it seemed like a surefire combination. well, somewhere the screenplay failed them. it was so scattered - is this movie about his childhood? his love life? his own disability? his speaking ability? his passion for the disabled? i'm sure there is a way to incorporate all of those things into a good story, but this movie wasn't it. i was left cold watching characters that were unlikable not because of their disabilities, but because of their personalities. other small gripes: 1. the heavy-handed soundtrack. it's the seventies - we get it already! 2. if he's such a phenomenal public speaker, why weren't we treated to more than a snippet here and there - and even then mostly in montages?
