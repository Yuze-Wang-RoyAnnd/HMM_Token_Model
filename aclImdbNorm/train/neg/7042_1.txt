this has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. even for a biker movie, it's rock bottom. the minimal plot involves a gang of bikers taking over a small town (how original!) and the townspeople's attempts to fight them off. why don't they call for outside help? who knows? the fight scenes are obviously fake. adam west and tina louise are in it but both have little to do and both look ashamed to be there (understandably) this movie belongs in the trash heap!
