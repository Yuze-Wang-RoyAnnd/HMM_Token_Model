wow, the plot for this film is all over the place! there is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin!! and, as a result, none of it seemed particularly believable.<br /><br />the movie starts with kay francis as a housewife living in a small town. she's had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to broadway. when a big-time actor arrives in town, she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost. but, her husband is worried about shenanigans--as this actor is a cad. so, the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actor--and the actor dies! as a result, he's convicted of first degree murder!!! not manslaughter, but murder 1! now, pregnant and in need of funds, kay goes to new york. but broadway jobs aren't to be found, so she's forced to take any job--even burlesque. unable to adequately care for her young daughter, she gives it to another woman to raise. however, eventually she does find a job in a real broadway play and everything looks rosy. but, the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play. despondent, she makes her way to england and becomes a real star. years later, she returns to new york to get her kid--but the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother. at the same time, her husband's lawyer now thinks that if he gets $10,000 he can get the man out of prison. as another reviewer wrote, is this to bribe people?! how can $10,000 get him out otherwise--maybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up!! wow--this is enough for 2 or 3 films! and, all this occurs by the 45 minute mark!!! believe it or not, there's quite a bit more to it. if you really care, see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds.<br /><br />this is sort of like 'kitchen sink writing'--throwing in practically everything and hoping, somehow, it will all work. unfortunately, the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite ms. francis' best efforts. it's the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2nd-rate plot. it's almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements, threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie!! overall, unless you are a die-hard kay francis fan or love anything hollywood made in the 1930s, this one is one you can easily skip. not terrible but certainly not good.<br /><br />by the way, the child who plays francis' daughter upon her return to new york (sybil jason) really was terrible. i think she was supposed to be...i think.
