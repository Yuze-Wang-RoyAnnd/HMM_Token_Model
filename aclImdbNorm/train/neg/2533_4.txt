i agree with most if not all of the previous commenter's tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). the zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement.<br /><br />i have seen zatoichi 1-13,15,16; i believe 14 has not been released on zone 1 (usa). zatoichi the outlaw was disappointing. the story line was complicated, and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous zatoichi story lines. at one point, i was wondering if i was not seeing a remake of a previous zatoichi film.<br /><br />this film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects (a head rolling, limbs severed, blood) and less on the nobility of the zatoichi character. all the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action, and won a great following without having to resort to effects.<br /><br />i am just hoping that the remaining zatoichi films do not follow the same trend. this is the first zatoichi film from his studio. i highly recommend all the previous zatoichi films -- and recommend them.
