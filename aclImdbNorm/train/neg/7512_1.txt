i had to walk out of the theater. after an hour, all i was seeing was people cheating on wives, schtupping like dogs in a rut, and using the f-word like a diabetic using equal.<br /><br />no thanks.<br /><br />it was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot. any one of the characters could have been quite interesting if they were given more to do than fornicate, talk about it, and swear at each other.<br /><br />the few times that it looked as if there were about to be some sort of character development, all that happened was another sex scene. plot development in the 1st hour can be summarized as 1)several murders occur, 2) vinnie sees murder scene 3) vinnie stares moodily across atlantic/east/hudson river 4) vinnie cheats on wife, and 5) joey (most sympathetic character in the show) gets kicked out of his parents' house. more than that, i didn't wait to see.<br /><br />the photography and the interplay between the characters were superb, but there was nothing for them to do. the flood of sex and vulgarity was hardly worth waiting another hour for something to happen.<br /><br />sorry, spike. take some lessons from notting hill, or shawshank redemption. either one is a better study in community and interpersonal relationships.
