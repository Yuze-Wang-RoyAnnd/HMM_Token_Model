but this movie was a bore. the history part was fine but the musical part was not. not one song i cared about and no soundtrack to be heard.<br /><br />if sweet jesus" was suppose to be comic relief it never work. if john adams was suppose to be the obnoxious annoying one, the rest of them were trying to overthrow him in every scene.<br /><br />hancock and jefferson were the only bearable characters in the whole movie.<br /><br />the historical quotes and the debate about slavery in their historical context were interesting enough but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical.<br /><br />shouldn't you be humming the songs after a musical, except for a few chirps, nothing else was worth the breath.
