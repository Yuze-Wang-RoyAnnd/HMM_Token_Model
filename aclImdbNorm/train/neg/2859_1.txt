it's made in 2007 and the cg is bad for a movie made in 1998. at one part in the movie there is a stop motion shot of a dinosaur that actually looks good, but this just makes the extremely amateur work on the cg stuff look even worse.<br /><br />the writing, acting, directing and everything else in this movie is just terrible. this is as bad as, if not worse than raptor island and 100 million bc... pure crap! again, as with the other movies, the only scary part about this movie is that it actually got made and is now being aired on the sci-fi channel.<br /><br />i still can't understand how they somehow get people who do have some acting skills to act in these movies and then somehow get them to act as terrible as everyone else in the movie.<br /><br />for those of you who are unsure, the other poster is obviously being sarcastic in his review... or he is one of the people who worked on this movie.
