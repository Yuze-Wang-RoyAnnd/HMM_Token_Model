bob clampett's 'porky's poor fish' is a so-so cartoon populated by appalling puns and one or two nice moments. set in porky's fish shoppe, 'porky's poor fish' occupies an uncomfortable area between a standard black 'n' white porky cartoon and one of the books-come-to-life merrie melodies that were popular at that time. typically of many of the early porky cartoons, porky is far from the star, appearing only in a rather stilted opening musical number and the climax of the film. for the rest of the time the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal but gets more than he bargained for. unfortunately, the audience gets far less than they bargained for. as was sometimes the case in the books-come-to-life series, the spotlight is thrown on punning signs which could have worked just as well in a non-animated medium. laughs are scarce and, while the cartoon is just about saved by clampett's energetic direction, there is very little at all to recommend 'porky's poor fish' over any of the other below-par early porky cartoons.
