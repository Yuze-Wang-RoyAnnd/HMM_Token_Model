i found this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store. that seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there. from romero's 'dead' trilogy to '28 days later.' however upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.<br /><br />it is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory. there is no horror here folks. just some half-way decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last... and last... and last... and soon you get the feeling maybe you're dvd player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie. it's a pity. i think anyone could find a better use for $7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o' crud. though some of the 360 effects were cool, but once again, they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time, just with a different character.<br /><br />also what is royally annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game. i've played the game. it sucks. so why did they put it in here? oh that's right, this isn't a movie but a music video, and it's a poor one at that. 3/10<br /><br />rated r: a lot of violence/gore, and profanity
