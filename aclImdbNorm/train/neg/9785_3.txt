this film, for an after school special, isn't that bad, and that's the problem. nothing happens. you feel as if you're still in class. a guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players. we never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them. they all of the sudden turn into good players by meditating. also there are too many characters and no character development. too much time is spend on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids. this could have had a 'bad news bears' feel (the original) since there was a girl on an all boys team, but there wasn't any feel to this movie at all. it has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it, is not fun to bag on, not fun to watch, and is just kind of... there. plain. boring. something you'd watch after school before your pre-evening nap. as dull as the day is long and it's been a long, long day watching this movie.
