where to start. the film started out pretty well, but after the 30 min mark i caught myself watching the clock. the horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in. it just got stupider and stupider as time ticked by.<br /><br />the actors gave an average performance in this movie however, i got a bit bored of vinny jones constant scowling in the film.<br /><br />as the film dragged on, and take my word for it, it dragged on, it just got more and more far fetched.<br /><br />*** spoiler alert *** spoiler alert *** spoiler alert *** just when i thought the film could not get any worse, towards the end loads if skeleton looking monsters turned up, just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all. it turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end. the ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was. once the lead role disposes of vinny jones, he becomes the new killer.<br /><br />in closing, this film made creep look like the best horror film ever made. i gave it 1 star because the female lead did a pretty good job but even she could not save this train wreck of a movie!!
