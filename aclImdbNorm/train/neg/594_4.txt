i just rented creep and was not at all impressed. i didn't feel anything in this film. i felt sick because the gore alone was shocking.<br /><br />i walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film. haven't we seen this all before? i didn't like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage. i felt bad for him. but then again i couldn't think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the creep? so many questions need to be answered.<br /><br />someone mentioned references to the ps2 game silent hill and i can see similarities vaguely.<br /><br />not a bad film, not a good one. judge for yourself.
