the motion picture was, in all likelihood, made in the year 1930 and released in 1931. i would surmise that talking motion pictures had great difficulty in making the transition from the silent era. nevertheless, this particular zane grey plot appears to be very weak. also, gary cooper was probably just learning to act. the result is something that would not be acceptable by today's standards. for 1931, maybe. for 2004, not acceptable. some of the actors performed well. sadly, the indians always get the short end in these early westerns. they were living on the land long before the white man came, but according to twisted history, they had no right to defend themselves.
