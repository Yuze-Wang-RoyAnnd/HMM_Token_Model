i truly despised this film when i saw it at the age of about 6 or 7 as i was a huge fan of robin williams and nothing he could do was bad. until this. this complete trash ruined robin for me for a long time. i'm only recovering recently with his funny but serious part in fathers day but then he went on to create another mistake, bicenntinial man i think it was called but the point is. robin should be getting much better jobs by now and now he has returned to performing the slime that originated with this 'classic'.
