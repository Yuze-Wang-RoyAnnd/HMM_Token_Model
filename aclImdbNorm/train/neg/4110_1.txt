it's just breathtaking in it's awfulness-- you really must see it!<br /><br />depending on your perspective, dylan walsh is either the savior or the problem here: since he's the only one on screen that can actually get his lines out with something akin to natural cadences and inflection, he either ruins the movie by pointing up everyone else's flaws, or he saves it by providing some context for their awfulness.<br /><br />i'm inclined to the later view-- thanks to him, it works as high comedy. he's the 7 footer in a game of dwarf basketball, his skill set just doesn't apply in this context, and his discombobulation is delicious.<br /><br />the real treat though is ms. eastwood, whose inability to speak in plain english is so pervasive i actually googled her, expecting to learn that she was a russian beauty who pronounced her lines phonetically, with no understanding of their meaning. but no: she's just a talent free american who will leave you laughing with every line she drops. whether she knew what the lines meant must remain an open question.
