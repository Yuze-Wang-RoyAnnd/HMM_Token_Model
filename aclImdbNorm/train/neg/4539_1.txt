i have never seen anything as awful as this movie for quite some time. the movie was boring, long long and awful plot. the special effects sucks like hell - it's like watching a movie back in 1999. it's a total waste of an hour and a half of my time. matthew settle's performance was quite bad. i saw him in band of brothers playing lt.speirs, he wasn't that bad. in fact not bad at all. but in this film, his acting wasn't convincing enough, it was quite bad and there wasn't any chemistry between the rest of the crew either. plus, his eyes seems empty like he's not feeling it. it surprised me, really, because he was good in band of brothers.<br /><br />anyway, don't even bother to watch this movie. it's a big big big waste of time. even if you had to kill an hour or two, get something else to do besides watching this movie. trust me, you'll regret it!
