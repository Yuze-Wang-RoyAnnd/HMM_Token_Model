although this is generally a cheesy jungle-adventure movie, it does have some highlights - the settings are quite beautiful, and the pacing of the adventure is good. you won't be bored watching it.<br /><br />keith is as breezy as possible playing the eponymous lead, an unabashedly drunk jungle guide shanghai'd into escorting rich boy van hoffman and his gorgeous wife shower on a hunting expedition in cannibal country. he never takes things seriously . shower is there as decoration and keith makes extensive use of her - she doesn't really have to act much. she's not the only female to show off her body and the prurient aspects of the film make it about halfway to a t/a picture.<br /><br />there's nothing in this film that would draw specific attention to it, or away from it. produced to be shlock, it succeeds without too much fuss. a good 2 am cable programmer.
