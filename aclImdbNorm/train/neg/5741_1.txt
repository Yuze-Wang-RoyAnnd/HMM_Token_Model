<br /><br />i am a big-time horror/sci-fi fan regardless of budget, but after watching countless horror movies late night on cable and video, this has to be the worst of all movies. with bloody special effects (what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that kept being shown over and over again) and people running around screaming from left, then to right, then back again. it should have stayed with the beginning convenience store scene and stopped there and been 15 minutes. instead, it is dragged out very long. it is very, very x5 low budget. many scenes were way, way too long. narrator sounded very amateurish like a random person out of junior high was talking. this is the only movie to rate lower in my opinion than manos, red zone cuba, benji,and godzilla vs. megalon despite their higher budgets. 10 snoozes, try to stay awake through whole movie in one setting or better yet, avoid it like you would an undead brain-eating mob. the why-did-i-ever-see-this-piece-of-zombie-dung-blues. epitome of nauseatingly bad made movies etc..ad infinitum. -infinity/10
