the opening shot was the best thing about this movie, because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate, well-crafted independent film. damn that opening shot for filling me hope. as the "film" progressed in a slow, plodding manner, my thoughts were varied in relation to this "film": was there too much butter in my popcorn? did the actors have to pay the director to be in this "film"? did i get my ticket validated at the box office? yes, dear reader. i saw this film in the theatre! this would be the only exception i will make about seeing a film at home over a movie theatre, because at home you can turn it off. were there any redeeming values? peter lemongelli as the standard college "nerd" had his moments, especially in a dog collar. other than that this "film" went from trying to be a comedy, to a family drama to a spiritual uplifter. it succeeded on none of these fronts. oh, and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad. her performance was the only comedy i found.
