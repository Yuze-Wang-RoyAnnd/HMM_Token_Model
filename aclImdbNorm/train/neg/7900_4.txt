the title creatures wreak havoc at a peaceful little desert town. that's basically the whole plot for this film, and while the scenes devoted to the munchies themselves are somewhat fun (in a lowbrow kind of way), all the rest is just filler, and bad filler at that. from the "hero", who is a painful woody allen wannabe, to the ultra-dumb town cop, it's hard to pick the most irritating character in the film. there were some times when almost all of them were on the screen together and i was thinking, "ok, at least the girlfriend is cute, but why do we have to put up with the rest of those morons?". the film is also filled with pop references (from ozzy osbourne to linda blair), which probably made it already dated by the early 90's.
