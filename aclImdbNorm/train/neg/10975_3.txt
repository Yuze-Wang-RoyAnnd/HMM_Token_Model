this movie blows - let's get that straight right now. there are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot. colin farrel looks like brad pitt in "12 monkeys" and acts in a similar manner. i normally hate colin because he is a fairy in general but he's ok in this movie. there were two plot lines in this movie-= one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache. let's face it- this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go. the characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script. the whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional ok scene. but overall- don't bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the lucky charms elf -an american fetish that has catapulted some truly crappy movies to success.
