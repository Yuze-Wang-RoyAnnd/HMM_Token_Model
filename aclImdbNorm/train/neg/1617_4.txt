what an unusual movie.<br /><br />absolutely no concessions are made to "hollywood special effects" or entertainment. there is no background music, not special effects or enhanced sound.<br /><br />facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the spanish language is a strange monotonic lilt that sounds the same whether in the midst of a battle or talking around a campfire.<br /><br />i sort of viewed these movies (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience, not really something to go and get entertained by. its quite long and in places dull.<br /><br />but i suspect that given the lack of any plot development, i don't think its very educational either.<br /><br />its also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue - it would be a good idea to read up a little on the history so that you can understand the context of what is happening, since for some reason the director didn't see fit to inform the audience why che's band was moving around the way they did - as a result there seem to be groups skulking around the woodland for no particular reason and getting shot at.<br /><br />i would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing depth of character, but somehow all of the characters were still strangers to me at the end. the stars it gets are for realism and showing the hardships of guerrilla warfare.
