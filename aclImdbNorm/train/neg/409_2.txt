<br /><br />paul verhoeven finally bombed out on this one. he became a joke on himself. once again we have a film which includes sex and violence, immorality, leering at women and lots of attitiude talk between the characters and dollying pans.<br /><br />its all for nothing. because their is no action at all in this film. it fudges all its set pieces. all the actors give the kind of performances form a verhoeven film. in other words rampant over acting on almost every level. starship troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world the characters inhabited. in this scientists are acting the same way. sorry paul but soldiers and scientist are not really made of the same mindset.<br /><br />one major flaw in the plot was that after escaping for that one night to do evil things kevin bacons character then returns back to the science lab where we have already spent more then enough time watching these animated manniquens (elizabeth shue excepted) walk and talk. why not show the extent of what the character could do in the outside world. how could they possibly track him if he could be anywhere at all??? think os all the different things that could have been done with this concept, both in terms of story and characterisation. then look at what this film does and you really how badly done and concieved the whole project really was.<br /><br />more insulting is the doco on the dvd where everyone is claiming that verhoeven is some kind of mad genius. well one out of two isnt that bad.<br /><br />this film has nothing of note in it. just like the title says.<br /><br />hollow!!!
