my wife and i started to watch this movie with anticipation. it looked warm and touching. it started out well; but, soon became boring and frankly idiotic after a while. it got so bad that we turned it off the movie was poorly acted and honesty, we couldn't really understand or wanted to understand what exactly why or how the hell they could put up with this woman! you lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acting wackos singing and cleaning. i would have had her committed. and, of course, like most movies and t.v series made in hollywood we have to throw it a token "gay" character! this movie was boring. i was expecting more from diane keaton!
