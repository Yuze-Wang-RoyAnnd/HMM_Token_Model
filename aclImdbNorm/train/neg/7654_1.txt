i remember reading all the horrible, horrible reviews for this film when it came out. i meant to go see how horrible it was but it was out of theaters in three weeks. the only other movie to manage that is gigli. <br /><br />when the movie came out on dvd, i bought it to see how awful it was. i couldn't think of the sheer horrible attention that this film was getting was possible. after seeing it, i can understand. <br /><br />first off, let me say that this film is not without some cool shots. there's a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun, which i thought was neat. and the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at; but it gets old after the first time you see it. <br /><br />let me start with the worst thing in this movie: tara reid. if bad acting was a sin, then hell would've chucked tara reid right out since she's so unbelievably awful in this movie it's unthinkable. and of all the roles, she plays a curator. now if she played a dumb, empty- headed sex toy then maybe i might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character. apparently, uwe boll didn't realize that, although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie, people would see it. he just didn't realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad. and is that a mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping? i couldn't tell. <br /><br />which brings me to my next complaint: uwe boll shows off some of the worst directing skills you'll ever see in a movie. i mean, i'd give house of the dead an f (and i only do that for very few movies) but hotd would score at least a b compared to this screwed up piece of junk. the movie starts off with a very, very long narration that causes immediate confusion (and read by a horrible narrator) and from there, the cuts are really, really dumb. there's this one point where slater and reid are looking around a building that's been destroyed and the screen blackens out. when it comes back, slater and reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly, an entire army has joined them. huh? <br /><br />and someone did not bother checking the mistakes in this movie. at one point, a team breaks through glass, but the glass breaks before they touch it. tara reid's earrings switch colors in the middle of one scene and after slater walks away from a dead comrade, you can see her begin to get up. <br /><br />as for the story... i was really lost. something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone "opens the path" or something and all the evil monsters pop out. it's just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes (the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this film) that get, quite simply, boring. <br /><br />i bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was. i didn't laugh, but i still think it's stupid. very, very, very stupid.
