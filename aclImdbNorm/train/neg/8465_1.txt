i can't believe how awful this movie turned out to be. i feel magnanimous even referring to it as a "movie". the acting was flat, the editing was terrible and the plot leaves many major questions unanswered. the premise was ok, if unoriginal: a small group of aliens is living in the us and trying to slowly take over humanity. but it goes rapidly downhill from there. how could they convince a "human" to accept an alien as his wife in order to make they alien-human hybrid they require? they show a larval alien but never show what it does. they have a plastic surgeon that can produce perfect looking skin on an industrial scale. they throw in the obligatory huge alien monster with teeth. the ending was almost too painful to watch. i suppose that i'm mostly disappointed that bruce boxlietner would have anything to do with this. how could he say to the huge alien monster with teeth, "get away from him you son of a b*tch" with a straight face? it's a long fall from his babylon 5 days. avoid this at all costs.
