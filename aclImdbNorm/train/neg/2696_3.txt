i know john singleton's a smart guy 'coz he made boyz n the hood, so how did he write and direct this? it's like the pilot of a bad "going away to college for the first time" teen soap, a parade of boring stereotypes and cliches with some gratuitous violence thrown in to make it a commercial proposition, i guess. who would've guessed the date-rape victim would dump sausage for seafood? the angry loner would be preyed upon by a group of neo-nazis (and would be roomed-up with a black and a jew - just for laughs!) even laurence fishburne's creepy reactionary history professor just irritated me and i love the guy, it's like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot. except busta rhymes, of course. big ups.
