a friend of mine was in the cast as a feds agent (a non-speaking part, as i recall). he brought it over on dvd so i could see it. it was "interesting", but very much felt like an amateur film. a well made amateur film, though. really boring and poorly written. it was probably fun to make and be involved in, but it definitely didn't deserve any kind of wide release. maybe in omaha they'd enjoy it, but this california girl was bored and honestly kind of embarrassed for my friend's involvement.<br /><br />if this film maker has made or makes any more films, he really should try to have a really interesting story line, and good actors. i'm sure this was a great learning tool for them. i wish them luck in the future, and hope they can improve their film making.
