there are often badly-matched couples (in the general sense of the term) -in huston's movies :"african queen" "heaven knows mister allison" "roots of heaven" "misfits" ..."the barbarian and the geisha" (check the title) is another good example,so to speak.it seems that japanese stuff was trendy at the time as such works as "sayonara" " the world of suzie wong" and "the teahouse of the august moon" bear witness. huston's effort might be the worst of this rather bad lot(with the exception of "susie " maybe).john wayne perfectly fits in ford's world ,in huston's he's like a bull in a china shop.his japanese partner is totally bland.even the dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the movie from absolute boredom.<br /><br />only those utterly enamoured of huston's every work need to choose this ,among all his other great movies around.
