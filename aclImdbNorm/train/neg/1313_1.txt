don't bother trying to watch this terrible mini series. it is a six hour bore, an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other. there is no heat in this story, no real passion, no real romance. it is a dry, boring, drawn out, and uninspired as they come. and it doesn't even meet the expected level of technical proficiency. take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile.
