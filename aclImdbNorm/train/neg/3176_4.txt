the lovely eva longoria parker plays kate, who dies after an ice angel crushes her before the "i do's" with fianc'e henry(paul rudd). after two years henry has yet to move on and his sister chloe(lindsay sloane)is very concerned. chloe arranges for henry to talk with an attractive psychic ashley(lake bell). ashley is to contact kate's spirit hoping to help henry get on with his life. when the psychic starts getting attracted to henry, kate's ghost appears to nip the romance in the bud. there are some funny situations; but if you've seen the trailers you have seen the substance of the film. also in the cast: stephen root, jason biggs, william morgan sheppard and wendi mclendon-covey. i personally thought that bell stole the show from parker. and biggs as usual a pain in the butt. still this movie was over-hyped.
