also known in a different form as "house of exorcism," this messy<br /><br />little film takes itself so seriously as to kill any entertainment value<br /><br />whatsoever.<br /><br />the spare plot involves european tourist elke sommer who has a<br /><br />chance run in with telly savalas, who looks just like the devil she<br /><br />saw on a fresco in the square. sommer is given a ride to a<br /><br />mysterious house in the country, where savalas happens to be<br /><br />butler. there, she is mistaken for a long dead woman, and the real<br /><br />soap opera theatrics begin. the house's blind matriarch's<br /><br />husband had an affair with the dead woman, who was the<br /><br />matriarch's son's fiancee. the couple who gave sommer the ride?<br /><br />well, the woman is giving the chauffeur, uh, "back seat driving<br /><br />lessons," and the husband knows and does not care. eventually,<br /><br />most of the cast is killed, sommer is drugged and raped,<br /><br />escapes, and the viewer is taken to a climax on board an empty<br /><br />airplane...which must have resembled the empty theaters this<br /><br />thing played in.<br /><br />the alternate version of this, "house of exorcism," has scenes<br /><br />added involving a priest.<br /><br />the vhs copy of this, from elite entertainment, is crystal clear and<br /><br />letterboxed. there are "extras" after the end credits; deleted sex<br /><br />and gore scenes.<br /><br />mario bava's direction is fast and furious, but his screenplay is<br /><br />awful. there are half baked ideas, abandoned plotlines, and<br /><br />stunning conveniences that do nothing more than propel this thing<br /><br />in some sort of forward direction. you have life like dummies for<br /><br />practice funerals, the blind matriarch does not act all that blind,<br /><br />and savalas is given the same lollipops he had in "kojak," (who<br /><br />haunts ya, baby?).<br /><br />the project seems like they had two name stars, then wrote the<br /><br />script quickly, something that happens in hollywood on a daily<br /><br />occurrence now. savalas looks completely lost, delivering his<br /><br />lines haltingly, and wishing his character had not died in "the dirty<br /><br />dozen." sommer runs around and screams and gasps a lot, but<br /><br />her character is a blank, i use the term "character" loosely. the<br /><br />only thing we know about her is her name.<br /><br />this is a real weird film, and your reaction to it might depend on<br /><br />how heavily you are into eurohorror, and kojak. i for one cannot<br /><br />recomment "lisa and the devil."<br /><br />this is unrated, and including all the extras at the end of the vhs<br /><br />copy, contains strong physical violence, sexual violence, strong<br /><br />gore, strong female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, and adult<br /><br />situations
