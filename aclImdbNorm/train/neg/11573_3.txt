i came here for a review last night before deciding which tv movie to settle in front of, and those i found made this one look unmissable. how misled i feel!<br /><br />firstly, it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a housewife's daytime movie. the performances are wooden, every sentence is an attempt at 'poignant' in the way that housewife's daytime movies and bad soap operas always are, and it is based in that predictable and well-trodden premise that men (particularly soldiers) are essentially violent and incompassionate. the whole movie is about the 'drama' apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension.<br /><br />if that sounds tolerable (or even enjoyable) to you, then be warned. linda hamilton's german accent, while quite good, is painfully distracting - as is her face, for some reason. the other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators, with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day. there are few surprises, but do watch for the 'monty pythonesque' endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers' knapsacks!<br /><br />i wasn't expecting action, but i had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged. what i got was a particularly bad christmas 'feelgood' story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence of it all.<br /><br />watch it under the folowing circumstances: 1: there's nothing else on. 2: you are a fan of predictable 'housewife takes on men and wins' tv movies. 3: the only way you can appreciate a true story is when hollywood turns it into a feature film. 4: you've imbibed enough nog that your emotions are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling.
