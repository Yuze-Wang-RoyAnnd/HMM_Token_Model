to this day when you speak of the japanese cinema, most folks won't talk about rashomon, or the seven ronin, or ran. to the masses the japanese cinema means all those monsters we've grown to love destroying those japanese cities over and over again, lots of times in battles with each other. the first and greatest of these is godzilla who's come back a dozen times or more and in a few films faced the three headed hydra like monster from outer space, ghidrah.<br /><br />oddly enough in keeping with the times, the special effects got slightly better. but part of the charm of those old films was seeing those paper mache city sets destroyed, they looked so phony, maybe three steps above ed wood.<br /><br />some visitors from the future have time traveled to japan to urge that godzilla be destroyed from when he was first discovered. and in fact he was first discovered as a surviving dinosaur during world war ii when he protected the japanese garrison on a pacific island from those american troops. but later on with atomic testing on bikini, godzilla the friendly dinosaur just like barney became the mean machine we've grown to know in the cinema.<br /><br />of course you eliminate godzilla than you give ghidrah a clear field to wreck japan so it does not become the economic colossus it was by 1991 when the film came out. more i won't say, but we all know japan is doing reasonably well as 2010.<br /><br />like all the other japanese monster films, just sit back and enjoy the mayhem.
