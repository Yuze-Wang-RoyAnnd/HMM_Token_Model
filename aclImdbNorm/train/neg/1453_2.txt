i'm not sure it was the language or the poor acting, but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake.<br /><br />after seeing der untergang this is a huge disappointment. there's no connection between different scenes, and the acting is so incredibly poor i couldn't even believe people could make such a mess of something that had great potential.<br /><br />and above all, everyone in germany speaks english. big mistake. the german language has a certain sound to it, and especially hitler himself only sounds like hitler when he's speaking/yelling german.<br /><br />the way the story is told made me believe it was improvised on the spot, the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happened.<br /><br />whether it's the english or the fact that i've already seen der untergang, everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous.
