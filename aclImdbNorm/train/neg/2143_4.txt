i grew up watching the original disney cinderella, and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn.<br /><br />accordingly, i was excited to see that cinderella 2 was coming on tv and i would be able to see it.<br /><br />i should have known better.<br /><br />this movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone. it holds absolutely none of the originals super charm! it seems, to me, quite rough, and almost brutal, right from the (don't)sing-a-longs to the characterization.<br /><br />while i remember the character's telling a story through a song, this film's soundtrack was laid over the top, and didn't seem to fit. jaq's transformation into a human is a prime example: where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there, he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall! and in the ballroom, there's old barn dance type country music. it's as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set. the upbeat fiddles certainly didn't fit.<br /><br />even the artwork and animation in cinderella 2 isn't up to scratch with the original. the artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed. and we see part of cinderella's hoop skirt, which doesn't feel right.<br /><br />the movie itself could have been it's own story, i think that it should have been just that. i wouldn't say that i hate it, but i believe that it had many shortcomings. it seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved cinderella original.
