sex wish was actually released (minus ten minutes of more, ahem, 'extreme' footage) here in the uk back in the early days of the video boom, and caused a tabloid storm in a teacup when it allegedly inspired a copycat murder case. strangely enough, the papers brushed this ultra-disturbing flick under the carpet in their headlong rush to get the comparatively innocuous likes of frozen scream and night of the demon canned, and the film has been all but forgotten as a result. i jumped at the chance to watch it on a dvd-rw and spent most of the film's duration with my jaw on the floor. it's not so much politically incorrect as utterly demented, a triple-x take on michael winner's death wish (did the title kind of give the game away as far as inspiration was concerned?) with hardcore sex and some truly nasty violence thrown into an already bubbling brew of seventies sleaze. if you don't consider yourself to be squeamish, this may force you to think again. by the time sex wish is over, you'll want to scrub your eyeballs clean with disinfectant and take a long hot shower to purge yourself. if any film truly deserves the "it's only a movie, only a movie, only a movie" tag-line, it's this one.<br /><br />highlights (or lowlights) - a rapist using a vibrator on a victim as he masturbates over her, harry reems's scene-stealing moustache, the helpless young black couple who are forced to screw in front the sword cane killer (they'd have won oscars for their entirely credible performances if the academy had gone mad) before the man is castrated for his troubles, and some jarringly slick direction that threatens to lift the proceedings above their obvious grind-house origins. don't say i didn't warn you. if you thought the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago, sex wish will prove you very, very wrong.
