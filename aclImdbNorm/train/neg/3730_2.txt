first off there is nothing wrong with studying daniel, revelation, matthew 24, isaiah and other prophetic scriptures. there is also nothing wrong with making a film such as this to attempt to present the gospel message. so my qualms with this movie are not in either its sincerity or aspirations. as a christian, though an amillenialist, i believe there will be a great tribulation and i believe christ will return as he said as much. so even though i have disagreement with this film about the rapture that is not why i rate this movie so low.<br /><br />no, what makes me rate this movie so low is not its sincerity or its message, but rather its lack of production values, awful script, mediocre acting, and pitiful fx. this movie ranks down there with some of the cheesiest scifi fodder of the 1950s. no, this movie ranks down there with plan 9 from outerspace. this movie failed to age well and was probably dated by the time they made a sequel.<br /><br />the apocalypse genre film producers could have learned how not to make an end times film from this, but they failed. the left behind series, the apocalypse series, and the omega code series all failed to learn from this because they addressed the fx problems and the dated look problem, but their scripts are still poor, and their acting is wooden.<br /><br />there are great christian films, with extremely low budgets, but this film is not one of them. i'm surprised the mst3k crew never lampooned this one.
