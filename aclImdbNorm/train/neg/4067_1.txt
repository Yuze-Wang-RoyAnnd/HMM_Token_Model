am i wrong,or is the 2007 version just a rip-off of the original? i have to ask because the dvd i just bought is one of the worst films i have ever seen.....bad acting,bad editing etc....the only "exploitation " aspect here is how we were ripped off for our money buying this piece of crap. it is nothing more than a light-weight porn flick...no real gore, no scary images, just a cheaply done bit of garbage. if anyone wants to see an excellent film with no name actors,some slimy gore and a decent storyline...get baby blood...also done on a cheap budget but well made...and an actual story too!i spit was a waste of money but i'll keep it just for a laugh....it is pathetic! new comment....sept 3.....i'll keep this film forever just because it it sooooo bad it's almost good....in a really bad way....the worst acting ever...a real crap-movie classic!
