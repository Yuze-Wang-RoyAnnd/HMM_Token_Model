i haven't read a biography of lincoln, so maybe this was an accurate portrayal......<br /><br />and maybe it's because i'm used to the equally alienating and unrealistic worshiping portrayals that unnaturally deify lincoln as brilliant, honorable, and the savior of our country......<br /><br />but why would they make a movie representing lincoln as a buffoon? while henry fonda made an excellent lincoln, his portrayal of him as an "aw shucks, i'm just a simple guy" seemed a little insulting.<br /><br />[granted, that was bushie jr.'s whole campaign, to make us think he was "just a regular guy" so we wouldn't care that he's a rich & privileged moron -- but that's a whole other story.]<br /><br />not only did the film show lincoln as sort of a simple (almost simple-minded) kind of guy , the film states that lincoln just sort of got into law by accident, and that he wasn't even that interested in the law - only with the falsely simplistic idea of the law being about rights & wrongs. in the film he's not a very good defense attorney (he lounges around with his feet on the table and makes fun of the witnesses), and the outcome is mostly determined by chance/luck.<br /><br />furthermore, partly because this was financed by republicans (in reaction to some play sponsored by democrats that had come out) and partly because it was just the sentiment of the times, the film is unfortunately religious, racist and conservative.<br /><br />don't waste your time on this film!
