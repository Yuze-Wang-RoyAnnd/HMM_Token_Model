i love the 80s slasher flicks and i remember when "silent night/deadly night" was pulled from our theaters, i was very disappointed, so i was very excited to see some of these on fear.net. you better watch out was what i've come to expect of these types of movies. the quality of the special effects were laughable by today's standards, the character development too long, but all in all it was laugh out loud funny! <br /><br />the scenes where he loses it because santa, aka dad, is feeling up his mom and later when the mob is actually shown lighting torches - not flashlights as you would in the 80s, but real torches! - really tickled my funny bone. however, the scenes where he was checking on the kids in his neighborhood gave me a creepy feeling of a different nature. i also enjoyed trying to figure out who some of these character actors were. it took me awhile to figure out that the main character was the lovable teddy bear on brothers.
