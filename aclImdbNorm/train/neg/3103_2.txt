so there's an old security guard and a guy who dies and then there's kevin, the world's biggest wuss. kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive, bratty, and virginal girlfriend amy. as he returns from work to... a random house... he finds his "friends," the sexually confusing red-shorted kyle and the truly revolting sluttish daphne. they are soon joined by daphne's boyfriend, the trigger-happy sex-crazed macho lunkhead nick. and there's the title creatures, horrid little dogeared puppets who kill people by giving them their heart's desire. kyle's heart's desire is to mate with a creepy, yucky woman in spandex. nick's heart's desire is to throw grenades in a grade school cafeteria-- i mean nightclub. kevin's heart's desire is to beat up a skinny thug with nunchucks. amy's heart's desire is to be a disgusting slut. daphne's already a disgusting slut, so she doesn't have a heart's desire. along the way a truly hideous band sings a truly odd song. the hobgoblins randomly go back to where they came from then blow up. "citizen kane" cannot hold a candle to this true masterpiece of american cinema.
