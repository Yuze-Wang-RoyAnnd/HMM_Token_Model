thanks to this film, i now can answer the question, "what is the worst movie you have ever seen?"<br /><br />i can't even think of a close second, and i've seen some really bad movies.<br /><br />absolutely nothing works in this film. name a single element of any horror film and this movie fails. honestly, i've seen better on youtube. here's some typical dialogue:<br /><br />"steve?" "steve?" "steve, is that you?" "steve, i'm not kidding" "steve, this isn't funny!" "steve, are you there?" "steve?" "steve?" "steve?"<br /><br />"arggh!!!! ahhhhhh!!!! nooooooo!"
