the only reason i watched this film was because i had recently read robert hough's less than perfect, but interesting, fictionalised account of the life of big cat trainer mabel stark. beaty appears as a character in the book, in a less than flattering light.<br /><br />i hadn't realised until checking the movie out later on the imdb that it was originally a serial. whoever edited the original running time of 233 minutes down to the 68 minuted version available on dvd has done a hell of a good job. the shortened version plays just as well as any b movie of the period despite the many 'duh-what?' moments. for instance are we really expected to believe our hero dug that twenty foot deep tiger trap in a morning without even getting his jodhpurs dirty? looking over the chapter titles i see that number five is titled "gorilla warfare" and number eleven is called "the gorilla". there were no gorillas at all in the movie. i guess that's where some of the cuts were made.<br /><br />historicaly interesting.
