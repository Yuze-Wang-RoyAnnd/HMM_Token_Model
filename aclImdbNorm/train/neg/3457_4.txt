this film was made and cast from my home town. i remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the fact molly ringwald was in town...<br /><br />storyline...<br /><br />essentially 20 years after a film was "laid to rest" without being finished, a group of film students set out to complete it - with dire consequences. it would seem someone does not want the film completed.<br /><br />the storyline is flimsy. one has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek, but it had no real oomph. the characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just don't care about, it seems irrelevant. it is weird hearing kylie's accent as australian again and nice to see a kid i went to school with in a starring role. but that doesn't redeem the film at all. goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in molly ringwald. perhaps due to the nature of the film (it sort of pays homage to 80s films / bad horror films)but really an aussie actor would have done just fine.<br /><br />as far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed constipated. some of these kids (especially the two main chics - they played "director" and "producer") looked like they were trying to act. that is never a good look. also, the shots had a rough feel about them. over lit perhaps? just not as smooth as one is used to.<br /><br />the killer. lord. could it be less frightening? there are some shock factors though, and a couple of gross scenes. i did like the film, but it was not great. it went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less. perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better. they had a lot of characters get killed - but no real build up to them getting slayed. maybe if they had killed less people and actually concentrated on a scary atmosphere it would have been better.<br /><br />now i know it is a comedy and elements were funny. or so unbelieveable they were funny. but i am not convinced.<br /><br />lm.
