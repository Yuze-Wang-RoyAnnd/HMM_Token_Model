i totally disagreed with those comments which said this is a good movie. this is a totally sucked movie. i mean sucked - s.u.c.k.e.d. the story development is strange. mia kirshner changed from an innocent girl to a party-fun seeking chick for no convincing reasons at all. in addition, all the actresses looked way too old for being college students - college students looked like about 30 years old - you figure out the rest. i watched only about first ten minutes and started fast forwarding to look for sex scenes. all the sex scenes are lame, hasty and, most importantly, no frontal at all. all the sex scenes are laughable, considering how many clothes they had on. do yourself a favor - put it down and save yourself a few bucks. conclusion: story - 0, sex - 0, acting - 0, score - 0 out 10.
