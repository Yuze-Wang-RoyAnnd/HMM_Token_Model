if you want to watch a film that is oddly shot, oddly lit, weird stories of these men (and one woman) who enjoy beating the crap out of each other, if you want to enjoy a story that goes nowhere of these two guys, one a boxer and the other a gay man, then you should watch this film.<br /><br />after watching this film, i almost felt as badly bruised up and cut up, like the director (of the film) himself beat the hell out of me.<br /><br />this is a movie where one is not meant to watch for plot or for great acting, this is a film to gawk at in horror and wonder. a lot like watching an airplane crash or a train wreck.<br /><br />if you want to watch a great movie, a good movie, a "b" movie, or even a mediocre movie, this movie is not it.<br /><br />a warning to all who watch this film, please don't eat beforehand. you might want to puke by the end of the film.
