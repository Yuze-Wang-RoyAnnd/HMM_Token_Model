ok, if you're looking for another bastketball diaries, this is completely the wrong film.<br /><br />i revolves around two brothers. max, the younger, has a major cocaine addiction. adam, the eldest, is a doctor. this movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible. it however, does not. it shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present. most of the movie focus is on max and his parting ways. eventually adam, can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well (perscription drugs).<br /><br />this movie has almost no climax. doesn't descend into what cocaine really does to you, has boring and low-budget scenes, and the acting of the eldest brother, adam, is horrific.<br /><br />i have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards, it is not a heart-wencher. if you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs- rent, if not buy 'the basketball diaries'. and notice the difference.<br /><br />try to avoid this movie but, if you think you will enjoy. try and see for yourself...
