do you like stand up? then stay away from this...<br /><br />during the early rounds, there are in fact good comics, but unless they got some cute qualities, they got a snowballs chance. any controversial material and you are out! ...and i think i hurt as much as the discarded comedians, when i see who the crooked judges are letting in.<br /><br />1 out of my top 4 made it further than the preliminaries. half+ of the finalists have given me 0 laughs. several of them have lifted their material elsewhere, something the judges doesn't seem to have problems with.<br /><br />it is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on tv, but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what it could have been.<br /><br />if the producers changed the name of the contest to "last clown standing", all my criticism would loose validity. maybe an idea?
