this movie is being shown over and over on cable lately, so..<br /><br />there is no excuse for these 2 attractive women to fight over either luke wilson or the equally vapid 'villian' in this movie. the female actresses are very cute, and that's the only reason to watch this movie. i suppose it is 'funny' that luke's even uglier/dorkier/stupider friend is around, but well, that is what we get.<br /><br />neither of the female leads would ever, ever talk to any of the males in this movie for more than 5 minutes. what we get is them sobbing and crying and fighting and so on over 2 guys that were best described in friday the 13th 4. dead *@$#
