poor whoopi goldberg. imagine her at a friend's dinner party, and she adds a comment to the in-depth political discussion going on. people just look at her and say, "oh what would you know, you were the star of 'theodore rex'". how could anyone take her seriously after she lowered herself to be the star of this appalling piece of crap? even little kids would be cringing in horror at this thing. it reminded me of a particularly bad episode of 'sigmund and the sea monsters'. actually, come to think of it, 'sigmund' was vastly superior to this.<br /><br />and however did it get made? by plying the producer with an illegal substance before telling him about it? watch this hideous abomination at your own peril.
