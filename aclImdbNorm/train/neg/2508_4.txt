about time they released this movie on dvd. i know some say wb rush the release of this movie because of the dreamgirls movie. but, how can you rush the release of a movie that's been in you catalog since 1976.<br /><br />i'm very disappointed with the dvd release of this movie, no special feature, no 5.1 dd sound. come on wb, you can do much better then this. the audio and picture quality on this movie needs some serious help.<br /><br />seem wb didn't place as much time and attention to this movie because it is a black movie and my have okay sales. they could have kept the cd which by the way dose not have all the songs the original cd has. <br /><br />would i recommend this dvd for purchase. yes, because it is a classic film. but wb need to go add some more special feature. take notes from other group movies, the five heatbeats, or the temptation were you may view just the performance, and the sound on both are much, much, much better than this dvd.
