when i saw this trailer on tv i was surprised. in may of 2008 i was at six flags in new jersey and this was showing at a 4-d attraction (you know, the attraction that the seats move). i take it that the version i saw was a shortened version (15 min.) and also re-created to add the motion effects. it was a cute movie... but that was it. it was educational and told about the first mission but the ending of a cgi spacewalk seemed a bit...well...trite. i was not a big fan of the movie but i would recommend this movie for any parent wanting to inform their children in a fun way about the first moonwalk. i will say, the character actors were well selected and the characters themselves were cute. so all-in-all, i would say, if you want to bring the younger kids... go for it. but if you are wanting to take your older kids, take them to another movie... they will thank you.
