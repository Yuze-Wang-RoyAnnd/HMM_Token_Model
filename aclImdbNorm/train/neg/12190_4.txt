one of scorsese's worst. an average thriller; the only thing to recommend it is de niro playing the psycho. the finale is typically of this genre i.e. over-the-top, with yet another almost invincible, immune-to-pain villain. i didn't like the 60s original, and this version wasn't much of an improvement on it. i have no idea why scorsese wasted his time on a remake. then again, considering how bad his recent movies have been (i'm referring to his dull buddhist movie and all the ones with his new favourite actress, the blond girl di caprio) this isn't even that bad by comparison. and considering spielberg wanted to do the remake... could have been far worse.
