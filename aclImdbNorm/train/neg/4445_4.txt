serum is about a crazy doctor that finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind. instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains. the mad doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems. there is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters. the mad doctor's nephew gets into a car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy. the results are not good. this is a class c film with ok acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors. there isn't much zombie action in this one and the effects, while adequate, are nothing special. you can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes. watch out for some nudity and bad language.
