this tv-made thriller is all talk, little action. it works hard to set up its convoluted plot, yet the writing is so muddled the exposition is still cloudy at best. by the end, i knew no more about these characters than i did at the beginning. it has a quasi-"ten little indians" scenario, but ditches it mid-way through in favor of spotlighting sally field and her uncovering of a killer. field overacts here with a gracelessness i've seldom seen from her. the early introductions are good, but the writing quickly strays off-course and eventually goes over the top. lots of hysteria, and constant thunder and lightning effects (which adds nothing). a curious failure from producers aaron spelling & leonard goldberg. with all this talent, couldn't they give us something more than a script full of red herrings and sally field hiding in a closet?
