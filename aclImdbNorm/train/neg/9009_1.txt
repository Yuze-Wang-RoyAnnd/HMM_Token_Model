what a dreadful movie! for some reason, scientific laboratories and outposts always have a staff of grubby, dirty, mean-spirited, misanthropes living inside. these folks who presumably work together on complicated scientific projects cannot seem to agree on how to survive death at the hands of a cgi dragon. spoilers: an extra-nasty scientist whose main acting skill is "leering" and "the sinister stare" has cloned a dragon. while the lab was supposed to work on this kind of thing, the other scientists are shocked, because apparently they were all way behind in their experiments and got caught with their pants down. the rest of the story is like the thing, or ten little indians, where the staff is hunted and killed off as they try to formulate a way to escape and/or defeat the "dragon." the cgi dragon creature is dark gray, which seems to be the popular color for most of the cheap cgi special effects. it hardly looks better than a cartoon, and the dark gray tones make it difficult to see any interesting details in the body of the dragon. all it looks like is a gray blob. the acting is less than horrible. these scientists act like a bunch of children who cannot agree on anything, and this makes it easier for the dragon to kill them off in various attempts to escape, hide, etc. dean cain is hardly better than any of the cast of unknown actors in this movie. he seems to sink to the level of his supporting cast. this movie is really, really atrocious. the acting is bad. the story is dumb. the cgi is very very cheap and amateurish. there is nothing commendable about this movie, it is not even a good time-killer to glance at while doing chores or other work.
