spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />i watched half of this movie and i didn't like it. <br /><br />first reason: boring. barely anything happens, the women sit around and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope, they smoke weed, read magazines, care for their sick friend, and cut up the occasional dead body. boring!!!!<br /><br />second reason: there are too many things left unexplained. many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men, restrains them in a chair and interrogates them. who are these men? how do they know anything about illegal activity concerning the diseased flesh eaters? why does he kill one and let another one go?<br /><br />also there is this dude who at first i thought also had the flesh eating disease but he puts his fist through a wall with superhuman strength suggesting he's not quite what we originally thought-never explained! how frustrating is that? <br /><br />conclusion: i found the women annoying, the story uninteresting, the duologue tedious, and the action non-existent. also the cover art is misleading since it makes you believe this movie is going to be cool when it clearly isn't. i rented this movie based on some of the reviews made by other people on this website, and although i respect the fact that some people might have enjoyed this flick, i will from now on make sure i read more than two reviews deep into a movie so as to avoid renting another movie i regret seeing.
