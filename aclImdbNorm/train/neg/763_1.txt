i love columbo and have seen pretty much all of the episodes but this one undoubtedly ranks as the worst of the lot. a mind-bogglingly tedious, pointless, muddled pile of unwatchable drivel that wastes both the time of the viewing audience and of the acting talents of an exceedingly bored-looking peter falk. the 'plot', such as it is, just seems to be made up as the film goes along with not even the slightest hint of the ingredients to the formula that made the show such a brilliant success to start with. one part of the proceedings which i found extremely puzzling ( or possibly annoying ) was peter falk's character being introduced to the guests at the wedding as 'lt' columbo. if the producers insist on keeping columbo's first name a secret, why couldn't they have omitted this line altogether as it sounds ridiculous? like i said, this is the pits and all true columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague.
