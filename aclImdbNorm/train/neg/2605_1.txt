although i recently put this on my 10 worst films list, i have to say it's probably no worse than burt reynolds in "the maddening" or any of the "look who's talking" sequels. still, it's pretty nauseating, even with sexy drew barrymore playing something of a horror-movie answer to holly golightly, relocating from new york city to los angeles but finding out she's being stalked by a murderous look-alike. poor sally kellerman, a quirky actress of great acclaim in the '70s, is reduced here to a paltry supporting role, and barrymore's leading man george newbern is the worst type of sitcom actor, always pausing for a laugh after every line. the picture is swill, but drew's bloody shower scene boasts showmanship, and the identity of the psycho (although right out of a "scooby doo" episode) is interesting. but as for the finale...get real! who had to clean up that mess? * from ****
