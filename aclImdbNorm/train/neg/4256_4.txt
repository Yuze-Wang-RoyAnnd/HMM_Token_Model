ascension is actually a step up in terms of what the original movie was in story and in special effects. jason scott lee is good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself (if you remember him, he was from the movie dragon, the bruce lee story.') jason london is funny as luke, the kid who helps the woman he loves from a far steal dracula's body from the slab. diane neal is good as the woman who steals dracula's body in order to finds a cure for her dying boyfriend, and stephen billington is great as dracula himself. giving a better performance than gerard butler did the count in the original film. roy scheider rounds out the rest of the cast in this movie, and he does a decent job as the mentor of jason scott lee's character. this is the second sequel in the trilogy, and they are off to a good start. it's up in the air whether the last film will close the series out on a good note.
