this movie is entertaining enough due to an excellent performance by virginia madsen and the fact that lindsey haun is lovely. however the reason the movie is so predictable is that we've seen it all before. i've haven't read the book a mother's gift but i hope for britney and lynne spears sake it is completely different than this movie. unless you consider ending a movie with what is essentially a music video an original idea, the entire movie brings to mind the word plagiarized.
