this is another typical unbelievable and non-sensical piece of hollywood dreck.<br /><br />kurt russell, as snake pliskin in a business suit, convinces me he was a better 2nd baseman. ray liotta as the psychotic cop is totally predictable and absurd. madeline stowe is her usual cardboard self, and does little to be a convincing victim.<br /><br />every scene in this persiflage is absolutely predictable all the way to the end when kurt clouts ray with a vase or something, knocking him down and out. kurt and madeline then do their obligatory end-of-the-movie embrace, and everybody--- except russell and stowe, knows liotta is going to get back up and menace the couple again.<br /><br />he does, of course, and russell drills him 10 times with his 9mm, which was entirely unnecessary. this movie could just as well ended with the bludgeoning scene--- except hollywood dotes on unnecessary violence, and the more they can add, or "enhance", the more slobbery they get.
