after an initial release of 4 very good eurotrash titles, redemption has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with the bloodsucker leads the dance. i found no bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie.<br /><br />the story is simple. a mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a little vacation. after some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls get decapitated one by one. who is the killer? who knows? there are more red herrings in this one than at the local fish market on friday.<br /><br />the pace is excruciating. the story is silly and the skin scenes aren't all that terrific either.<br /><br />give this one a miss.
