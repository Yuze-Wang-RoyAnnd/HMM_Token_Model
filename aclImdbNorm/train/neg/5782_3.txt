lesbian vampire film about a couple on holiday who are staying on the grounds of what they think is an empty manor house but is really being used as a pair of lesbian vampires. as the vampires bring in the occasional victim the couple go about their business until the two groups come crashing together.<br /><br />great looking film with two very sexy women as the vampires there is nothing beyond the eye candy that they provide to recommend this cult film. yes its a sexy vampire story. no it is not remotely interesting beyond the women. to be honest there is a reason that i've been seeing stills of this film in horror books and magazines it looks great, but other than that...<br /><br />for those who want to see sexy vampires only.
