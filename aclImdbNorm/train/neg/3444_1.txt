this is by far the worst movie i've ever seen. from the plot, though the shots, the "special effects", the acting, and did i mentioned the plot? every single thing in it sucked ass!<br /><br />this is a good example of what "over-doing" means and i'll try to explain:<br /><br />i understand what the creator of this movie was trying to do; this was supposed to be one of those movies you can't really tell what the hell is going on up until the end. you sit mesmerized, not knowing who's dead and who's alive and who killed who and why and just when you think you got the timeline right you find out you're wrong and the movie ends - leaving you with an opened mouth for the next 5 minutes! something like "unbreakable" or "the job" if you know what i mean.<br /><br />but olga levens, the writer of this junk, yes, olga
