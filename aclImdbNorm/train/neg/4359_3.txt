wow, after trashing the disk of timo roses "rout city" after about 15 minutes (south park is about more than meaningless cursing... i guess some people just don't get it) i was interested in this movie. i read quite some positive stuff and the packaging and look of the movie seemed far from the total trash i expected after "rout city".<br /><br />surprise: the movie isn't total trash but the problem seems to be exactly that. timo rose tries to walk in the footsteps of german horror/splatter cinema like olaf ittenbach and the likes. that means "barricade" is in parts extremely gory and detailed. the gore fx are not really believable but ok, the acting is ok but in some cases plain sucks. the hillbilly chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous and doesn't get better till she's shot.<br /><br />so what is the problem... the movie is gory, has a typical german underground vibe (including the classic booby shots in blood), ok fx and a modern feel to it like the packaging already promised?! <br /><br />1. the script is total bs. you get a typical hillbilly/lost in the woods story with some guys+gal camping out and meeting a degenerated hillbilly family. everything is just leading towards the torture/mutilation scenes and seems unbelievably random and pointless. this is the first thing that makes "barricade" half-hearted.<br /><br />2. random is also the perfect description for a lot of the camera work (i liked the repetitive cut to the tweezers in the extended booby torture scene... either they had no material or the editor works in a hardware store). even worse the editing... sure, its modern and far better than a lot of other movies in the genre but its random. you got an overuse of that typical exposure effect everywhere and with no meaning ... its just there... all the time. then there's some grainy/noisy film look which also is just thrown in here and there for the sake of it, i don't get the meaning.<br /><br />3. like the fore-mentioned effects there is a lot of repetitive stuff in here. for example most of the kills are edited with multiple repetitions of stabbing and punching. its ok once but here its annoying and fake, especially towards the end. annoying also attributes the "music" which is permanently used without any change in the background. it doesn't take long until it makes the movie hardly bearable.<br /><br />4. from all this comes the biggest problem of this movie (and many others in my opinion). if you make a splatter movie with trashy feel its pretty idiotic to polish it with special fx and new school editing. it looks like they take it way too serious. its no fun because the decent gore fx are plain wasted in this context. and where the classic gore fx are ok the computer fx in scenes like the stabbing in the mouth or the gunshots in the ending look rather silly(and 3d splatter mostly sucks to me even in movies with a budget and decent 3d artists).<br /><br />i often wondered if the time of serious splatter movies is over and "barricade" is just another example it might be time to put it in the tomb. its no fun, has no character and is too trashy for its look. the script is a cheap try on "wrong turn" and "tcm" leading absolutely nowhere. you can take that literally... the ending is just there and as random as many other things here ("i love you" in a splatter flick... come on!!). "barricade" tries to incorporate a lot and fails...you can sure fast-forward through this movie for some extensive disembowelment, acid face melting,nipple pinching and classic friday the 13th style stabbing of a couple while fingering in a tent (bloody boobies hooray!). but its really hard to get through this. total failure especially because you can see it could have been something.
