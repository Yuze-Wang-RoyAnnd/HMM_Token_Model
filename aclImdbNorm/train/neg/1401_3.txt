someone mentioned editing. this is edited badly and what started out as somewhat intriguing became an incomprehensible mess. for starters, let us know what it is you are trying to do with these experiments. why are these people the best choices for the type of experimenting they are involved in? and, what exactly are they testing? apparently there is some grand plan that some agency is going to exploit. the acting is pretty bad. everyone is emoting. everyone is keeping secrets. they frequently mention that if it weren't for the money, they'd hang it up. there's a deranged minister who spouts scripture. on and on. but, again, the biggest hang up is the lack of laying out a playing field for the actors. there are some really cheesy elements. those little rooms and those chaise lounges. the awful wallpaper (was it wallpaper?). it was interesting, but didn't seem to go anywhere.
