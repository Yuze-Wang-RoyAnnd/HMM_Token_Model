this is a very sad movie. really. nothing happens in this movie. the script is bad!!! i guess they've just copy-paste the first 15 pages to 90 pages. the producers must have thought let's create a hollywood movie here in belgium. they didn't succeed. now in the third week it is only running in antwerp and brussels at 22h45 or something. in the past we have had really good movies in belgium, like daens. shades is a waste of your time. maybe you could sneak in the theater after you've seen a real movie. if you've seen 10 minutes of shades, you've seen it all. it was advertised to death on local radio and tv. i hope it will disappear in the shades soon.
