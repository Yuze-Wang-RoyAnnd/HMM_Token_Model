welcome to our town, welcome to your town? as we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of 1901 america, this three act play is opened before us with the help of "the stage manager", a visual narrator if you like. after his initial introductions, we are lead into the homes of two particular families; the webb's and the gibb's.<br /><br />this is most definitely middle america at the turn of the century, and the progressive way of life of the american dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town. here we see the everyday lives of some of its 2642 populace of grover's corners, new hampshire, even if there are, too, the migrant polish workers that add another 500 to is numbers, they, never get a look-in.<br /><br />once the daily lives of these families have been introduced; wives cooking, children home-working, fathers working, kids falling in love and the clean picket-fences painted white, the second act is started three years later, after young george (a young and unrecognisable william holden, then aged 22) and emily have fallen in love and intend to marry. blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching, too, a turning point in their own lives, from the nest they lived and now, into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step. the third act is slightly more sour and foreboding, it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent, here we see not life, not celebration but death, and it is in this predicament that the dead, as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past, are here to remind us, to tell us, that life, and every last minute, every precious breath is not to be wasted and squandered.<br /><br />it is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too, feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on, and by, middle america and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order. this isn't just about "our" town, this is moral diction aimed at "our" souls and how america can better itself if its peoples', (excluding the poles, the irish, the native american and the freed ethnic minorities', and minorities' in general, plus the supporting backbone of the americana's who, still, have not had a fair part in this narrative), such as the middle classes, can live up to the expectations of the american dream through honest, decent living. the purveyors of the american dream with special invitation only.<br /><br />i was entertained, slightly, by this movie too, but i felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting, the musical score or how well, or not, it was made. this was the movies intention to exclude other groups, and to only include the likes of the webb's and the gibb's, in the future of the developing country of the usa, a good movie, but also a slightly biased in its stance, i thought.<br /><br />taken from the play by us' born thornton wilder (1897 - 1975) this pulitzer prize winning play, and six academy award nominated movie, was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes; life, love and death, the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness. our town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness, like other towns, nothing too exciting ever happens here, if anything at all, this town only has the "right sort of people", you can still leave your back-door unlocked here, we are seeing the developing lives of these two families, but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves. our town may just have been "any town", just as long as you came from the right part of town that is.
