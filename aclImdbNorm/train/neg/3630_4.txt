it must be assumed that those who praised this film ("the greatest filmed opera ever," didn't i read somewhere?) either don't care for opera, don't care for wagner, or don't care about anything except their desire to appear cultured. either as a representation of wagner's swan-song, or as a movie, this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster, with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy, lugubrious realisation of the text.<br /><br />it's questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera (or, for that matter, a play, especially one by shakespeare) is "about" should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio; syberberg, very fashionably, but without the smallest justification from wagner's text, decided that parsifal is "about" bisexual integration, so that the title character, in the latter stages, transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe, though one who continues to sing high tenor -- few if any of the actors in the film are the singers, and we get a double dose of armin jordan, the conductor, who is seen as the face (but not heard as the voice) of amfortas, and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of batonzilla or conductor who ate monsalvat during the playing of the good friday music -- in which, by the way, the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in ill-laid turf, an expedient which baffles me. in the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts, but i can't think why syberberg couldn't splice in, for parsifal and gurnemanz, mountain pasture as lush as was provided for julie andrews in sound of music...<br /><br />the sound is hard to endure, the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual. someone in another review mentioned the 1951 bayreuth recording, and knappertsbusch, though his tempi are often very slow, had what jordan altogether lacks, a sense of pulse, a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music -- and, after half a century, the orchestral sound in that set, in modern pressings, is still superior to this film.
