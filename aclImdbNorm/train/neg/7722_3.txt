extremely poor action film starring the ever wooden dolph lundgren and brandon lee trapped in a sidekick role that never seems to gel. the action is at best average, a bit of nudity chucked in and yes tia carrera does use a body double! <br /><br />the set-up is the usual renegade cop forced to break in a new partner on a big case, the makers at least try to give the formula a twist making lundgren the cop with oriental values and lee the modern city slicker but there is zero character development making it almost comical, lundgrens oriental warrior outfit for the big showdown has to be seen to be believed. the action sequences are by the numbers and lee(who would go on to make the excellent the crow) is never given the scope to show off any particular martial arts brilliance. but given his illustrious parentage he must have been under a hell of a lot of pressure and was far better served not having to live up to his father by taking on a very different role in the crow which showed what a unique actor he may have become if not for his tragic and early death.<br /><br />unless your a hardcore lundgren fan or a fan of poor 80's style action movies (think cobra etc.) then avoid.<br /><br />poor 3/10
