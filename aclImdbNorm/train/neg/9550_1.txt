after highlander 2 (which i am still in denial about), i thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad. i was wrong. i loved the original wargames, however, this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie. the original wargames at least had some hacks that worked. whoever wrote this movie knew nothing about computers except how to use a word processor. i doubt he or she even watched the original movie. the acting isn't even convincing. please save yourselves, under no circumstances watch this movie. i don't care if the channel is stuck on the tv and you can't turn the tv off. this movie will ruin your life.
