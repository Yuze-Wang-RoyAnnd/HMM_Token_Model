doc savage: the man of bronze is a horrible movie. poorly scripted, over-acted, and just plain silly. that being said... it is actually an enjoyable movie on some level. this movie begs to be watched in a group with an ample supply of cheap beer. it's one of those movies like "santa claus conquers the martians" or "yor, the hunter from the future"... so bad it is almost good. if you have the right group of people this movie is a blast to watch. it's campy. it's fun. it has a theme by sousa. if you're looking for a good movie though, look elsewhere. 3/10.<br /><br />btw, i've heard rumors some studio is exploring the possibility of a remake...
