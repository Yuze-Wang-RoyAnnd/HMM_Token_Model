when you look at this now and hear all the language in here, it's amazing this was rated "pg," but that's the 1970s rating system for you. peter falk spews out the lord's name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie! yet, few people consider that offensive, and certainly not the scumbags who make movies nor the people who "rate" them.<br /><br />the cast is a clue to how profane this film can be: falk, peter boyle, allen garfield, warren oates, gena rowlands and paul sorvino aren't exactly actors you wouldn't find in "the sound of music."<br /><br />i like heist movies, and a lot of films by director william friedkin, but this script doesn't deliver and it just has way too much of the "sleazy '70s" feel to it, visually and audibly. for those who loved falk in tv's "columbo" it must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in films. this is far from the only case.
