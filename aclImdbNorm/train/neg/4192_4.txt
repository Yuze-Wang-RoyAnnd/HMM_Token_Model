in this short an urban man and his wife have their weird lives set akimbo when the man takes to wearing an old red pants suit of his mother in law's.<br /><br />i kept watching this hoping that i could see why it had been made, or why the other reviewers found it funny. for me it was a total waste of time.<br /><br />not everyone's tastes are the same but this was clearly not to mine.
