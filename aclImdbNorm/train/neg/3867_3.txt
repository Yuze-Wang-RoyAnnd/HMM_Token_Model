oh-so-familiar comedy story about low-key nice-guy paul (jason lee), who after the night of his bachelor party, wakes up in bed with becky (julia stiles), an attractive blonde he met just the night before. after lying about it to his fianc'ee karen (selma blair), he's forced to tell more and more lies to cover his tracks.<br /><br />i'm sure most of us have been witness to a story like this at least once before...on film or on tv. the movie is formulaic and extremely predictable, with an ending you may see coming a mile away.<br /><br />at least the cast provides some interest and keeps it watchable. lee is just right in the lead, and stiles is a lot of fun in a light-hearted comedic role different from the very serious roles she usually plays. becky is a free spirit who seems to change jobs as often as other people change their clothes.<br /><br />but you know, this isn't exactly well-written. at least one question is left unanswered: for what, exactly, is ray (lochlyn munro), becky's brutal ex-boyfriend, being investigated by the i.a.?<br /><br />and i didn't like the character of buck (david koechner), paul's stepfather; he's a super-obnoxious moron who got on my nerves so quickly i was begging for somebody to punch him.<br /><br />add another debit: a gratuitous, uncredited cameo by comic/actor larry miller, once again playing a grouch (in this case, it's a little justified - his character is an ultra-conservative minister).<br /><br />not good at all, but as usual for me, i give it a three out of ten based on the efforts of the cast alone.
