ye lou's film purple butterfly pits a secret organization (purple butterfly) against the japanese forces in war torn shanghai. ding hui (zhang ziyi) and her ex-lover hidehiko itami (toru nakamura) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting.<br /><br />i agree with the reviewer from paris. the film substitutes a convoluted, semi-historical conflict for a plot, without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes. the sudden time shifting doesn't help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless. normally i don't mind dark movies, but the absence of light, the bone-jarringly shaky camera footage, and the generally bad film-making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in. i also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film "has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography", but i don't think that helps the movie. the backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th century, and i don't believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a michael bay film. the overly melodramatic moments don't add to its watchability.<br /><br />the actors are all suitably melancholy. zhang ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films, brooding and looking generally annoyed. however, at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love-making scene since michael biehn and linda hamilton in the terminator.<br /><br />all in all, a very disappointing film, especially seeing as how it comes from the director of suzhou he. 2/10
