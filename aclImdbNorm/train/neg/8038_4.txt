**spoilers** redicules slasher film that makes no sense at all with a killer running around dressed in a black robe and wearing what looks like a pull-over peter lorre rubber mask. were told early in the movie, almost the very first scene, that young beth morgan was in rehab due to heavy drug use after her boyfriend was murdered in tennyson collage about a year ago.<br /><br />it's also brought out that fbi agent sacker's (jeff conaway), who's obsessed in catching the killer,daughter was also murdered in tennyson around the same time. by the time the movie "do you wanna know a secret" is over it's never explained just what those two killings back in connecticute has to do with the slaughter in florida of some half dozen collage students a year later? other that the killer, at least in the murder of beth's boyfriend, wore the same silly halloween outfit. <br /><br />at spring break in the sunshine state the six students spend their vacation at a beach house and before you know it they start getting knocked off one at a time. starting with computer geek brad clyton, chad allen, the killing even spill over into town with a number of people who have nothing to do with the targeted student including the police chief gavin, jack mcgee, getting sliced open. <br /><br />the masked killer saves beth for last in this weird ceremony at a deserted church, in what looks like the florida everglades. he then finally reveals who his is and what he intentions are which make as much sense as the movie does, none. trying to scare it's audience all the movie does is confuse and bewilder it with a number of not-too convincing slasher scenes. the most effective ones having the victim oz washington, tom jay jones, survive at least three attempts on his life and ending up, together with agent sacker, the hero in the film. <br /><br />oz also had a vicious cut on is foot from a large splinter of glass that almost cut it in half and crippled him but later he miraculously recovered, after getting arrested for a murder he didn't commit, in fact he had it out two more time with the killer with him not as much as having a slight limp in his walk! it also made no sense at all why oz and beth went on their own to tack down and catch the killer instead of calling the police, with a cellphone that oz had, instead? <br /><br />beth's boyfriend, who loses his head over her, in the movie hank ford, joseph lawrence, is also very unconvincing as well as the two girls at the beach house.they together with with beth oz end up being the killers victims and then somehow disappearing from sight! for a moment you didn't know if they were really killed at all or if it was some kind of hallucination on oz's or the local police part. until the off-the-wall final scene where they popped up in the church.<br /><br />we also get an insight on a previous relationship between tina and hank with her, drunk and acting obnoxious, trying to get it on with hank as beth walks in without hank and tina even noticing her. that seemed to have upset beth even more then her boyfriend being murdered at the beginning of the movie!
