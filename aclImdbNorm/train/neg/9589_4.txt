this movie is horrible if you pay attention to it. it's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen - each one with no apparent connection to the next. i rented this movie because i'm a david bowie fan, and i really appreciate musicals. in finality, bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired. the moral of the story was really befuddling. i couldn't tell if it was about racial issues in london in the 1950s or about not selling out. for the first half of the movie i was chuckling at how cheesy it was but i liked the campiness of the "no selling out" message. when blacks started being murdered i thought my tape had gotten messed up. maybe i rented half of two different movies? nope, there was a "keep britain white" song and dance sequence. i'm sorry, but wwii is not something you can write a musical about. at least not a musical that could conceivably be described as "campy" as i have several times in this review. overall i'd say this movie could do a whole lot better if it made up its mind and cast better actors. (and put david bowie in it for longer goddammit!) my grade: c-
