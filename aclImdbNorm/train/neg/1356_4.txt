i firstly and completely and confidently disagree with the user who calls this a "spoof". crispin glover is very serious about his film. he personally introduced the film at the screening i saw in chicago. he had worked on the film for years and it is the first in an intended trilogy. "what is it?" is crispin glover's attempt at an art film in the vein of those he idolizes by herzog, lynch etc.<br /><br />i had heard rumor of this film years ago "epic porno movie with all down-syndrome cast directed by crispin glover". when it finally came out i watched the trailer on-line and read the synopsis and i was foaming at the mouth with anticipation. ...i went to chicago to see it and it was a major disappointment. if he took out the goofy sh*t, such as the pot-smoking grandma, and the dancing dolls, he would be left with something much better, but only about 10 minutes long.<br /><br />in other words just watch the trailer, be entertained, and leave it at that. there are some striking images and fantastic juxtapositions and phrases, but its lack of focus amounts to disappointment.
