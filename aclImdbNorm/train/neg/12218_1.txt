very bad. very, very bad. as a fellow who aspires to make, be in or - at least - sniff the catering table at a movie set, i find it hard to criticize independents who actually got a movie of any sort made. however, this movie ... oh dear.<br /><br />realizing frightworld doesn't aspire to anything more than crude exploitation (an honorable thing in itself) and to try to make it conform to more mainstream standards is a mistake. and to be fair, it is more entertaining than - say - red zone cuba ... but not by much. so i won't try to critique, just let me ask throw out some observations.<br /><br />1) if gore is the point of the movie, shouldn't you be able to see it?<br /><br />2) if you have hire three sound men make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipment.<br /><br />3) in a horror movie your lead maniac must be scarier than a smurf doll. difficult i know but really...<br /><br />4) there is a lot of talented videographers in the buffalo/rochester area, most you can hire really cheap. get one who knows how to frame a scene.<br /><br />5) just because you have someone who knows how to use after effects and other cool programs doesn't mean he should do so every two seconds.<br /><br />6) kudos for getting the girls to take off their tops but next time, get girls who's tops we want to see taken off.<br /><br />7) editing should help tell the story or set a mood. at the least in this sort of movie editing should sell the gore gags. a chainsaw suddenly appearing in a characters stomach is not scary, it's sloppy.<br /><br />some good things. not all the acting was bad. jack was pretty good and i liked acid once she started fighting back. there was some neat imagery, unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason. "acid poptart" is a name that deserves a better movie. i like the moxie of frightworld too. next time, now that they have a movie of sorts under their belts, i hope all involve aspire to something better than colman francis. upgrade at least ed wood.
