first of all.....<br /><br />what the hell? why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night tv with the promise of disturbing, offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn't watch. <br /><br />what the crap is funny about a dog being injured, a grandma getting her head knocked off...a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom? what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick. anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny, should not even be allowed to walk the earth. <br /><br />but from what i hear its not even offensive...so...they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage...and they cant even pull that off.
