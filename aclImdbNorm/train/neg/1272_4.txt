did anyone else notice whenever they are in the car each time the camera takes a new angle they switch roads. like in one scene it is a one lane residential with sidewalks, next they are on a multiple lane highway with a divider, next a two lane country road with double yellow lanes. i can understand a low budget but that was just sloppy film work.<br /><br />i also read the other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie. i think that if you are a fan of paul reiser and his comedy then you may enjoy this movie. if, however, you find his work/not funny then i would recommend staying away from this one.
