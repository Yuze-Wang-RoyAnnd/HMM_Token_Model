unspeakably discombobulated turkey, a mix of anti-nazi musical (!!), pre-war americana and agatha christie whodunit spoof with one big, big problem: it's deadly unfunny. besides the single-digit i.q. plot and dialog, the most amazing aspect of "lady..." is the berserk casting. gene wilder (star and co-writer) tries hard at it all: he plays a romantic lead (with his looks!! and his age!! he and woody allen should start a club for clueless, mirrorless ageing comedians), and he tries to be moving and funny and poignant and smart, and tries to sing and dance, and succeeds in none!! a looong shot from his good old days with mel brooks.<br /><br />for a while i thought i was having a myopia fit, because everybody in the movie keeps saying cherry jones is this pretty hot chick, and that michael cumpsty is this impossibly handsome stallion!! the guy who plays claire bloom's male secretary is a bespectacled balding thin actor as sexy as a chair and is the object of passion of the two leading ladies!! mike starr's over-the-top acting as the most incompetent, phoniest cop you ever saw deserves to rank among the 10 most abhorrent performances in recent film history. the saddest note is to see wonderful claire bloom and barbara sukowa completely miscast and offensively wasted. at least i hope both stars payed their bills back home (and subsequently fired their agents) with this flop. no wonder acting prodigy sukowa returned to germany after she saw what hollywood had in store for her!!<br /><br />if you want to see how to accomplish a really bad film out of a really bad script with a berserk casting director, study this one - otherwise stay away!!! - 1/10
