set in providence, rhode island, feeding the masses tries to be a satiric look at the role of the media in government. at best, it could be applied to how the us try to control media during the iraq war, but it ends up feeling hollow. there's never any really tension in the story and the acting never very good. worst, the direction of the movie is atrocious, focus more on odd camera angles that fail to convey anything beyond "isn't this an odd way to hold the camera." special effects are pretty bad...at one point video of an explosion is green screened over the city, and it's laughable at best.<br /><br />the film does have a couple bright spots...namely the advertisements for post-zombie services (including a reclamation service and a party bus). but it's far too little to make the film worthwhile.<br /><br />for a better zombie film, try hide and creep. it has the same weak production value, but there's much more wit, humor and talent behind it.
