wenders was great with million $ hotel.i don't know how he came up with this film! the idea of giving the situation after spt11 and the view of american society is hopeful,that makes it 2 out of ten.but this is not a movie.is that the best someone can do with a great idea(the west-east clash).there are important things going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of a mac* with the fingers of an amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity(because she is just ignorant about the facts).the characters are not well shaped.and the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me.at the ending scene lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen.and the background music says "...i will pray".the thing is not about religion actually.but it ends up with this.how you are gonna see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray.the lights are already shining on the truth.its just that nobody wants to see it. ps: "my home is not a place.it is people"the only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence.but it is wasted behind this film making. (by the way; as "someone" mentioned below ,americas finest young man are not finest,they are just the "poor" and the "hopeless" ones who sign up for the army in need of good paychecks which is not provided by the government ! )
