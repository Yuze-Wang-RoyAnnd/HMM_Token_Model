whatever the merits of the film, it is poorly researched. as others have pointed out, the movie shows locals in iran speaking in arabic, rather than persian. that is enough to lose credibility for anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the area or the country. the landscape could not be more different from the actual.<br /><br />other factual errors: a train is shown to be operating in afghanistan, while afghanistan does not have railways. the turkish ambassador is wearing a fez (the red hat), whereas the fez was banned by turkey much before the time in which the movie is set. the turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an indian, and indian classical music is playing in the background in many scenes. i suppose the filmmakers meant to show an exotic woman, and sari was what they decided would make her exotic.
