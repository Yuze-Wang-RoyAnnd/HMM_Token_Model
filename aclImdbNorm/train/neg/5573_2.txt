i cant understand at all why so many godzilla fans think this is excellent, one of the best godzilla films ever in fact. this film is horrible and one of the very few gojira films i cant stand to watch again (the other being g. vs megalon).<br /><br />the plot is too campy to be in the heisei series, a series that attempted to turn the aging godzilla franchise into bonafide action films, revolving around ideas that seemed more in place in 1974 than 1991. it just sounded ridiculous, especially with some of the subject matter, take for example the ww2 scene, with the japanese soldiers praising a dying godzillasaurus, a mournful and serious tone, take the exuberant former commander turn capitalist and his death, serious seens in a film its fans somehow denote as played for laughs, as a goofy romp with guilty illogical fun, if so than this is easily one of the most tasteless films i've seen, however i think its more likely it was only talent the filmmakers lacked and this was a case of a straight faced action movie gone bad. it was made ever worse by the fact that the special effects are terrible beyond compare, from the jet packs to the android, to the hokey sound effects emitted from everything, its impossible to take anything seriously, and yet the film expects you to, there's no nudges to the camera.<br /><br />like nearly all godzilla films there's a pointless romance, and this is no exception, though something can be said about the fact that this one is especially pointless since and inexplicable. there is literally no reason at all presented for the romance, it just happens and there lives make 360 degree commitments for it. aside from this the other terrible aspect of this film is dialogue, both the japanese and english is horrible, clunky and possibly the inspiration for battlefield earth.<br /><br />the tristar dvd compounds the problems, making everything look grainy, blurred, dim and just plain ugly, the same was for the sound. i first saw the japanese region 2 version and the differences are night and day, with the original vibrant colors and texture, the noteworthy score, the fight scenes especially, are actually watchable.<br /><br />in my opinion, the heisei series is a disappointment, with the exception of godzilla 1984 (japanese version) there is little to praise here, and godzilla vs. king ghidorah is case in point of this failure. it doesn't even come close to deserving the reputation and fans it gets.<br /><br />2 out of 10
