after some internet surfing, i found the "homefront" series on dvd at ioffer.com. before anyone gets excited, the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv 15 years ago. the resolution and quality are poor. the images look like you would expect old re-recorded video to look. although the commercials were edited out, the ending credits of each episode still have voice-over announcements for the segway into the abc news program "nightline", complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990's. even with the poor image quality, the shows were watch-able and the sound quality was fine.<br /><br />to this show's credit, the casting was nearly perfect. everyone was believable and really looked the part. their acting was also above average. the role of jeff metcalf is played particularly well by kyle chandler (most recently seen in the 2005 remake of king kong). the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets, especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and d'ecor. the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time. for example, conversations between characters were sometimes inter-cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes. the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations. that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case.<br /><br />as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it 15 years ago. despite all the ingredients for a fine show, the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start. for one thing, the name of the show itself is totally misleading. when wwii ended in 1945, there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a "homefront" either. curiously, the first episode of the show "homefront" begins in 1945 after the war had ended. that's like shooting the first episode of "gilligan's island" showing the castaways being rescued. the whole premise of the show's namesake is completely lost. i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no, the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948. additionally, this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940's. by the third episode, it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left-wing political agenda. the show is set in river run ohio, near toledo. however, the show's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson mississippi than ohio. part of the ensemble cast are dick williams, hattie winston and sterling macer jr. who portray the davis family. much of the series shows the davis family being discriminated against by the evil "whites" to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable. the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over 40 years. we get it. we're also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis. the subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show, as it was for "homefront". the acting talents of williams, winston and macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical "frightened / angry black family". the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in ohio was a kkk member or something. the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist-fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing, and leave it at that. devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid.<br /><br />in yet another ridiculous plot line, the big boss of a local factory (ken jenkins) is portrayed as an ebenezer scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees. the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer.<br /><br />personally, i think this series had great potential. the writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941
