i can't believe this movie was made as recently as 1984. it's got some laughable acting, not to mention one of the stupidest plots ever. who would ever ask fat texas sheriff joe don baker to escort an italian he illegally arrested in mexico back to italy? not to mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing about it - in fact, it's about as generic a title for a wannabe action/cop film as i can think of.<br /><br />i'm glad i only saw this on mst3k with mike and the bots as a shield. they remark on the female lead's resemblance to elaine from seinfeld ("none of them are spongeworthy") and riff non-stop on baker's weight. this movie probably isn't worse than "mitchell," but baker's reputation definitely precedes him here: when his title comes up at the beginning of the film, tom says, "i wish i was illiterate so i wouldn't have to read that."
