over the last 20 years the majority of british films are about how horribly poverty stricken the uk is and how our youth doesn't stand a chance of a good life whilst they live on the mean streets of british cities. the british film industry is obsessed with the idea of 'broken britain'. trainspotting, this is england, kidulthood, football factory, kes and from london to brighton.<br /><br />bullet boy is just another british movie added to that list. the main character expresses a desire to go straight yet he still insists on hanging around with dead beats who carry guns and fight with gang members over nothing. i was never convinced that he did want to go straight as there was nothing stopping him pursuing an education or a trade. in fact it would have been a breath of fresh air if he had of gone straight and we had a character who turned his life around. instead he spends his time helping his friend trying to commit murder. i felt no sympathy when he is predictably shot by another teen at the end of the film, which is sad because at the beginning of the film i really liked the entire family and their desire for success. i believe the makers missed a great chance to show the world that success belongs to those who are willing to really strive for it (like the pursuit of happiness). <br /><br />i know the purpose of this film was to try and paint a realistic picture of what life is like for black teens living in working class areas of britain but don't we already have enough films in the uk with that very same plot? isn't it time these talented producers and writers give britains youth something to aspire to and show them a better life is just around the corner?<br /><br />i applaud the makers of bullet boy for not loading the film full of mindless violence in order to try and get success through shock factors (like kidulthood, football factory) but at the same time this movie offers nothing new to a long list of british films that are effectively dull and depressing to watch. there is no happy ending to this movie or any of the others i have mentioned.
