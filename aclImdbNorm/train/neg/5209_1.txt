ok so i was bored and i watched it all the way through.<br /><br />this film is mild, inoffensive and lacklustre. the story is so sugary it rots your teeth on the opening titles. a tail of two 'traumatised' children learning about 'god' the fairy story way which frankly left me rather traumatised. it uses the irish 'blarney' in such a stereotypical way one hopes no true irish ever see it. aimed at children who frankly would switch off after the first attempt at an 'oirish' accent. all in all why do they pump these out.
