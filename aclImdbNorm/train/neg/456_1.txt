add to the list of caricatures: a southern preacher and "congregation," a torch singer (sophie tucker?), a dancing chorus, and the mills brothers -- it only makes it worse.<br /><br />contemptible burlesques of "negro" performers, who themselves often appear in films to be parodying themselves and their race. though the "negro comedy" may have been accepted in its day, it's extremely offensive today, and i doubt that it was ever funny. though i wouldn't have been offended, i don't think that i'd have laughed at the feeble attempts at humor. as an 11-year-old white boy, however, i might not have understood some of it.
