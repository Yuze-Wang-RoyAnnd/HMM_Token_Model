jack black is an annoying character.this is an annoying indie movie for 14 year olds.do i have to write eight more lines?ana de la reguera is dang fine to look at,as a mexican nun who puts up with the rather forward and rude advances of jack black.this movie is a pg 13 version of an indie film.i really like a movie that has the courage to explore mexican culture.this movie explores mexican culture-deeply. i just choke on its cultural rudeness:jack black is just so rude. a white person like jack black is not my most valuable emissary into mexican culture, as it were.mexican wrestling culture is not the most diaphanous venue a white guy, such as myself could seek.i suspect mexico is more culturally opaque than jack black has presented here.<br /><br />i think imdb changed my review.has anyone else had his review changed as well?just a question.
