don't waste your time on this film. it could have been good, but the ending was one of the lamest i've ever seen. i seriously have to wonder how the people involved with the making of this film could've looked at that final scene and thought, "yeah! now there's an ending!" and patted themselves on the back about it. to me it seemed more like they just ran out of ideas! they built up the final scenes to have a cool twist, but instead just let the whole build-up fall flat on it's face. when the last shot faded to black and i heard the credit music starting i was in shock - i could not believe what i was seeing and that someone could even call that an ending. the best thing anyone could do with this film is rewrite the end and give it some substance. seriously, i'd really love to get whoever came up with that one in a room, look them in the face and say - wtf??!!!!
