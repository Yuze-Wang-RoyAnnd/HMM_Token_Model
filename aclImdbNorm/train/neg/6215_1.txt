this really was a waste of time...the movie has a weak plot, the story is fragmented and ends very abruptly with many loopholes....though the animation is top notch. <br /><br />once the movie started, i tried to give it the benefit of the doubt by telling myself that it might get interesting in the later stage, but it was never unique. this same plot has been played over and over again, but what made it worse was that the major plot hole was the whole story on how to kill the baddies...the writer could have done so much more with the entire concept, but seemed that he or she did not have their heart in it and wanted to close the movie as soon as it started.<br /><br />overall, too much hype but not able to deliver.
