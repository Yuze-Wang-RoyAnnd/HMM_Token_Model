i am glad to read so many negative comments about the tritter plot. everyone i talk to says the same thing. they like house's gruff nature and his intelligence, but really dislike the vindictiveness of this continuing plot. it cuts into the real nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry at police authority. it needs to have a more caring nature instead of the vindictiveness to everyone at the hospital. also, there seems to be many questionable legal aspects to what tritter is actually doing. he alone cannot freeze accounts and have the authority to stop doctors from writing prescriptions for patients. a lot of the vindictiveness he is showing also is hurting the very sick patients at the hospital and the is not a good storyline to portray. i voted the episode awful not because of the story itself, but when you insert the trittor piece it turns me off and the rest of the plot gets hurt by it, people say they hate to watch the story lines anymore. please change it. get tritter out.
