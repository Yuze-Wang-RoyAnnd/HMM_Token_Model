let's just say it in simple words so that even the makers of this film might have a chance to understand: this is a very dumb film with an even dumber script, lame animation, and a story that's about as original as thumbtacks. don't bother -- unless you need to find some way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children. they might laugh, especially if they're off their meds. there's a special kind of insult in a film this ridiculous -- not only do the filmmakers apparently think that children are brainless idiots who can be entertained with claptrap that cost approximately zero effort, but they don't even bother to break a sweat inserting a gag here and there that an adult might find amusing. this film, frankly, ticked me off royally. shame on you for stooping so low.
