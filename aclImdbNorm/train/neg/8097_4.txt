regarded by many critics as one of the biggest stinkers of all time (certainly the biggest stinker of director brian de palma's career).<br /><br />sherman mccoy (tom hanks) is a smug rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his lover maria ruskin (melanie griffith) are involved in a hit-and-run. his story is chronicled by another smug guy, reporter peter fallow (bruce willis).<br /><br />well, as i said in my summary...<br /><br />what is this movie supposed to be? it seems to combine comedy, drama, and satire, but it sure doesn't add up to much. it's undermined by unimaginably loathsome, one-dimensional characters who you'd never want to have the displeasure of meeting in real life.<br /><br />i'm no big fan of the novel (i started reading it once, but couldn't finish it because it wasn't to my liking) but it's obvious to me that those who did / do enjoy the novel consider this film to be a complete travesty.<br /><br />i've never seen so many talented actors strive to hard to give a below-average movie some semblance of quality and fail. what a waste.<br /><br />the problems start with casting nice guy tom hanks in a role that is clearly supposed to be unsympathetic. and the role of peter fallow in the novel was that of a brit. bruce willis is badly, badly miscast in the role. what was the thinking there.<br /><br />alas, not even morgan freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact, being obliged to deliver a lame, heavy-handed lecture on 'decency' after the climax.<br /><br />this movie ends up turning into an absurd farce.<br /><br />i liked the assemblage of talent; for that i will give it four out of ten, but i'm sure some people will say a much better movie could have been made from the source material.
