this is one of those movies that apparently was trying to ride the martial arts wave craze. kind of like billy jack i guess. however, whereas billy jack did have one notable martial arts scene there are none in this one unless you consider some gentlemanly grappling and roughhousing as such. we are introduced to the star who is described as having learned judo in the marines. i was in the marines and while they are pretty established in boxing, i really don't remember any emphasis on judo. as a result the antagonist, james macarthur, makes reference to the judo when he offers an excuse for why he, a state champion wrestler was so easily defeated. lame.
