who me? no, i'm not kidding. that's what it really says on the video case.<br /><br />plot; short version: pretty woman stands around smiling. this, for some reason, makes all men kill each other.<br /><br />"find ariel...where's ariel...can't find ariel..." she's right behind you, you idiot...<br /><br />most of what can be said about this horrendous little space opera has already been said, looks like.<br /><br />a bunch of corny actors playing mostly convicts come in after the first selection of actors is knocked off very quickly. then they get knocked off in the same way. every scene is broadcast nearly fifteen minutes in advance. perhaps it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the most screen time and bigger pay check. the alien virus/hologram/vr witch/glitch seems physically powerless and doesn't do a thing. why can't she just stay in the computer instead of doing her "teleporting vampire" routine? (actually, it would've been more interesting if she had been a vampire, or doing more than just standing around looking at people, which is all she ever does. this is enough to make all the men kill each other. go figure...)<br /><br />this isn't really a space flick. there are far more shots of the old western trail, 1950's easy rider trail, film noir's night club scene, even a jog on the beach in fantasy-land, none of which has any real depth or even makes any sense. the night club scene is in black and white, of course. worked with "the wizard of oz". doesn't work so well, here. this is probably a good thing, as those few shots they do show of space are depressingly silly. you will probably cry during those moments, especially upon seeing that swirling "space ship", which looks about three inches long.<br /><br />nothing is felt for any of the characters, not because they are convicts or have no personality, but because they are in serious need of acting lessons, except for billy dee williams who really does look depressed and at a loss, probably by being in this work...<br /><br />this is one of those movies that, when viewed with friends, is going to cause some extremely "loud" silences, especially when the nerd throws out his attempt at comic one-liners (including the line about french-kissing a meteor...? did i hear that right? perhaps not...)<br /><br />the original virtual reality girls get "killed", which means nothing, as they are not even real to begin with. well, the other "characters" aren't, either, but that's beside the point. haha.<br /><br />what's kind of funny is that the scene that graces the video case is some sort of skull-horror-alien looking thing (green filter added on top of that, to give it more of a...uh...green look), which is actually the android after he gets killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else afoot.<br /><br />another odd deal i noticed. whenever there is an explosion (at least on my cheap dvd copy), everything becomes highly pixelated. i don't mean a little pixelated, i mean huge blocks about 1/16th the size of the screen. wow.
