what can i say about seven pounds...well i watched on a flight from seattle to tokyo and as that flight was long and boring the movie definitely didn't help. will smith's character ben thomas is almost completely unlikable even with his redemption in the end. the movie's two hour plus run time wastes most of the screen time with random garbage that just strings the plot along as slow as possible. in the movies defense rosario dawson's character adds a little life to the film although not much. i don't understand how anyone could actually cry during this film when all i wanted to do was turn it off. also will smith kills himself with a jellyfish at the ended proving that killing yourself with a jellyfish is the stupidest way to die.
