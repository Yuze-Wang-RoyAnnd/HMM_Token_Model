this film is beautiful to look at, but is like watching really bad experimental theater. the plot (if there was one) doesn't make any sense. but it is very "artistic". lots of shots of half-dressed actors wrestling and looking deep into each other's eyes. lots of arty shots through windows and with people out of frame. mumbling and people wandering wistfully. lingering close-ups of faces and bodies. by the time you get to the threesome on the roof with the cat, you'll be ready to throw a bottle of ky at the screen.<br /><br />it is supposed to be about a father and son's relationship, but you will just be wishing the two of them would just f*$& each other and get it over with. if you have always wanted to see bad russian gay porn without any money shots, your wish has been granted.
