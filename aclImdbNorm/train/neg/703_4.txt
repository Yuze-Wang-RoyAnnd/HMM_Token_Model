college students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by an elusive killer.<br /><br />the dorm that dripped blood (aka pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans. the movies production values are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine, there's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring. in fact much of the story's build-up is pretty forgettable, save for one or two brutal murders. but the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and one fairly bold, unconventional conclusion.<br /><br />the cast is lackluster for the most part. stephen sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character. also look for a young daphne zuniga as an ill-fated student.<br /><br />over all this is a pretty standard b slasher effort, but the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho-hum.<br /><br />** out of ****
