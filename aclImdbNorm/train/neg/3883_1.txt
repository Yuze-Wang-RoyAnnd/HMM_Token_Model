no, just kidding. it was god-awful.<br /><br />i was watching my local sci-fi station last night, which plays movies, every night, within a monthly theme. this month it's "space turkeys, or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bombs". movies so bad, they should never have been made. this was a good selection.<br /><br />everything about this movie is thoroughly horrible with two exceptions, the gore make-up (which showed potential) and the editing (which slightly out did the rest of the movie, in terms of being horrible). the acting is horrible all around, the dialog is horrible, the script, the direction. it's not a good movie.<br /><br />it consists of two forms of special effects, gore and stock footage of space. i'll focus on the gore. watching this movie, i thought to myself, "what was the motivation behind the making of this movie?" people like making stuff, sure, but i was hesitant to think anything good could have come of it for anyone involved. i came to the conclusion that this movie was made as a means to increase the make-up effects guy's demo reel. he (rick baker) actually went on to a pretty nice career, he's worked on star wars (1977), king kong (1976), men in black (1996), and even the incredible shrinking woman (1981), plus a number of other notable flicks. other than that, i can't say i've ever actually seen a real, live melting man - incredible, or otherwise - but i'd have to say this seemed to be a fair representation of one.<br /><br />now, when i think of bad editing, i usually think of maybe a scene where someone's talking on the phone and then, in the middle of the scene, the phone jumps down to his shoulder, or something to that effect. this movie really serves to highlighted the fact that bad editing can take many forms. specifically, over-long and utterly useless scenes. just about every scene dragged on longer than it should have, from a little bit of dead air to that crazy-long screaming scene with cleaver girl. and that severed head in the river, the head gets thrown into a river (in slow motion), the movie carries on for a couple minutes, and then we cut back to the floating head and watch it fall down a waterfall. while i'm sure they were all very proud of their severed head, what the hell??<br /><br />lastly, i'll mention the running fat lady/slow motion scene right near the beginning. the jerky slow motion tells me that they didn't shoot the scene in slow motion originally but later decided that it "wasn't working like that" and then slowed it down. oy vey. in any event, if you should ever see another movie in which a hysterical fat woman runs down a hall and then directly through a closed, glass door - all in slow motion, mind you - remember the incredible melting man, for *this* is where it all started.<br /><br />movies like this are best viewed at home with a bunch of friends. this one's a little slow most of the time but that's just all the more time to come up with your own one-liners. it's not the worst of the worst but it's pretty freaking bad.
