this sleek, sexy movie is a must-see. only upon multiple viewings can one truly understand the uniqueness of this film. personally i enjoy the narrator for his intelligent, no subject left untouched, style of narration. the introduction grips you right away, and holds you at the edge of your seat throughout the film. he provides wonderful insight into the world of the trainables and allows the audience to really 'connect' with internal horror this film exhibits. the script itself holds the movie together wonderfully. not only for kids, but the elderly alike will gain a higher understanding of the trainables and the modern grasp that they have on the sexual experience. ahead of its time and groundbreaking in cinematography, it surely defines the word 'masterpiece'.
