i was lying on my bed, with a really bad cold or flu or whatever. i figure maybe i'd kill some time watching some horror movies my mom bought for me a little while ago. i wish i never picked this movie! after i watched it i felt even more sick and i wanted to throw up. afterwords(when i got better of course) i did some research on dennis l.rader and i noticed that the dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one. i hope that no one ever watches this movie but if they ever do don't eat or you'll feel the way i felt after i first watched it. i think you would have a better time watching the santa claus 3. at least that movie had better reviews on this site.
