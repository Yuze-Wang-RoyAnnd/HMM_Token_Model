i had very low expectations for this alleged "re-imagining" of the original -- and they weren't even met! what were they thinking? (answer: they weren't.) please don't waste your time on this hollywood trash fest. clip your nails, balance your checkbook, do anything besides watch this. remember: if you rent stuff like this, it will only ensure they make more.
