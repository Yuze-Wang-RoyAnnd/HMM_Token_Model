the problem with family dramas is that, outside of tv movies on channels like lifetime, most people don't want to watch them. and the ones that do get watched tend to be sensationalized and about current or topical problems or issues in the news (or recent news). movies that explain or explore the human condition aren't popular. particularly with the young crowd that would be miss lohan's fan base or the younger crowd that tends to make movies not simply popular but financially successful for studios.<br /><br />the specific problems i had with this movie is the cartoonishness of some of the characterizations. it was a bit much to blame all of the lohan's character's acting-out (wrecking the car, drug use, etc.) on what her step-father did to her. while not improbable,it's just a bit much to expect the audience to swallow. additionally, other aspects, such as her giving the young morman boy, oral sex, or that she would actually make a good assistant to the vet, who coincidentally happens to have a thing for her mother, etc., all these elements just did not really help this movie along. it placed it more in the element of a situation comedy trying one of their "special dramatic episodes" then it did for a fully realized, well-written feature film.<br /><br />when you watch the dvd and listen to the commentary, particularly for the various alternate endings, you can really see all of this is sharp focus.
