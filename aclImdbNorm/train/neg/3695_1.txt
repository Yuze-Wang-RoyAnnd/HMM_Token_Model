not the best of actors' movies.the director has concentrated on projected actor's stardom rather than giving a good entertainer. may be hero himself, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it.but definitely it's not worth for neutral audience.the fight sequences are a total comedy.the dance moves in the song sequences are pathetic. the music is average.this film was the biggest flop for the actor. inspite of the hype created over the movie, the movie failed miserably. don't even think of watching this move even if you want to kill time. you can watch some cartoon instead.a good movie buff cannot digest this crap for 2 1/2 hours.
