holy crap. this was the worst film i have seen in a long time. all the performances are fine, but there is no plot. really! no plot! a bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that's your film. ug... robert duvall's character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over. this earns him the same responses over and over. i am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it. good performances with famous and well regarded actors, but the actual complete work is a steamy turd. well, maybe that's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film nothing happens! sack
