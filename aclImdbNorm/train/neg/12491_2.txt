hm. while an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes, point out atrocious acting, primitive (at best) special effects (all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years), severed ranks among the worst i've ever seen. i'm never sure who the protagonists are, all i know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen in the dance floor murder scene. all in all, i don't really like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable, the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion (which i can't remember anyway).
