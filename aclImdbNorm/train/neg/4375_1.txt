less self-conscious and much less pretentious than guts of a beauty, this kazuo komizu gore flick is worth a look (at least once).<br /><br />sleazy snapshotters escort wanna-be actresses/models to a remote house in the woods in order to sexually molest them. unfortunately (for the horny boys), a long-schlonged demon, who lives in the woods, has already targeted the girls for fun.<br /><br />the thing even ends up having fun with the boys -- that's if you consider beheadings, dismemberment and masturbation with severed limbs "fun".<br /><br />once again, it all sounds better on paper than it looks and sounds on film.<br /><br />just as komizu mangled living dead at tokyo bay with his ineptitude, he also mangles this effort and is only saved by some audacious violence and some great white panty shots.<br /><br />don't buy the hype, though, or you'll be sorely disappointed.
