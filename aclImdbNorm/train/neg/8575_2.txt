******spoilers******<br /><br />the unfunny radio quiz show host kyser and his mediocre band are the excuse for lugosi, karloff, and lorre to pick up a paycheck in this bland, sporatically watchable haunted house spoof. lugosi is a mystic whose seances are exposed as a fraudulent attempt to bilk an heiress' fortune; karloff is the butler and lorre is a professor who exposes fake mediums, but it turns out that they're both in conspiracy with lugosi. <br /><br />of course, kay kyser and his band of 30-something year old "kids" uncover the truth with the minimum of possible humor along the way. not recommended to any but the absolute horror completist.
