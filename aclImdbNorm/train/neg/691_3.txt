this one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre slasher movies but it's surely a damn bad movie.<br /><br />the holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates it's poor production values and stupid plot. i mean, the sub-genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far. there is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add.<br /><br />the clich`es are more than boring, the gore is minimal, and so does the mystery.<br /><br />this is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that shouldn't be hyped even if it has a video nastie label.<br /><br />i am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of trash.
