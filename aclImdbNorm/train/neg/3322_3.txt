unfortunately for me, the first busby berkeley movie i ever watched was "42nd street." i then expected all of his stuff to be that good. i found out that wasn't necessarily the case, even here, with my all-time favorite classic-era actor james cagney.<br /><br />oh, the musical numbers at the end are as spectacular as always, but the story is like many of the others and quite tiresome. they seem to always involve screaming, unhappy show producers. in this film, it's cagney who winds up shouting things out so often that he gives me a headache after awhile and his character wears thin....fast!<br /><br />even the songs in here are anywhere near "42nd street" class, songs you could hum for years and years - decades, i should say. the songs in this movie are not memorable. no, this is one of the few early cagney films - and berkeley films - i totally dislike and was very disappointed with while watching.
