yes, this was pure unbelievable condescending babble. we know that the french often have a skewed idea of the usa, it's puritanism and views towards sex. as an american (hoosier) who lives in france, i have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. and while some of these preconceived notions may be true, not one element of the midwestern town portrayed in this film rang real. a man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big? where in the world would you find that? a juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass? a town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from chicago, but with no major gas station, no tvs in the home, no mcdonalds, no kids... a population that knows each other's intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big family that hates each other. the adult males plant whoopee cushions at the local cafe, have farms but don't harvest, kill the guy they don't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it, and all with equal emotion? the liberated french girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity, the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in cornfields by the mere breath of an illinois breeze to helping deflower this same 17 year old farm boy? help! i am so baffled and astounded by the absurdity of this film that i am not expressing clearly how ridiculous it is. go see it for the a-to-z primer on what to avoid. gosh, i hope i didn't ruin it for you!
