i have absolutely no knowledge of author phillipa pearce or any of her novels and if tom`s midnight garden is typical of her work i probably would have had little interest in her books as a child . when i was a child i wasn`t really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count <br /><br />judging by this film version of tom`s midnight garden i guess pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist tom long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one . having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didn`t have in the 1950s so i guess there`s some political class ridden subtext there somewhere . there`s also a romance involving a young girl called hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories ? perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative <br /><br />this is a childrens film that seems dated by its source . it`s inoffensive but i`m surprised by its high rating by the imdb voters . i wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were 10 year olds who`d just seen the lord of the rings trilogy ?
