the comedic might of pryor and gleason couldn't save this dog from the tissue-thin plot, weak script, dismal acting, and laughable continuity in editing this mess together. it has a very few memorable moments, but the well dries up quickly. as a kid i remember this as a luke-warm vehicle for the two actor-comedians, but there was always something strange about the flow and feeling of what was being conveyed in each scene and how this ties to the plot overall. watching it again after many years, it screams schlock-a-mania. i'm not so concerned with the racial controversy, as i wouldn't mind seeing a movie take that issue on with a little levity. the most obvious fault to me is that the scenes are laid out like a jumbled, non-related series of 2 minute situation comedy bits (any not very good ones at that), that were stapled together by the editor after an all-nighter at the local watering hole. characters change feelings and motivations on a dime, without rhyme nor reason, between scenes and within scenes, making this feel as though no one had any idea of what to get out of the screenplay. not that it was any gem to start with. i feel bad for the two actors whose legacy is marred by this disaster that should never have been made. maybe my sense of humor has become too refined...
