this is just flat out unwatchable. if there's a story in here somewhere, it's so deeply buried beneath the horrid characters and jarring camera work that's it's indiscernible. there's a group of vampire hunters who go around doing their thing, and the vampires they kill have little aliens inside of them. they pop their heads out and talk like speedy gonzales. if you can imagine a blood and gore covered alien sock puppet screaming in horror as a cowboy dude zaps it with a cattle prod, well, that's what you get here. these folks are loud, obnoxious, violent, and just extremely annoying. then there are some anti-human humans, who stand around in their cgi spaceship being so incredibly pompous that it's impossible to take. these folks make hillary clinton seem like a right-wing extremist in comparison. they're friends with some vampires, or something...who cares.<br /><br />then there's the camera work. remember how everybody hated the thousand-cuts-a-minute crap from the recent rolleball remake? the folks who made this movie love that stuff. there's enough of it in here for three really crappy nu-metal videos on mtv.<br /><br />nuff said. this thing smells. in comparison, dracula 3000 is a masterwork.
