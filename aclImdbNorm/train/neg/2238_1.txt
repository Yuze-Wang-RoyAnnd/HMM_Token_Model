the video quality is awful. the sound quality is pathetic. the acting is horrific. the dialog is painful. the lighting is dismal. the editing is laughable. i could go on, but it would be pointless. snitch'd is a third rate amateur video being passed off as a feature film. this one is best left to collect dust in the video store bargain bin.
