nowadays it is sort of a trend to look upon all shows from begin 90's as classics (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days), and while some of those shows were/are undoubtedly good, this one is just pure crap. i watched this show a lot back in those days since it got a lot of reruns on tv back then, and even as a child i didn't like it. even a 8-year old can see how much the people in power rangers are overacting, and how much the special-fx sucked even back then. when the show doesn't resort to the painfully bad 'fighting'-scenes, it plagues the viewer with this unnecessary soap-opera about a group of teens and they'r little social problems every now and then. i don't know about you, but i didn't give a rats ass about any of that at all, and its basically filler until they have to 'fight' some dude again in a very clich'e alien-costume with fireworks or some toy-robot. you never feel 'involved' in some kind of way with this show, and the fact that most of the actors act like there really have no interest at all besides they'r wallet just enhances the lack of feeling.<br /><br />there is really nothing memorable about this show, and its pretty surprising that it got so many spin-offs (beetleborgs is a good example). all it is is just a quick way to make some money though. i challenge any 'fan' to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so good because i couldn't find anything that is even slightly appealing to children. my guess is that most 'fans' of power rangers will tell me that i "just don't get it" anyway, or something along that line. i really don't care though; this was crap back then and it still crap now.
