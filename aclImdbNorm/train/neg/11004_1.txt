it really impresses me that it got made. the director/writer/actor must be really charismatic in reality. i can think of no other way itd pass script stage. what i want you to consider is this...while watching the films i was feeling sorry for the actors. it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there, not enjoying it, just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying. id really like to know what the budget is, guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor. i want to write 'the jokes didn't appeal to me'. but the reality is for them to appeal to you, you'd have to be the man who wrote them. or a retard. so imagine that in script form...and this guy got that green lit. thats impressive isn't it?
