this movie seemed like it was going to be better than it ended up being. the cinematography is good, the acting seemed solid, the dialogue wasn't too stiff... but then about twenty minutes in there's this long scene with a doctor who you know is actually a patient at the asylum pretending to be a doctor - and it just goes south from there.<br /><br />on top of that, the demon is about the silliest looking hellspawn since the godzilla-looking thing in curse of the demon. there's also some odd demon worshippers who wear masks that look like the exploding teens from the beginning of logan's run.<br /><br />in the end, the cinematography couldn't save this movie. despite some pretty solid performances by the actors, the story just doesn't go anywhere. i think "hellbored" would have been a better title for this.
