first off, i'm not here to dog this movie. i find it totally enjoyable in spite of the poor production quality. the acting herein is about as abominable as the monster stalking them, although the monster itself is quite well done...impressively well done, at that. he actually looks kind of other-worldly, like an alien family on vacation landed in the himalayas and while dad was out taking a ... attending to nature's call, spot got loose and they just didn't have time to hunt him down. that, or he's the caucasian brother of the wishmaster. i haven't decided which.<br /><br />actually, this seems to have been filmed somewhere in snow country, yes, but more likely canada somewhere than china anywhere. the trees and vistas say canada to me, and it's okay that the set area never takes on the look or feel of uber-coldness one might expect to find in the himalayas of china. it's a sci-fi channel movie, so we can forgive the lack of location.<br /><br />further, apparently (as we have just established) sci-fi directors do not travel often, as they are not aware that commercial planes fly above weather like what is featured herein and the subsequent crash actually would not have happened. but as i said, it's a sci-fi channel movie so we must forgive a few things.<br /><br />the movie is pretty graphic at times, and rotates between "alive" about the donner party, "predator" about the alien in the woods, and any bad wushu movie where they fly about on wires. the yeti apparently can leap about like spiderman...or super mario...remember? "run faster! jump higher! live longer!" <br /><br />also, the yeti has missed his teddy bear. he's searched high and low for it, but cannot seem to make a cadaver work. poor yeti! you can't help but feel sorry for it. it has survived and evolved thousands of years only to succumb to severe teddy bear loss. he's missed his bear. or maybe it wants to mate, but that thought is banished! do ya hear me? well, it does seem to be an unmated male. rebanished! <br /><br />and it's superhuman. well, it's not human...it's super-yeti! but then again, what's normal-yeti? i don't know, but he has a definite michael meyers quality that is completely unsettling. and he's got this fabulous way of cleaning his fur. fabulous dahlink! it's spotlessly white at times when it so shouldn't be. he's fastidiously superhu-...super-yeti.<br /><br />all in all? this was a lot of fun to watch, has some great kills and a few honest plot elements. in spite of the horribly gravel-like production style, this is actually quite entertaining. i can't help wondering if they're planning on another one? <br /><br />it rates a 6.0/10 on the m4tv scale.<br /><br />it rates a 4.4/10 on the movie scale from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
