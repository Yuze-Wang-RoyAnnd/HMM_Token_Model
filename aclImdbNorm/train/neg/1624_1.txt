i saw this movie a couple years back. i could'nt sleep and there was nothing on. so i peeped it. what really gets me is it makes no sense and thats why its disturbing. richard gets tied up in chicken wire and jarvis starts making out with richard's girl while she's unconscious. then jarvis's buddy troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar. by the next morning it shows richard's girl talking to jarvis and trouby and then she walks back to richard and looks at him while he's still tied up. then they play some happy music and the movie is finished. i mean what happened? did they brake up? and what was she saying to those 2 guys(trouby and jarvis)? its to puzzling and to poor to. i can't stand movies that are disturbing and don't make sense. this was the worst film i've ever seen since the 90's version of lord of the flies.
