as much as i like japanese movies this one didn't just cut it... a movie that is supposed to be about rebels and the survival of a royal blood line turned out to be a very slow paced movie with a doubtful plot.<br /><br />the photography is ok, though i've seen much better sword fight scenes in other japanese movies, the fast cameras and the way they followed the characters didn't convince me at all. the soundtrack is so weak you don't even notice its presence.but worst of all was the way the plot evolved.i have to admit that, at some times, i had a hard time understanding who was who and what was going on...anyway the platonic love between the main character and another one was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from a hollywood influence.<br /><br />all in all, if your looking for an action japanese movie this isn't it. its very slow, with very few sword fight scenes and very sentimental... in a bad way...
