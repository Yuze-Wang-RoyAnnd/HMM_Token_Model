i saw this in the theater when it came out, and just yesterday i saw it again on cable. this i was able to reacquainted myself with the feeling of just how revolting this film is. the whole bunch of characters are self-absorbed narcisstic preeners. worst of all, it reinforces every negative stereotype about 20-something dating, even as it purports to celebrate people "finding themselves". the nice guys finish last, the jerky guys make out great, the jerkiest guys do best. the girls are all boy toy pushovers. only one character ("wendy") is seen doing anything remotely useful to society, and she dispenses with her long-saved virginity in a throwaway one-night stand with a scumbag, in a lushly filmed scene that we're supposed to think is romantic. what this really is is hollywood's concept of young america: permissive, detached, promiscuous, conceited.
