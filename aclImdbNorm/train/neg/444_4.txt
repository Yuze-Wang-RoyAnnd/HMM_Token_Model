(spoilers in this)<br /><br />"rosenstrasse" is a movie about heroic women in german nazi time. but it is way too long, it is not touching and sometimes even boring! there are too many clich'es and not enough good acting.<br /><br />the storytelling (storyline) is bad. like in james cameron's titanic an old woman remembers events of her live. good, now we've got a point of view. than there is another woman introduced who does the same. confusing is that they both are recalling events of lifes of other people! come on! this is a lack of knowledge of basic story telling...how can riemann know about the fate of the little girl's mother and her interrogation for example?<br /><br />the scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place. for example the scene when riemann is proposing to fabian. when did that happen? the scene looks like it is set in the twenties...<br /><br />riemann's character is of course a talented pianist, well, she is even a baroness! wow. her brother comes back from the eastern front, he has received a "ritterkreuz" which he is showing in some scenes. so he is a war hero and still a fine man who preserved his conscience. and he gained knowledge of massacres committed by germans. he even made some photographs! and so it goes, clich'e after clich'e is piling up and this is why the movie does not work.<br /><br />basically von trotta made a chick flick out of something what could have been a decent movie. and in the end it's all very simple. riemann finds a way to get goebbels into bed and - ta da! - everyone is free. which is not a historical fact but pure imagination despite the "true story" claim at the beginning. like "sass" it is vaguely based on a true event.<br /><br />it is sad but true, this is the typical german movie these days. it is bad! macaulay j. connor<br /><br />
