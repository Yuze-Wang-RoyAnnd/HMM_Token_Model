i heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early 80's movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see. well, i rented it and i have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as "april fools day", "friday 13th" and "prom night", this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story. characters that i found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer. another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket, he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting, instead, the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste, i was disappointed in his part in the end. as far as the true identity of the killer goes, when the identity was released as to who he was, i just laughed, but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed. this movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but don't spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory.
