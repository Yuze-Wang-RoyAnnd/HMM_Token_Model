first off, i had my doubts just looking at the dvd box and reading it saying that it was about of bunch of teens gathering at a lake where they will find do or something. any movie that has a premise like this has failed miserably, even as a slasher movie, except for the first friday the 13th.<br /><br />i wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times, but i just kept thinking that it had to get a little better. it didn't. usually, i think every movie has something that you can take from it. this has nothing.<br /><br />do yourself a favor, and find something constructive to do for 80 minutes. like, give yourself papercuts, or eat dirt.
