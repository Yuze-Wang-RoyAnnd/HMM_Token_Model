bloodsuckers has the potential to be a somewhat decent movie, the concept of military types tracking down and battling vampires in space is one with some potential in the cheesier realm of things. even the idea of the universe being full of various different breeds of vampire, all with different attributes, many of which the characters have yet to find out about, is kind of cool as well. as to how most of the life in the galaxy outside of earth is vampire, i'm not sure how the makers meant for that to work, given the nature of vampires. who the hell they are meant to be feeding on if almost everyone is a vampire i don't know. as it is the movie comes across a low budget mix of firefly/serenity and vampires movies with a dash of aliens.<br /><br />the action parts of the movie are pretty average and derivative (particularly of serenity) but passable- they are reasonably well executed and there is enough gore for a vampire flick, including some of the comical blood-spurting variety. there is a lot of character stuff, most of which is tedious, coming from conflicts between characters who mostly seem like whiny, immature arseholes- primarily cowboy dude and asian woman. there are a few character scenes that actually kind of work and the actors don't play it too badly but it mostly slows things down. a nice try at fleshing the characters out but people don't watch a movie called bloodsuckers for character development and drama. the acting is actually okay. michael ironside hams it up and is as fun to watch as ever and at least of a couple of the women are hot. the space sfx aren't too bad for what is clearly a low budget work. the story is again pretty average and derivative but as i said the world created has a little bit of potential. the way things are set up bloodsuckers really does seem like the pilot for a tv series- character dynamics introduced, the world introduced but not explored, etc. <br /><br />the film does have a some highlights and head scratching moments- the kind of stuff that actually makes these dodgy productions watchable. -the scene where our heroes interrogate a talking sock puppet chestburster type creature. hilarious. - the "sex scene." wtf indeed. -the credit "and michael ironside as muco." the most annoying aspect of it all though is the really awful and usually inappropriate pop music they have playing very loud over half the scenes of the movie. it is painful to listen to and only detracts from what is only average at best.<br /><br />basically an okay watch is you're up for something cheesy, even if it is just for the "chestburster" scene.
