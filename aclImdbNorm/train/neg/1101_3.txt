this bogus journey never comes close to matching the wit and craziness of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie. this installment tries to veer away from its prequel to capture some new blood out of the joke, but it takes a wrong turn and journeys nowhere interesting or funny.<br /><br />there's almost a half-hour wasted on showing the guys doing a rock concert (and lots of people watching on "free tv"--since when does that happen?) surely the script writer could have done something more creative; look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied up together by a converging them at the science presentation. not in this film, which pretty much ended the bill & ted franchise. the joke was over.<br /><br />the grim reaper is tossed into the mix, for whatever reason. this infusion, like the whole plot, is done poorly and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement. there's a zz top impression, hammered in for no reason. there's lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. but nothing really creative or funny.<br /><br />skip this bogus thing.
