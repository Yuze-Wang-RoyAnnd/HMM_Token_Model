omen iv: the awakening starts at the 'st. frances orphanage' where husband & wife karen (faye grant) & gene york (michael woods) are given a baby girl by sister yvonne (megan leitch) who they have adopted, they name her delia. at first things go well but as the years pass & delia (asia vieria) grows up karen becomes suspicious of her as death & disaster follows her, karen is convinced that she is evil itself. karen then finds out that she is pregnant but discovers a sinister plot to use her as a surrogate mother for th next antichrist & gets a shock when she finds out who delia's real father was...<br /><br />originally to be directed by dominique othenin-girard who either quit or was sacked & was replaced by jorge montesi who completed the film although why he bothered is anyone's guess as omen iv: the awakening is absolutely terrible & a disgrace when compared to it illustrious predecessors. the script by brian taggert is hilariously bad, i'm not sure whether this nonsense actually looked good as the written word on a piece of paper but there are so many things wrong with it that i find even that hard to believe. as a serious film omen iv: the awakening falls flat on it's face & it really does work better if you look at it as a comedy spoof, i mean the scene towards the end when the detective comes face-to-face with a bunch of zombie carol singers who are singing an ominous gothic song has to be seen to be believed & i thought it was absolutely hilarious & ridiculous in equal measure. then there's the pointless difference between this & the other omen films in that this time it's a young girl, the question i ask here is why? seriously, why? there's no reason at all & isn't used to any effect at all anyway. then of course there's the stupid twist at the end which claims delia has been keeping her brother's embryo inside herself & that in a sinister conspiracy involving a group of satan worshippers it has been implanted in karen so she can give birth to the antichrist is moronic & comes across as just plain daft. at first it has a certain entertainment value in how bad it is but the unintentional hilarity gives way to complete boredom sooner rather than later.<br /><br />it's obviously impossible to know how much of omen iv: the awakening was directed by girard & montesi but you can sort of tell all was not well behind the camera as it's a shabby, cheap looking poorly made film which was actually made-for-tv & it shows with the bland, flat & unimaginative cinematography & production design. then there's the total lack of scares, atmosphere, tension & gore which are the main elements that made the previous omen films so effective.<br /><br />the budget must have been pretty low & the film looks like it was. the best most stylish thing about omen iv: the awakening is the final shot in which the camera rises up in the air as delia walks away into the distance to reveal a crucifix shaped cross made by two overlapping path's but this is the very last shot before the end credits roll which says just about everything. i have to mention the music which sounds awful, more suited to a comedy & is very inappropriate sounding. the acting is alright at best but as usual the kid annoys.<br /><br />omen iv: the awakening is rubbish, it's a totally ridiculous film that tries to be serious & just ends up coming across as stupid. the change of director's probably didn't help either, that's still not a excuse though. the last omen film to date following the original the omen (1976), damien: omen ii (1978) & the final conflict (1981) all of which are far superior to this.
