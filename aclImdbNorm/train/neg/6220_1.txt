this movie was a real disappointment to me. i have been a fan of gram parsons for a long time, and when i found out they were making a film about him i was very exited, i got the movie on vhs when it came out, and was sickened by what i saw, this film wasn't about his life, it was about the aftermath of his death. i thought it would be a descent film about grams life and music, but they had to make a film about his death. i am tired of hearing about his deaths in books and movies, i wanted a film about his life, not his infamous death. i was very disappointed. i wish people would look at his life, more then his death. the only thing good about this film was its soundtrack. this film is a disappointment to any gram parsons fan.
