this will be brief. let me first state that i'm agnostic and not exactly crazy about xtians, especially xtian fanatics. however, this documentary had a tone of the like of some teenager angry at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games. i just couldn't take it seriously. mentioning how charlesmanson thought he was christ to illustrate the point that xtianity can breed evil? i don't know it was just cheap and childish -- made the opposition look ignorant. furthermore, the narrator just seemed snobby and pretentious. the delivery was complete overkill. i can't take this documentary seriously. might appeal to an angry teenager piss3d off at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games.
