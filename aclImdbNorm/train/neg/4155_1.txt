ok, i knew this would be a back alley f-film (well below b-film standards) going into it, so i thought, "man, i could use a good laugh, so let's see some nether-beings kill each other." well, what i got could have been found at your local "love toy" store. random lesbian scenes, very little fighting, and no plot.<br /><br />for example, one scene in particular i remember (for its sheer stupidity only; i've seen better porn on abc) is where the two main characters (i can't remember their names offhand...great movie, huh?) are driving along, as they mostly did, and the driver was tired of driving and stopped:<br /><br />driver: "let's pull over, i'm tired. you want to take over?" passenger: "sure, i can drive for a while." (once pulled over, the driver starts grabbing the passenger's boobs) passenger: "what are you doing? i'm not like that!" driver: "it's ok, everyone does it sometime." passenger: "ok then." (proceed to take off shirts, fondle, kiss, and perform fellatio)<br /><br />now, last time i checked, horror films were not in the porn section of hollywood video (unless you're into s&m, then you go elsewhere), and it definitely shouldn't be in the mainstream videos at blockbuster. don't get me wrong; i'm definitely not one of those people who hate porn, but i only watch it when appropriate and definitely don't want to watch it if i'm looking for a movie in the mainstream stores, as this one i rented was at one of the two retailers i named (and probably at the other too if i went and looked).<br /><br />worst movie ever, no one should rent it, and it should only be bought for a public burning ceremony. if i could give it a 0, i would, but i can only give it a * of 10.
