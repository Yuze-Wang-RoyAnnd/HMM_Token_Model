my first attempt at watching this ended in 8 minutes, roughly after the tv report scene, which i couldn't handle. it went approximately like this:<br /><br />reporter 1: hmm, there's a pyramid in our skies. reporter 2: i think it's aliens. *awkward silence* reporter 1: in other news...<br /><br />a few days later i watched it to the end, and it wasn't as horrible as i've imagined, but there are serious problems with this. about half of the plot can be easily discarded. and the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something.<br /><br />what use are the detective, the eugenics people, and the monsters which are disposed of momentarily by horus? more amusing was the monopoly scene. "we're all powerful "gods", who have lived for aeons, and of all the games in the multiverse we happen to play monopoly." monopoly? monopoly?! even erich von dainiken looks coherent, compared to that.<br /><br />the other half is terribly lacking. what did our protagonist do to get himself cryo-frozen? why was there no big event when he was released at the end? he had those pesky followers, remember? what happened to normal humans? what's the deal with the masked guy? how did the blue-haired girl appear? what's with her eyesight? etcetera, etcetera.<br /><br />visually it's ok, more or less, if you disregard the egyptian gods looking like walking turds with rotweiller heads.
