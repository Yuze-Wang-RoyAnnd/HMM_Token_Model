the writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story, but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much away from the film as to nearly render it unwatchable. basic elements such as character development were glossed over, at best. inconsistencies also reared their ugly heads. a massive mansion in the middle of the rural irish countryside? characters just "showing up" in the gardens during a stormy night (at very convenient times, i might add)? all in all it wasn't "bad". i rated it a 4, based mostly on the story and talent of alison elliott.
