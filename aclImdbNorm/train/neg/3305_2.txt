i absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film. the humor seems to be destined for corpses. it's slow. the story is too simple to be true. the characters do not raise much sympathy, a few non-important characters aside. nothing surprising happens. what did the writers of this script think? "oooo funny! let's make some old lady's high on pot! let's make them.... giggle! let's make them... behave like little children!! oooo, yes, that's absolutely brilliant and original!"<br /><br />this film has irritated me most from all the films i've seen in the last five years.
