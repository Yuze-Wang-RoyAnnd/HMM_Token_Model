i have read the book a couple of times and this movie doesn't follow exactly as it should. i could let this slide, it is after all a movie. however i have serious issues with the setting of the movie. nobody has seemed to mention that this movie and the book it is based on are based in actual events that happened in nebraska. i live in nebraska. i grew up in the town that this movie is supposed to be based on. first of all, the "small" town that is talked about as the setting, is the third largest city in the state. with a population of around 50,000. grand island is the largest city between lincoln and denver. second the scenery for the movie is wrong. grand island is in the platte river valley. which is very flat with very few trees. i tried watching this movie, but it made me mad to see my hometown being treated so bad. this was a real event. large sections of the city were wiped out. in the book they talk about riding bikes from mormon island to fonner park. i guess you could if you don't mind a 15 mile ride each way. for anyone who wants to know what really happened go here http://www.theindependent.com/twisters/
