although nothing can compare to vampires vs. zombies...in any realm of film making i will attempt to judge this movie.<br /><br />firstly, the special effects were breath-taking. when there was an explosion on the television screen i thought my entire house was going to explode, and when automatic machine guns were fired i thought the shells were landing on the floor right next to me. simply stunning my friends.<br /><br />but the scene when the jack black sound-a-like is giving the worst monologue i have ever heard i nearly killed myself, but don't worry since he was getting blazed in the movie he can pass his awful acting off on "i must be high". seriously, he must have watched himself mindlessly babbling about non-congruent thoughts that make absolutely no sense and just added that he must be "high" to justify his awful acting. well if you can say that to excuse terrible acting then if you talked to the writers, directors, executive producers, sponsors you will probably get the same response...seriously.<br /><br />with a production team called "shock-o-rama" i was shocked i didn't place a sawed-off shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after this shockingly terrible excuse for a movie was played.<br /><br />if you want to see this movie, then you should be murdered <br /><br />yours truly,<br /><br />the general
