"masters of horror" has proved itself a poor arena for 'message episodes,' and while a definite case can be made for joe dante's 'screwfly solution' (one of the best episodes of the series, period), most efforts to do so have come across as anvil-heavy and unimpressive (nothing defuses horror more than a soapbox). and 'pro-life' simply fuses reactionary viewpoints with ultra-violence; young angelique (caitlin wachs), seen running through the woods, is nearly hit by 2 doctors (mark feuerstein and emmanuelle vaugier) who just happen to be driving in to work at the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. angelique's father, dwayne (ron perlman), is a stone-cold, far-right holy roller who will do anything to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion. if for nothing else, 'pro-life' accumulated some buzz for its controversial issue, but john carpenter treats this whole venture with startling indifference--he seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself (which is admittedly poor); the slow pacing builds no tension, and simply brings the already ambling plot to a crawl. even when dwayne and his sons storm the clinic, guns blazing, it is a stunning non-event; later, when a doctor is tortured with a 'male abortion,' the scene comes off as gratuitous and unnecessary--an effort to pad out the underwritten film. the poor performances (perlman is sadly wasted here) become an outgrowth of the script, and carpenter's direction feels exhausted, as if 'pro-life' is the source of his next hot meal. by the time a spider-creature with a human head and a guy in a latex monster suit are prowling the hallways, you just have to wonder what the minds behind this mess were thinking...
