the premise sucked me in, but it was clear about 30 seconds in that this was either david lynch or something seriously terrible. interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list. i can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece (romero comes to mind), but there was nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one. the message seems to be that we must all pretend we have an iq of 80 (or simply get a lobotomy - jennifer what happened to ya?) and blindly follow the bible without any sort of self-examination whatsoever or we'll trigger the second coming. it's the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets into 110 story buildings (i work around the corner from the site of the former wtc). i like to think that god is a little greater than that.
