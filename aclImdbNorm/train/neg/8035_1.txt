this is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen... unfortunately, i am a horror movie buff and will rent any horror movie unless it's not made for t.v. when looking at the box it says it is rated r for gore and some language... where was the gore? was their one good death scene where you actually saw gore? i could have overlooked that if there had been some brief nudity or some good dialogue. there wasn't even one remotely witty or amusing line in this lame movie. sometimes horror movies are awesome because they are so stupid, but this was just sad.
