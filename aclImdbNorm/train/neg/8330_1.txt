i saw "shiner" on dvd. while i was watching it, i thought, "this is a really bad porn flick without the porn." i also thought, "whoever wrote this has some real issues." then i watched the director/writer carlson explain his process as a special feature. yeah, it was real special.<br /><br />the emphasis of the film is placed on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get off. they are marginally attractive. there is frontal and full nudity. these factors probably account for the film being seen at all.<br /><br />the most upsetting element of the film is the gay bashing and the subsequent further gay bashing of the same victim who tries ineptly to exact revenge from his assailants, the two drunken losers. not only is the subject handled absurdly and badly from a technical point of view, but the acting is horrendously bad.<br /><br />then there's the boxer-stalker theme. this is really insane, not just absurd. this hunky boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attentions of a fleshy momma's boy who works at his gym's parking lot. this is in la, mind you. the boxer is so traumatized that he turns up at the stalker's house, strips in front of him and gets excited in the process.<br /><br />well, all i can say is, why would a boxer who is at heart an exhibitionist be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker? it simply makes no sense. and, i'm afraid, some psycho-dynamics actually do make sense, if you take the time to read about them. however, bad scripts seldom make sense at all.<br /><br />the director/writer seems to have thought that this film represents a considerable minority within the gay community. well, he may be correct, i suppose. we may never know, since that minority would be so dysfunctional they would hardly be able to get organized enough to ever get to an obscure gay film festival or dvd store, the only two places they could possibly find this turkey. thank goodness for that.
