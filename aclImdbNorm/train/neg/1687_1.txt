if you go see this movie you'll be holding a grudge against the movie theatre, the director, the producer, the actors and the person that told you to go see it! shame on you, sarah michelle geller, for putting your name and face to this poor excuse of a movie. it may have been more scary if the japanese actors would have just spoken in japanese instead of attempting to 'act' in english. i wanted to boo when the movie ended...a true disappointment after all of the hype on tv and movie trailers promoting this lame money maker. sarah michelle really didn't have to act at all to make this movie...she just practiced her frowning skills. don't waste your time or money on this film.
