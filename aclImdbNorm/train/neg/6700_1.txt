is there a movement more intolerant and more judgmental than the environmentalist movement? to a budding young socialist joining the circus must seem as intimidating as joining a real circus. even though such people normally outsource their brain to hollywood for these important issues, the teachings of hollywood can often seem fragmented and confusing. fortunately ed is here to teach neo-hippies in the art of envirojudgementalism.<br /><br />here you'll learn the art of wagging your finger in the face of anyone without losing your trademark smirk. you'll learn how to shrug off logic and science with powerful arguments of fear. you'll learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you by labeling it as the gateway to planetary armageddon.<br /><br />in addition to learning how to lie with a straight face you'll also learn how to shrug off accusations that are deflected your way no matter how much of a hypocrite you are. you'll be able to use as much energy as al gore yet while having people treat you as if you were amish.<br /><br />in the second season was even more useful as we were able to visit other hollywood gods, holy be thy names, and audit - i.e. judge - their lifestyles. note: this is the only time it's appropriate for an envirofascist to judge another because it allows the victim the chance to buy up all sorts of expensive and trendy eco-toys so that they can wag their finger in other people's faces.<br /><br />what does ed have in store for us in season three? maybe he'll teach us how to be judgmental while sleeping!
