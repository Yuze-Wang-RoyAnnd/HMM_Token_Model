i'm not a huge star trek fan, but i was looking forward to this. i was intrigued by the pre-hype descriptions of the enterprise, its cramped-submarine styling and rough-edged technology compared to the treks we are used to.<br /><br />i didn't see anything all that interesting in this pilot. i found the plot to be convoluted and confusing.<br /><br />i will admit that i did like some of the character development - the depictions of the humans as an 'adolescent' species ready to outgrow their britches was entertaining.<br /><br />and that vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible rack.<br /><br />but i don't think i'm going to get hooked on this series.<br /><br />3/10
