the film is pretty confusing and ludicrous. the plot is awful...but on the plus side the acting is pretty good, with a few good shouts and rants. sharon stone is ok this time...not even half as good as the original mind you. the murders aren't as gory as the first one either, which is a shame. its not the unpredictable mess everyone say it is though. the sex is pretty graphic at times while others it is clear it is fake (they are fully clothed). the script is weak most of the time, but the scenes with banter and arguments between dr.glass and washburn are highlights. the plot twists a few times, but the ending is awful. the tension is always constant with a huge dollop of 'oh my god!'. the chase sequences are brilliantly directed, and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to an otherwise, rush-felt film. sharon stone is a bit old for this too. the bits where we see her breasts were, in the first one, delights. this time around, they are too horrid to describe. the films its self is rather average, but it is worth a go. mainly because the film does deserve some good buzz...with the opening sequence being a highlight. not to be critical, but if you liked the first one - leave this one. don't ruin the run. you'll be glad you left this stone unturned.
