i can't believe this is on dvd. even less it was available at my local video store.<br /><br />some argue this is a good movie if you take in consideration it had only a 4000$ budget. i find this funny. i would find it very bad whichever the budget.<br /><br />still more funny, i read the following in another review: "dramatics aside, if you love horror and you love something along the lines of duel (1971) updated with a little more story and some pretty girls thrown in, you'll love this movie."<br /><br />what?!? this is a shame comparing those two movies.<br /><br />i give a "1", since i can't give a "0". i just don't see any way this movie could be entertaining.
