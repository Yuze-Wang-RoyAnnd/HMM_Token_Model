*warning* possible spoilers below<br /><br />the film is more boring then anything else. there seems to be some attempt to build tension through badly lit shots of empty rooms and empty lawns, but none of it works.<br /><br />mst3k did a fairly good job with it, but on its own the movie is mostly tedious.<br /><br />funny moments:<br /><br />when the fake skull rolls out of a pile of ashes, the wife becomes hysterical and woozy while the husband (who is trying to drive the wife crazy) says in a deadpan voice "there is no skull there, there's no skull."<br /><br />when the real ghost-skulls have the husband caught in a pickle, as if trapped between first and second base.
