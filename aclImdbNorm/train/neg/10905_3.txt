guy is a loser. can't get girls, needs to build up, is picked on by stronger more successful guys, etc. seen it, saw it, moved on. i'd have to say that rob needs to move past the adam sandler part of his life. and get out of the adam sandler plots. there are two funny parts in the whole movie. i couldn't even finish the last 5 minutes. i was getting bored. "the animal" is an alright film. i do usually enjoy adam sandler films that have the same plot. but this was trying too hard to impress. the jokes are very old. so, trust me. this is not a film that most people could really get into. but some did, so i'll be nice.<br /><br />3/10
