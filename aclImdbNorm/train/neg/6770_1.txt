i went to see this movie with my 17 y.o. daughter. i insisted we go the matin'ee showing, not because i'm a tightwad, but just feeling i had. in the nascar spirit, this is a sponser's dream. so much blatant advertising, it almost qualifies as an info-mercial, if it weren't for the so-called acting. keeping with tradition, the herbie franchise continues with its cheesy story lines, the car is only a 'vehicle' (no pun intended)for this cornball of a motion picture. earlier herbie installments (although cheesy as well) were produced during more serious times, making them a little easier to digest. ms. lohan, disney's reigning drama queen, has little acting ability. i was surprised that mr. keaton and mr. dillon would get involved in such a project. only the snack bar, was a bigger ripoff!
