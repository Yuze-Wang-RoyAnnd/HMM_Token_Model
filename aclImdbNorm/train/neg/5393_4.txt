i am a shakespeare fan, and i can appreciate what ken branagh has done to bring shakespeare back for a new generation of viewers. however, this movie falls short of conveying the overall intentions of the play with the ridiculous musical sequences. add that with alicia silverstone's stumbling over the dialogue (reminiscent of keanu reeves in much ado about nothing) and other poorly cast roles, it all equals an excruciating endurance of viewing.
