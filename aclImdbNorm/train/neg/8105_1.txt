harsh, yes, but i call 'em like i see 'em.<br /><br />i saw this in the late 80's, and it was truly one of the most awful, boring films i've ever forced myself to watch.<br /><br />yes, the cinematography is lovely. the czech settings are truly stunning. the political backdrop is enticing, but unlike similar "historically set" stories (e.g. _dr. zhivago_ (qv)), this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story, or even interesting.<br /><br />sure, olin and binoche are beautiful. but this film manages to make even "erotic" scenes plodding and slow. i'm all for romance, but this movie was so boring, i started hoping the russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery.<br /><br />i'm sure if i'd read the book, the story would have made a bit more sense. however, life's too short to expend any more time on this one.
