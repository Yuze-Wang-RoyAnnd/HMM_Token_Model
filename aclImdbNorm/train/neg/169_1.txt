i saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from nyc. after 30 minutes, i said to him," you've got to be kidding. is this some sort of joke?" he thought it was good. i told him that i thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made. "what was it supposed to be?" i asked. "a propaganda movie made for children?" the plot is stupid. the acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life, love or even afterlife, of which it offers an incredibly idiotic view...need some psychiatric help. please, if someone tries to get you to stick this in your dvd or video player, consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computer...it won't destroy your player but it will destroy your evening. if they had made razzies in the '40s, this would have won in every category. (ps. it also goes under the dubious sobriquet of "stairway to heaven.")
