pretty poor firestarter clone that seems more like a bad tv movie than a bad feature film. how disappointing for this to come from hooper and dourif!<br /><br />government contractors do a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb. the boy born to the couple from the experiment constantly runs a fever of 100 degrees, and when he's an adult, people in his life start spontaneously combusting. he tries to find out why.<br /><br />the people completely on fire are well done, but when they get to the point that they are well done in another sense, they're obviously changed to dummies. when jets of fire shoot out of characters' arms, it looks silly rather than alarming the way it should. also ridiculous is fire that evidently travels through phone lines and erupts in huge jets from the receiver's earpiece. how is that supposed to happen, exactly?<br /><br />something else that struck me as silly about the movie is when a character has visions of his late parents. we later see the exact same shots from those visions in home movies.
