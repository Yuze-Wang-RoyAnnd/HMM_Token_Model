encompassing virtual reality, the potential of computers, communication with the past, the ongoing struggle to express your identity in a constraining society, and the fascinating ada byron lovelace portrayed by the fascinating tilda swinton, this film should have been great. but it is lousy, terrible if you consider the potential! the acting - aside from tilda swinton and karen black - veers from tolerable to atrocious. the plot construction is awkward to say the least - the modern day programmer is a dull one-note character, but half the movie is spent setting up her character, and then when ada finally appears, it is to narrate the events of her life, not to present an engaging story (swinton almost pulls this off, though). you never fully get to know her as a real person, just an icon from a grad student's history paper.<br /><br />the digital effects, such as a digital dog and bird, are lousy and distracting, considering it was 1997 and not 1985. and, finally, the script is just bad. bad, often pretentious dialog - especially the fights between the programmer and her boyfriend, which made me squirm - cold and distant characters, and zero attempt to create a sense of wonder. the programmer successfully contacts a person in the past! astonishing! but it hardly seems to surprise anyone, and her boyfriend says, "well, be careful." (although we're given no clue then or later why it might be dangerous, and it never seems to actually be dangerous.)<br /><br />also, despite being about computers and ada lovelace and her love of mathematics, it is clear no one involved with the script had any knowledge of mathematics or computers - any references to these subjects come across as complete mumbo jumbo that defies any suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />one scene, towards the end of the movie, is quite good, a monolog by tilda swinton expressing her sadness at the fragility of life but her joy in that life. poignant, passionate, and insightful, it seems to be dropped in from another movie.<br /><br />so i am disappointed in this movie, because it is a missed opportunity for a fascinating little cult film. if you find the subject matter interesting, you might want to rent it, but be forewarned. see orlando for another, much much better examination of gender roles in history with a great tilda swinton performance.<br /><br />***spoiler/question: * *<br /><br />at the end of the movie, ada asks that her memories not be preserved (in what i thought was the best scene in the movie). but then the modern day programmer seems to do it anyway, transferring the memories into her little girl (hence the title of the movie). am i correct, that the programmer violated ada's wishes without even struggling over it? or is this another confusing plot point that i'm misinterpreting?
