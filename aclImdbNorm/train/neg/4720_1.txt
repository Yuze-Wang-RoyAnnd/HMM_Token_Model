when i saw this "documentary", i was disappointed to see serbian propaganda in action once again. even though serbia and its nationalist politics is main reason of yugoslavian breakup, it is not mentioned in this "documentary", which is made by bogdanovich whose name tells us that he is serbian and his movie that he is far from being objective. it is one in the set of lies pushed by milosevic regime. everyone else is guilty only serbians were right and victims, even though most of the war criminals tried in hague are serbs, even though serbs are one who have committed genocide against bosnians , and attacked slovenia, croatia,and bosnia all independent nations recognized by the un.breakup of yugoslavia was not avoidable because serbians did not want to release the grip their nationalism has put on federal yugoslav government, so slovenia, croatia, macedonia, and bosnia were forced to become independent nations in order to protect their interests.if you are interested in an objective documentary about breakup of yugoslavia, and fact led documentary this is not it . you should watch "yugoslavia:death of a nation", made by discovery channel and bbc.
