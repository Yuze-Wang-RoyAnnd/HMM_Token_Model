ok, people, honestly... this gotta be one of the worst movies about show biz that's ever been made, but i've been laughing myself silly (which may be why i enjoyed it). basically, it's all about sex, sex and a way to get your own personal 15 minutes of fame. did i mention that sex was a major issue in this movie? if you have a thing going for bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment, watch this movie when you get the chance (and don't have something better to do). <br /><br />***attention spoilers!!!*** the funniest thing on the movie was the guy who asked jerry whether he could marry his goat (!) on the show and flashing his wallet with his love's pictures. a triple a for bad taste and fun!
