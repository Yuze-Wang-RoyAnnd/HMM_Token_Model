i loved the batman tv series and was really looking forward to this. but they tried to do too much.<br /><br />why they had the story of adam west and burt ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me. i don't want to knock burt or adam for the way they look now.....it's been 35 years since they appeared at batman and robin, but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting 'badguys' was kinda sad. i would rather of just seen the ex-stars do commentary. the batmobile side story was stupid.<br /><br />as for the flashback movie, i think it was too short and left out way too much. it was really just a quick overview in my opinion. i'd like more background. they showed the penguin and joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff i already knew. the joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex-smoker. that was it on those 2.<br /><br />i'd love to read the book. i am sure it has more in it that this showed. like why was there 2 riddlers or why 3 catwoman's or 3 mister freezes. where was commishioner gordon, cheif ohara, alfred, mister freeze, king tut, etc. the list goes on. like i said even the ones that were in this one were barely in it.<br /><br />very disappointing. and really corny.
