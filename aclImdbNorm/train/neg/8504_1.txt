semana santa is jaw-droppingly bad. it's so wrong in so many ways i don't where to begin. so, let's see...mira sorvino, whose judge husband has been shot while protecting her, goes from madrid to seville for her cop job. during the holy week (semana santa, see?...everybody begins to fall sleep..told u it was bad in so many points, even from the beginning), a killer executes his victims like bulls in a bullfighting arena. she teams up with male chauvinist pig olivier martinez and nice feodor atkine. soon she discovers she'll be the next target of the killer (who wears a red robe). why, oh but why?<br /><br />why..;that's the questionthat has been in my head the whole movie.<br /><br />q :why did go to see that a : because i love mira sorvino (i even excuse her for that at first sight crap)<br /><br />q : why were we only 8 people in the theater this saturday on the first week end of release? a : ah-ah-ah. spider-man got relaesed the same day. but also the fact that the movie has been blast with execrable reviews.<br /><br />q : why this movie has been made? a : money i guess. but boy did mira need the money.<br /><br />then...why???????????? first of all, there's always something wrong with european co-productions. here you got a french-english-german-italian-spanish-danish production. yi-ha.<br /><br />then it wants to play on the same playgroung as us thrillers/slashers/whodunit/mysteries/whatever. even valentine, though unnecessary and badly scripted and shot, was much better in the suspense and the fun.<br /><br />then , to give some credit to the story, the screenwriter wanted to add some political sight to the story. wrong : done in flash-backs in a traffic-like photography, it's certainly the most interesting thing i n the movie. could have stick to it, it wouldn't have to sit through the whole movie. better go straight to guillermo del tros's the devil's backbone (el espinazo del diablo)for some clever fun.<br /><br />then the homophobia. bullseye! the first victims are s&m drug addicted gay twins who got stabbed to death. the annoying olivier martinez goes to a dating agency held by a badly shaved overweight transvestive with a blond platinum wig. calls mira sorvino's character a big dyke all the time. do we need this kind of stuff? nah. just needless offensive remarks, just like ol'times.<br /><br />then the suspense. yipee. no apparent motive. the first murders are plain illusion as they're a representation of a famous painting. but no. and the revelation of the killer (a horrible fascist, of course) could have been done from the beginning as he appears at the end of the movie as, i guess, it was time for the director to say "weel, time to finish that damn movie. let's reveal right now who the killer is and why he kills".<br /><br />then the director thinks he's a director. wrong : no sense of suspense, no sense of directing the actors, no knowledge of change of pace. a giant, mega-bore. the scenes of the holy week are needless (maybe a co-production rule saying : ok, shoot in sevilla but show some creditsof this beautiful and historical town with the celebrations of easter. there we are : a mystery movie for tourists!)<br /><br />then the actors. all wrongs. mira sorvino bores herself to death : she does practicly nothing except getting stabbed in the right hand. everything she did best (the replacement killers, mighty aphrodite...) were like they never existed. olivier martinez...hello, anybody here? when the producers will learn that he's not an actor but a mannequin with no ability of speech nor feelings? feodor atkine, bland and transparent. only do we pay great respect to alida valli, one of the greatest actress this last century (and i hope for some more roles in this current one). she's tha main attraction here as she's the only one to give life to her poor lines. i won't mention the other actors as they're only one-sided characters, uninteresting and shallow.<br /><br />incoherent direction, inconsistent actors, implausible plot. idiocy incarnated.<br /><br />superwonderscope says : 1<br /><br />
