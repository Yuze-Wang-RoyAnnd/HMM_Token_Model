this is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen. again i made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too (after buying this and the movie "malevolence" which i reviewed on here as well, i have learned my lesson). i love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. this supposedly takes place in the woods of texas but was probably filmed in the director's backyard. the production was probably the worst i ever seen. the actors were absolutely the worst. the story didn't have anything to do with what the back cover said. i even tried to sell it to f.y.e and some other "mom and pop" store that buys used dvds and neither would take it. thats how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was. i have seen some bad movies before (troll 2 for example) but this definitely takes the cake. i didn't think there was a worse movie than "troll 2". boy was i wrong! do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but even than your stuck with it unless you throw it out which is what i am about to do!!!!
