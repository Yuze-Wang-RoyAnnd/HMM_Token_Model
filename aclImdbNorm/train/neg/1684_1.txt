***spoilers***spoilers***spoilers***spoilers<br /><br />there are bad movies and then there are movies which are so awful that they become affectionately comical in their ineptness. such is the case with columbia pictures' 'the grudge.' this cinematic atrocity began when an otherwise well intentioned american saw a japanese made for tv film 'ju-on' and was inspired to remake the movie in english. this began a virtual tsunami of bad decisions which circumnavigated the globe until it washed ashore in orlando on october 21, 2004.<br /><br />the premise, and i use the word loosely, involves a house in tokyo haunted by a skinny momma ghost who looks like a cross between margaret cho and alanis morrisette, along with her ghastly sidekick a chubby, rambunctious but evil second grader. is there anything scarier than a creepy 8 year old japanese boy? sure there is! count chocula comes to mind. with this whimsical bunch we must add a mysterious black cat who i have affectionately named chim chim. (remember speed racer?) as you have already guessed, they were murdered in this domicile of doom and now desire to kill everyone who enters the premises. you see, as explained by a japanese detective, when someone dies in a rage their ghost seeks revenge on everyone who steps on the property lines as defined by the county commissioner or something like that, i forget. <br /><br />the story begins innocently enough with acclaimed thespian bill pullman leaping to his death from a balcony. my guess is bill pullman got this job because of his kids begged him for a trip to tokyo disneyland. next we endure the mildly interesting saga of nurse yoko, 'oh no don't go in there' screams the audience, but alas she heeds not the dire warnings and is predictably snuffed out like a magic lantern. about 30 minutes into the movie we finally see its american heroine sarah michelle gellar as karen. sarah michelle gellar might be a competent actress but i could not help thinking of buffy the vampire slayer, so much so that it was distracting. it is the equivalent to having jennifer anniston star in a movie about the adventures of six friends in new york. try as you may, you just can't stop thinking about the other project which made her famous. but i digress, karen, the nurse is hired as a replacement for the original care giver who disappeared at spooks r us. <br /><br />she snoops around, meets the ghosts, coma lady dies, and some other stuff happens. watching the fair haired vixen searching for clues i half expected her to find the ghost and pull its mask off to reveal it was actually old man gower who owned the abandoned amusement park! 'i would've gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling kids and that dog of yours!' <br /><br />director takashi shimizu, who is vying to be the ed wood of asia, made two unfortunate decisions involving sound. first, he choose to use a soundtrack only when someone is about to be killed. this is an excellent devise for obliterating any suspense because the audience gets a two minute warning to prepare for another miserably predictable murder. second, he gave the ghosts a bizarre guttural noise that sounds like a gargling gopher. after the movie, i heard several people exiting the theatre making the sound and laughing.<br /><br />sarah michelle gellar ends up being the sole survivor. and of course we learn that the fire she set to burn down the house was extinguished in time for the obligatory next chapter. however, considering the humorous reactions of the audience, they did not want a sequel but an apology. 'the grudge' could be easily re-edited into a comedy, perhaps then it will be appreciated for its camp value. baring that, this will go down as the greatest cinematic thriller since 'godzilla vs. megalon.' i would suggest waiting until the movie comes to your local discount theatre where it can receive the public ridicule it so richly deserves.
