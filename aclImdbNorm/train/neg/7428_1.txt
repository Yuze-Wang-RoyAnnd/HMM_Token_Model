as usual, on imdb, going by the majority vote instead of the "weighted average" is far more indicative of the movie's entertainment value. in this case, the majority gives it a "one". how right they are! to start my review, i'll first admit that i am completely clueless as to why this movie is titled "alien intruder". it does involve space and even an "alien" (i suppose), but there's no rhyme or reason (at all) for anything in the long run, at least, no actual plot basis or resolution that i can make out anywhere.<br /><br />there are quite a few scenes that are so atrocious (with regard to both the lines, the timing, and how they are spoken), that it far exceeds the weird feeling you get when watching similar really bad movies. i have no idea about that part near the beginning where an electronic bugs bunny seems to be ranting about something.<br /><br />the "plot" solely involves an area of space known as the g-spot, sorry, make that g-sector...and a virtual reality program infected with some sort of alien(?) virus. i think it is alien since the image of the otherwise normal ariel appears as a photographic negative.<br /><br />for most of the movie, we see people getting shot with space weapons, falling out of lofts, and seemingly endless, pointless close shots of "where's ariel?", "can't find ariel" (pointless because most of the other shots include interaction with ariel, anyway - whatever) on a computer monitor. commander skyler (billy dee), sits and watches each fantasy of the convict's vr programs hoping to find this alien virus and become one with it...??? or maybe i missed something...<br /><br />billy dee williams took a few courses on "how to act in despair" prior to the filming of this. we know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers down over his face and looking mournful.<br /><br />the docking scene with the nose of one ship going into the rear of the other was semi-hilarious at least, and provided for a laugh in addition to the early scenes where we see several shots of the ship as it is just spinning in a circle, looking much like a lego experiment gone awry.<br /><br />it seems everyone dies in this movie, so why bother? even the vr females get killed, as if that is supposed to mean anything (especially since everyone else dies anyway)...outrageous.<br /><br />because of the money i save on groceries, i won't rant about wanting my money back that i paid for the dvd of this. the dollar that i saved on that bag of vanilla wafers paid for this reviewer's time.<br /><br />i'll just add that the story itself, at least as a novel, and with far more detail added, could probably be quite interesting with the right author.<br /><br />1/10
