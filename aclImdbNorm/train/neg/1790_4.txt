this was a "cute" movie at first, then then got too sappy and featured mediocre songs, at best.<br /><br />there is too much king james english spoken with is not only annoying in today's world but not always easy to interpret. can you imagine young people of today trying to listen to this film? forget it.<br /><br />bing crosby has some good lines in here and is likable as "hank martin." rhonda fleming ("alisande la carteloise") was, too, in addition to her good looks and beautiful, long red hair. <br /><br />it's a nice movie with a feel-good ending, and i can't knock that. maybe this is worthy of a rental, for historical sake or if you're a big crosby fan but, overall, it's not that much.
