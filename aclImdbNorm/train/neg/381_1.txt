this movie is traditional bollywood fare as far as the star power, sentimentality and love triangle of emotions. what really bothered me about this movie was the makers' absurd notion of surrogate mother. a whore who conceives a child with someone after have sex with the man (of the family desiring a child) is not a surrogate mother. neither is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother. i have seen indian movies and television shows that made 10 to 15 years ago that dealt with this issue more intelligently. the whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and absolutely implausible. i realize that most bollywood movies aren't meant to be plausible, but they don't pretend to be either. this movie wants us to emote along with the characters, but this can't done with such a ridiculous, contrived conflict. i would have expected better from abbas and mustan.
