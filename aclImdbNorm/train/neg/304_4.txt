this movie portrays ruth as a womanizing, hard drinking, gambling, overeating sports figure with a little baseball thrown in. babe ruths early life was quite interesting and this was for all intents and purposes was omitted in this film. also, lou gehrig was barely covered and this was a well know relationship, good bad or indifferent, it should have been covered better than it was. his life was more than all bad. he was an american hero, an icon that a lot of baseball greats patterned their lives after. i feel that i am being fair to the memory of a great baseball player that this film completely ignored. shame on the makers of this film for capitalizing on his faults and not his greatness.
