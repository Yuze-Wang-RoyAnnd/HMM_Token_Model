if you can believe it, *another* group of teens return to *another* lakeside cabin three years after *another* one of those fatal 'accidents' claimed one of their number. low and behold, a psycho wearing a patterned hockey mask (a cheap papery one at that) turns up to waste them one by one. this mechanical 'friday the 13th' knock off gained slight notoriety as one of the first digitally-shot features, but that's where the interesting facts end and all that remains is a predictable, amateur production with sub-par performances and a recurring boom-mic intrusion. a last-second twist does little to lift the spirits, and 'memorial day' is something best tossed in a lake and forgotten about. one for insane slasher collectors only.
