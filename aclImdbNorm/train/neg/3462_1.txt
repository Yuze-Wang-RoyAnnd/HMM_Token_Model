slash flicks come few and far between now a days, so when i heard about cut i had high hopes and heard good things about it. those good things i heard were all wrong..very wrong! this flick is bad and i mean bad. it's just plain stupid. everything about it. especially the killer's origin and how he stays alive and how he is taken care of in the end. there is nothing original or outstanding about this flick. just another slasher wannabe with those "hip," "self aware." "movie savvy" characters. i'm so sick of that crap. someone do something different cause the slash genre needs new blood, literally.
