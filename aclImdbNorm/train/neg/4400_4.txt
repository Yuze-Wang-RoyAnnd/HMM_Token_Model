one of frances farmer's earliest movies; at 22, she is absolutely beautiful. bing crosby is in great voice, but the songs are not his best. martha raye and bob burns are interesting, but their comedy, probably great in its time, is really corny today. roy rogers also appears- in a singing role. in my view only worth watching if you are a frances farmer fan, and possibly a bing crosby fan.
