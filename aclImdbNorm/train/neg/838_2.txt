[contains spoilers!!!]<br /><br /> timon and pumbaa are watching the lion king. timon decides to go back before the beginning, to when the story really began. so they go back. way back. back even before simba was born. back to timon's old home which was miles away from pride rock. a clan of meerkats burrowed underground to hide from hyenas. the worst digger in the clan was a pompous, self-centered meerkat named timon. his mother took pity on him but uncle max just shook his head. mother suggested putting timon on sentry duty; timon had dreams of a bigger and better place out there somewhere. just then, hyenas shenzi, bonzai and ed arrived and nearly killed poor uncle max. that did it. the other meerkats just wanted timon to go away while timon took it upon himself to leave. so he kissed his mom goodbye and started off. he didn't get very far before he started getting homesick. just then he met rafiki, who taught him to look beyond what he sees. timon had no clue what that meant so he continued on and met a warthog named pumbaa, who was all alone due to a flatulence problem. timon and pumbaa join up then, but timon declared them acquaintances, rather than friends.<br /><br /> they soon arrive at pride rock where all the zebras, antelopes, wildebeests, rhinoceroses, giraffe's, elephants and many other plain animals had gathered. what was going on? timon didn't care. they pressed on. timon then saw rafiki atop pride rock lifting into the air something he couldn't see. just then all the animals took a bow. was this to honor the birth of the new king? no, pumbaa had passed gas and the animals were bowing to cover their noses; timon and pumbaa try an assortment of new homes, but each are discomforting due to incessant singing or hyenas or a large stampede of wildebeests! pumbaa and timon suddenly find themselves heading down stream. when they reach land, timon decides to give up. but then they gaze around at their newfound paradise. it was beautiful: trees and water falls as far as the eye could see. timon named the place after a strange phrase he learned from rafiki: hakuna matata. timon and pumbaa go out bowling for buzzards one afternoon when they suddenly run into simba. they take him under their wing and become father figures. they teach him the arts of bug eating and belching contests. pretty soon, a teenage simba takes on timon in a snail slurping contest. simba won, leaving timon deathly ill.<br /><br /> then one day, simba's childhood friend nala arrived. timon and pumbaa just knew she'd break up the friendship. suddenly, simba runs away. nala and pumbaa race after him, but not timon. he chose to stay at "hakuna matata" by himself, until rafiki "talked" some sense into him, so he joins his friends at pride rock. timon's mother and uncle max arrive then. while simba battles scar, mother and max dig a large hole to trap hyenas shenzi, bonzai and ed in. it worked. scar is soon flung down the same hole where he is devoured by the hyenas. then all is well. mother, uncle max and the rest of the meerkats go live with timon and pumbaa in the paradise that is hakuna matata. back to the present, timon and pumbaa finish the movie when suddenly mother, uncle max, simba and rafiki want to watch it again. so do mickey mouse, donald duck, goofy, snow white, the seven dwarfs, dumbo, peter pan, the lost boys, mad hatter, march hare, genie, aladdin, and jasmine.<br /><br /> well, i must say that the lion king 1 1/2 wasn't as good as i had hoped. it was too ridiculous and silly. the original lion king was a masterpiece. it had a serious story with light comedy thrown in. this one was just silly and made a mockery of it. i swear, sometimes timon and pumbaa are just way too overplayed. they're overplayed to the point of no longer being funny, just annoying. the original voice cast is back: nathan lane as timon, ernie sabella as pumbaa, matthew broddrick as adult simba, whoopi goldberg as shenzi, cheech marin as bonzai, jim cummings as ed, robert guillame as rafiki. new to the cast are julie kavner of tv's (too) long running series the simpsons as timon's mom and jerry stiller as uncle max. so anyway, this movie isn't the lion king iii, and it isn't ii because there already is a ii. it takes place right after part i and part ii is a ways away. hence, it's 1 1/2. in conclusion, i don't recommend this to die hard lion king fans because it's far too ridiculous and frivilous. however the kids will love it so i recommend it to them. i hope this will also be the last lion king movie. two is enough. "the lion king 1 1/2". what we've come to expect from disney sequel makers.<br /><br />-
