another violent, angry fantasy from paul verhoeven. verhoeven is a puzzle: it's difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously, with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion. he also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world (and this has some outstanding ones) cannot hide a negligence to story, dialogue and performance. kevin bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy. bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side (`the river wild') in an attempt to offset his boyish looks; given the material, however, bacon isn't nearly hateful enough to compel. the other principals are elisabeth shue and josh brolin, neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who, when forced to deliver inane dialogue, embarrass themselves. the climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended.
