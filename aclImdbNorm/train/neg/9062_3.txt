this movie was different in that it didn't show the typical gay stereotypes that i'm used to seeing. but that doesn't change the fact that it totally lacks a storyline. i'm sure that there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves depicted on screen, since black gay characters are seldom seen, and when they are the characters are usually not fully developed. but, how hard would it have been for the writer to actually script a story with a beginning, middle and end. or how about a story that was focused. there really doesn't seem to be a point to this film, and even though it is a low budget film, that is still no excuse for the lack of story or plot.
