this picture seemed way to slanted, it's almost as bad as the drum beating of the right wing kooks who say everything is rosy in iraq. it paints a picture so unredeemable that i can't help but wonder about it's legitimacy and bias. also it seemed to meander from being about the murderous carnage of our troops to the lack of health care in the states for ptsd. to me the subject matter seemed confused, it only cared about portraying the military in a bad light, as a) an organzation that uses mind control to turn ordinary peace loving civilians into baby killers and b) an organization that once having used and spent the bodies of it's soldiers then discards them to the despotic bureacracy of the v.a. this is a legitimate argument, but felt off topic for me, almost like a movie in and of itself. i felt that "the war tapes" and "blood of my brother" were much more fair and let the viewer draw some conclusions of their own rather than be beaten over the head with the film makers viewpoint. f-
