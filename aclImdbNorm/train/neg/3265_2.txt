i have no idea as to which audience director george schlatter hoped to sell this comedy-of-ills. with redd foxx in the central role and enough pimpy outfits and polyester to carpet the entire 1970s, "norman" plays like a blaxploitation picture combined with any number of silly sitcom episodes involving comic misunderstandings, not to mention an elongated cameo by waylon flowers! based on a play by sam bobrick and ron clark, this tale of an estranged married couple (foxx and pearl bailey) learning the hard way that their son is secretly gay--and living with a mincing, prancing white homosexual--has enough limp-wristed jokes to shame any early episode of "three's company". bailey keeps her dignity, and foxx's sheer confusion is good for a couple of chuckles, but the rest of the performers are humiliated. * from ****
