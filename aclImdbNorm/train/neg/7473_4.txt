my husband and i were intrigued by the spectacle - a strong willed southern lady with a messy personal life solves crimes for the lapd. the first season was must-see tv for us. unfortunately, the stories of her personal life in the second season became so tedious and unworthy of the strong character that we stopped watching.<br /><br />my husband and i were troubled by the episode where she tries to hide from her mother the fact that she is shacked up. but the deal breaker was the episode where she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend but tells her boss. why would a strong, middle aged woman do those things? the answer is she wouldn't. additionally, my husband and i pick out the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy. it is almost always a white male or female introduced in cameo at the murder scene or in an idealized family. can't the script writers do something original from time to time? as i mentioned, we are no longer viewers. we prefer shows that don't betray the characters and insult our intelligence.
