i know i've already added a comment but i just wanted to clarify something...<br /><br />i'm not some old fogey from the baby boom generation that grew up glued to a flickering b/w picture of phil silvers, jackie gleason etc.<br /><br />bilko was already 20 years old before i was born but i had the pleasure of discovering phil silver's bilko courtesy of bbc2. i wonder if i would have enjoyed steve martin's travesty if i hadn't seen or heard of phil silvers - i don't know - maybe i would have.<br /><br />some of the other reviewers who think this movie is worthy of a '10' admit that they haven't seen the original. i can only urge you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching a single episode. if after watching the original ernie, colonel hall, ritzig & emma, duane doberman, henshaw, dino, flashman, zimmerman, mullin et al you still think that steve martin's film is woth anything above a '2' - i'll stand you a pint....
