really, they spelled it brain in the credits, not brian.<br /><br />ok, they didn't have the budget for a spell checker. all the production money went for great old cars. there are at least two packards visible here. one is a darin convertible. a nice yellow packard convertible.<br /><br />the scenes of the movie studio show that there was some money spent for costumes and set decorations. old cameras, an exterior of ciro's, street signs and whatever was needed to make a visually pleasing picture was there. poorly written and directed.<br /><br />my dvd says it runs for 104 minutes, approximately. it was more like 85 minutes. it came to an end without reaching a conclusion. there was a collision but no conclusion. the movie just smashed up against the credits. 99 cents for this. i paid 99 cents for this. i could have bought 3 cans of cat food and watched my cat's face as he emoted more excitement.<br /><br />for a few seconds in the ciro's scene after darren mcgavin gets a phone call, it looked like, maybe... this movie would have a surprise twist that would make for an interesting film. then it just sat there.<br /><br />the young latin actor played by steven bauer (tony montoya) could have had a much bigger part in all that was going on here. this cast could have made a good film.<br /><br />i think if they cut brian's part and use steven bauer in his place and change the script and keep the packards and lose the band and add a johnny otis sound alike band, then they got something.<br /><br />here kitty, kitty...<br /><br />tom willett
