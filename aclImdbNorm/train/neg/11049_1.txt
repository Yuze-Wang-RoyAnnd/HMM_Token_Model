if mr cranky had rated this, i'd be tempted just to copy his review and paste it here. but as he hasn't, i'll have to give it a go myself.<br /><br />the only thing giving this movie a 1 instead of a 0 is that malcolm mcdowall's acting is excellent. however not even he can save this film from disaster. the director must have been really distracted when he worked on this one because it is just a conglomeration of scenes that were thrown together with very little continuity - reminiscent of bad '70's movies. even worse, both the actors and director appeared to be making it up as they went along which probably showed how bad the original script was.<br /><br />it's not even worth discussing the story line although it revolves around a futuristic corporation called the proxate corporation who put together a crew of dispensable people to carry a dangerous cargo on an old container/slave ship to nigeria. this ship's computer is a baby kept in a glass jar and wired into one of the crew via usb 12 or something. the company should have been called the prostate corporation as the entertainment value of this movie is on a par with an examination of the same name.<br /><br />i honestly can't find one scene that i could say was well made and made any real sense in the context of the movie. i only watched it to the end as i had a touch of the bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people out there who were actually worse off than me - malcolm mcdowall in particular. i won't hold this against him as he's a great actor and every great actor is entitled to one bad movie in their career and this one is a doosie.<br /><br />so, unless this is the only movie your shop hires out or you're male and you're doctor isn't doing prostate examinations this week and you somehow feel this is a bad thing then give this one a really wide berth unless of course if you're really community minded, buy a copy to support malcolm and then use it as a drink coaster.
