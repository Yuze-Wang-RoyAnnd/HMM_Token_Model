spike lee has been in a decline since his early successes and this mess does nothing to help. i looked at my watch frequently hoping the movie would end or get to the point. lee's first movie with an all-white cast is a major disappointment.<br /><br />what's the point? that italians swear and like funky sex, but not with their wives? if i wanted to see scorsese, i'd go to a scorsese movie. the incredibly lame godfather character only adds to the stereotype.<br /><br />i've admired several of lee's films, especially "do the right thing". this movie is a waste of time.
