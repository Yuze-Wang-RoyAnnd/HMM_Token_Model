this is your typical priyadarshan movie--a bunch of loony characters out on some silly mission. his signature climax has the entire cast of the film coming together and fighting each other in some crazy moshpit over hidden money. whether it is a winning lottery ticket in malamaal weekly, black money in hera pheri, "kodokoo" in phir hera pheri, etc., etc., the director is becoming ridiculously predictable. don't get me wrong; as clich'ed and preposterous his movies may be, i usually end up enjoying the comedy. however, in most his previous movies there has actually been some good humor, (hungama and hera pheri being noteworthy ones). now, the hilarity of his films is fading as he is using the same formula over and over again.<br /><br />songs are good. tanushree datta looks awesome. rajpal yadav is irritating, and tusshar is not a whole lot better. kunal khemu is ok, and sharman joshi is the best.
