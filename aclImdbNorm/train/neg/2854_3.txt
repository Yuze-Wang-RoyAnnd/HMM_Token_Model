dreyfuss plays a mob boss who lost his mind, but now he's "fixed." lane is his girl who's been messing around with his number one (goldblum), who's supposed to have something going with lane's sister (barkin).<br /><br />with what anyone could consider an all-star supporting cast (burt reynolds, gabriel byrne, kyle maclachlan and even an appearance by richard pryor) can't help this plot, as dreyfuss proves he's not "fixed" and tries to kill just about everyone in sight.<br /><br />you know, it's not like you didn't know what was coming. the first ten minutes were nothing but guys trying to tell goldblum what was in store for him when dreyfuss gets out, but i'll save you all the trouble: skip this movie.<br /><br />the actual reason i picked this movie is because i've been on a diane lane kick lately and have been trying to see all her movies. the real let-down for me wasn't just the terrible plot, but also the fact that she doesn't show up until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (although we hear about her all through the movie). even being a fan of over half of the cast can't help me enjoy this film. the parts where the suspense was supposed to mount found me laughing at what was actually going on.<br /><br />3 out of 10 stars.
