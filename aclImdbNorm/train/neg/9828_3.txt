i rented this by mistake. i thought, after a cursory examination of the box, that this was a time-travel/sci-fi story. instead, it's a "christian" story, and i suppose is fairly typical example. if you are sold on the message you probably will overlook the awkwardness of the plot/acting/etc., but i found it rather painful. <br /><br />i have to admit that i'm bothered by the rewriting of history in this story. it paints the 1890's as some sort of paradise of family values and morality (a character is aghast that 5% of marriages end in divorce!), but it overlooks very unsavory sides of this "highly moral" society (rigid racial, sexual, and social discrimination were widespread, for instance). and at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that sound not all that different than the complaints of some iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as reported in a recent wsj).<br /><br />overall, thought, i suppose that it's the sort of thing you'll like if you like this sort of thing, and it's certainly wholesome...
