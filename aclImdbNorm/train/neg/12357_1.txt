i'll be short and to the point. this movie was an insult to any one with a room temperature iq. sorry liberals, feminists, etc. no women will ever be a seal. they can forget about the draft or being in combat too. ain't going to happen. you see, hard as it is to understand or accept, men and women are physically different.regardless of the fact it is 2007,reality cannot change things in order for people to avoid having their feelings hurt. men can't give birth or breast feed babies( oh-i forgot about san franfreako ).<br /><br />women lack the physical strength to be on par with men in a combat or other physically challenging situations. how many women play in the nfl or nhl? lastly, i couldn't give a bloody hoot in hell if what i just wrote upsets you.come to think of it - if this does upset you that only warms my heart more. i didn't write one thing that wasn't the truth. this imbecilic movie is nothing more than a comedy and a lousy one at that.
