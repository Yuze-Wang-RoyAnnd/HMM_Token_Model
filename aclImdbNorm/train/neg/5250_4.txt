i absolutely adore the book written by robin klein, so i was very excited when i heard that a movie based on the book was in the making.<br /><br />but i was severely disappointed with the movie when i did see it because it didn't capture what i loved about the book - the absolutely ridiculously funny erica and the interesting way in which she views the world.<br /><br />from the start of the movie, i realised that things weren't the same as i had imagined in the book. so, i just went along for the ride. it wasn't all that bad, i guess. miss belmont was totally different to what i had imagined her to be! i didn't think she would be one to smoke and drink - jean kittson, who plays her, is hilarious!<br /><br />on it's own, i thought the movie and it's actors/actresses in it did a good job, but alas, i'm such a fan of the book (one of my all time favourite books) that i couldn't help but feel disappointed =p
