this is only somewhat attractive for fans of "bad movie" entertainment. it is more worthwhile for students of 1970's pop culture: the fashions, the furniture, the attitudes, and that great "women's lib" moment of the early 1970's, when it was still fresh and novel for a self-employed, independent woman to exist.<br /><br />"superchick" (joyce jillson) had a monetarily rewarding if stultifying career (after all, what is a flight attendant but a waitress at 30,000 feet -- that goes for the male ones too), she slept around with multiple men, could protect herself and others (with karate) and wasn't tied down to anything. this is the kind of emancipated woman that scared the juices out of anti-feminists, those retrograde idiots who believe that no woman is complete without a husband.<br /><br />the "sexy stewardess" was a potent archetype of the late 1960's to 1970's, (geez, even on "the partridge family," i remember swinging bachelor ruben kincaid constantly hooking up with stewardesses) and from that point of view, this silly film is an important pop culture time capsule of the pre-aids, free-love, women's lib, swinging seventies. the plot is quite awful though. and for those cavemen in the audience, there are few bare breasts to look at.
