the good news is a movie was made, drawing on a supposed aztec myth and featuring an unusually aztec-american (is such a word exists) cast. the bad news is, it was dead at birth.<br /><br />if ed wood had come out of retirement and coached george romaro through his classic 'night of the living dead,' this is what we might have come up with. 'the legend of diablo' is clearly fodder for any future resurrections of 'mystery science theatre 3000!'<br /><br />i don't think one can even call this a 'b' movie. the production values are so abysmal that i kept getting the feeling i was watching either a lengthy skit from a variety show or a backyard 8-mm film shot by a group of school kids. <br /><br />some spoilers<br /><br />the basic plot line sounded interesting enough to lure me into renting it. a rural california sheriff finds a box containing an aztec demon and accidentally unleashes it on the unsuspecting community. his daughters, one hot and one homely, team with a gringo fbi man and a priest, to try to re-cage the demon. <br /><br />meanwhile, every zombie scene one has ever seen in previous undead movies is re-enacted-poorly. these zombies walk more like an army of nutty professors than the undead! the supposed infrared scenes from the demon's viewpoint are nothing special
