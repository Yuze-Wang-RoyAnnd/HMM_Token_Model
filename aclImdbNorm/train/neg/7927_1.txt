this movie is awesome. i watched it the other day with my cousin jay-jay. he said it was alright, but i think it rulezzz! i mean, it's so cool. ted v. mikels is so brave and smart. he made a movie totally unlike those terrible hollywood films, like the matrix and stop or my mom will shoot. it could have been better, though. i like ninjas and pirates. i also like that big talon that the funny man wears. i think he's the coolest guy since that domino pizza claymation guy. not only does this movie look really cool, like those out-of-focus movies my dad made of my birthday when i turned 6. but it tells a complex tale with dozens of characters that seem to be totally unrelated, but they all meet up in the end. it's genius how this web is woven to make everything meet up. i wish ted v. mikels would make a sequel. but it needs more aliens. and a pirate.
