a cheap exploitation film about a mothers search for her daughter who has been kidnapped by people who make snuff porno films. the trail leads the mother all over europe as she searches for her child and we in the audience struggle to stay asleep.<br /><br />this is one of the countless soft-core sleaze films that are made for people who want the excitement of porno with out the stigma or danger of it showing up on their credit card bill.personally i'd rather have the stigma since those films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we're seeing. this is suppose to be a sexy thriller but its not. mostly its people talking about things followed by lots of walking from place to place and lead to lead.periodically through out the film various people get undressed and everything has more than a touch of s&m to the proceedings. the violence and fetish material is of the sort to provoke laughter rather than horror or even excitement, its all so incredibly fake. worse there is not even enough nudity to keep it interesting. (basically par for the course for many of these films)<br /><br />you'll forgive my lack of details but it simply is a dull boring film that i stayed with to the end hoping for something remotely prurient to occur, but there was nothing. the most interesting thing was the blonde haired villainess with the huge over bite and nose the size of a buick. i watched her with morbid fascination wondering what she had looked like as a young girl and wondering whether she had had plastic surgery, not the type of things you should be thinking about in a gripping thriller.<br /><br />avoid.
