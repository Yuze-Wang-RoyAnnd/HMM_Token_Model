attack force has a horrendous title, and can almost certainly be judged by it's awful cover, because the film is horrible! a mish-mash of plot lines, a choppy mess, and a horribly stagnated pace, make the film hard to watch start to finish. i managed this and i'm proud. as a fan of seagal's work (mostly of his old days), it's painful to see him star in such tripe. true seagal's last half dozen movies or so, have sucked a lot, but some of them at least had some redeeming features. attack force is a mess. from conception to delivery this film has undergone many changes, from an alien plot line, to the current one about a highly addictive super drug, about to be unleashed on the romanian (the film has several settings, none of which are romanian, but all look like romania because they are in romania!) populace. the film is tacked together with little regard for whatever state the original shooting script was. plot-holes and loose ends are abound in the film that's for sure. that's been a problem in seagal's last few films as well, but never has the result been so boring. there's a whole plot line about the water supply being poisoned with ctx (that's the drugs cool name) that is never resolved! <br /><br />of course in recent years the plot's haven't been the main draw in the seagal canon so there was a big onus on the other departments, especially the action. before i regard the action though, all the other departments are poor. the direction is poor, or perhaps better put, made to look poor. who knows how director michael keusch originally intended this film? between him finishing his job, the re-shoots by stunt man tom delmar, and the editing, a coherent auteur vision is completely lost. the best way to describe the film is that it's just all over the shop! the cinematography is dull, nearly inducing sleep, while the droning score (sounding like it was produced on the cheapest of cheap synthesizers) does nothing to excite matters. the cast too are poor, unable to salvage anything here. seagal looks bored beyond recognition, and is dubbed through much of the picture, clearly when plot-points are being changed. he looks tired and overweight, and lethargic, unlike he's looked in previous pictures too (remarkable as the aforementioned have been key complaints in seagal's recent pictures). the only redeemable cast member is adam croasdell as one of the villains, doing a slimy brit routine. he seems to be a throwback to the alien plot line, because he's playing it inhuman. he seems like a cross between a body snatcher and a vampire (ditto to the lead villain played by some hot chick who appears on occasion, seemingly waiting for her husband
