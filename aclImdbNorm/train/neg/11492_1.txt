how can a major german tv station broadcast a mess like this? it's amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent - even the well-known gottfried john is acting very poor - especially in the double murder scene - how amateurish.......! the screen plan is very , very extended - perhaps to fill out 2 parts of the movie. be careful not to fall asleep while watching! the set is obviously very often a blue screen, f.g. the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in background...! in the german version the sound and the dubbing is very poor - probably reason: different languages of actors - but: other international productions do handle this much more professional. advice: do not watch - it's a diabolic waste of time!
