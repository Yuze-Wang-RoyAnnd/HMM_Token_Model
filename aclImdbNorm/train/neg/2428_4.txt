the thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy, shaky, camera-work and the fast, confusing cutting. i am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like oliver stone and steven soderbergh proof with most of their movies, but in this case there was way too much. it seems like the jump-cuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end. for a movie that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that it's story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development. that is another disappointing aspect of the movie. if i want to watch an over the top action flick i do not need any justification, but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of denzel washington's character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances. the first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb archetypes and clich'es are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens. so the movie does not work either on the level of a believable drama/thriller , nor as a pure action movie. of course the movie is not as bad as some oft the totally messed up blockbusters of the last years, but i absolutely cannot understand why so many people claim this movie to be something fresh and so cool. for a video clip it is way too long and for a movie it has too little substance.
