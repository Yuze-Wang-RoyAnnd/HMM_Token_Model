i liked how this started out, featuring some decent special-effects especially for a film 50 years old. there was some pretty impressive scenery. however, the film bogs down fairly early on with some very dumb dialog as the males all try to flirt with anne francis "altaira morbius.")<br /><br />viewing this in the '90s after a long absence, it was fun to see francis again, an actress who has done mostly television shows since this film was released....and is still acting. it also was interesting to see a young-looking leslie nielsen ("dr. john j. adams"), who i wouldn't have recognized had it not been for this voice <br /><br />i watched half of this movie before the boredom came almost overwhelming and i had a strong desire to go to sleep. i appreciated them re-doing this vhs tape in stereo. but it was a weak effort. this is one those overrated film where "elites" think is so "heavy" and "thought-provoking." that's nonsense. it only appeared "intelligent" because the rest of the '50s sci-fi films were so stupid!!<br /><br />some if the early scenes would have looked great on wideescreen, which i didn't have at the time of this writing. perhaps another look - this time on the 2.35:1 widescreen transfer would make me change this review.
