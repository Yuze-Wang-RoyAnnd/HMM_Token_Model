where to start, this movie started badly and ended badly! it consists of extremely poor acting and unrealistic effects that had me cringing in my seat, seriously, my cat could have acted better than this lot.<br /><br />some of it was actually laughable because it was so unbelievable, i would of rated this lower but they haven't got anything else! so, heed my warning and unless your so bored your close to suicide and would like a good reason to continue with your suicide mission, don't bother with this one. i'm still in shock that this could actually be released to the public, this should be a crime and all involved should be arrested. i gather you've got the gist by now so i'll leave it up to you to decide.
