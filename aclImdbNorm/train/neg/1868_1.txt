this film is terrible. every line is stolen from 8mm (the italian dubbed version, at least). if you like trash... real trash, give it a try; but beware: this ain't the "so bad it's good" kind of flick. in its cheapness, it may really look like a porno but, believe me, if you're looking for "snuff", s & m, hardcore, softcore... or even an ordinary erotic thriller, go find something else in store! i'm telling you this, 'cause the absolutely uninspired and unconvincing shooting, acting, plot, dialogues (the only good lines, as i said before, are the ones they stolen from joel schumacher's 8mm!) will bore you to tears in a few minutes and the "happy ending" is absolutely revolting! i'll give it one star: a half for the sudden shot in the back scene, after "the eyes of the victim" monologue (stolen from 8mm as well) and a half for mom & daughter's sexy bodies (that didn't manage to keep me completely awake while watching this turkey, anyway!)
