first to die 2003<br /><br />i'll admit my mistake first: i didn't realize this was a made for tv movie. i was "thrown off" by the "r" certification. the plot is strong, but the movie is about 40 minutes too long. the direction and continuity were excellent. for the most part the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their characters. the down side of the movie is that it definitely falls into the "chick flick" genre. although there are some violent scenes, none of the violence should call for an "r" rating. there is no nudity or gratuitous sex scenes. actually, there are no sex scenes. ona grauer (who is absolutely beautiful), kristina copeland, sonya salomaa, and glynis davies were all guests on the sg-1 series, but this movie did nothing to advance their careers since they were all used as low level supporting actresses. robert patrick was fantastic, as he usually is and mitch pileggi made me think of a modern day lee marvin. the very talented megan gallagher who i came to respect as an actor during the millennium series, was given nothing challenging to show her range of abilities. the greatest disappointment with regard to the cast was tracy pollan. aside from being a below average actress and not particularly attractive, her voice is absolutely annoying. i found myself muting the tv during her dialogue. i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the lifetime tv type of programs. i would not recommend paying any money to see this movie however. considering i found nothing that would cause censorship, this is a movie that is worthy for only watching on tv, since nothing will be cut out. as a tv movie i would rate this as a 5 out 10. as a feature film with an "r" certification and such as strong cast, i rate it as a 2 out of ten.
