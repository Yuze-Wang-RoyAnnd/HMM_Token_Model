the opening sequence is supposed to show the legion arriving in paris on 13 nov 1918. the troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the french army, including the legion, marched off to war in 1914! this a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey. (the french army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. metropolitan french troops were put into "horizon blue" and colonial troops were put into khaki.) the claude van-damme (sp?) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right. really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right.
