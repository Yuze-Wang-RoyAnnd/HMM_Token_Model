an okay film, with a fine leading lady, but a terrible leading man. stephan jenkins, who plays the husband, is a truly bad actor. joyce hyser, on the other hand, is the movie's saving grace. she's the best actor of the bunch.<br /><br />note* the first comment, by the fellow who heaped praise upon the movie (and, according to his imdb.com account, has only written one review -- and guess for what movie?) is obviously a plant. while the movie is nicely shot, it's by no means subtle or great or whatever other hypobolic descriptions the reviewer used.<br /><br />"art of revenge" is a fair movie, but it's a big tease. it offers up all manner of sexual situations but never goes through with it. like watching a skin flick on cinemax, but with all the "naughty bits" edited out.<br /><br />the film, as a whole, is a bit unfocused and the ending, and much of the third act, is really a big mess. there's a twist ending, of course, since every movie nowadays finds it necessary to have a twist ending.<br /><br />a 4 out of 10.<br /><br />
