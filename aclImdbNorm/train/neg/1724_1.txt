...and it is this film. i imagine that if indeed there is a negative afterlife, damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity. <br /><br />okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it is probably the worst film i have ever seen next to "manos, the hands of fate"... and i have seen a lot of bad movies, believe you me. <br /><br />this is just a crummy b movie, bad film-making at it's finest(or is it worst?) the thing i really didn't like about this movie is the moronic duo they threw in for comedy relief. now, a little comedy relief is a good thing, but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two morons, rather than on the "heroes" of this film, who are actually in it for less time than them! <br /><br />to be fair, crown international really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing a poor job editing. but honestly, this was probably a bad film to begin with, so crown really couldn't have done that much to hurt it. <br /><br />this really needs to be in the bottom 100 list. i wouldn't wish this one on my worst enemy. <br /><br />actually, it's my kind of campy b movie. it was bad, but i still liked it, despite my one star rating.
