i watched this....let me rephrase...suffered through this because i'm a fan of eva's. i don't think this is a flick she'll put on the back of her head shot photos. i like gangsta flix but this wasn't even close. the budget couldn't have been more than a few hundred dollars, and that money was probably spent on the caterer.<br /><br />the premise was interesting, but the first victim died before you get the chance to care about her or not.<br /><br />i won't bother saying who did what and how, because it isn't worth the effort. i'm only glad that because of my monthly rental plan at the local video store that i didn't have to actually pay for this garbage.<br /><br />oh!! before you flame on me, i love movies, i thought a lotta flix were good that some of you have jammed, so for me to jam this tells you all you need to know.
