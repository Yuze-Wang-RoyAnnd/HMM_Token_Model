i feel the movie did not portray smith historically. the goal of this movie was to tell smith's life in a way that would be "comfortable" to the lds church leaders, historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern. the movie was designed to be a "faith promoting" experience, not a balanced view of smith "as a man." i have taken it upon myself to study smith's life and have read both lds works and none lds works. the movie, like most lds projects, was beautifully filmed and well acted. however, this was not a realistic portrayal of either the beginnings of mormonism or smith's relatively short life.<br /><br />a significant period of time was given to reenacting an accident that smith had when he was seven. while this event was no doubt important in forming his mental outlook, it appears that the main reason for including it in the film is to help establish a sympathetic view of joseph smith. another point is in portraying smith's teen years the film is silent regarding the smith family's involvement in magical practices during the 1820's. another problem is while the movie shows joseph smith good-naturedly entering into wrestling contests, it fails to show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent.<br /><br />i could go on and on. this movie was not historical in any way and should be considered a fictional movie about a man. i would not recommend seeing this movie for any other purpose other then entertainment.
