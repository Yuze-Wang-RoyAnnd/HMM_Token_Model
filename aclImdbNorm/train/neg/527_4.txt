cast to die for in a movie that is considerably less. vanessa redgrave is dying but before she goes she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and of her secret love...<br /><br />this is one of those movies which has the look and expectations of being a great film simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it so it seems to be about something other than the potboiler that it really is. not bad as such but with redgrave, toni collette, glenn close, meryl streep, clare danes,natasha richardson,eileen atkins, patrick wilson,hugh darcy and others (all giving fine performances) you expect more than a weepy story thats a bit more than a harlequin romance.<br /><br />wait for cable.
