the only word i can think of to describe this movie is: ordinary.<br /><br />the plot line about gary sinise's character attempting suicide is a ridiculous premise and c'mon..living as some sort salingeristic hermit or recluse in a shack driving golf balls into the ocean because he couldn't handle life in the lucrative pro/am golf community? cry me a river. i wish these were my problems. i do enjoy dylan baker and sinise but this movie was clearly a bad choice or a pay check for sinise. the scene in which little timmy price gets verbally abused by the other club member in front of his father during the tournament is so over the top that i am embarrassed to watch it
