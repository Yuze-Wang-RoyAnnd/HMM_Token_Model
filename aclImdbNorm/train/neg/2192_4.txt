another movie that relies upon the trite, worn-out clich'e of the mad scientist gone madder. the movie centers around a surgeon whose life's ambition is to bring the dead...back to life. i know, i know...you've never heard that one before! of course, as all of these movies go, the experiment goes very, very wrong and creates a maniacal, bloodthirsty creature. for this promising setup, you'd think that it'd be at least a bit suspenseful. wrong. like many movies of this era, the idea is nice, but the execution and the script is mediocre. not the worst horror movie i've seen (no, abominator: the evilmaker 2 still takes the cake)...but not one of the gems, either.
