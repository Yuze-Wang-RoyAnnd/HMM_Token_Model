non existent plot, tons of poorly directed / super-cheesy scenes (snipers / world famous sharpshooters who can't even hit their targets a few feet away? plus what's up with the ending?---> a bunch of law enforcers vandalizing a carnival's shooting gallery? wth?), technical mistakes (how many bullets can you fit into a magazine of a glock? 100+? these people fire their guns without the need of reloading). the movie is so bad that even senior hollywood actor like michael biehn (aliens, terminator) can't save this junk.<br /><br />do not watch this movie (i realized that i wasted some good 100 minutes of my precious life on this one). hopefully the director would either stop making movies, or learn more for his next movie.
