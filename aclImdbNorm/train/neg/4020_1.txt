i will never be a member of any club that would have me,<br /><br />especially this one.<br /><br />starr andreeff is a single mom/stripper who gets attacked by a<br /><br />female vampire and left for dead. she begins to get a hankering for<br /><br />blood, and meets up with john savage, looking like he's<br /><br />wondering where he left michael cimino's phone number. savage<br /><br />is also a vampire and wants to let andreef join his little vampire<br /><br />family, which consists of a british vamp, the blonde vamp who<br /><br />attacked starr, and a green haired midget (i am not making this<br /><br />up).<br /><br />the family does not want starr, so they try to kill savage and starr<br /><br />and starr's kid.<br /><br />someone forgot to tell john savage that this was a drama. he<br /><br />spends most of his screen time exhibiting more facial tics than<br /><br />hugh grant on a jolt cola bender, and he reads all of his lines like<br /><br />he is making a farrelly brothers film. andreeff tries to make the<br /><br />most of a badly written role, but screenwriter/director ruben goes<br /><br />for all the vampire cliches, like starr eating her son's pet hamster<br /><br />and buying a lot of raw meat to fight the craving for blood. the kid<br /><br />also gets knocked around a lot, for those who think watching<br /><br />violence against children is really entertaining.<br /><br />the film is extra gory, but not in a wild, over the top way like "killer<br /><br />tongue." here, the gore is gross and never justified, it just occurs.<br /><br />it is just in the budget. most of the r rating goes to andreeff's<br /><br />coworkers, who are put through embarassing strip routines in the<br /><br />background of conversation scenes. the budget does not include<br /><br />vampire fangs! all the vampires here must stab their prey to eat.<br /><br />nifty idea, unless you have already seen george romero's<br /><br />"martin."<br /><br />even at 77 minutes, and once you throw in ruben's attempts at<br /><br />arty direction (skewed frames, blurred scenes), this is one<br /><br />tiresome, dull, and dirty ride. leave this club and take a shower,<br /><br />you will need it.<br /><br />this is rated (r) for strong physical violence, gun violence, sexual<br /><br />violence, strong gore, strong profanity, female nudity, sexual<br /><br />references, drug abuse, and adult situations.<br /><br />
