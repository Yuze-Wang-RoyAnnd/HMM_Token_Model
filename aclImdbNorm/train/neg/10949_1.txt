i go to the cinema to be entertained. there is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film. from beginning to end, there is no respite from the gray, grinding reality of this woman's life. it is one-paced, with no change of mood. i remained until the end only because i was convinced that things must get better. they don't, and i don't think i was the only one, as evidenced by the many groans ringing around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close. honestly depicting social depravation is no crime, but boring your audience to groans is not the way to win the sympathy of the public. a dreadful film.
