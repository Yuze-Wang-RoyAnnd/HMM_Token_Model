wow. i don't even really remember that much about this movie, except that it stunk.<br /><br />the plot's basically; a girl's parents neglect her, so this sicko pokemon pretends to be her dad. am i the only one disturbed by that? then, this weirdo pokemon kidnaps ash's mom to pretend to be the girl's. i don't care if he was trying to make the girl happy, that's just gross.<br /><br />there was no real plot. the girl was just a whiny brat who wanted things her own way. she played with unowns, was the "daughter" of entei and apparently could grow and shrink in age on a whim with the help of her "dad".<br /><br />that's pretty much all i can remember, but i think you can take it as a hint, and not see it. (or if you do see it, don't expect much.) 1 out of 10.<br /><br />seriously. if you want a pokemon movie, rent "pokemon; the first movie".
