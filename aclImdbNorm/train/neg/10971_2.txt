how irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me. overacted by the usual band of irish actors dragged out for every irish movie. terrible script, with forced character quirks (the brown sauce). romanticising all that is bad about dublin. the attitude of 'ah, it's a dump but sure isnt it great all the same'. plenty of tidbits purely for american audiences (the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase). and the nail in the coffin was colm meaney's character. a great actor forced to play this part that could've been written by a five year old. cringeworthy stuff. the best thing about this movie is farrell, and it's a bad when you have to say that. well, at least he wasnt putting on his dreadful american accent. international audiences be warned: stay at home and watch snatch and lock stock. you'll have a better time. intermission is a walk-outer
