saps at sea <br /><br />aspect ratio: 1.37:1<br /><br />sound format: mono<br /><br />(black and white)<br /><br />suffering from 'hornophobia', ollie embarks on a 'restful' boat trip, but he and stan get mixed up with an escaped convict (rychard cramer). chaos ensues.<br /><br />this feature length comedy - an ok entry which nonetheless unspools like a mere imitation of laurel and hardy's best work - marked the final collaboration between l&h and producer hal roach. episodic in structure, the movie culminates in a memorable ocean voyage after the boys are taken hostage by villainous cramer (who shoots a seagull to prove how tough he is!). the gags are ok, but inspiration is lacking, perhaps due to the recruitment of actor-turned-director gordon douglas, previously responsible for ollie's first solo effort in the sound era (zenobia, produced in 1939), but whose work here lacks a measure of pzazz. fair, but nothing special. l&h regulars charlie hall and james finlayson make guest appearances.
