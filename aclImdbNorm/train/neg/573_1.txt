the last reviewer was very generous. i quiet like the first movie, but can't say i enjoy this one very much. the beginning is bearable, but it goes downhill pretty quickly. i just don't see jon bon jovi as a "bad-ass vampire hunter" and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary. a lot of the scenes just do not make sense. i mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you, let alone an experienced hunter. why una is able to communicate with jovi? nothing was ever explain in this movie, you wouldn't mind if it was entertaining, but that was too much to ask. this has to be one of worst vampire movie i have seen.
