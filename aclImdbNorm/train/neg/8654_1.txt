the movie was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was a rip-off of joeseph conrad's heart of darkness ,the river is replaced by a road and the boat becomes a jeep and walter kurtz is osama.<br /><br />the claims made on the outside of the dvd box was overt fraud to<br /><br />take this fabricated death of a journalist and present it as factual<br /><br />while some portions have muslims supporting the 9/11 attacks for the usa's treatment of muslims around the world .<br /><br />i alerted the video store that the movie should be removed from their "documentary" section and be placed in the war-drama area for quasi fictional accounts of actual events.
