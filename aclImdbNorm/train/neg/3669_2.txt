i really cant think of anything good to say about this film...not a single thing. the script is a nightmare.. the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and doesnt seem to understand the difference. you'd think they would at least get a technical advisor. the performances were bad by most of the cast... although i dont really blame them.. the material really stinks. the editing was equally bad.. i'll just stop now.. its all bad 2/10
