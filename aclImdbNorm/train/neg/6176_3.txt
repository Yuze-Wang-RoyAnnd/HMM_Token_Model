i'm not a big fan of the stooges' slapstick, but i find their history interesting. i've recently tried to check out stuff from each stooge era, but the opportunity to see joe shorts doesn't seem to come easy; this is the only one i've seen so far.<br /><br />some say the quality problems with joe-era shorts are really not joe's fault, and i suspect that's the case. joe as a performer is far from the worst thing about this. the thing that bothers me the most about it has been pointed out in another comment: the pitting of the other guys against the third violates the whole comedy-team/stooges ethos. perhaps joe's style was perceived, by those in charge, as not really fitting in -- though there were no real off-camera conflicts between him & the others -- and this was their way of working around that.<br /><br />and what's with the titles of this and some of the other late stooges shorts? definitely a lack of creativity going on there; was that sort of thing the cause or the effect of the shorts market drying up?
