how this piece of garbage was put to film is beyond me. the only actor who is at all known to me is judge reinhold, an accomplished actor whose presence is merely a justification for putting it into production.<br /><br />i don't even think it is worth a nomination for a rotten tomato award, this film really does make b movies a cinematic enjoyment. a car travelling along the freeway with police in tow, and no one knows how to stop the car, yeah, right.<br /><br />the script must have been written on the back of a cigarette carton. most made for tv movies are awful but this redefines the word. check out the acting skills of the bridge operator, pure oscar material.
