why is this show so popular? it's beyond me why people like it. i think it's one of the worst sitcoms out there. <br /><br />because it's so popular, i've tried more than once to watch it and i can't make it through an entire episode.<br /><br />for one thing, the acting is horrible. everybody is overacting to the point where it's annoying to watch. they talk in unnatural voices, use unnatural tones, and have unnatural body language. i've seen better acting in a kindergarten school play.<br /><br />for another thing, it's not funny. the plots are dull. they're not creative, intelligent, or funny. shouldn't a sitcom be funny?? why am i not laughing?<br /><br />lastly, what is seventies about this? it's about as authentic to the seventies as "happy days" was to the fifties.<br /><br />oh and what is up with ashton kutcher? who cast this untalented dweeb? and now he's making movies?? oh, save us all!<br /><br />if people think this is quality television, it worries me.
