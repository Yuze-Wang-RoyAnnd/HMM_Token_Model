as a youth pastor i heard good things about this movie. then i watched it. the acting wasn't the best. that's forgivable. it's the message that's not: give jesus your life and everything will change - you'll tackle better, make amazing catches, stop fumbling, start making touchdown passes, and even make the playoffs. all because jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into all-american athletes. i laughed out loud when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals. but wait, that's not all. you'll get a brand new truck, a $6000 raise, and you and your wife's struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice. then you'll win the state championship because god helps a weakling kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than he's ever kicked before - and into the wind, no less - all because "god wanted him to make it." then you'll win the state championship again the next year. none of this good stuff would have happened if the team hadn't chosen to follow jesus will all their hearts.<br /><br />here's what i took away from the movie: god can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and it's all about making our lives better, easier, and more enjoyable. he chooses his favorite team and helps them win games. which bible is this story based on? i'll bet saint stephen wished he'd known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death. someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following jesus. it would have saved them all a lot of trouble.
