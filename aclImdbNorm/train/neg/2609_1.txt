this movie provided nothing new or worthwhile. after seeing it, my wife and i both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining. this is a good example of a "concept only" film--they have a concept about a film and the other details are unimportant because execs know it will make $$ just based on the initial concept.<br /><br />the movie starts with cruella getting out of prison and going on parole. she no longer hates puppies but has been programmed to adore them--she simply couldn't hurt a flea. this doesn't last too long after her release and she's back to her old ways. period.<br /><br />the most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters. eric idle as the voice of waddlesworth the bird made me hate him--and that is tough considering i am a die-hard python fan. it was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money (there can't be any other reason). cruella's low self-esteem servant, tim mcinnerny, was funny in the black adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny. and it must have cost a few bucks to get g'erard depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well. there were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were, i am trying to block them out of my mind.<br /><br />overall, you'd be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel.
