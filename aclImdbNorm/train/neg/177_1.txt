if you are planning to see this movie, please reconsider. i don't usually post my comments about something i've seen on television, but this one was such a waste of my life that i needed to do something productive to get that bad taste out of my mouth. critiquing this movie would take far too long as there are so many things wrong with it. i will just simply say, please do not ever see this movie. it was a complete waste of my time and it will be a waste of yours. anyone that wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things; utterly inept, or working for the company that produced it. again, i guarantee that you will indeed regret seeing this movie!
