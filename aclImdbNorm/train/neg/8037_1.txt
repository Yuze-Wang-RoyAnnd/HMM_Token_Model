ok, a slasher movie. a very, very stupid slasher movie.<br /><br />we got your stereotypical teenagers in a house thing going. we got a fbi agent that's seen dirty harry one time too many. "so what's the secret....punks?" we got about 4 different little camera shots and scene that make no sense at all. "hey man, i'm fixing the sprinklers" ((that guy was my favorite part of the movie)) suddenly there's a preacher tied up on a couch watching home movies, he gets killed.<br /><br />they follow the killer into the middle of nowhere, with no cops. suddenly she's in a church, wearing a wedding dress. i swear this is the stupidest slasher movie i've ever seen.
