well where do i begin my story?? i went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the actors that were in it, and that it was supposed to be a horror movie.<br /><br />well i figured out within the first 20 minutes, what a poor decision i had made going out seeing this movie. the plot was crap, and so was the script. the lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically.<br /><br />the cast couldn't have been more plastic looking. even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker...like they dragged on for no particular reason. very poor editing.<br /><br />all in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money. boo.
