best of the best 4, is better than 3, but just barely. basically, i say this because part 4 doesn't contradict parts 1/2 (like 3 does), (ie. their is no reference to tommy lee having siblings).<br /><br />anyway, i liked the russian plot line of the story, and especially sven ole-thorsen's bit part as boris. aside from that though and a few fighting scenes, the movie is nothing special. the limited budget is also very noticeable (especially in the airplane blow-up scene).<br /><br />also, part 4 does not really have a moral or say anything like part 3 did, there are a couple of more better known actors (hudson, thorsen) in part 4, but alas nothing like the beginning of the series (and even these characters have very small roles).<br /><br />alas, it seems best of the best is the rhee show, and to be truthful, he cannot carry a movie.<br /><br />saw on tape, rating:4
