it was meant to be a parody on the lotr-trilogy. but this was one of the most awful movies i've ever seen. bad acting, bad screenplay, bad everything. this is my personal opinion. i don't doubt any second that there are people who'll like this sense of "humor", but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as mel brooks or the zucker brothers. i'm working in a movie theater and in dvd shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas: at the movies it was a nice (but no big at all) success during the first two weeks but then, when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good, the movie dropped very fast. in dvd sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore. in the last ten years, the two worst movies i've seen are the ring thing and torque. i can't decide which one was worse, but i'm happy that there a so many good movies so i don't have to think too much on this question.
