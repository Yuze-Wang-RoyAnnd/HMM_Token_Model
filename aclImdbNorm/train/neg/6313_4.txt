well it's not often that we in the uk have a film made about inner city life from the perspective of the afro caribbean community, the last example that i can remember was the underrated babylon way back in 1980. so i had high expectations when i heard about bullet boy, a film that has been touted as the british version of la haine! well la haine it is not! i agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film an authenticity that has been missed in other british films of late, but my concern is that this film predictably ends sadly.<br /><br />the film intelligently deals with the escalating problem of black on black violence that is sadly all to common in london, but i'm concerned that film makers now use type-casting in plot as opposed to characters which is equally as damaging. saul dibb had a great opportunity to make a film that could be both entertaining and inspirational to us all, but sadly missed and created a film that only reinforces the idea that to be a young black male in london the only future is violence & tragedy
