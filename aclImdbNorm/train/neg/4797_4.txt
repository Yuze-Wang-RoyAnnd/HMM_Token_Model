after mob boss vic moretti (late great anthony franciosa) kills his lady whom has been cheating on him with derek, their new chauffeur/ vietnam vet, and blames it on the poor guy, derek finds himself in jail where he has to contend with a corrupt warden, vic's prisoner brother who runs the jail, and, oh yeah illegal experiments conducted by a shady cia agent (great genre-mainstay and first time director john saxon) to turn various prisoners into super-human invincible zombies. of course things get out of hand and it's up to derek, and the rest of the unchanged prisoners, to save the day after the infected ones take the jail over.<br /><br />john saxon is a great talented actor & as a director saxon is a... great talented actor. to say this movie (john's sole directorial outing to date) lacks a certain visual flair would be a bit of an understatement. however, the film isn't totally without merit. the dialog, while idiotic, is just bad enough to be humorous sometimes. sadly, this isn't really enough for the movie to coast by on that alone and it takes forever for the film to even start coming into it's own (which is fairly late in the movie). as such, the most i can recommend this film is to say that if you're a fan of saxon (which i indeed am), it's worth one watch, just go in with low expectations and you should be fine.<br /><br />eye candy: dana lis mason and tane mcclure get topless<br /><br />my grade: d+
