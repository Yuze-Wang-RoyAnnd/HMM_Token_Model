dolph lundgren broods and scowls his way through this incoherent mystery/thriller that's not nearly as cool as the box would have you believe. he is actually quite good here, but the story is a mess of b-movie cliches (detectives, revenge, tycoons, hookers, s&m) that looks like it was made up as they went along. the film picks up a bit in the second half but for a more decent lundgren flick, rent red scorpion instead.
