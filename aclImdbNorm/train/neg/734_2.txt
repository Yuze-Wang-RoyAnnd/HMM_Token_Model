this movie was crap with a capital "c." the opening scene showed promise. but that "promise" was broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot is going.<br /><br />and the wooden statue, morty, who was rather creepy in the original film, looks plain goofy in this one. it was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume. (and by the way, who else thinks "morty" is one of the most un-scary names on planet earth? it ranks right up there with "jimmy" or "fred" when it comes to horror value. or why not just name the wooden statute henry-freakin'-kissinger. "run, it's dr. kissinger!" that'd be about as scary as "morty.)<br /><br />and then there's a scene where the "hero" hits his father's tombstone with---"a sledgehammer?" you might guess--"a two-by-four?" someone might venture. no, he angrily beats his father's tombstone with a twig---a freakin' twig. but worse than that, once the characters walk away, the tombstone actually, and inexplicably, bleeds. oh brother!<br /><br />there's also a native american guy who lives with the main character's grandparents, but apparently, does nothing except morty-maintenance. he perpetuates creepy morty-legends, warns those who scoff, and even fixes morty's arm when it becomes damaged during a childish prank. but for all his respect for and tenderness toward morty, does morty give a rat's hairy behind? no.<br /><br />the movie drags on, and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears (sort of). this film is a real yawner. don't rent it.
