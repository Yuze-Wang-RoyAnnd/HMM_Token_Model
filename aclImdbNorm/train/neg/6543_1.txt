the 1990's begun to have day time talk shows sprout up left and right. every network had one, and they all lacked one thing originality. ricky lake was just another show to entertain the obese trailer park mother with a marlboro cigarette hanging out of her mouth while breast feeding one of her dozens of toothless, illiterate children. the english language and other cornerstones of mankind where ruined by this shows existence. titltes ranging from girl you a pigeon head and so on. how could anyone want to watch this pure and utter garbage? has our society really became nothing more than a bunch of hill billy's and dead beat fathers? the people who appear on this show were trash. the people who watched this show were trash. anyone that wishes to see this show re aired or put onto dvd is trash. people wonder why americans are becoming huge piles of lard and too fat to even get jobs, its having shows like this tell them its ok to be 500lbs overweight, and have 12 year old girls act like prostitutes. having such trash on tv has ruined morals.
