i'm not sure this is a spoiler; perhaps it is a public service. if you are one of those people focused on instant gratification who skip end credits, you will miss the final line of the end credits news announcer's voice-over, which states the u.s. has just surrendered to nazi germany on may 7, 1945 to end wwii. here are just a few of the problems with this close: <br /><br />1)the older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three more unholy movies in their mind's eye to fill in the yawning chasm between movie events and this startling conclusion.<br /><br />2)the average person will really kick themselves that they did not "watch" one of these unholy fill-in-the-blanks flicks created in their own head for free, instead of shelling out time and money to see this unholy from the video store (or on cable).<br /><br />3)this end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about wwii, leading them to the conclusion that george w. bush is the latest heir to the nazi throne.
