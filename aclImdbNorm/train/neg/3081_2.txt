good grief! while i still maintain that manos: the hands of fate is the worst piece of mental torture available, hobgoblins came awfully close. this...this...thing insults the audience at every opportunity.<br /><br />at least films like space mutiny and future war can be enjoyed on mst3k, this one was a struggle to get through. i was literally writhing on the couch in anguish. this thing managed to embarrass me - alone!<br /><br />even if you are a die-hard mst3k fan and have made it your mission to see every single experiment, think twice about seeing this one.<br /><br />it's that bad.
