when the film started the first 4 minutes seemed like a travelogue of california, i was wondering if i got the tapes mixed up. then i breathed a sigh of relief to see paul thomas in a scene with the lovely joanna storm and laurie smith. this is being spied on by jimmy (a young tom byron). jimmy's aunt (honey wilder) is concerned about his behavior so she hires him a private teacher (kay parker). i could do without the animal, robot role-playing, or the incest aspects.there's one good sex scene, between byron and parker, but it's not good enough to save this film.<br /><br />my grade: d+
