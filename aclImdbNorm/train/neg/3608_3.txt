i have a nice collection on movies going, and this one was added to it. number 274 to be exact. <br /><br />the title had me going at first. splatter university. i thought this would be a great horror movie. was i ever wrong. don't get me wrong, this is not the worst movie i have ever seen, but it could have been a lot better. i love all movies, but this one was one that was more of a laugh then a scare. <br /><br />poor audio quality, poor acting, and poor shot arrangements are some of the areas that could have been improved. 3 out of 10 stars.<br /><br />movie is ideal for a good laugh. if your looking for one of those movies to make fun of, then this is one!
