i don't know what margaret atwood was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book. i've always been a big fan of the robber bride and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works. i am aware that the translation of book to movie isn't perfect but this movie was the worst ever. the names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it. i feel like i lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie. this really should have been a mini-series to tell the story the way it was written.<br /><br />the actors for roz, tony, charis and zenia were well-chosen even though i was skeptical at first about mary-louise parker. i only wish they'd had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book at all.
