not exactly my genre, this straight-to-dvd street fight action is one i only encountered due to a friend putting it on whilst we had a few beers. i'm relatively open minded, and quite a fan of eamonn walker, so i sat back ready to enjoy myself.<br /><br />blood and bone is the story of isiah bone, an ex-con who becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons which eventually unfold as the film progresses. blah blah blah.<br /><br />what a tedious film. i understand that films like this don't rely hugely on plot, but do they have to stuff in such a silly, predictable and entirely stupid storyline? it may not be important, but by golly gum does it annoy me. better no plot and pure action than a cl'iche-ridden fleabag mongrel of a narrative. infused with entirely unfounded and unachieving sentimental drivel, it is the cinematic equivalent of a thin-skinned turkey stuffed with rotten innards. i should probably at this point mention what is, of course, the film's drawing point: the fighting. even in itself, the fighting is rather poor. bone manages to take out well established tough-man street fighters in single punches (a large oaf or two is the filmmakers' laughworthy attempt to rectify this inconsistency); fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a foolish ploy. even this is repetitive and stupid, arms broken and faces kicked with a steady alacrity that we get to see time and time again.<br /><br />a run of the mill, film-by-numbers movie which fully deserves its straight to dvd status, doing absolutely nothing new and everything we've seen time and time again. and not even particularly well.
