i go to ucsb and take some classes with the executive producer, alison anders. she's a superb teacher and director so anything she put her name on, i thought must be pretty good. this film as a selection at the santa barbara film festival seemed like a good choice.<br /><br />while this movie included some nice shots and cinematography, the lack of story and coherence really took away from anything the it was attempting to accomplish. my main problem was that this was someone's first film and you could obviously tell. bad acting and an even worse screenplay stopped this film from getting off the ground. the soundtrack had some nice music that gave a sense of the main characters struggle to cope with the sadness that lead to his leaving and now returning the place he grew up. i just have to say that despite some of the better craft of the film, it's lack of story and performance really prevented it from being some good.
