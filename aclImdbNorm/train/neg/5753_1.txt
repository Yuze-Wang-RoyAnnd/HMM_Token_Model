...though for a film that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror, there was a distinct lack of blood.<br /><br />there was also a distinct lack of skilled directing, acting, editing, and script-writing.<br /><br />jeremy london put in one of most appalling performances i've ever seen - his "descent into the maelstr"om" of madness is achingly self-aware and clumsy. oh look at him twitch! oh look at him drink strong spirits! oh look at him raise his brow, and cock his head at a jaunty angle! oh look at his unwashed, greasy dark hair! oh listen to his affectedly husky voice! he must be a tortured artist/writer/genius! oh, yes, out comes the poet-shirt - it's another boy who thinks he's byron. (or poe.) oh for the love of... did someone give this guy a manual on "how to act good" or did they just pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere, the defunct little plastic toy-prize in a discontinued brand of bargain-bin cereal. okay, that was a stupid line - but that's only because london's performance has melted my brain with its awfulness.<br /><br />katherine heigl is cute, and very briar rose, but has yet to grow into her acting shoes in this film - she delivered her lines like she was being held up, in fact, her whole performance was very wooden, her poses as stiff as her lines - who knows, perhaps she was just reacting to, and trying to neutralise, jeremy london's flailing excesses, but if that's the case, she takes it too far.<br /><br />notable is arie verveen as poe - while his character's role is confused, he delivers the best performance of the piece. he, quite simply, looks right, but it's more than that - he has some sort of depth, i believed that he had a life beyond the dismal two-dimensional quality of the rest of the characters. huh, maybe it's just because i like poe, and could thus just let my mind wander and invent while he was on screen - whatever, he had an interest factor otherwise missing.<br /><br />the rest of the characters are a faceless blur - there are all the usual caricatures: the perky blonde best-friend who's a bit of a floozy; the smitten local cop who's a bit of a dork; the protective older man who perhaps has too much un-fatherly interest in our heroine; the scheming old witch, etc., etc., yawn, yawn. <br /><br />as with the 'distinct lack of blood for a horror movie' issue, none of the themes that they mention (and that london's character mentions - so scathingly - in his attack on poe's writing) are followed through on. as another reviewer said - there was potential here: murder, incest, - genuinely shocking stuff, but instead they skirt away from the issues, and cut away from the violence (a raised candlestick swinging through the air - closing in on it's victim - then---cut to black! this is fine in a noirish traditional horror, indeed, it's expected, and is fondly received when it happens - it's a dear convention, especially when accompanied by fake lightning bolts and intense siouxie eye makeup - but in 'descendant' it just comes across as clumsy, or as though the editor got queasy at the last minute and cut it out.) this could have either been a very tense psychological thriller - the horror of palingenesis/delusion/madness - or a simple (and fun) slasher movie: it tries to be both, or neither (something new and exciting!), but either way it fails dismally. the only horror element of this entire movie is it's epic dullness.<br /><br />i think the editor (if there was one at all) must have been drunk when s/he chopped this thing up - there are awkwardly foreshortened scenes; scenes that appeared to be out of order (but that could have just been the poor script). likewise the director & cinematographer - there were some very strange shots and framing that i think were meant to be tributes to hitchcock or browning, but just ended up looking silly (again, fine in a noir, but this was trying to be something else.)<br /><br />the whole thing perhaps may have been funny (in that way that previous reviewers have mentioned - "omg how did this get made?!?") if i had been in the mood for some trash- bagging, unfortunately for me i had settled on the couch, with the lights down low, with the express intention of scaring myself silly - this is a very poor film, and i'm afraid i can't recommend it to people, not even for laughs.<br /><br />please, please, don't waste your time or money on this - either borrow a real horror/thriller film, or find yourself a copy of poe's fantastical tales, either way, you'll have a far more enjoyable and frightening night than you could ever hope to achieve with this rubbish.
