err...this movie sucked. a lot.<br /><br />i have been reading some of the other reviews. apparently there are a lot of people that think that anything woody allen writes or stars in is automatically good...<br /><br />i have watched several of his films, in the vain hope that i'm missing something. but no, they just suck. poorly written trash. the characters are all very stereotypical (not to mention rather stupid). the plot is...i think it is supposed to be mysterious. not sure on that. mr. allen's character is...woody allen, on any other film you have seen of his.<br /><br />if you are a fan of woody allen, go see this film. if you are under 50, don't bother. (if you are a fan of woody allen and you are under 50...well, you are atypical. i don't know what to say.)
