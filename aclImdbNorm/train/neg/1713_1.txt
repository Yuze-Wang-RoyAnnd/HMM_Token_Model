if you haven't seen zombie bloodbath, you haven't. a contest like 'make your own horror movie in one day' could not possibly come up with a entry than this outrage of an insult on any viewer's intelligence. mr. sheets forgot a story, a plot, proper dialog, the fact that people need some basic acting talents and the credited lighting designer obviously forgot to show up. it seems to be recorded on the crummiest of handycams, and copied on even worse equipment. make-up effect consist of black mascara for the zombies and yoghurt being poured over people's heads in order to simulate their skin melting. this is nothing more than a home-movie, and a really bad one as well. only fun to watch for the friends, familymembers and neighbours that were willing to show up for the filming. i cannot for the life of me understand why this mockery of a product is listed in any serious film magazine or website - i have home-movies of wedding parties that are way better and more interesting. a total waste of time, money and energy. the sequel zombie bloodbath ii is just more of the same rubbish.
