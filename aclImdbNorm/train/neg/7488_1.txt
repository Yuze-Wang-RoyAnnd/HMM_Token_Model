anyone who saw the original 1970 movie knows how an excellent cast, script, and director can put together a comedy masterpiece. by the same token, it's easy to see how the opposite of that can create another insipid hollywood bore-a-thon! this movie was pathetic! had it not been for john cleese (a comic genius), i would have walked out about 15 minutes into this dreadful waste of celluloid.<br /><br />neil simon wouldn't write another screenplay for this version (he said that he couldn't improve on the first), and i'm surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he wouldn't sue for defamation of humor!<br /><br />jack lemmon and sandy dennis did such a wonderful job in the original, what were the producers thinking about when they cast this one? how could the director and editor look at these scenes and think any of them were funny? i don't know, but one thing i do know---it's no surprise why foreign and independent movies are becoming more and more popular.......
