no matter what anyone tells you, there is a mere fact to the word "possession" in film circles -- such as "what possessed you to greenlight this film?" religion doesn't have anything to do with it, but common sense does. that is, if your head is clear and you are of sound mind to make a judgment.<br /><br />on many levels i tried to rationalize where this film would entertain....or even interest the average consumer. the star? the story? the unique idea? a buddy movie that kids would love with a dinosaur and a black woman? on, my goodness! i am sure when this was an "idea", it sounded good. but somewhere during the course of development...someone should have pointed out where the idea could not translate into a piece of entertainment anyone would wish to watch or pay for...unless they were very much deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and saw something the rest of us could not see.<br /><br />regardless, this is a complete mess. mess, mess - sin and a mess.<br /><br />who cares about the plot (what plot?) et al. whoopie got a paycheck, but i would have been embarrassed to take it. i sure hope she fired her agent/manager/publicist over this career move. obviously not, she went on to make more bad films. and more bad films. sad.
