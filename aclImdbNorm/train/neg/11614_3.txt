the lady in cement is a veritable course on social anthropology of the late 60's. the writing, not the acting, is at center stage. did i say - pure camp! prepare to be offended if you are female or gay. broad and dame are standard terms and gay baiting and bashing are represented for what they were in the day (camp- wise). most of the lines are tossed off although there are wonderful performances by a very few outstanding character actors. the action scenes are mundane but it is fun to see dan blocker play a tough guy who likes bashing toughs. and lanie kazan and racquel welsh are at the voluptuous peak of their careers. amazing to note they were both 28 years old and mr. sinatra was 53. the musical score, wait . . . was there a score? well, you get the point. watch it with friends who want a good laugh. it's full of them.
