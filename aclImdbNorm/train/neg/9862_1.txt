i couldn't believe it when i put this movie in my dvd player. i thought i'd have a good laugh, since i've played d&d for half my life. i had to turn it off as i had company and they were wondering what the crap i was watching.<br /><br />finished it later, and i should have just left it off at the soft-core gay clown porn in the beginning. no, they run the gamut of fart jokes, cum jokes, incest, racism, dressing up as kkk... this movie is flat out mean to anyone who's ever played d&d.<br /><br />no wonder it looks like the real d&d wouldn't let them use their game. who'd want their name attached to this?
