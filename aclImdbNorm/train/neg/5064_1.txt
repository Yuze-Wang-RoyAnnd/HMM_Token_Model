i don't believe they made this film. completely unnecessary. the first film was okay. but there was no need for a sequel, certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film. this film feels like a soap-opera. the writing is so bad, it's utterly simple. the jokes don't come across, the acting is flat, it's shot like a soap, it lacks any direction. the first film had a good emotional spine behind it. every character had a little arc. it was very simple then but somehow it worked and i could see the merit of that film. but this time around, there is no cohesive story-line. the characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. one good thing: the brazilian boy who plays axel daeseleire's son is pretty well cast. that was their one moment of creative success on this film. i hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to 'team spirit 2' but please god, don't let them make a third feature installment...
