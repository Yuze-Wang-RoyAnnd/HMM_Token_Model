this must me one of the worst takes on vampires ever conceived by men. how can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally uninspiring story? apparantly not such a difficult task... first of all, a conditio sine qua non of any vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this one lacks all these things.. too much light - the spots! oh my god, why in the name of christ/judas was that about?<br /><br />every time dracula came about he was devoured by light (in the script to keep him weak, for the record: just weak) there was only one scene that made it almost worth watching, near the ending of the movie (beatiful dancingscene with dracula and his new conquest). i really enjoyed the first one, the judas-twist was defintely original, but this one's just not good, not in any way. hopefully the third one will cary the vampire-signature i like so much in other classics like herzog's nosferatu, coppola's dracula or even interview with the vampire.
