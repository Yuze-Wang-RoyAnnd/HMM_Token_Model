this is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen. i rented it as a joke, expecting to get a giggle out of the first few scenes, and let me just say i've never laughed so hard in my life. the first scene where ninjas randomly pop out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action movie moments of my life. this is not a dinosaur movie, but more a movie that makes fun (and doesn't mean to at all) of the action genre. i didn't see the first two, but judging by the complexity of the plot, i don't think there's to much i missed. if you wanna see a movie that goes great with a six pack or any herbal remedy, than i insist you rent this movie and sit back and watch a 100 years of advancement in cinema get thrown in the trash and get shat on by carnosours
