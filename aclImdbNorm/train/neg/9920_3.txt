i love the music of the clash and i love the music of joe strummer and the mescaleros. i went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind most of that. but i came out of the theatre not knowing much more about joe than i already did after reading the entry on wikipedia. the movie never really gets through to the person, his thoughts and feelings. what they did was to collect the little material that they had, shaky blurry videos and to interview some people about joe strummer at a camp fire. it turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all, and that the director just wanted them in the movie in order to have some more celebrities say, "oh, he was such an inspiration to all of us". like bono or johnny depp (whom they seemingly asked to keep his pirate costume on to benefit from his current success in pirates of the caribbean). it seems that the director could not even wait until the body was cold before he jumped in to sell his version of "the greatest punk rocker and hippie at heart" that ever lived, sanctifying the person without really knowing enough about him.<br /><br />sure, being a fan i enjoyed seeing the images of the band, hearing the anecdotes behind the songs and such, but in the end i felt like what remained as the portrait of joe strummer could have easily been told in 60-90 minutes.<br /><br />go see the movie if you are a fan, otherwise better listen to some music of the clash or even better the undeservedly unknown mescaleros, where joe strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death, melting all his rich influences together to one amazing sound.
