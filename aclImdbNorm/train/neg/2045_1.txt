this movie must have been the absolute worst movie i have ever seen. my sister and her boyfriend went to rent zodiac (2007) and got this one by accident. thought it was a joke before the actual movie. this was terrible i was waiting for it to get scary and it never did. this movie had not actual facts about the real zodiac killer. the filmmakers clearly didn't even bother to research anything on the killings... they only liked the name... so they decided to write a script about nothing true to its name. i am upset i didn't realize it wasn't the movie sooner. i try to like something out of every movie, i don't hate movies... ever... except this one. if you could have given it no stars, i definitely would have. 1 out of 10.
