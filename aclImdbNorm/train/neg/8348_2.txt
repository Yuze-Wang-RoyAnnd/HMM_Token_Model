i just finished watching "el otro". i have always taken my hat off to julio chavez's performances, as he is a great actor, but this movie is really depressing and slow. i guess that it would have been even worse if it wasn't for julio. anyways, this is definitely a film that you will never understand if you are not from argentina, and even if you are, i would advise you not to rent this movie in order to have a nice time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends... it is really depressing and incredibly slow, and the plot does not make a lot of sense neither. probably the director wanted to show the fragility of the human life, but what he does is bore and impress the audience with scenes that shock you a little bit. it gives you something to think about, but not in a good way. overall, i definitely didn't like this movie.
