like most people i was intrigued when i heard the concept of this film, especially the "film makers were then attacked" aspect that the case seems to emphasize, what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob.<br /><br />then, to watch the film and discover, oh, what they mean by "the film makers were attacked" was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said "someone should beat those two kids up." the picture on the cover, "the chase" as it were? total fabrication. which i guess ties in with the theme of the film, lying and manipulation to satisfy vain, stupid children with more money and time then sense.<br /><br />i have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film. it's like michael moore's "roger & me", but if "roger & me" was moore mocking the people of flint. it's completely misdirected and totally inane. wow! can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets full of food? what jerks! and it's not so much, "look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah", since it wasn't just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors, it was that, as many people in the film say, the prices were absurdly low, someone mentions that they should've known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck. that's not proving anything except that people who are poor, will go to a store that has low prices, bravo fellas, way to stick it to the people on the bottom.<br /><br />way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people. you should be very proud. how about for your next movie you make a documentary about iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then, say, "haha! no such house exists! your so stupid and loved to be lied to by the media!".<br /><br />morgan "please like me" spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and it's no surprise since spurlock as one hit wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him.<br /><br />avoid like the plague.
