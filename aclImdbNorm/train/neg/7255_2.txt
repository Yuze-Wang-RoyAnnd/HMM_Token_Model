i wasn't particularly impressed by this movie that has lackluster music and only lasts 40 minutes. thank god, because i was falling asleep. i makes excellent use of time lapse photography to display the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow, people, water, clouds, etc. unfortunately, that's all it is.<br /><br />my preference is for its predecessor, the excellent koyaanisqatsi made in 1983 at 87 minutes and to prove that a sequel can be better than the original, powaqqatsi made in 1988 running 90 minutes.<br /><br />try them both.
