to describe this film as garbage is unfair. at least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby. this flick was neither absorbing nor entertaining.<br /><br />kevin bacon can act superbly given the chance, so no doubt had an irs bill to settle when he agreed to this dire screenplay. the mad scientist story of 'hollow man' has been told before, been told better, and been told without resorting to so many ludicrously expensive special effects.<br /><br />most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men, women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies. in the uk they were marketed as 'the transparent man (/woman/dog)' which is maybe where they got the title for this film.<br /><br />clever special effects, dire script, non-existent plot.<br /><br />
