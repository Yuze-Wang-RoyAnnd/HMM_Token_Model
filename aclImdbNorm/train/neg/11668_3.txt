there are pretty landscape shots. writers putting trite mouthings into actors mouths. with lesser actors this show would be silly. 'art must uplift humanity or it's bs.' not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side. the lead character even says those who don't drink hide the shadow side. wrong , he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not expanding his horizons with something other than landscapes. there wasn't a breathing organism in his work nor expression of his pain. all the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes. the discussions between the characters was grade school, trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted. i tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments on here. i had to dig deep to see those i agreed with. i figure the great comments were from those connected to the movie. i was moved only once towards the end. the kid was way too passive. the scenery was nice and the music ridiculous. just my opinion but nowhere show for me.
