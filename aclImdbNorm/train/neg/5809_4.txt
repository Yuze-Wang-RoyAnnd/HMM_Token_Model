i cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie. <br /><br />the 1972 movie with mcqueen and mcgraw is almost a classic. steve mcqueen was an outstanding actor and baldwin is only an inadequate actor. he has no passion in his play.also the action in the original "getaway" was fantastic. but the remake has no action! it is almost boring despite the fact that the film-making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. <br /><br />i don't understand the way that baldwin imprisoned from mexico. i think this is a mistake in the story.<br /><br />so i think that there was no need to remake it, or if they decided to remake a classic, they must choose an excellent actor for the first role, like johnny depp or brad pitt...
