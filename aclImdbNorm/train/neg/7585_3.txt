i love watching early colour films - you mean those 40s clothes weren't all grey? <br /><br />margaret rutherford dominates this movie. her "eccentric" garb is actually rather attractive and yes, she has an amazing hourglass figure. but i feel she was given her head rather too much. she probably developed this characterisation over many performances, and nobody told her "if it gets a laugh, leave it out." she does too much deranged fooling about when she's supposed to be surprisingly down to earth. the madame arcati joke is that mediums were usually portrayed as wispy females in long drapery. arcati behaves like a retired headmistress (we'll really put our backs into it!). the contrast between her breezy, commonplace manner and her wacky beliefs isn't really brought out.<br /><br />just because all the actors are english (apart from cummings), the americans feel they have to use the words "brit", "stiff", "lip" and "upper". oh, give it a rest! the three main characters lose their tempers constantly and make risqu'e remarks (did he make love to you? yes, but very discreetly - he was in the cavalry!).
