as a southern baptist, it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie. there certainly aren't so many that i want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. still, i must honestly say that "love's abiding joy" is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously christian film. the plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (i'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. as a tv movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. keep trying guys. you've got to have a movie about about real christians inside you somewhere. might i suggest you turn to g. k. chesterton or c. s. lewis for some inspiration?
