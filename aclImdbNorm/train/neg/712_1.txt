when i started watching this movie i saw the dude from buffy, xander, and figured ah how nice that he's still making a living acting in movies. now a weird movie i can stand, given that it's a good dose of weird like for example david lynch movies, twin peaks, lost highway etc. and you sort of have to be in the mood for one. this one however made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about there about conspiracy theory's that make absolutely no sense. i mean come on people nazi's who conspire with america to make an unholy trinity of evil powers? i was surprised they didn't mention the hollow earth in this movie with hitler flying saucers and lizard people. maybe if you had like 60 grams of heroine with this movie it would make some sort of sense, but seriously i don't condone drugs like i don't condone this movie. it should be burned, shredded and forgotten just so good ol' xander might get another acting job. it wasn't his acting though, that was alright, but the script just didn't make any sense. sorry.
