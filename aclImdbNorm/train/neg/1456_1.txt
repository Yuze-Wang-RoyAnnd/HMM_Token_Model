simply put, this is a simplistic and one dimensional film. the title, the rise to evil, should tell you that this isn't going to attempt to be anything deep or do much with hitler's character. rather, from the first minutes of the movie where we see baby hitler looking evil with evil music playing the background, we are given a view of hitler that presents his as a cartoony supervillian, seemingly ripped right out of a saturday morning tv show. the film really wants to make its case that hitler was evil but does anyone need a movie to convince them that hitler was evil? ultimately, making him such a one-dimensionally evil character is both boring and confusing (one must ask how the inept, phsycotic character in the film cold ever persuade a nation to follow him or be named time's man of the year). this film had a great opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the most horrible acts in the 20th century, and try to delve into his mind. instead, it basically just says, "hey! hitler was evil! just thought you might like to know..." over and over again. the great irony is that the film still was attacked for presenting too sympathetic a view of the character. give me a break.
