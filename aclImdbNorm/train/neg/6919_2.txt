my roommates & i nearly shorted out our tv from the numerous spit-takes we did while watching this hilarious piece of 1970s self important pseudo-zen dreck. i'd read about this campfest for ages and scanned my local late night tv listings for years in search of this elusive turd. several years ago our local abc affiliate was known for showing cool flicks for its late night weekend flick (ie "frogs", "night of the lepus", etc). then one day it happened: at 1:40am on a saturday night (over 5 years ago) there it was! we had over 15 folks over and the flick did not disappoint!<br /><br />see! andy griffith as the silliest & most unthreatening bad guy since jaye davidson in "stargate"!<br /><br />see! william shatner sport a variety of things atop his head that only faintly resemble human hair (or anything organic for that matter).<br /><br />hear! jaw droppingly inane 1970s psychobabble that makes "chicken soup for the soul" sound like bf skinner<br /><br />feel! content that any decade was better than the 70s.<br /><br />for those still reading...the plot surrounds a bunch of middle class mid level a--holes who decide to suck up to their s---head boss (griffith) by joining him on a cross dessert race that spans california & mexico. they all wear leather jackets, looking more christopher street than anything else. along the way they stop at a cantina, get drunk, smoke joints (the sight robert "mike brady" reed smoke a joint is an image you won't soon forget), start a fight, attempt rape, and just act like a bunch of suburban middle class jack offs. although i have an excellent copy that i taped off tv i wish this one would be released on video so the whole world could enjoy its half baked goofiness.
