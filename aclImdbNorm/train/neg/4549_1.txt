amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel "the celestine prophecy", which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in peru. home video quality actors present so-called characters spewing overwrought exposition and metaphysical hokum, while the film is propelled by the extremely heavy-handed direction of armand mastroianni. even though there are visible attempts at measuring up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain of abc's "lost" or dan brown's "the da vinci code", the filmmakers are hardly up to the task. this film reeks of ill-conceived mass consumption spiritual propaganda, and the results are so awful few can wade through this mess to spot a real point.
