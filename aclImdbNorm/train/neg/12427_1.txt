i hated this movie. it was absolutely horrible, poor,poor, pitiful acting, real real real stupid criminals that weren't even the least bit funny(unlike the first 2 home alone movies that were very good). all the boobie traps are weak, pathetic excuses for ideas poorly copied of of the first two which just meant that the people writing this movie were just lazy because their paycheck didn't go above 20 bucks a week. this movie is absolutely lousy, it's not worth even renting. in fact don't even watch it on t.v.! go use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two! i barely give this 1 star(out of 10). just trust me when i say, if you liked the first two, and you are not a complete stupid person, you will not like this movie,do not watch this movie!!!
