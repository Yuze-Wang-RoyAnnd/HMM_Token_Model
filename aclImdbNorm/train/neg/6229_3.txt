first of all, let's get a few things straight here: a) i am an anime fan- always has been as a matter of fact (i used to watch speed racer all the time in preschool). b) i do like several b-movies because they're hilarious. c) i like the godzilla movies- a lot.<br /><br />moving on, when the movie first comes on, it seems like it's going to be your usual b-movie, down to the crappy fx, but all a sudden- boom! the anime comes on! this is when the movie goes wwwaaaaayyyyy downhill.<br /><br />the animation is very bad & cheap, even worse than what i remember from speed racer, for crissakes! in fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie i "vividly" remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school... & it's the same kids over & over again! the fx are terrible, too; the dinosaurs look worse than godzilla. in addition, the transition to live action to animation is unorganized, the dialogue & voices(especially the english dub that i viewed) was horrid & i was begging my dad to take the tape out of the dvd/ vhs player; the only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes & comments like the robots & joel/mike on mst3k (you pick the season). honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time.<br /><br />heck, i'm planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on halloween for a b-movie night. because it's stupid, pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time, i'm giving this movie a 3/10, an improvement from the 0.5/10 i was originally going to give it.<br /><br />(according to my grading scale: 3/10 means pretty much both boring & bad. as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will become as fun as counting to 15.)
