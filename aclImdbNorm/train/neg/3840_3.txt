i'd heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and she recently got it on dvd. there was a lot of anticipation and excitement as we'd both heard that this was a terrifying film, really scary. how disappointed was i?? very!!!! apart from that one scene (we all know which bit) nothing happened!!! i was expecting to see the woman in black a few times and for her to do a few more jumpy scenes, like appear at the window or walk across the hall or something.<br /><br />nearly all the reviews here say what a scary, gripping, atmospheric movie this is. i just didn't see it i'm afraid. maybe there's a difference in what people find scary in the us to here in britain.<br /><br />a big let down after all the hyped reviews :(
