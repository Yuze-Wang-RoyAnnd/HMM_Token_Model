soon after watching this film you will realize why it didn't even make it to the theaters! this movie does not deserve the "prequel" tag. instead this is a common theme in hollywood, rip off previously good movies with disastrous prequels, sequels, etc.<br /><br />this film's plot was bouncing all over the place like a ping pong ball, and the character development was non-existent. i seriously felt like i was watching a comedy at some points in the movie because the acting was so bad. p diddy needs to stop tainting movies with his horrible acting, he actually made me laugh every time.<br /><br />the only good thing that comes out of this movie is jaclyn desantis, who looks excellent in this movie and actually brought some enjoyment from watching this film.<br /><br />if you are a big carlito's way fan, i recommend you not watch this. if you decide to watch it anyway then treat this movie as if it ripped off the original, because that is exactly what it did.
