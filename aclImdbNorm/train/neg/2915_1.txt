it's a bad movie, it seems like there is only 5 police in hk, they were not using there gun and this makes me feel like a jacky chan's movie. all the time they were using their gun to point at the suspect only. when they finally use their gun is when they kill each other, what a funny movie. in the movie, it's like all the good guys died without a reason.<br /><br />they story line of the movie also sucks, the story jump here and there and bored people. but if you wanted to see a bloody movie, i think this is only a ok type of movie, i think u.s. made zombie movie is more bloodier than this one
