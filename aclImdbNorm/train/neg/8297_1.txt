ugh! where to begin ... first, campbell scott's non-stop angst becomes a real turn-off after awhile (a very short while) as he internalizes his mounting anguish, curiosity and anger. only we don't care! these characters as presented by the writer and director are wholly unlikable, and therein lies the key. they haven't given us anything to make us care if they are adulterous and whether or not they are still in love with one another. when scott quietly tells his wife, "i could kill you" before their three daughters at the dinner table, after the shock of his selfishly poor timing wore off i almost wished that he had--and then done the same thing to the smug, wisecracking apparition of denis leary before being hauled off the the looney bin. an utter waste of time and perhaps--only perhaps--resources.
