start of with the good bit: several times swayze talks zulu to his friends or that language is heard among the tribes. that's a great plus, as normally usa & uk movie audiences think all people on this planet speak english (just in case you're one of them: no they don't).<br /><br />but the acting is 'tenenkrommend' as we say in the netherlands (it makes your toes curl -and not in a good way). i like swayze but in this he's awful. the muscles in his jaws make overtime and he's frowning the whole movie -some one must have told him it looks butch. no patrick: it looks silly and is compensation for lack of character. alison doody (elizabeth) has opted for a style of acting that does not meet the style of her co-workers. her acting is s'o relaxed that this movie could have been set in the current days. and it's not. your frock was a clue, alison.<br /><br />the best acting came from the people from the african continent and sided onyulo as umbopa i liked best. clear, warm and in character, his performance is a joy to watch. <br /><br />general: it is mwah-entertaining on a rainy day. pity. could have been better. sack the director.
