guernsey (maria kraakman - belgium/netherlands 2005).<br /><br />the mousy maria kraakman plays anna, a woman in her thirties, who finds out her husband (fedja van huet) is cheating on her but she doesn't dare to confront him. she painfully avoids any confrontation with human beings, her parents as well as her sister, so we have a main character in a feature film that doesn't do much at all. we barely know anything about her background or her motivations. just a woman who seems to be stuck in a blind alley, not just during this difficult episode of her life. she obviously suffers from something, but why do we in the audience have to suffer as well?<br /><br />i almost gave up on cinema after seeing this unwatchable mess. these were a very dull and painful 90 minutes. normally i try to avoid wasting energy on bad film making. i'll take the beating and roll with the punches, but in this case a fair warning is in place. how on earth did nanouk leopold get funding (in large part from publicly financed funds) for this turkey? obviously, there was no script to speak off. it could be compensated by an ingenious filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or a cast with only a little more appeal. none whatsoever, just a vaguely defined concept, "i want to do something from a woman's point of view". the result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life.<br /><br />to make things worse, there's not an interesting shot to be found in the entire film. i cannot think of a cast who could have spiced this one up, but johanna ter steege is a (small) light in the dark, if possible with this dire lack of material. i'm trying to imagine how leopold tried directing maria kraakman: "maria, look at the horizon, we'll film you for three minutes, just express sadness". a perfect cure for insomnia. get a copy and watch this late at night, guaranteed too put you to sleep.<br /><br />camera obscura --- 1/10
