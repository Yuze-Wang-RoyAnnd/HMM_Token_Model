ever since i was eight years old i have been a big wrestling fan. it didn't matter what federation i watched. wwe,wcw,uswa. to me the action is all i watched it for.<br /><br />may 23rd 1999. that was my 19 birthday. i ordered over the edge and i was just expecting another pay per view. but this time. i was wrong. instead that was the night one of the best wrestlers to come out of canada a true human being fell to his death due to a stunt gone wrong. not much you can do to change the situation. but what happened affter owens death made me very mad.<br /><br />rather then ending the pay per view and doing the right thing as human beings the wwe decided to protect what comes first and that was the money by keeping the pay per view going as if owens death never happened.<br /><br />i gotta tell you. vince mchmaon has made some stupid decisions in his life but this was by far the stupidest decision he ever made.<br /><br />and this crap with saying owen would have wanted the pay pew view to keep going. give me a break. when someone dies on a pay pew view its comon sense to stop it. thats like a police officer shooting a robber or a mugger with a run and then just leaving the man to die so he can go home and call it a day as if the mans life never mattered.<br /><br />but no matter what happens. owen will be missed and thanks for the memories for all the times you gave us.
