{rant start} i didn't want to believe them at first, but i guess this is what people are talking about when they say south korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill. after the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie "gwoemul" (aka "the host") of 2006-- which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a b-movie genre-- successive korean blockbusters have become more and more generic, even though their budgets (mainly spent on special effects) have become more and more fantastic. do south korean movie-makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill, which their industry has built up since the 1999 break-out film "shiri/swiri", by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland china did? {rant end}<br /><br />the only "reason" i can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a korean/ east asian-styled dragon i have seen to date, for the final scenes. now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 "dragonheart", the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons. remember "dungeons & dragons" in 2000? hasn't anyone learnt that the trick is not how much special effects you use, but how well you use it? i hope there are more (and better) korean legends they can use, because they have just killed a lot of international interest in korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one.<br /><br />in short, i agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how koreans felt about having their folk anthem "arirang" being played at the very end. as a creature feature, i would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it, but i've seen many video games with better camera work and scripting (just less dragons).
