a memorable line from a short lived show. after viewing the episode where that line was introduced my fraternity intramural flag football team started using the line to break our huddles on offense. instead of ready / break, our quarter back said football and the rest of the squad responded you bet! a fun way to break the huddle that had our opponents scratching their heads as very few of them had watched the show. using this line added a unique element to our season that i'll never forget. we had our best season during my time in college that year and in a small way it was due to the fun that we had using this line. the show was pretty much a stinker but it lives on in the memories of the 1977 pi kappa phi intramural flag football squad at west virginia tech.
