i'm a big fan of nicolas cage and i never thought he would work on a movie like this. i couldn't believe the other reviews and i thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once...but trust me, it is.<br /><br />i haven't seen the old movie..but why would they want to remake a movie like this. the very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. this film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb.i just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point , but it never does. <br /><br />so this movie is a big no no for both horror movie fans as well as for the cage fans. you could probably for it show up on television.
