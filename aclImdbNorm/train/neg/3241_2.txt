this movie had potential, but what makes it really bad is lindsay crouse's acting. i've never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some crouse fans out there that like her in something else, but her performance in this movie is bad.<br /><br />her delivery is robotic. when she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head. so, her voice has very little inflection. i can't believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie. she has to know somebody in the biz.<br /><br />now i hate to be this mean about her, but the comment has to be "this" long and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else.<br /><br />however, i liked where the story was going so i continued to watch it. the first part of the script has the makings of a good movie. but the end was disappointing as well. maybe if her acting had been better, i would have liked it.
