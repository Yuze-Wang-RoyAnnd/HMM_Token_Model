this movie is not only a very bad movie, with awful actors --or presumed actors--, a bored direction and a story unattractive, it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent "giallio" "torso", directed by sergio martino in 1973 (two years before), one of the most celebrated psycho-thrillers of italian cinema and a cult-movie around the world. in "la sanguinusa conduce la danza", the director replays the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl, with an peeping-tom watching from a window of the bedroom. naturally, the scene in rizzo's movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in martino's film. to put another black girl, another white girl and another peeping-tom replaying the scene is simply the most appropriate way of prove that rizzo's movie has no ideas, no originality, no taste, and nothing at all. i think that such things are an offense to spectator.
