this movie is actually worse than most movies i've ever suffered through, and i've suffered through a lot. absolute nonsense. it's got terrible, forced dialogue; pointless plot developments; really drawn out 'spooky imagery' scenes, which look more like a high school remedial art project than a horror movie; 5/10 at best attractive women; long, boring sex scenes involving said women (forget what you know about virgins! especially ones with lop- sided fake breasts); muttered, difficult to understand speech from some of the characters; and they actually used the masks from killer klowns from outer space during a masturbation scene, which should be a saving grace because that movie was pretty funny, but it isn't. veden fell is the lamest bad guy in the history of film. <br /><br />absolutely give this one a miss.
