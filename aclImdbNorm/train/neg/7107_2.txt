i am sure there is some sort of imdb cult that likes movies that mst3k made fun of. after seeing both this and "werewolf" and reading dozens of comments about how underated they are, i became convinced that there is some conpiricy going on here. alot of people are saying that people who hate it "are only scared by gore", "don't know good horror" or stuff like that. well, i don't really care for gore, but i do want something to happen in a movie! most of it is just the wife sitting and looking around! or walking around the house/garden! a movie requires something to give it atmosphoere, you don't get it by just have pointless scenes were someone walks around and stares. oh, and "makes you think"? yeah, i was thinking "move! you @#$0&%!!" one of the worst horror movie i have ever scene! <br /><br />p.s. for the record, i am a big fan of the old style of horror, dracula, frankenstein, that kind of stuff.
