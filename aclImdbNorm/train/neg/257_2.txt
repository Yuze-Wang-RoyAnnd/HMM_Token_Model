i love jamie foxx.<br /><br />and i enjoy 99% of all movies i see.<br /><br />and i walked out of this one.<br /><br />now, i admit, it may have had something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing ("oh no, jamie's knocking on a door! hee hee hee!"), but... this was just so incredibly annoying. there could be no sustained camera shot, and no camera shot from a conventional angle... everything had to be in-your-face, loud, and annoying.<br /><br />the bad guy tried to be smooth and malkovich-like, but at this point, it's just old and tired. he brought nothing new or interesting. from all the characters, too many lines you saw coming, too many you've heard before, and too many "tough guy" lines... and i don't mind that sort of thing, really, as long as there's a bit of originality to it. in fact, pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked.<br /><br />i love jamie foxx, and i think he's really funny, and i thought he was funny in this movie... but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else. <br /><br />this movie needed less shoot-em-up, less annoying camera shots, more emotion, more feeling, and more jamie foxx. i gave it a 2.
