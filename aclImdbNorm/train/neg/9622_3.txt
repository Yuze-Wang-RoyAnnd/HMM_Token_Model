when i saw that this movie was being shown on tv, i was really looking forward to it. i grew up in the 1980's and like everyone else who has grown up in that era, have seen every 80's teen and summer camp movie out there. so i couldn't wait to see this movie that totally spoofs that film genre. what a disappointment!! the movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over, with hardly any plot and no substance. and the filmmakers attempts at dark humor totally failed-some of these so-called jokes didn't come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive. the only good things about this film were the wardrobe, music, and acting. it was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the 80's, and the same goes for the music. and the acting was top-notch throughout: almost all of hollywood's best comedians were present. too bad they didn't have better material to work with.
