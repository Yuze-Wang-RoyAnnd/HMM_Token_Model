an inconvenient truth is as entirely simplistic and demagogic as the turgid slop created by the rabid and idiotic republicans, it meanders along intangible lines until it attempts to gorge something into your face, namely that we'll all be dead in a few hundred years, which is already indisputable, but who cares, humans are selfish, destructive creatures, i frankly do not waste my time caring about human extinction. i'll just call it a "natural progression". let the apocalypse begin, but meanwhile, we have to listen to the same brazen, slanted politicians who propose another "new society", well, don't be fooled, we'll all still be controlled by the wealthy, by those in power and by those idiots who created the catastrophes in the first place. nothing will ever change.<br /><br />al gore, whose hypocrisy is quite evident in the film, as he is being driven in a gas guzzling car all alone using a consumerist computer, he also lives on huge acres of land in a rather large mansion, the land itself was used for destructive erosive purposes including cattle, tobacco, pig farming (which accounts for methane gas traces) and who knows what else, his wealth is predicated on exploitation, greed and his investments include numerous large companies in the world with disputable records. i hardly think this man is qualified to lecture the less fortunate, but his prestige is based on his opposition to another ludicrous political party, that is all, meanwhile he emits those very same rancid characteristics that make politics and politicians so appalling. this bozo happens to be living the comfortable life and yet he's lecturing poor people in africa about crop farming and cut and burn techniques? he travels across the world in first class seats in fuel wasting jets, uses product placed computers in the documentary, and yet he thinks everything is a "moral issue". he's entirely absorbed in his own deluded nightmares, he says he came to these conclusions because of the death of his sister (from tobacco induced cancer and the near death of his son by an automobile of all things). did he fight against the tobacco companies or propose that automobiles be banned because they are dangerous hulking machines? no. everything must serve the "economy", so why is he any different, the answer is he is not.<br /><br />his forlorn and exhausted attempts at humanistic philosophy are disastrous, all this while he's being filmed in the forest or along a little river eschewing stale life affirming quotes. well mr gore, why don't you try living like the common people then? he is a politician, plain and simple, he has a career invested in the power structure. my question is, why doesn't he concentrate on the powerful industrial nations of the earth who are to blame for most of the complications? he doesn't do that because it would be unwise for "investments, stocks and corporations".<br /><br />al gore gives monotonous lectures about the subject in the documentary, namely to wealthy white people in the audience, who clap on cue, while showing them graph charts, numbers and percentages, and speaking in a dreary tone, no one without a harvard (which the elites control) education can make sense out of it, but he tells us everything is going to hell. no kidding, but i think he fails to account for this problem precisely in the approach that capitalism has taken for the planet, namely that it is expendable and a waste dump. he never once mentions how industrialization has created these problems, he just wants to put mild bandages on them but not eradicate the whole oppressive system. its obvious he was spoiled, sent to the schools for elites and has the same basic temperament for politics as any other back stabbing, inconsistent dullard in washington. whoever made this propaganda, as it is in no way different than what the republicans have conceived, had only goals in mind that were directed by capitalistic impulse. that is to say, someone is going to benefit, and it seems the "new green" politicians who support venture capitalist companies who are buying up hordes of land in an attempt to develop the "new utopian future" with "new technologies". it's the same old story, al gore is a believer in the elitist structure, he actually believes there is a "democracy" in the us which i find very naive. if we aren't paying wages to the oil companies, then we'll be paying them to the wind and solar companies.<br /><br />i find the speech at the end quite rancid, along the lines of something gw bush would have oozed over to the dumb downed masses, gore speaks about "people uniting together to defeat communism" in the 1990's, what it had to do with global warming, absolutely nothing but he attempts to get base emotions ruminating in people. with that said, he didn't understand that communism never existed in the world, the systems in europe and ussr were merely a tyrannical form of authoritarianism and capitalism, no less different than what controls the us interests. social ecology was not even mentioned here, which is really a travesty. if you want to change the world, then one must dispose of those antiquated systems that are based on greed, exploitation and violence.
