i gave this two stars for the awesome dv shot clarity, which lends to the cold and dark sterility of its character. that was being generous, i know.<br /><br />this film fails on all accounts. i can not recommend this, for it is neither poetic, nor blunt. neither dramatic, nor suspenseful. neither controversial, nor ordinary. it is just a wretched piece of trash that no horror or exploit fan can recommend in good faith.<br /><br />do not watch this, whoever you are. . .please, just stay away from this awful product.<br /><br />thank you.
