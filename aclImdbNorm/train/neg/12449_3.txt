sondra locke stinks in this film, but then she was an awful 'actress' anyway. unfortunately, she drags everyone else (including then =real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her. but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one? one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer. it's an exceptionally weak story, basically no story or plot at all. add in bored, poor acting, even from the normally good eastwood. there's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned, this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers. wow! could a film be any more boring? i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun. a real stinker. don't bother with this one.
