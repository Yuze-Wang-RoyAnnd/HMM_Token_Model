unfortunately there was not a 0 for a rating or else i would've chosen it. this movie lacks the star power that the original movie had in such abundance. carol burnett, albert finney, tim curry, bernadette peters, edward hermann, the innocence of newcomer aileen quinn, and expert directing from seasoned pro john huston (father of actress angelica huston)is what made this film so charming. even the 1999 remake with kathy bates, victor garber, alan cumming, and kristin chenoweth had more to offer than this sorry excuse for a sequel. before she did this movie all ashley johnson was known for was her role as little chrissie seaver on the prime time show growing pains. she had a few bit parts in movies but i don't know who thought she had talent enough to carry a movie on her own. and adding joan collins as lady edwina hogbottom, ridiculous! they couldn't get good enough actors to play the major roles like daddy warbucks, miss hannigan, and annie but they will sign joan collins to play some british lady? it doesn't surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was. the critics were right to have not agreed with this movie, even if it was only made for tv, it was a poor sequel to an otherwise lovable movie.
