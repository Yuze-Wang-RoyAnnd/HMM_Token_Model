you know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of "jeopardy!".<br /><br />the saddest thing about white men can't jump is that it had tremendous potential. for several years, i lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film; racial tensions were high, and basketball meant everything to everyone. a film about the members of this "basketball culture" could have been very interesting, but the mediocre acting and poor script in white men can't job left something to be desired.<br /><br />the movie's sequence of events is cyclical. first, billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball. he then returns to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. most stories build up to a climax of some kind, but the "climax" i saw was just another sequence in this repetition (this case being "billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball").<br /><br />in order for a plot to develop, some dilemma must be resolved; and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well. apparently the writers of white men can't jump forgot this rule, as the plot can be summarized as "billy needs to pay the bills." i appreciated the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies, but -- i'm sorry -- this was just plain awful. i could have cared less if billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment.<br /><br />despite all this, white men can't jump is a successful film. apparently some adamant sports fans will dismiss terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in them. others, i'm sure, were lured by the big names playing the leading roles. this leaves me to wonder, if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors, and the basketball theme was replaced with lacrosse, would anyone have bothered watching this movie? i really don't think so.<br /><br />i'll give this movie two stars out of ten; the extra star is for the "jeopardy!" scene, which kept me awake for a few minutes. thanks, trebek.
