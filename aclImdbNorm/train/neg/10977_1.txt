i live in ottawa where this film was made and i really wish it hadn't been. this is one god-awful flick. i really try and support independent films but there is this stigma attached to anything indie and that stigma is: indie films blow. well, this film does nothing to shed this curse. the actor, writer, director brett kelly does little to contribute to the genre, rather he re-hashes tired clich'es from movies past. i am really tired of menacing evil looking characters that lurk in the shadows and prey on the unsuspecting, it's way too overdone. <br /><br />i can remember one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car headlights. now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension, but sadly it was to showcase the shoestring budget of this movie. as well for a movie that dares to call itself horror, a viewer will find themselves hard pressed to find any actual gore, other than a few scenes with corn syrup and red food colouring. <br /><br />the biggest thing that drags this film down is the pacing and the lack of character development, the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this bonesetter fellow before a certain time in order to get their kids back. not that this concept bugs me, but, i didn't really find it believable that when the two main characters, both who have lost children can find time to make out with each other. this is done in such a short time span that it's inconceivable, my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before making out with her. <br /><br />the last point that i have is.... and i won't hold this against kelly, but the movie is shot entirely on boring, emotionless video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just oozed style on film. although if this movie were given a million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat. my only hope is that something happens to prevent brett kelly from making a sequel, which has been reported on his website, a sequel that was half written in one sitting. <br /><br />lord help us all.
