now, i like sci-fi cartoons. however, when "robotboy" appeared in canada in late 2006, i watched the premiere and was inevitably appalled. the characters are generic and stereotypical (do they really need to make an african-american man wear tiger-stripe print clothing and speak in a jamacian accent? why are all the asian characters vibrant yellow and squinting? does the mother have to have big thighs and chest and constantly complain?) to the point where things become unrealistic, predictable, gross and sometimes disturbing. there are heavy similarities to, even stabs, at astro boy. allow me to explain (dub names for the young): robotboy/astro, kamikaze/tenma, constantine/shadow, gus/abercrombie, tommy/alejo, lola/zoran+kennedy, moshimo/o'shay, and it so on. brief resemblances to "my life as a teenage robot", "star wars", "teenage mutant ninja turtles", "kamen riders", "sailor moon" and co. are afoot. not to mention the abundant racial/gender stereotyping. don't even get me started on the innuendos. i'll just say they're hidden and quite dirty. but seriously. don't even try watching this. especially if you like astro boy.
