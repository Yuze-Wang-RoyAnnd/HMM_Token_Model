i have just watched the movie for the first time. i wanted to watch it as i like drew barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies. <br /><br />the movie is about a girl (played by young and beautiful drew barrymore), who moves from nyc to la in order to get over her recently troubled loss. short after moving to a guy who falls in love with her, it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin=doppelganger, who haunts her.<br /><br />the movie is quite poor and lousy. both the dialogs and the acting make the film not really worth seeing it. summing up it is just something for the fans of drew barrymore.
