when i am watching a film, i am aware that it is `just a movie,' but nonetheless i do like to allow myself to become engrossed as much as possible under the circumstances. i think this is what makes us cry, scream, laugh, or otherwise react emotionally as audience members, even though, deep down, we know it is `just a movie.' what i don't want is for the movie to remind me it is just a movie so that i am unable to slip into the aforementioned engrossment regardless of the quality of the film. this film's director chose to frequently use multi-angle camera shots simultaneously on the screen. maybe it is just me, but i find this to be terribly distracting and downright irritating. they might as well run a continuous banner across the bottom of the screen reading, `attention: this is just a movie. do not allow yourself to become too interested or engrossed'. if i want `picture-in-picture', i'll activate it from my tv remote, but never during a movie i want to enjoy.
