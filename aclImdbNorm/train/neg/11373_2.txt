it is not obvious from viewing this film (so i recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it) but this presentation on the realities of islam, and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non-muslims is lacking objectiveness, and also completely fails to factor in the human condition. it is one thing to document that the koran says many things about how a devout muslim is required to interact with non-muslims, but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of islam, will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system. there is reason to call much about the presenters into question, such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism; don't swallow it all, hook, line, and sinker, without some thinking of your own.<br /><br />one specific, for instance, is researching the person walid shoebat; who claims to be a former muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in bethlehem. there are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions. i am not nor have i ever been a muslim. i have never read the koran. i am not a christian, nor a member of _any_ faith. but i am an intelligent and discerning human. while the film is quite disturbing, in its presentation of how some muslims view their obligation to islam; i remind you that there is more to islam than the views of the fundamentalists. just as their are fundamentalists and evangelical christians, so, too, there are variations in the intensity of belief and obligation among jews and muslims.<br /><br />when you watch this film, you need to have the salt shaker on hand. one grain will not be enough, you'll need more. please use your own mind and think for yourself, research what is presented, and evaluate the state of the world and how islam fits within it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video. there is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together, indicating a definite bias. be your own brain.
