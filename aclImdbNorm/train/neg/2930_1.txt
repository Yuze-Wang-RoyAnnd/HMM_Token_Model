i like british humor, i believe it's one of the best in the world. i like almost every british sitcom (okay... maybe not monthy python, some of the jokes were great, but some of them i didn't understand.), but this league of gentlemen is just something good to make you sick. this show was good in some way; it helped me lost some weight because watching this piece of garbage make me feel i'm not hungry anymore. this is really just disgusting, sick and not even funny tv show and i wonder who is actually laughing at this stuff. i watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off. it was so disgusting, watching men dressed in the woman with yellow teeth and urinating on the car... i mean... what's so funny about that??? it makes me wanna puke. no humor, just disturbing images and cheap, toilet laughs... i don't know... if you like this stuff... you go ahead... watch it... but to be honest, people watching and enjoying this must have some emotional problems. garbage.
