warning spoilers following. superb recreation of the base in antarctica where the real events of the film took place. other than that, libelous!, scandalous! filmed in canada; presumably by a largely canadian crew and cast. i caught the last half of this film recently on global television here in canada. nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled i was at what a blatant piece of american historical revisionist propaganda it is; and starring susan sarandon of all people! i can only assume that canadian born director roger spottiswoode was coerced to make the usaf the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in calgary; kenn borek air.
