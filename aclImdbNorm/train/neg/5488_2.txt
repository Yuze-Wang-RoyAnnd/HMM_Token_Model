why on earth is colin firth in this pointless film? has he really been that strapped for cash?<br /><br />the film isn't clear on what it wants to be about, grief?, exotic places?, ghosts?, a vehicle for mr darcy? it's a muddled, muddy mess.<br /><br />there seems to be some sort of idea that italy must be good, in itself, and that italian has something to offer as a language - but in the end the girls just want to go back to yankland.<br /><br />there are pointless episodes on the beach, in churches, on busy roads - but what it is all about, or why anybody should care simply isn't clear.<br /><br />there was also a yank woman in the film. it wasn't clear what here job was, but she seemed only to be there to make vapid, inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl. was it supposed to be about paedophillia??<br /><br />a pretty dreadful mess, all in all. i gave it 2 rather than 1 because it doesn't have the charm of an utterly ghastly film.
