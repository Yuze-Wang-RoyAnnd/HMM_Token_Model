this movie is really wack. there is really nothing nice i can say about it, besides the moral truth expressed in the film's climax concerning people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime. besides all that, the film had nothing: no good shots, no good acting, and no good script. i give this film a f and a 2 out 10.
