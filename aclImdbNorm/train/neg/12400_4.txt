matt cordell is back from the dead for a third go-round, although i'm not sure anyone cared at this point except for rabid manica cop fans. cordell, who died in the last flick, is resurrected through voodoo, and is now hot on the trail of several miscreants involved in the shooting of a fellow officer cordell is very fond of. i missed part of this early '90s low-budget quickie, but it was pleasing to see cordell wracking up the body count in various, gruesome ways. problem is, the overall film is pretty static, and cordell simply ain't jason or freddy. the interest wanes pretty fast, even with that grand b-movie master robert forster as a doctor who ends up with his brains scrambled. stick with the first film in the series, which is funny and scary and exciting, all at the same time.
