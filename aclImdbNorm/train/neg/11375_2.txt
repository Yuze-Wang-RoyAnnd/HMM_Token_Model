you talking' to me? (1987) is a pretty bad movie starring some dude who i have never seen before or since starring as a guy from the neighborhood who tries to become an actor. he has a heavy jones for taxi driver as tries to use that shtick to make it big. when he learns the hard facts of life, he does what everyone else does, changes his image! he goes from good fella to a surf's up dude over night. his friend can't believe the change (but he scores with faith ford and get's a cool paying gig). can this young punk keep his street cred whilst making it big?<br /><br />this is a real lame movie that tries too hard to incorporate too many things at once. an interesting idea that falls apart due to poor execution. who knows, maybe somebody will pick up the ball and run because the film makers fumbled the ball this time.<br /><br />don't waste your time with this movie. unless you want to see a hot faith ford and a young bubba from forest gump.<br /><br />xx
