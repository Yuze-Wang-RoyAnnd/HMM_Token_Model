...and even then, even they can live without seeing it. to be honest, this film (if one deigns to call it that) is of real interest only to bondage freaks. bettie page fans will learn absolutely nothing new (and i do mean *nothing*), nor will they enjoy the warm fuzzies of experiencing anything familiar, loved, or cherished.<br /><br />nevermind the abysmal screenplay, the wooden, less-than-community-theater acting, the utter absence of direction, the crappy lighting, or any of the rest of the bargain basement production values. this is definitely "hey, kids, let's make a movie!" movie-making of the lowest order. i suppose one could be thankful that at least they knew how to run the camera. no, i'm sorry to say that none of that is germane to why this thing is so outright *wrong*.<br /><br />it's wrong because the young lady playing bettie page, a somewhat zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the queen of curves is dark hair and the trademark bangs, utterly fails to bring anything to the role beyond a willingness to be bound and gagged. this is apparently a good thing for her film career before and since this wretched excess, but not for the wretched excess itself, which consists primarily of a number of lovingly re-enacted b&d set-pieces sandwiched between horrendously awful faux-biographical scenes delineating ms. page's fall from grace (so to speak). there's actually probably more information, per se, about page's life in the opening and closing credits than the rest of the movie.<br /><br />do not be fooled. this is not a worthy companion film to "the notorious bettie page." this is not a worthy film at all. this is a fetish piece that trades on the allure of one of the greatest pin-ups of all time, and does it without class, without style, and without any real sense of understanding the character of bettie page whatsoever. no true bettie page fan will find it to be anything but a disappointment, i guarantee that.<br /><br />avoid at all costs. if free, remember that time is money, too. yours may not be worth much, but i'm betting it's worth enough that you'll be sorry you wasted time with this one. that's it, i'm done, you've been warned.
