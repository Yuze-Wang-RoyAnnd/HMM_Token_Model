this film was a waste of time, even rented on dvd. if super-speedy camera shots get any faster than this, we might as well pay twenty bucks to get in the laundromat, get popcorn, and watch the dryer spin. jet li is so much better than this. one can only hope that he won't be making deals anytime soon to make another cliche-ridden film like the one.<br /><br />if there's one film you should avoid, this is "the one".
