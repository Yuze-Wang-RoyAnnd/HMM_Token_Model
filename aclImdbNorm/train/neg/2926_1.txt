it seems there's a bit of a curse out there when it comes to gay cinema. namely, happy endings aren't very common. beautiful thing excluded, gay films tend to end in broken relationships or untimely death. and some, like come undone, just end... period.<br /><br />the creators of this horrid piece of nonsense have a thing or two to learn about plot, direction, and timelines. within the first ten minutes of this film, i found myself a bit confused, and even more so after the first glimpse of jeremie elkaim's character having a little psych session. it seems this film was randomly pieced together without the slightest attempt at continuity or consistency. there's no real way to tell when you're viewing the present or some sort of ethereal flashback. i could only take so much before it became truly unappealing.<br /><br />stephen holden of the new york times called this film "...shimmeringly beautiful and utterly real." well, it seems that stephen invested in beer goggles prior to viewing, as this is truly far from beautiful. due to all the praise this film received, i expected something worth watching. sadly, the film lived down to its title. and by the end of the movie (which provided no resolution whatsoever, i might add) it's plain to see that the writers, the director and the film have all come undone.
