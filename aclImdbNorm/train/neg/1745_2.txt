the first half hour of the movie had a steady pace and introduced the characters. however all of a sudden everything was happening too quick, a lame reason for akshey kumar to date 3 girls, very loud over acting by both akshey and john abraham. neha dupia was the highlight of the movie, paresh rawal did well but not as good as his performance in hera pheri. overall this movie was the biggest disappointment the film does no justice to its trailer. save your money and don't watch this movie, watch hera pheri and hungama again!<br /><br />summarising it: a cheap stage show performance and appearance to the film no story or substance, the plot was extraordinarily non-sense good music by preetam the man who bought us dhoom! keep it up! movie shot all in one room, new comers (female cast) were okay as it was their first film but established actors like akshey and john totally disappointed an established director like priyadarshan gives his worst movie ever!
