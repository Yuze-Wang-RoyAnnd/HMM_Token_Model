i totally agree with the review by a reviewer of variety that the film is never quite as funny, lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise would seem to warrant. narratively it is messy and the lighting is really problematic. if the film is supposed to be character-driven the poor lighting doesn't enhance the acting and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors. many non-south africans will have difficulty in following the spoken english in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process. i watched the film at the cape town world cinema festival last year. comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past. unfortunately bunny chow won't be remembered as one of the bright lights of the south african new wave, but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our 110 year old film history. not surprisingly the film disappeared from cinemas in cape town only two weeks after its release and from most of the cinemas in durban and gauteng. it has clearly limited appeal among south african audiences.
