okay, when i came on the board for this movie, i was really expecting people to be making fun of it. i was surprised to see that people over the age of 7 liked it. i enjoyed the movie... but only b/c me and my little sister (who is, in fact only 10) made fun of the whole thing.<br /><br />i am sorry jordan, but that acting was awful. you know a movie is headed for the toilet when the lead cannot act. and it didn't even have a good script or plot to redeem it. i also thought that the character of pamela was very very lame... border-lining pathetic.<br /><br />even with that being said, i thought there were a few good actors, such as gorgeous spencer, hollywood, and ronnie. still, not enough to redeem the movie.<br /><br />two things about this movie that i just can't get over:<br /><br />1.) that that spencer guy would fall for her. okay, eww. i looked up the dates and while in reality, he is only about four years older than her, the difference in "go figure" seemed much larger. jordan is a very pretty girl, but in gf, she seemed like 10 or 12... she seemed like a little kid! jake abel (spencer) seemed like a college student.<br /><br />2.) that there is any way that kristi yamaguchi would come just to skate for one girl. i mean, i know that katelin is good and everything, but it still just seemed kinda unlikely that kristi would go to a boarding school that didn't even have scholarships for skating, or that a school would have employed a skating coach with such connections.<br /><br />that all being said... it wasn't the worst movie ever known, but it wasn't very good even by dcom standards, which i consider quite low.
