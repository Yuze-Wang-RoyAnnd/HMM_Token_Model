i gave this a four purely out of its historical context. it was considered lost for many years until it popped up out of the blue on showtime in the early nineties.<br /><br />moe is the straight man and larry and curly act as a duo. spade cooley has a couple of numbers. i guess it had something to do with working on a ranch. i'm not quite sure because the plot was so minimal nothing really sticks in my memory. i vaguely remember it being a western musical comedy. even the stooge's seem to be going through the motions. overall there's nothing much really to recommend here.<br /><br />if you're not a stooge fan then don't bother. if you are a stooge fan, then stick with the shorts.
