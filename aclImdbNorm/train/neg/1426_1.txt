one question: why? first off, the premise is not funny or engaging at all. they use taped interviews, and take the audio to animate ite with animals speaking the parts. first off, the interviews aren't funny or entertaining to begin with, and even if they were, i am sure they would be a lot more entertaining being viewed as they are originally, without being turned into cartoons. how does that add any hilarity to it? i turned on cbs's monday night sitcom line-up, (which has become a regular way for me to relax after stressful monday workdays) and found this on. of course, the sitcom line-up would be reruns anyway, being summer, but seeing those episodes over again would have been more entertaining. i tried to give "cc" a chance. i really did. when it started, i figured, well, maybe it will be funny. nope. and then it kept going. it was a long half hour.<br /><br />and i can almost see if there was a purpose, if the interviews were shown in their entirety, and had points to them. but no, it was just one-line clips, cut and pasted together really quick. it was like a horrible dreadful version of cartoon network's "robot chicken." i wasn't a fan of cbs' now-cancelled sitcom "the class." while that was on, it was one half-hour of the line-up i would struggle through. but if it came down to me deciding a whole season of that or three more episodes of "creatures"....let's just say i'd take the "class." considering it's been a couple hours since it aired, and i come on here to see i am the first to comment...i guess that's a good sign that nobody watched it, and that it won't last much longer. cartoon roadkill.
