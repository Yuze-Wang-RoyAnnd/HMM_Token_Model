why such a generic title? santa claus??? so bland and unpredictable. movies before that tried to cash in on the holiday spirit, most notably 'santa claus conquers the martians', at least was entertaining to watch because of the campiness to it, and all the stock footage being used... for some reason, that seemed happy to me. but this movie just screws christmas in the butt, and screws the joy of all the kids. santa lives in space? his enemy is a devil named pitch? santa gets help from merlin the magician? how random is this!? well, since it was made in mexico then some of you might understand the way of how the film was made. i had to admit some of the effects were just wacky for the time. it was a all-out cluster of madness! though, despite all the troubles with the movie, it still feels like a christmas movie. good conquers evil, and christmas still plays a part of our hearts of every good girl or boy in the world, or possibly universe, thanks to santa claus conquers the martians.. apparently. so, i think you should give it a try, even if it is one of the worst holiday movies of all time... though it should put a smile on your face any day.
