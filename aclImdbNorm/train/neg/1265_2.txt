i first didn't want to watch this film, for the trailer gave the impression of a common and too expected film...but as i recently had the pleasure to discover the surprising "mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinit'e"" which was beautifully directed and written by laurent tirard (screenwriter of "pr^ete-moi ta main"), i changed my mind and decided to try it, thinking that "pr^ete-moi ta main", would be as good as "mensonges...". and it is absolutely not. the script is not bad, but it is not as well directed as "mensonges...", the actors not as generous (especially charlotte, as boring as she usually is) as edouard baer or clovis cornillac, and too be honest, i still don't understand how such crap can have such a success, even with such a casting... anyway the story could have been a pretext to create so many interesting plots, but it is not as good as tirard's "mensonges..." though it's also written by him. easy, unsurprising, and lazy work. totally overestimated!
