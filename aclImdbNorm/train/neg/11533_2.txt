if derivative and predictable rape-revenge thrillers are your thing, then you're in for a rare treat... they don't really appeal to me, so i couldn't find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale. it seems like something straight out of the 1980s, a different age when this would have gone straight to video. gillian anderson and danny dyer do ok work with a weak script and a tedious scenario. but what is gillian anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as lady deadlock in the bbc tv adaptation of bleak house last year? the director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near-rape and by his work on documentaries, but even that's not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up dyer. i don't think i was the only person in the cinema laughing. what i can't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - filmfour and verve pictures. both have been involved in some great independent british films in recent years. verve distributed bullet boy, code 46 and red road - straightheads doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. filmfour and verve take note: is this really the best you can do? what are independent british filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement? it's a big blot on both of your reputations. listen carefully: can you hear the thousands of fans of independent british films crying in despair?
