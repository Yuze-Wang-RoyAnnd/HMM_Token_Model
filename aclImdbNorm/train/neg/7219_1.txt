i still find it difficult to comprehend that a movie as bad as this could be made in hollywood. the acting and story is simply pathetic & the direction is awful. i don't see any logic behind this trash except may be that the director had nothing good to do. i took me ten minutes to realize that i had wasted my precious thirty rupees. it filled me with dismay that i was going to waste some more time of my life on this crap. i bet the movie was made in less than a day. i don't know what category it falls into. please, avoid this movie at all costs, just do anything, even bang your head against walls but don't go for this movie.
