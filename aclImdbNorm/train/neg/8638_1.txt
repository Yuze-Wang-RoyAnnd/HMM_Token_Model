action, violence, sex and coarse language are the things that the characters do during the whole movie. and everything they do is done without reason. mark l. lester is (un)known for his violent (without reason)movies (commando, the base). the story is weird but stupid. the actors play their stupid characters very well...i'm not telling they are stupid but i mean they are very bad actors. it's another low-budget unknown b series action movie. if you saw something like operation delta force, drive, the patriot, sanctuary or something like these bad movies from the same kind than misbegotten...don't rent it...and, by the way, don't rent any of the movies i mentioned....i give it 1and a half out of5.
