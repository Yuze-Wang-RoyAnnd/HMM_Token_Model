a craven, cowardly film. director boorman shows cahill burglarizing rich houses, but the male occupant is shown being unfaithful with the nanny, thats all right then. the forensic scientist investigating cahill is blown up in his car, but he is rat faced sourpuss, and doesn't look like a nice man, so thats all right too. the beits, owner of russborrough house, made their money by exploiting 'darkies' digging up diamonds, so it's okay to rob priceless art from them and hide it in a bunker in the wicklow mountains. the garda kill his ferrets and are implicated in his murder. the moral equivalencing is sickening, boorman looks for a hit film, but doesn't have the guts to stand against the criminality of the generals gang, who terrorized the neighbourhood, and unleashed another wave of scumbags upon dublin. he even liaised with the generals son while making it. disgusting. shame on him for his cowardice.
