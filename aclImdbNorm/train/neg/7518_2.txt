horror movies can be a lot of fun with low budgets, bad acting, and a bit of panache. i think the film is just missing panache, because, one thuddingly dull scene after another, people make laughably harmless claw-handed grabs at the air. if it weren't so boring, it might be funny.<br /><br />a horror film can go a long way with a tired concept like "college kids in a haunted house," in much the same way the evil dead movies had a lot of fun with a similar standard plotline. hallow's end, unfortunately, doesn't go a long way. actually, it doesn't go anywhere. it spends the better part of an hour setting up faceless and anonymous characters with what seem like endless interpersonal drama. i have nothing against character development, not even in a horror movie, but these are strictly one-dimensional characters (the alpha-male, the milquetoast, the... um... throwaway characters that exist mostly for sex scenes.) spending forty-plus bloodless, droning minutes with them was more horrific than when the bloodshed started.<br /><br />well, implied bloodshed anyway. when the college kids turn into whatever they dressed as for their haunted house (one's a vampire, one's wearing o.r. scrubs and some white pancake) they look pretty much the way they did in their amateur haunted house costumes; the dead hate the living, using a similar theme, is a masterwork in comparison. there isn't really any gore to speak of, nor are there any real scares.<br /><br />i've thought about this one from almost every approach. if it was supposed to be a tight, suspenseful horror movie (which would explain why things moved so slowly), the pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters would invalidate it. if it was supposed to be a genuine blood & guts horror movie (which would explain the schlock)... where's the blood and guts? and the anticlimax is one of the unexciting endings to a movie i've ever seen. it's the kind of movie that, though it doesn't have a narrator through the film, is bookended by voice-overs because all of the meaningless dialogue just wasn't enough.<br /><br />this was a hard one... coming out of it, i wonder if i've just sat through a christian horror film. maybe the "i know hell exists" of the opening wasn't meant that way, but there are some hints (or misdirection-- i'm not sure which). for all the profanity in the film, a line like "gosh-darnit" comes off a little absurd, and so does most of the crucifix worshipping, god-fearing, and satan-dreading, especially after some lecherous t&a sex scenes (one heterosexual, one lesbian).<br /><br />if it a christian company (highland myst's logo even has a bit of a crucifix resemblance), then this film weighs in heavily for the atheist camp. an omnipotent being can't be this bad a filmmaker.<br /><br />
