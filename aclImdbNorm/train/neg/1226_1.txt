my, how the mighty have fallen. kim basinger is a great actress but she was definitely slumming when she took this role. this movie is bad for one reason in particular: lapses in logic. its looks like one of those movies that would have been passable with all its plot holes if it had came out in the 80s and 90s but in 2008 it just looks real stupid. this is the worst thriller i've ever seen and i've seen the bone collector and twisted.<br /><br />the story details della(kim basinger)is just getting from buying gifts in a mall an is harassed by a gang of thugs that end up killing a cop that came to her aid. from then on she is chased by these idiotic goons through an abandoned street and she gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of tools.<br /><br />so many things are wrong with this movie. as i said this movie leaps over logic at every turn and with the exception of kim basinger, the acting is made-for-tv bad. hell, this pseudo thriller is made-for-tv bad. the way she kills each of these politically correct thugs(1 caucasian, 1 hispanic, 1 asian and 1 african american all coming together to stalk a caucasian woman. don't you just love america?)is laughable to a fault. the way she killed the hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically. the sex scene with the main hoodlum was so out in left field that it make you shake your head in shame. i only recommend this to lovers of bad films and no one else. anybody else especially kim basinger fans would do well not to own this flick. you don't want see an actress you respect in a film this bad now do you? of course not. you were warned.
