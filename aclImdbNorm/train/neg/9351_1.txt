this is only the second time i stopped a video/dvd part way through.<br /><br />i was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt at first, even though it managed to be both shallow, clich'ed and stupid.. and joyless, plodding and pretentious.<br /><br />it was like an after school special directed by that weird grade nine kid who thinks nobody understands him... creepy and sad, with voice-over narration that only the most deluded adolescent would consider poetry... and some singing, and... no, really, the poor child's suffering...<br /><br />enough, already, especially when it morphed into a brazen, clumsy, and insulting clockwork orange ripoff. and did i mention the singing?<br /><br />this isn't the worst film i've ever seen, but certainly the one i've felt least compelled to sit through. i don't recommend it to anyone.
