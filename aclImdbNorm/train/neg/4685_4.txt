up until the last few minutes of the movie, i would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars. however, the ending is so terrible and "hollywoodized" that it completely undermines the first 80% of the movie.<br /><br />the plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles. the captain, gene hackman, is all for launching, while his first officer, denzel washington, is in favor of confirming the launch orders first. the problem is, to launch both the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys. hackman is determined to launch and washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub. eventually, the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not launched. cool. however, here comes the part that just doesn't ring true. after they are back on land and go before a review board, washington and hackman (who'd just spent half the movie trying to kill each other) shake hands and are all buddy buddy! huh?! too trite an ending to make the movie worth while for me.
