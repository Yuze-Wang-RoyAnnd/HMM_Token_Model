this movie is some of the worst crap i have ever seen. i literally got a sharp pain in my head while watching this movie. the cgi was awful, and the story was just a waste of ink. dean cain's character was mr-super-intuitive-i-can-figure-out-anything, except he can't seem to work his own helicopter correctly. the biggest problem was the split screen camera work. i felt like i was watching the brady bunch or something, only it wasn't different people in the boxes, just close ups and different views of the same thing. i can only figure that the actors really needed the money, because this movie wasn't worth the film it was shot on.
