the cover of box of this movie has kyle minogue's name on it, but she has the same destiny as drew barrymore did in "scream." that's the first thing that makes this movie lame; they are trying to market a movie with someone that's in it for 5 minutes.<br /><br />of course, we have to have this movie feature young hip college kids that are oblivious that there's a killer going around. to top it all off, molly ringwald of 80's teen movie fame is the star of this beautifully written film. it's a good career move for molly to get some money doing a crappy movie in australia so she won't get ridiculed in the states.<br /><br />either way, this dumb movie is about some dumb horror movie that was never finished because this dumb creature kills everyone that's in it. throughout the movie, we're supposed to guess who's the killer. long story short, remember our little friend molly, she saves the day...or does she?<br /><br />this move is just plain bad, rent it if you feel like torturing yourself or just break it on the floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf. don't spread the horror.
