sloppily directed, witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the "classic" 50s "alien invasion" films, but really is no better than them, except of course in the purely technical department (good makeup effects). and any spoof that is worse than its target is doomed to fail ("casino royale", "our man flint" are worse than almost any james bond movie). after two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens, you'll be begging for some peace and quiet.
