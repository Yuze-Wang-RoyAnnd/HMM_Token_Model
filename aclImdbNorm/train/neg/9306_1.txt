this film is the worst excuse for a motion picture i have ever seen. to begin, i'd like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means misleading, if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown, you are soooo wrong. in fact the killers face doesn't even slightly resemble the front cover, it's just an image they must have found on google and thought it looked cool. speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool, there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods, then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it's young in a glisten of sunlight... i mean seriously wtf??? how is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through? i bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining, if it wasn't horror then at least it would be funny right? wrong! the next day i gave it to my work colleague ridding myself from the plague named s.i.c.k<br /><br />bottom line is: don't see this film!!!
