i've no idea what dimwit from san francisco came up with this stupid plot, but apparently they need to get off whatever drugs they are taking and put their analyst on danger money -- now.<br /><br />yeah, this is a plausible story, if you regard the alien abduction sequence in "life of brian" as plausible.<br /><br />this film is little more than a leftist pipedream. had the us and ussr give up nuclear weapons, the result would've been to eliminate the only real obstacle that kept the two from engaging in a war. bad as korea, vietnam and other wars of the era were, they were "proxy wars" fought to keep the superpowers from a direct engagement.<br /><br />this film makes me think about how realistic it was when some group of high school kids would go on a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation. as if someone would say "mr. president, some kids at drastic high are not eating!" and ronald reagan would reply "my god! i'd better revise my defense policy!" right.<br /><br />like this film? wouldn't it be better if the soviet union would've collapsed because they could not support their massive arms build... wait, that happened!
