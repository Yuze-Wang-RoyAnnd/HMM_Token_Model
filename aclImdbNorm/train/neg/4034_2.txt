oh dear. good cast, but to write and direct is an art and to write wit and direct wit is a bit of a task. even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right. im not putting it all down there were parts where i laughed loud but that was at very few times. the main focus to me was on the fast free flowing dialogue, that made some people in the film annoying. it may sound great while reading the script in your head but getting that out and to the camera is a different task. and the hand held camera work does give energy to few parts of the film. overall direction was good but the script was not all that to me, but i'm sure you was reading the script in your head it would sound good. sorry.
