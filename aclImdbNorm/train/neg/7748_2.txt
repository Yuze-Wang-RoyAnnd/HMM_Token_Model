this movie was pretty bad. sci-fi is usually my favorite channel so i watch all the original movies that play on it. i really don't know if this movie can be called original. starting a zoo/theme park on a remote island sounds pretty familiar. what was it, oh yeah, jurassic park. but this has sabertooth tigers instead.<br /><br />the movie starts out with a few stereotypical college kids on an island doing some kind of treasure hunt. one of them ends up dieing a rather gruesome death with some of the worst special effects i've seen. the blood looked a lot like ketchup. also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many saber tooth tigers as possible for people to enjoy. 3 of them have already escaped and are going around eating the tourists, or the people invited to the island to see the tigers first hand. again, sound like jurassic park. probably the coolest thing was the 1000lb saber tooth who crawled around on his front legs killing the mad scientist with a tooth statue of sorts that somehow shrinks and goes through the guys neck. funniest death i've seen on tv.<br /><br />the acting is extremely cheesy, the special effects are horrible. the cg tigers could almost pass for clay models, and even some of the sounds were off. for instance, when one of the college students is trying to escape, he uses an ax to break down a door, the ax goes into the door and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound. this movie was pretty bad. the cheesy deaths were quite funny though.
