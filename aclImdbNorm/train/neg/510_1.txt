this is surely one of the worst films ever made and released by a major hollywood studio. the plot is simply stupid. the dialog is written in clich'es; you can complete a great many sentences in the script because of this. the acting is ridiculously bad, especially that of rod cameron. the "choreography" is silly and wholly unerotic. one can only pity the reviewer who saw 23-year-old yvonne's dance as sexual; it's merely very bad choreography. the ballet scene in the film's beginning is especially ludicrous. if you are into bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of hollywood's turkeys, this is for you. i bought the colorized version on vhs, making the movie even worse. yvonne's heavy makeup, when colored, has her looking like a clown all the time. and she's the best part of this film. what a way to launch a career.
