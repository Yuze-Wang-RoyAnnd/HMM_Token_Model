hah! so this is the movie that the "next action stars" were getting into. well i'm glad that i didn't participate and didn't win...<br /><br />isn't it funny how one can just look at the first 10 seconds(!) and make up ones mind about a movie? i mean, come on! just look at those titles!? i watched this movie(or part of this "teleplay" since it was produced for tv and we couldn't bear to watch the whole thing) one evening while doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical hodge-podge of average guys that once in a while watch series like las vegas just for the girls in the show. so the bar wasn't really high, the most watched movie in my group was girl next door (and it wasn't because of the great script ;d . but this movie's total lack of originality, acting, scripting, and just about everything else that makes a movie good made it pretty easy to switch channel to las vegas (or was it csi? don't remember...) without any complaints by the rest of the group. and that is rare(!) for heavens sake! don't by this movie! if it's on tv, then yes, watch it. and contemplate on it. my conclusion? well, since joel silver has indeed produced some of the best action-films out there (die hard, matrix 1, to name some) i can only say that producers don't give the film it's quality, they provide money for the directors. and to sell this movie just because it's a joel silver movie is just a desperate attempt to conceal the obvious flaws of the crew who really made it.
