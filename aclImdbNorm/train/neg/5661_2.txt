the premise, while not quite ludicrous, was definitely ridiculous. what should have occurred, by the second encounter with tritter was that tritter should simply be wasted. house hires some guy and de-physicalizes tritter. in real life, tritter would have been hauled up for harassment, the rectal thermometer episode would have been exposed in court, providing motive and opportunity and the hospitals lawyers would have made mincemeat out of tritter and the particular department he worked for. he would be in prison as would anyone complicit in the harassment of house, chase, foreman, cameron, wilson and cuddy. the lawsuit would have won house a tasty settlement, enough to keep him supplied with vicadin well into his old age. while tritter would wind up somewhere driving a cab, trying to rehabilitate himself by doing good for people for two years before people tumbled to the fact that they'd seen it all before.
