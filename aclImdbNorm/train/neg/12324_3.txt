this was a rip-off of the same garbage we had to watch bob saget host during the half-hour before this. dave coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as america's funniest home videos except with a hosts who have a combined iq of three. tawny kitaen must've really needed the money and coulier had to go to the recycle bin for his jokes. it was torture enough having to see him imitate popeye and other washed up cartoon starts on full house. that one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a grade a wedgie. coulier must've needed to money to please alannis morisette while they were dating.
