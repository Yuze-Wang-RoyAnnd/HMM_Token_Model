good grief i can't even begin to describe how poor this film is. don't get me wrong, i wasn't expecting much to begin with. let's face it, a pg-13 slasher flick is pre-destined to be missing the ummm... slashing, so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore. but it was the level of incompetence and clich'e on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away. <br /><br />we have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. and here's a turnup for the books... she never changes - hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing - character development. if you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again. <br /><br />on top of this, we're handed possibly the least intriguing (and definitely the least scary) killer ever to grace the genre. i'm not joking when i say that dora the explorer has scarier villains than this movie.<br /><br />finally, because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept (and apparently thirteen-year-old) director, what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time? <br /><br />closets, that's what. <br /><br />lots and lots of closets: big closets, small closets, mirrored closets, closets to narnia, so many damned closets you'll not want to dress yourself for another year. in fact this movie should have just been called "closet", and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the dvd case. on the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by roger and ebert - something to the extent of: "what the f*@! did we just waste our time watching!"
