this is a depressingly shallow, naive and mostly unfunny look at a wildly improbable relationship between brooks' psychotic film editor and harold, his vapid girlfriend. the two have zero chemistry together - primarily because harold is incapable of doing anything besides looking pretty at this stage of her career; but also because brooks' character is neither interesting nor likeable. there are 15 static, excruciating minutes at the beginning where brooks, having just broke up with harold, stumbles about his apartment in a depressed, drugged out state - unbearable.<br /><br />sappily and unimaginatively bookended by joe cocker's "you are so beautiful", there simply is not enough material here for a feature film. there is hardly anything going on on the periphery of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world. i'm sure brooks' intention was to shine a white hot spotlight on the affair and, in a way, deconstruct it; but if you're going to do that the writing and acting needs to be far far better than what it is here.
