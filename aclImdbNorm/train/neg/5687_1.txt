while not as bad as his game-to-movie adaptations, this hunk of crud doesn't fare much better.<br /><br />boll seems to have a pathological inability to accept that he doesn't make good movies. one of these days he'll run out of money and stop inflicting the world with his bombs.<br /><br />the acting was sub-par, the dialog sounded like they were reading teleprompters and boll's special little 'touches' were seen throughout the whole thing.<br /><br />like all uwe boll movies, this one just shouldn't exist.<br /><br />plain and simple.<br /><br />just like uwe boll himself shouldn't exist. >_>
