this was no trainspotting or guy ritchie film. it was a big wannabee. it wanted to be an edgy, nervous-laughter, urban-life affirming film, but it's more of a camera jerky, mess. it's a lot easier to imitate something else, than to create a real story with real characters. from the beginning, i couldn't care less about the characters or what they were involved in. they were always always hitting, pissing, or crying on each other. only, there wasn't any substance to what they were doing. the dialog between characters is meant to be hip, revealing, instead it comes out trite, and one scene after another is predictable. i know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie, so i could be wrong.
