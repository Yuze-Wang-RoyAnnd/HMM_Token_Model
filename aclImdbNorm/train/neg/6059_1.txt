i have to say as being a fan of the man who created halloween/the fog/christine/the thing - probably his best films.<br /><br />then you got this pos. i can't logically think he put any effort at all into this like he did with cigarette burns. at least his son made a decent soundtrack.<br /><br />you have to look at this from the standpoint that it didn't seem like a movie. it looked as if someone else directed it for one thing. i won't believe carpenter put any effort into this at all.<br /><br />i was just listening to his old school h2/h3/the fog soundtrack and it was awesome, especially for the times.<br /><br />he was using a style that no one had and it worked so well for his films.
