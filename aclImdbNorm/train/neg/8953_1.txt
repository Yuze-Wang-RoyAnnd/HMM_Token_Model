i saw this movie literally directly after finishing the book, and maybe that was a neutral idea or a very stupid one. i think it was the latter. first of all, it was inaccurate in many small, yet important details. one of the first things i noticed was, during winston's day to day life in his work, his conversations, eating in the cafeteria, etc. he feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive glances at people without immense fear. one of the most important parts of the book, was that even in small activities it was virtually impossible to safely show even a hint of his true emotions on his face at any moment. this is also shown in the scenes on the streets of the proletarions. in the book winston knew that this was a huge risk to wander around there and was skeptical and frightened at every trip. while in the movie, he does it so often and without fear, that you lose the important feeling of heavy surveillance and risk right off the bat.<br /><br />other minor inaccuracies included winston hiding his diary in the wall, yes a very small change, but it begs the question, what's the point? there was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book, and that is morphing characters.<br /><br /> the large inaccuracies were far more disturbing, however. first of all, one of the important pieces of the book is that big brother is a government based on an intelligent, yet crude philosophy. in the movie, they skip that and go straight to making you think that the government is run by hitler with technology. which is true, in a sense, when directed with its facism, but if that's all you get out of big brother, you really missed the point of the book. the terrifying thing about big brother is that, in a way, it has some points behind its philosophy. when o'brien is picking at winstons mind in the ministry of love, he is listening to everything winston says against big brother. the fact that he listens, and advances forward in his philosophy, is in effect what is most creepy and intriguing. in the end, (careful spoiler ahead) when winston says he loves big brother, the terrifying thing is that you are not sure whether it was souly the beating and torture that caused this, or the actual power behind the philosophy. i am in no way saying that the big brother's philosophy has points that appeal to me, but its intelligence and depth is what makes this book incredibly disturbing.<br /><br /> also, how could anyone feel any connection between julia and winston in the film? it was awful, no connection whatsoever.<br /><br /> and where was o'brien before he gave winston his address? one of the things that carried the book was winstons thoughts about o'brien before he made contact with him. in the movie, they just jump the gun.<br /><br /> but that about sums up why this movie was a terrible adaption: because its impossible not to jump the gun and morph characters in less than two hours. how could anyone think this movie was watchable if it was under two hours? at the very least, the movie demands 3 hours to be able to capture some of the important moods and connections. anything less is just pointless.<br /><br />if you loved the book, and i mean truly adored it, you will not approve of this movie, and chances are, you already knew you wouldn't. because the book is unfilmable, and this movie just proves how impossible it is cram something decent into a small reel of film.<br /><br />two stars out of ten
