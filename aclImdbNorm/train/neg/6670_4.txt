this film really got off to a great start. it had the potential to turn into a really heartrending, romantic love story with cinematography that recorded the love between "harlan" and tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. it really didn't need to be anything more than that, and for a moment there i became excited that someone was finally making a beautiful film for its own sake, another timeless classic, a modern myth perhaps. why, oh why, then mess it up halfway through by making the lead character (norton)another psycho? maybe i'm missing the point, but do we really need another film about psychos? or is this need in hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature indicative of a more general malaise in the movie industry? for a moment there, i was going to make a mental note of the director's name; now i'm left feeling indifferent. at least it should be added in the film's defense that all the actors seemed to invest in their roles. also, evan rachel wood is really lovely to look at and a good actress with lots of potential.
