i can count (on one hand) the number of good movies starring joe don baker. this is not one of them.<br /><br />interminable chase scenes, dim-witted dialogue, and terrible lapses in continuity made this movie a prime choice for getting the send-up on mst3k.<br /><br />and that is the only way i was able to watch this...
