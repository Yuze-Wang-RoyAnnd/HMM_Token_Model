bobby is a goofy kid who smiles far too much and wants sex. so he buys a van to aid in this quest. the acting is lame, the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clich'es and cheap thrills. the makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there craziness of other films of the time, but fell a long way short. they even resort to bobby slipping on a banana skin, because this will supposedly add comedic value.<br /><br />i'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film. if you like devito, this is another classic devito kind of role - but he's only a supporting actor and there for clich'e value.
