in the autobiographical coming-of-age tale "romulus, my father," eric bana, of "munich" fame, plays an impoverished german 'emigr'e struggling to raise his son, raymond (kodi smit-mcphee), in rural 1960's australia. the major obstacle to the family's stability and happiness is his wife, christina (franka potente), who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly shacking up with other men. despite her highly unconventional behavior, romulus refuses to grant her a divorce, masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him. it is, unfortunately, the good-hearted and good-natured raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil - and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the movie (raimond gaita would later grow up to be an author).<br /><br />even though i admire "romulus, my father" for what it is trying to do, i can't honestly say i enjoyed it, for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it, these simply aren't enough to counteract the dour storyline and funereal pacing, which leave the audience as despairing and depressed as the people on screen. a serious slice-of-life drama is one thing, but this unremittingly downbeat wallow in adultery, insanity and multiple suicides (let alone attempted suicides) is something else again.
