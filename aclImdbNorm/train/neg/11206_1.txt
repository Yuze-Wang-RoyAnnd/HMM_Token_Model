no one is a greater fan of geroge macdonald fraser's flashman papers than i am.<br /><br />i was surprised to see just now that richard lester directed royal flash, since i also see he had made the three/four musketeers with fraser which i though turned out rather well.<br /><br />not so royal flash.<br /><br />i was 12 years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since i had read all the flashman papers published up to that time, and was intoxicated with a clockwork orange and malcolm macdowel (i still am, but he was never really given a chance after that).<br /><br />what a disappointment (i saw it once again when i was about 20 on television and it seemed even worse).<br /><br />none of the sharp dialogue in the books is transfered to the screen. the comedy of flashman's character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do. the dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic.<br /><br />looking back with more mature eyes, the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the prisoner of zenda.<br /><br />if you have read the book and not seen the film, i can only say that the film ends with flashman and rudi von starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game rudi has just invented: russian roulette.<br /><br />a pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about.<br /><br />my comments would be more direct if i had seen the film more recently, but i am glad i have not.<br /><br />if by any chance fraser ever reads this, i can only say i think he is a genius--perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation, but, based on my appreciation of that corpus of work, it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film, as that he did all those awful roger moore james bond films.
