one wonders how the script came to be written.<br /><br />wayne and the other performers do an ok job but as it is neither comedy, romantic thriller or anything else it is all rather disappointing.<br /><br />one feels as if one of the threads had been pursued it could have been something worthwhile. it is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the usa became directly involved with the war. i wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes but ending up with something that pleases no one.<br /><br />nonetheless it has historical value.
