before seeing this movie, i was expecting a fictional drama based loosely on ideas from the book; instead, it's the book, interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating the different "illnesses." that didn't bother me much, but it hindered my enjoyment of the film. one story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed through the movie would have been preferable, in my opinion. if you're going to base a movie on a psychology text, you've got to find a more interesting (and preferably accurate) text than this one. the film drags during parts where it's little more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century sexual psychology and would be utterly intolerable if it weren't sexual in nature (because "sex = interesting" for most of us, even me). luckily, there are several stories with actual character development that pull us in.<br /><br />but, disappointingly, krafft-ebing's theories of sexuality went unchallenged, for the most part. i was hoping it would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology which is still held by many to this day.<br /><br />so, in the end, what do you have? a detailed catalog of a few fetishes and orientations, with some mildly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of a few "sexual deviants" before they are cured. for most of the film, the film moves with the crawling speed (and mood) of a wake. and, as an obviously low budget film, the cinematography and acting are not exactly top tier. although i *was* pleased with the music, costume and interior design.<br /><br />i felt this film's subject was right up my alley, and i still feel it's a below average film. it deserves a 3/10; a 4/10 if i were feeling extremely generous. i can't imagine anyone enjoying this if they didn't already have an interest in sexual fetishism.
