tobe hooper is quite possibly the biggest fluke the horror genre has to offer. like any other horror fan, i loved the texas chainsaw, but i think that in order to put your name in front on a movie title, you should have at least more than one hit movie. i can't really think of any other movie hooper has done (on his own, don't count poltergeist) that has really made an impact on the horror genre or film world. and this movie, night terrors, just backs up my point.<br /><br />poor robert englund, i give him credit for at least doing a good job with the awful material he was given. he did what he could. as for the movie itself? pure drudge. unnecessary nude scenes every five minutes, a story that must have been penned in an our, and really just awful scenery, music, and cinematography. nothing in this film is redeemable. don't waste your time.<br /><br />overall, 1 out of 10. i feel sorry for hooper, his career seems like it was over before it really ever got started. i hope that he's able to pump out at least one more good flick, that way he can do his cult status some justice.<br /><br />
