i can't believe that none of the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two quite upsetting sexual assault scenes. it's as though our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual but not violent. my biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't seem to condemn these assaults - as in, the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and pressured never holds the men accountable for their actions, and neither does anyone else. one man is stopped from completing the assault when someone throws a dagger at him, but he is reprimanded only with "you cannot force a woman to love you" rather than "you should never force a woman sexually, you jerk"... from a woman's point of view, the movie is a let down. it sort of "throws a bone" to women in letting them be both skilled fighters and leaders, but the movie is much more defined by the romance - which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power, with men dominating the woman they love. this amazing martial arts fighter doesn't use any of her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers. she never even makes them apologize - rather, she seems apologetic. overall, a depressing and upsetting movie, with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes, but not as good as hero by a long shot.
