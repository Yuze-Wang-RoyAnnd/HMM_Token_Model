alexandre aja's remake of the hills have eyes was one of the bright spots of 2006. not only was it a remake of a classic horror film, but it was pretty damned good too. so, nearly a year later, we are being treated to the sequel to that remake. while original scripter wes craven is back as producer and co scripted, this film just fails to rise to the level set by the original and the remake. a group of military trainees stop by in the desert to check in on some scientists and find themselves run afoul of the mutant family from the first film (at least those that remain plus some new ones). there's plenty of gore to be had here. what annoys me about this film is the utter lack of characterization. the viewer does not give a damn about what happens to any of these people because we haven't gotten into them. even the mutants had some characterization last time out and this time, nothing. gore for the sake of gore is pointless. there has to be a reason for this to happen for it to be interesting. nothing that happens here is interesting. and what is it lately with rape scenes in films? here we get yet another one for no real reason. hopefully this is one set of hills that won't be visited again.
