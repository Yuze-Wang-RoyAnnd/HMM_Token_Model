a lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as in leon, then other parts felt like some other movie, i don't know which, but there are an familiar feeling over the whole movie. it was kind of nice to watch, but it would have been fantastic! if the story would have been more original. the theme little girl, bad assassin from leon, is just tweaked a little. the opening scenes are really good :-) it is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen, in the movies :-) my biggest problem was to remember which parts was from leon, nikita and if they where from the french or american version. if you have not seen leon, then this is a good movie. if you liked this movie, then i can recommend leon.<br /><br />best regards /rick
