i tried to watch this movie three separate times. the night i rented it. got through about 20 minutes hoping it would be better if i had a night's rest. watched 15 more the next day, almost vomited at how stupid it was... it wasn't even funny stupid which is sometimes a fun movie to watch but this movie was just crap with a capital s (if you know what i mean in the censored world we live in). and finally on the third day i watched over an hour of the dumb thing and i didn't enjoy one single moment! not even one. how did this script get greenlighted. oh boy!<br /><br />g<br /><br />1/10 - the one is for cheerleaders... they deserve at least something for all their hardwork.
