anyone not aware of the 1973 original british lion movie ' the wicker man' would,no doubt, have left the cinema with the impression 'poor' and 'peurile'.<br /><br />as a devotee of the original i left with the impression purely poor.<br /><br />from the grim reality of haggle toothed inbreds drawing the force of law and order into a web of paganistic barbaric ritual on a remote scottish island, named summerisle(the original) to a near amazon-ic colony off the maine coast of the us, named summersisle, the remake hardly hits the spot.<br /><br />this is, quite sadly, a case of what 'could' have been a classic remake of a classic being tampered with to cater for a simple minded public. nothing more and nothing less. <br /><br />gentlemen (or given the reworked context of the film) ladies involved ... hang your heads in shame.
