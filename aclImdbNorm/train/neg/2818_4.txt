genie (zoe trilling) arrives in egypt to visit her hypocritical, bible-quoting archeologist father (william finley) and attracts the attention of a group of cultists led by a descendant of the marquis de sade (robert englund). englund also plays de sade in flashbacks, ranting in his cell. genie is led astray by mohammed (juliano merr), who rides around naked on a horse and sabina (alona kamhi), a bisexual who introduces her to opium smoking, which leads to a wild hallucination featuring topless harem dancers, a woman simulating oral sex on a snake, an orgy and her father preaching in the background! meanwhile, black hooded cult members decapitate, gouge out eyeballs and slit throats. when genie is slipped drugs in her tea, she imagines de sade hanging from a cross, a gold-painted woman in a leafy g-string and herself bloody on a bed covered in snakes. it's all because she's the reincarnation of de sade's lost love.<br /><br />this typically sleazy harry alan towers production is redundant, seedy and pretty senseless, but the sets, costumes, cinematography and location work are all excellent and at least there's always something going on.<br /><br />score: 3 out of 10
