quite possibly the nicest woman in show business, and the sexiest, debbie gives another fine performance here. although her work in american nightmare was far superior, she is still worth watching in this film.<br /><br />the cast is filled with your typical melrose place types, chiseled features and seductive curves, that i had never seen before. other than debbie, laura nativo was the only actress i had seen before, in the similar delta delta die.<br /><br />the plot centers around a group of california arrogants who initiate poor naive debbie rochon into their clique. they tell her that they have a murder club, and that she must kill someone to be accepted. debbie wants nothing more but to be accepted by these cool people, so she quickly kills a person, and now the group must decide what to do with her, after she fell for their joke.<br /><br />violence: $$$$$ (plentiful! debbie rochon occasionally has blood splattered all over her and all of the murder scenes are done in your face. gore hounds will surely enjoy!)<br /><br />nudity: $$$$$ (plentiful as well! debbie rochon has several nude scenes as do many of the no-name actresses and actors. the pool party seems as just an excuse to get everyone naked; man and woman alike. julie strain also has a topless cameo but her character is gone after the first five minutes).<br /><br />story: $$ (could have received a higher vote because the plot was very interesting and unique but the plot serves as filler between nude scenes. i understand that b-rate films use nudity often, but this is borderline excessive).<br /><br />acting: $ (the acting is sub standard to say the least. rochon is always a treat, easily the best b-rate actress in the business today, but her character in american nightmare was superior. danny wolske does a fine job as debbie's object of lust but the other actors were nothing to write about).
