spooks is enjoyable trash, featuring some well directed sequences, ridiculous plots and dialogue, and some third rate acting.<br /><br />many have described this is a uk version of "24", and one can see the similarities. <br /><br />the american version shares the weak silly plots, but the execution is so much slicker, sexier and i suspect, expensive.<br /><br />some people describe weak comedy as "gentle comedy". <br /><br />this is gentle spy story hour, the exact opposite of anything created by john le carre.<br /><br />give me smiley any day.
