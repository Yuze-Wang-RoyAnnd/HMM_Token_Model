not funny - how can anyone link this to monty python? that is absolutely ridiculous - there are no laughs. this is not funny. over the top, but ugly, weird just for weird sake and it seems to me these people were on something all the time. unfortunately something that did not make them funny.<br /><br />it should be given some points for effort etc. whatever. actually it appears there is a laugh track - or is there one? hummm.... since there are barely any laughs that's a debatable question.<br /><br />maybe i'm doing it injustice - maybe it's some sort of exercise. some sort of art - in that case anything goes, never mind.<br /><br />but these guys playing women with high-pitched voices, turned-up noses. come on !!! not funny. <br /><br />there is only one heir apparent to monty pythons intellectual wit and that is stephen colbert, and maybe jon stewart.
