this film is a travesty, and isn't fit to keep company with the superior original. the plot is an absolute mess, and the film is way too long. everytime they're struggling, they desperately inject a sentimental reminder from the first film.<br /><br />"gregory's girl" is one of the top 10 british films of all time, this one is awful.
