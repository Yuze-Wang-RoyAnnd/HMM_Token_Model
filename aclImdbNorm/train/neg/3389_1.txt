i saw the original "chorus line" on broadway god knows how many times and felt the passion, despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater. michael bennett knew he would have to re-imagine "chorus" for the screen but could never figure out how to do it. if the man who came up with the show is stumped - that should answer your question. there are some shows that are simply made to be seen live - with an audience. however, richard attenborough fresh of the musical work of "ghandi" and dancing with animals in "doctor doolittle" ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show. horrible songs were added (surprise! surprise!), great songs were dropped or given to other characters (which didn't make sense). michael douglas was mis-cast. people that couldn't dance tried to act and there was the sexy "landers" woman who couldn't sing, act, or dance - i guess she had just finished being ghandi's wife. the dances by jeffrey hornaday look like nothing more than schlock from "flashdance" rejects and nothing works. i sat there stunned at how something so riveting and emotional could be drained to nothing. if you truly love this show and it is coming back to broadway in 2006 - see it but don't think that the long running musical event that was "a chorus line" has any thing at all to do with this film.
