i've given up trying to figure out what version of this i'm watching. the copyright at the end indicates 1983. and though this is not the important bit of my objection to this film, i will say that watching a film obviously made in the aquarian age (including long haired hippie chicks and odious station wagons) but with a 1980s synth soundtrack is unsettling. extremely unsettling.<br /><br />my main objection here is how dare the filmmakers bury cute-as-a-button pamela franklin alive. how dare they.<br /><br />seriously she's all like adorable and stuff but in the two movies i've seen her in - this crapfest and the otherwise excellent legend of hell house - they kill her off.<br /><br />i would like to put the film industry on notice. pamela franklin has apparently retired from the business but if she ever decides to do another film and some blasted cur of a director attempts to kill her off i shall ask him to step outside.<br /><br />no one beats up on pamela franklin and gets away with it. i am quite cross. the fury has been unleashed.<br /><br />for b-movie fans seeking out a crapfest, you could do much worse than this. on the plus side, this is not a film which involves satanism in a peripheral and circumspect way - this movie is a hardcore satanic film.<br /><br />wall-to-wall satanic ceremonies, baphomets, hallucinations, a ludicrous rat attack - what else could you ask for.<br /><br />this excellent stuff is quite nearly ruined by the baffling grafted-on 1980s synth soundtrack, which is about as mismatched to a film as it is possible to be. the soundtrack reminded me of something you'd hear on the equalizer. it's really bad.<br /><br />also, they made pamela franklin squash her charming english accent, which was also quite rude, if not a cruel atrocity (against the viewer) such as you might find covered by the universal declaration of human rights. i say that we have a right to hear pamela franklin speak in her own voice. who's with me? i could forgive everything else about this film if they didn't abuse pamela franklin. and so i throw the gauntlet down, sirs -- anyone who messes with pamela franklin messes with me.<br /><br />even in a fictional context.<br /><br />good day, sirs.
