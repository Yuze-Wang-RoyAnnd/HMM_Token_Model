i frequently comment on the utter dirth of truly scary movies on the market, and sadly white noise only served to reduce my faith that the film industry remains capable of such an endeavor. i was surprised to find myself growingly increasingly fatigued as the plot wore on and my static-induced headache increased. i found white noise to be preposterous beyond our best efforts of suspension of disbelief. even after witnessing the harrowing ordeal sustained by michael keaton, i was totally unaffected by his demise. up until the credits i diligently awaited for something--anything-- of substance to connect me to the characters' story, but such relief never came. sure, there were the occasional heart-stopper moments, but only because loud noises tend to do that to the dozing viewer.<br /><br />while the acting was lame, michael keaton may have played his studliest role to date. perhaps the only redeeming quality that white noise has to offer is the stunning archietecture in both of keaton's abodes. overall, white noise leaves one with the morbidly depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three malicious shadows, contriving to trick the living into following the dead to their own graves.
