not as bad as some are making it out to be, though obviously pathetic compared to the original. in my opinion amitabh was great as the villain babban singh - try not to compare to gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect. other than some mediocre action scenes however, the rest of the film is flawed. character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless, with many loopholes, and missing pieces of information which i wouldn't have known if i hadn't read the back of the dvd case. the worst part of the movie was the support roles from nisha kothari and especially this new dude called prashant raj. nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open. as for prashant raj - seriously who is this guy? where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks?. his acting ability is zero and he has the same tone, dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene, whether it be action, comedy, or even a scene when someone has just died. ajay devgan was average, at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion. overall, rgv's aag is worth watching for amitabh's solid performance, and also a very sexy urmilla matondkar in a special appearance.
