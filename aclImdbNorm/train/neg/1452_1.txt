this 1919 to 1933 germany looks hardly like a post wwii czech capitol. oh sorry, it is the czech capitol and it is 2003, how funny.<br /><br />this is one of the most awful history movies in the nearest past. r"ohm is a head higher than adolf and looks so damned good, g"oring looks like 40 when he just is 23 and the "f"uhrer" always seems to look like 56. and the buildings, folks, even buildings have been young, sometimes. especially 1919 were a lot of houses in germany nearly new (the wwi does not reach german cities!). no crumbling plaster! then the reichstagsbuilding. there have never been urban canyons around this building, never. and this may sound to you all like a miracle: in the year 1933 the greater berlin fire brigade owns a lot of vehicles with engines, some even with turntable ladders, but none with a hand pump.<br /><br />one last thing: what kind of playmobil castle was this at the final sequence? for me this was a kind of "adolf's adventures in wonderland"
