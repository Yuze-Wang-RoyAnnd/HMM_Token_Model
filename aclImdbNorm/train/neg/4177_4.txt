second movie in the boxset. originally titled bloodsuckers, this movie was pretty average. it is kinda boring in some parts but there is some good gore effects, but they're not great though. <br /><br />the movie takes place in the year 2210. vampires have pretty much taken over the whole world. the v-san (vampire sanitation) squad, which also has their own spaceship and is lead by churchill, who is captured by the vampires, receives a message from an earth and the team, formed by quintana (played by the very hot natassia malthe), the rookie officer damian and the rebels rosa and roman (roman being played by aaron pearl from wrongfully accused.) v-san later meets up with the leader of the vampires muco, played by michael ironside from total recall. he has no plans of living peacefully with humans, as he is bent on world domination. <br /><br />while this movie was not a waste of time, i doubt i'll be putting back in the dvd player anytime soon.
