i just saw this movie on flix after timer-taping it. i grew up watching f troop and had a major hard for wrangler jane so i was shocked, literally shocked, to find out after seeing this film that the degenerate homicidal nurse was melody patterson, who looks pretty good but also looks completely different and is unfortunately poorly photographed. i would never have guessed it was her in a million years. what the hell is she doing in a picture like this? i agree with the guys here that the movie lacks what it's pushing. no sex, no gore, no tease. it's also a remake of the atomic brain aka monstrosity (1964 or thereabouts). most of the action is tedious; the main character spends enormous amounts of time running around the crazed doctor's house and basement, and the neighborhood in general, or being roughed up by the cop, all of it boring and time-filling. now if the italians would have made this, half the film would have been the slingblade/uncle ernest/jack elam henchman fondling the unconscious nude girls. but you only get that for 20 seconds.
