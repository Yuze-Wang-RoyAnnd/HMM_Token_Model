wow. this movie bored the pants off me when i saw it. bland, pointless and unmoving.<br /><br />apparently, ash and co. can travel through time with the help of "the spirit of the forest" ('princess mononoke' much??) there, they meet a dorky kid named sam, and the "plot" begins.<br /><br />so tom (ash) and huck (sam) get high with nature, become hippies and try to free celebi (the "spirit") from some weirdo hunter guy. i don't even know what else went on. it all went by in a blur. ash's friends were hardly in it, and all the fight scenes were boring.<br /><br />after saving the day, ash and his infamous friends, must return to their time, while watching sam float away with celebi (that scene was just creepy. o-o;) then, after returning to their time, ash learns that his new friend is actually his rival's grandpa. and i think that's it. pretty retarded isn't it? if you love your children, you won't expose them to this.
