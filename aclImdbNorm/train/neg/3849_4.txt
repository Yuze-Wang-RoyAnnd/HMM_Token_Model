debbie reynolds toe-taps, tangos and, yes, tap-dances her way through this ordinary thriller which has a distinctly fabricated '30s atmosphere. two ladies, brought together when their sons commit a murder, try starting their lives over by running a tap-dance school for tots in hollywood. trouble is, one of them is plagued by neuroses. can you imagine this thing 10 years earlier with robert aldrich directing bette davis and joan crawford...? nahh, bette never would have allowed joan so much screen-time to strut her stuff, and i can't imagine bette davis in the other role, tap-dancing her heart out. this is a purely bogus piece of macabre, written by a slumming henry farrell (whose idea of a good "shock" is to stage the mass-murder of a group of rabbits!). not an ounce of honest fun in the whole tepid package. *1/2 from ****
