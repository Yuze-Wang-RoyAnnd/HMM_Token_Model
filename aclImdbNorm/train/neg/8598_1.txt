just kidding! this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen! it was so bad though, that it was hilarious. my friend and i purposly rented it because it looked so bad. cheesy old horror flicks are always good for some laughs. the plot stunk, some of the voices were dubbed, the quality was horrendous. but i sure had a blast watching it!
