i'll get to the movie in a minute. first, someone wanted "proof" about clinton's comments at georgetown, where he claimed that the usa "deserved" the 9-11 attacks. well, here's what clinton said:<br /><br />"in the first crusade, when the christian soldiers took jerusalem, they first burned a synagogue with 300 jews in it and proceeded to kill every woman and child who was a muslim on the temple mount. i can tell you that story is still being told today in the middle east and we are still paying for it."<br /><br />we're still paying for it? whaddya mean "we", paleface? the marines didn't storm the temple mount. <br /><br />but in truth, clinton never really came out and flatly said that we "deserved" 9-11. like all his statements during his presidency, he implied that we deserved 9-11. just point out "fact" a, b, c, and maybe d, and let the listener deduce that they must add up to conclusion x. when in truth, most of clinton's "facts" added up to guacamole.<br /><br />but that's beside the point. we're here to talk movies, not politics. unfortunately, when oliver "captain conspiracy" stone does a movie, you can't escape his warped politics. it was only a matter of time before he focused his paranoia and bitterness on the reagan era, and what better time than when stone's dreams almost came true, on the day reagan nearly bought the farm. unable to find any nefarious plots or schemes in hinckley's assassination attempt, he invents one with al haig. from a simple misunderstanding of the chain of constitutional authority, haig is transformed from a public servant who really should have brushed up on his remedial civics into a raving megalomaniac. you almost expect haig to rub his hands together like montgomery burns and tell cap weinberger to "release the hounds." stone even recruits the smarmiest person in hollywood to play our former secretary of state, richard dreyfuss. a guy you love to hate on sight.<br /><br />overall, the movie is ok. average, hovering on below average. don't bother renting or buying. try to catch it on cable. 4 out of 10.
