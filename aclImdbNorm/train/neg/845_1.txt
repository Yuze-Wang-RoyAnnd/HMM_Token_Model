it is a pity that you cannot vote zero stars on imdb, because i would not have hesitated! in fact i would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars. <br /><br />i, like many others, bought this film thinking that because it has michael madsen in it, it could be good... no chance! this film was shocking! imagine a movie length 'the bold and the beautiful', well, primal instinct did not even come close to that good, and i had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a movie length 'the bold and the beautiful'. <br /><br />michael madsen, how could you do this to us? the worst part is, i didn't fast forward a bit, i was hoping that at the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick joke, that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad film.<br /><br />where do i start...? directing - zero stars, screenplay - zero stars, acting - zero stars, cinematography - zero stars, digital effects - zero stars, production design - zero stars, make-up - zero stars, casting - zero stars, editing - zero stars, trailer - half a star, graphic design - half a star, dvd menu - half a star.<br /><br />however i think that it is very important to have seen bad films just so that you know what a really bad film is, so for that reason i am happy that i saw this film, just so that i have a bad film to put at the bottom of my list.
