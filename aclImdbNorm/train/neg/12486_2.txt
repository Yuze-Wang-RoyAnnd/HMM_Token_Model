rich ditzy joan winfield (a woefully miscast bette davis) is engaged to be married to stupid egotistical allen brice (jack carson looking lost). her father (eugene palette) is determined to stop the marriage and has her kidnapped by pilot steve collins (james cagney. seriously). they crash land in the desert and hate each other but (sigh) start falling in love.<br /><br />this seems to be getting a high rating from reviewers here only because cagney and davis are in it. they were both brilliant actors but they were known for dramas not comedy and this movie shows why! the script is just horrible--there's not one genuine laugh in the entire movie. the running joke in this has cagney and davis falling rump first in a cactus (this is done three times!). only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated. as it is they both do their best with the lousy material. cagney tries his best with his lines and davis screeches every line full force but it doesn't work. carson has this "what the hell" look on his face throughout the entire movie (probably because his characters emotions change in seconds). only palette with his distinctive voice and over the top readings manges to elicit a few smiles. but, all in all, this was dull and laughless--a real chore to sit through. this gets two stars only for cagney and davis' acting and some beautiful cinematography but really--it's not worth seeing. cagney and davis hated this film in later years and you can see why.
