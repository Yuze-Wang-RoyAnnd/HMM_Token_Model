for daniel auteuil, `queen margot' was much better. for nastassja kinski, `paris, texas' was much better. the biggest disappointments were from chris menges (`crisscross' and `a world apart' cannot even be compared with this one), and goran bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from `queen margot' for this movie (attention to the end of the film). if this was an american pop movie, i would not feel surprised at all; but for a european film with more independent actors and director, a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simple-minded and disappointing. there are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people. there are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone. and finally, there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys. every character is shown in simple black and white terms: the good versus the evil. plus, from the very beginning, i could understand how the story would end. is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse? i believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie. i think this movie was not disturbing, but very disappointing.
