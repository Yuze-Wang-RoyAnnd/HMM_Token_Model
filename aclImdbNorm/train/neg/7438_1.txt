this movie is an utter waste of time, the plot is awful, the dialogue is awful.<br /><br />the acting is ok, but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with. the photography and some of the special effects are ok, too, but again there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch. there is no logical progression to the story, the story line is utter nonsense. it isn't even scary. for a movie to be scary, there has to be at least a small element of believability. this movie has no believability at all.<br /><br />there are only three characters in the movie. each character is shallow and has no personality. <br /><br />most of the special effects and make up work are both badly done, or at most mediocre.<br /><br />i hope you read this and do not waste time on this movie unless you are curious to see an entirely awful movie.
