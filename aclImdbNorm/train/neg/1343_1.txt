we bought this film from a shop called poundland. we were looking for more inspiration as we have previously bought the film no big deal an remade it.<br /><br />we expected this film to be badly inspirational so that we might remake it and put it on the tube. however, this was shocking. boring is the main word that comes to mind. the bad effects and script aren't enough to make you watch it. the main woman's body seems to be whipped out at opportune moments in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested. however, it just makes you wonder, did they blow the budget getting her to take her clothes off? if so, i'd have asked for a refund! it looks like a homemade film, the shots don't even correspond with each other and the camera work is so amateur it makes our remakes of bad movies look professional. i cannot believe that this is being sold as a marketable product.<br /><br />it is just boring and ugly to watch. the actors are bad and there is no degree of professionalism about it. there are no words to describe how terrible it is.
