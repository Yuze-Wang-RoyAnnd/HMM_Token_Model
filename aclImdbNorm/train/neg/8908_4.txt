this series was cbs networks answer to the success of the big valley. it was a 90 minute western just like the abc program was. while it was an answer, it did not have the stuff to make it past season 2.<br /><br />the problem really became reality got lost on this show. for example- in one episode, johnny gets his eye poked out by a stick. amazingly, by the end of the show, johnny had healed entirely. along with that, the stories on this were no where near as strong as the big valley.<br /><br />this is a show that i would not want dvds of, & frankly hope they are never released. think since cbs was running out of lots, they re-used many familiar settings. this was one the last western series cbs produced as westerns were not real popular in the 1970's.
