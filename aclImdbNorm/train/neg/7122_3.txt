"the screaming skull" opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - now there's a hook! the story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick: scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then attempts to convince her that she's going insane with shrill noises, mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times. add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to. maybe it's just that the 1950's didn't have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie, the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane. but then again, when i first saw "house on haunted hill" as a nine year old, it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way i'm sure this film did for young viewers of the same era.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, the film is not terrible, it just seems to get tedious at times. but there's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished whitlock home, and the gardens and pool are a nice touch. for me the best played out scene involves eric whitlock (john hudson) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull, he just wades right in clothes and all, in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director alex nicol in a dual role). it makes you wonder who the real dimwit was.<br /><br />in it's own good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the film: how about that neat roadster the whitlock's make their first appearance in - gull wing doors in 1958! that at least made me jump out of my seat!
