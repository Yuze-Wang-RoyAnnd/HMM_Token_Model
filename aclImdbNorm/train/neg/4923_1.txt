this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen. this movie has nothing positive about it. some of you people actually like this movie! i've seen a lot of dracula movies and i've liked everyone that i've seen, but when i saw this movie i said to myself, "what the hell is this?" what a stupid movie. now they have dracula becoming who he is because he is judas. for those of you who don't know who judas is, he betrayed jesus christ and then felt so guilty he hung himself. you have to be kidding me. that's the dumbest reason i've ever heard for why dracula became evil. who asked for a reason anyway? what a piece of sh** this movie is. who ever came up with this sorry excuse for a movie should be beaten. even the dracula is horrible. if you ever saw this movie you wouldn't even think it was dracula. wow, dracula 2000! is that title supposed to impress me? don't waste your time or your money on this trash.
