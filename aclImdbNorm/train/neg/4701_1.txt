it's terrible how some people can get away with such things... this is one of those overrated things again... and i hate things that are overrated that are no good... why can't we have more tv shows and movies that actually have a story and excellent music and that are well written and are actually about something?? it takes many people to make this movie, the series, and the band, all possible, and those people are all wasting their time... it seems that the bands are getting younger and younger... i looked at how small that they were, and i thought that they were 5 or 6. it's sad that kids are performing that young... they are still too young... performing takes a lot of work, and they have many other things that they need to do with their lives... the idea about having a very young band is horrible... they need to stop having bands like this... and i don't like the idea at all, nor the kids themselves... they are very annoying, very young, and their name is "the naked brothers band" the people that are involved in this, and the people that are supporting this have all lost their minds... whenever this band is shown on tv, change the channel, and petition to get it banned...<br /><br />and i know that this is a very boring comment thing, but you get the point...<br /><br />this band sucks... get rid of it...
