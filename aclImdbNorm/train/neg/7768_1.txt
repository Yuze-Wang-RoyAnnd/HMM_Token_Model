this god forsaken film is about three dumb millionaires who gather a bunch of people to play a deadly game, and the winner gets a million dollars. first of all, the acting is terrible, and the movie makes absolutely no sense at all. it is not scary in the least bit, it is so stupid that it made me laugh, which is why it earned that 1 star.the movie is not violent at all, but is pretty sleazy and focuses mostly on the women's breasts the whole time, and some of the characters are very annoying and whiny. plus, the monsters in this movie are so cheesy and fake and not scary that it just makes you want to throw something at the screen. last, but not least the ending is terrible. i don't want to give it away, in case you actually are strange enough to see this piece of junk. avoid at all costs!!!!!<br /><br />not rated (but should be r) for nudity, profanity, and mild gore.
