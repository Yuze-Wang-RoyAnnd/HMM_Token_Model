karl jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island. they capture a trio of guys who stumble upon the island. whom after a while fight back. (well the survivors) this one has non-stop blood, gore and carnage, which would have been good if any of it looked remotely real, or if the production didn't look like it was made with a weeks worth of saved up lunch money (i may be overexxagerating there. it was probably just a couple days worth). the horrendous dubbing didn't bother me as much and i suspect if i had been really drunk, some of it might have been slightly humorous....maybe. but as it is, at merely 78 minutes the movie still felt way too long by.. oh i don't know... 78 minutes. don't waste your time.<br /><br />my grade: f <br /><br />dvd extras: bonus movie: "zombie '90: extreme pestilence"; and trailers for other shock-o-rama released films
