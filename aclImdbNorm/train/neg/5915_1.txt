i have seen many, many films from china - and hong kong. this is the worst. no, the worst one was 'unknown pleasures'. i watched 'platform' yesterday evening and thought that jia zhang ke's other two films must be better. this evening i was disappointed again. i will not be watching 'xiao wu' tomorrow evening because i have just placed all three films in the bin! whoever gave this film, 'platform' ten out of ten, needs to watch more cinema! the photography was very poor: it was very difficult to differentiate between some of the characters because of the lack of close-up work. the storyline was so disjointed that i fast-forwarded it towards the end out of pure frustration. i would not recommend this film to anyone. give me zhang yimou or chen kage any day. these are true masters of chinese cinema, not pretentious con men!
