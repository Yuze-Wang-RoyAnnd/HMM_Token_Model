despite the lavish production numbers and wonderful costumes this film is a chore to watch. the murder-mystery plot is just a vehicle to mount the musical numbers on but it often brings the proceedings to a staggering halt besides not being very involving. although there has obviously been a lot of money spent on them the numbers are badly staged and poorly photographed. it's obviously a pre-code film because the girls often wear very little clothing and there's even a song singing the praises of marijuana! the performances are all one-note although it's nice to see carl brisson in a musical but when victor mclaglen, as the police lieutenent, lurches into view for the umpteenth time on the hunt for clues, you may want to throw in the towel or at least fast-forward to the next number. pity the patrons who were trapped in the cinema on its release though!
