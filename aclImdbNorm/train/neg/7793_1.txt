this really is one of the worst movies ever made. i consider myself a huge zombie film fan and usually tolerate bad acting, lame "special effects" a dumb story and whatever you may encounter in second rate movies, as long as the film has a good atmosphere/story/suspension or whatever to offer. this one has basically no positive aspect to it and is third or fourth rate, maybe worse. some friends of mine and myself made a small movie during a week's holiday and definitely did a better job (no zombie film though).<br /><br />this flick is not even funny, not speaking of anything else. really bad and redundant special effects, zombies that look like normal people (except for a white additional skin pulled over their faces), way to much fake blood (i like realism a lot, the combination of realism and zombie films being debatable, but the presented gore is just plain silly). the camera stays quite long with feedings scenes, it gets boring and you cannot help but wonder, why the zombies use weapons (!) to kill their prey. i will not go into the details of the dubbing (others have done so). although i am from germany myself and am at least a bit curious about the original version, i will not waste more of my time with this movie.<br /><br />keep away from it, as far as you can.
