a small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. the only hope is a lone avenger and a group of ragtag survivors.<br /><br />released in 1993, "darkness" garnered something of a cult following upon release. it's easy to see why-it's loaded (and i mean freaking loaded) with gore, and it's energy and enthusiasm, like that found in other no-budget cult horror flicks like "the dead next door" and "the children of ravensback", is actually rather infectious.<br /><br />while that may be true, that's sadly not enough to save it. the film was shot on a super 8, so the image is grainy and dark, making things very difficult to see (it would have been great if it had obscured the protagonists dreadful mullet.) also grating is the soundtrack, made up of annoying casio keyboard and even more annoying death metal (seriously, what is it with these no budget horror flicks and bad death metal?) while one isn't expecting oscar worthy performances, the acting is still strictly amateur hour, as the actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of frightened or threatened.<br /><br />in the end, i'm sure fans of no-budget gorefests will love this. everyone else though, will wish there was a little more meat on the ribs.
