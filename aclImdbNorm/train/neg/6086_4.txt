for some reason, in the late 70's and early 80's the local cbs affiliated station in new york kept playing this movie in it's late-night slot on friday or saturday nights for several years, usually at 2 a.m. or some such time. it's a fitting movie for that time slot since it's really hard to follow and quite odd (see the other reviews for specific story info). anyway, after catching it numerous times in those days just before cable tv (and even after it hit but before they offered much all night programming), i kept catching this little oddity. after not seeing it for many years i decided to see if i could find it on dvd. well, it is only available (from every search i've conducted anyway)in a pretty lousy grainy print on the budget label "brentwood video" as part of a 4-pack of movies (4 movies on 2 double sided discs)called "alien worlds" if anyone is interested. it's usually available for around $10-but even much less if you shop around. the other 3 movies on this set are readily available in numerous other collections of public domain movies, so no need to comment on them here. but i haven't seen "eyes" available anywhere else. though hardly a "restored" version in any way, this print runs exactly 92 minutes, so for once imdb's stated running time of 90 minutes is not correct. even with the 92 minute running time it's not unusual for a movie dubbed into english from another language to also have some of the running time trimmed. it seems to be a common budget-conscience practice to sometimes save money by not bothering to dub some scenes at all if they are not considered to be important to the story. would a longer version make in any less confusing? who really knows-unless you've seen it in it's native language... by the way, my attempts to watch this during the day don't work and i end up just turning it off. there's something about watching this in the middle of the night that just fits this movie..or maybe it's just from my earlier experiences, who know??
