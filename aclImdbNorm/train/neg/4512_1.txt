having lived in japan for several years this movie does not reflect the japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what being a geisha is all about. unfortunately, a great opportunity has been missed to bring the japanese culture a bit closer to the broad western audience and help demystify the country where zen, samurai, the geisha world of kyoto originate from. some of the most poignant moments of the movie are when the americans are shown in japanese surroundings.the geisha dances were not authentic. there was far too much use of chinese music. a minor but essential detail: proper use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen. the sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy ! interestingly, some of the chinese actors were quite convincing as japanese persons.
