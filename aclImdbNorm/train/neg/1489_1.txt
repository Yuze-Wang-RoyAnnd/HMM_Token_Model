this started bad, got worse, and by the time the girl attacked the old lady at the end i literally wanted to take the dvd to the person we borrowed it off and choke the c**t to death with it. avoid this film, a little bit of good cinematography and some naked shots, would be almost acceptable if i was 14 and had not seen jenna jameson naked a million times. if anyone feels the need to watch this film, i would strongly recommend you spend the time more appropriately, as an example i would say trying to cram a lego house into your bum with no lube would be a good start. i hear that this film was not the original version, i would very much like to view the original, as it seems that this cut version is devoid of all plot, and apparently most of the nudity, can someone please tell me how i can get in touch with christian viel he owes me an hour of my life back!
