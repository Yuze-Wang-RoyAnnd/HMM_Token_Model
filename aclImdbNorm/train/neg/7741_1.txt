josh hartnett's dead eyes, the thick writing of it, and harrison ford being in a buddy-cop comedy ! here's 3 reasons to hate it, avoid it, and to utilize 116 minutes of your life better.<br /><br />the buddy-cop movies are fun. however their real golden age was back in the 1980s and the 1990s. making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of hollywood itself is sure a good idea but the final result of that turned out to be not at least a spoof of the subgenre but a reason to ask god to have mercy upon all the past movies of the same kind whereas the worst of them was by all means greater than (hollywood homicide).<br /><br />what really did happen to this entertaining formula ?! since a whole decade the things hadn't been the same. you'd have a buddy-action stubborn flop after another. i'll delight you with some titles to catch on the disaster well : (i spy - 2002), (national security - 2003), (taxi - 2004), (starsky & hutch - 2004), and the worst of them all yet (miami vice - 2006) ! <br /><br />i believe one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many similar cinematic flicks and tv shows during 2 decades already. add to that, particularly here, the negligent dealing and the dull humor. actually the matter this time is totally unbearable. yes, we've got the characters of 2 loyal cops who have second jobs, and the background of sinful city, but what else was new ?! it's not about clich'e; it's about few renewals mixed with clich'es where both have been badly made.<br /><br />the acting, especially from (hartnett)'s side, is terrible. this guy is anything but a comedian (or actor !). so his character was wanting to revenge for his father's death ! revenge on yourself man, he probably died out of watching your acting !!. even the small roles got people that have nothing to do with comedy (or that's what they seemed here anyhow !).<br /><br />the directing fails in presenting something that comic or that harsh, some parts managed to be highly dull (arresting the black guy through the lack ??) ; it's a rare time to be boring in what supposed to be action/comedy ! they didn't utilize hollywood itself whether as an ironic place where there is ugly face behind the superficial charm, or even as a place which's full of shining or fallen stars (cameos that could've given it few interesting moments).<br /><br />it's a very easy movie that relayed on being watchable by only its stars' glamour, and as being a buddy-cop movie to end up as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with non-chemistry on the screen (one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself ! guess who ?!), and a buddy-cop destroyer more than movie ! god, don't make me, or my children, live enough to witness (hollywood homicide
