why? why did they make this movie? if timothy olyphant wasn't shirtless in it several times, there would be absolutely no reason to watch this movie, ever. um...plot? nope. well-defined characters? nope. the only time i laughed was when my boyfriend made fun of the whole she-bang. p.s. andy dick? nope.
