<br /><br />entrails of a virgin is so bizarre and incomprehensible that it allows the viewer to interpret it subjectively, applying whatever meaning he wishes to its inexplicable excesses of sex and violence. if this was an intentional characteristic of the film, it would be a work of postmodern brilliance-but of course it isn't. <br /><br />without getting too much into plot summary, let's take a quick walking tour of the events. at a secluded cabin, an orgy is in progress, which includes topless wrestling and diaper p***ing. a vanload of latecomers joins the orgy in progress, but they have unwittingly been followed by a monster i like to call "the muddy ninja." this monster precedes to slay orgy participants one by one, except the proverbial virgin (if you don't count oral sex) who receives his seed and consequently becomes so passionate with desire that she masturbates with someone's severed hand. <br /><br />finally she has her guts pulled out, and then there's a scene which seems to imply that she's pregnant with a baby muddy ninja. got all that? if you're going to rent this movie, it's best if you don't speak japanese and don't have any subtitles. in a season populated by boring hollywood flicks, putting this in your vcr might be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy. it will certainly be something different.
