this is one of those movies which makes you think: would hulk " the real american " hogan have done the same? frankly i don't think so and he'd have been right. i'm italian, i cannot go proud of my country for many reasons, but i wouldn't have rowed for another team (the french, for example), simply because i'm in love with juliette binoche. besides the protagonist doesn't fall in love desire with a british girl at the end of the movie but with a fellow countrywoman, so why rowing against yale. as far as acting is concerned, well, all the players act very poorly. and then , you know, i hated that "dead poets society " atmosphere. in fact that's another movie i hate.
