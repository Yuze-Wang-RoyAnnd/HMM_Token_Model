oh, this is so bad, it is funny. the only way one could explain something like this is a porn party with drugs that resulted in the resolution to make a movie just for fun. i mean: you get to see porn actresses topless, having sex, then killed by human mutants. there is plenty of gore, including the classic "something is wrong with her, oh no, it's half the person she used to be" and the accidental murder caused by panic. but you can also find funny stuff like intestines pulled through someone's ass and a guy running in the woods then finding himself decapitated by a wire tied between two trees (that makes a metallic doiiing sound afterward, like in cartoons). somehow there is a market for people going beyond porn, they really need to know what's inside an actress, mere genitals are not enough. therefore you get to see plenty of summary autopsies on slain bimbos. there is no dialog. jenna and chasey have really small parts and i really wonder what richard grieco wanted when accepting a role here. i think this is a film one must watch with the button on fast forward and watch only the juicy stuff, just to be reminded of the old school c class horror movies.
