because that is the only way you won't think this film is a total waste of time and money. a remake of "heaven can wait", (which was at least worth watching) is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy. it is more a vehicle to give rock some time on film for weak stand up comedy which doesn't play well on the big screen. especially because his jokes generally are supposed to be from the body of an old, fat, rich, dead man but are shown coming from rock himself. as he insults blacks and whites the chemistry is all wrong. the movie is not funny, poorly shot the acting is weak at best. go rent "heaven can wait" and a live rock video and you'll be way ahead of the game.
