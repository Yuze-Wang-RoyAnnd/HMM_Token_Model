john scott (john wayne) and partner kansas charlie (eddy chandler) are trail buddies who make their way to the rattlesnake gulch rodeo. scott is a pretty fair contestant, but finds that unless he's willing to accept twenty five cents on the dollar in prize money from a crooked promoter, he'll have to collect his winnings at gunpoint. quite coincidentally, bandits pete (al ferguson) and jim (paul fix) decide they'd like the rest of the rodeo take; they shoot promoter farnsworth (henry hall), and make it look like scott and kansas charlie are the killers. <br /><br />wayne and chandler use a running gag in the film where they're about to go at it with their fists over various trivialities. each time chandler takes a wild swing, wayne foot stomps him and knocks him silly.<br /><br />if you're very attentive, there's a neat lipton's tea ad in one of the scenes in which scott's love interest anne (mary kornman) appears.<br /><br />later on in the film, the buddies are framed once again over a stage robbery. having a change of heart and seeing the error of his ways, bad guy jim wants to come clean and confess to the sheriff, but pete shoots him down. while being patched up, jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister anne. in an unbelievable scene, anne marches right into the middle of a gunfight between the good guys and the villains to confront the sheriff.<br /><br />"the desert trail" is one of the blander john wayne westerns from lone star productions during this era. noticeably absent are george "gabby" hayes and yakima canutt, one or both are usually to be seen in these oaters. if you're a john wayne fan though, you'll have to see it once, but that will probably be enough.
