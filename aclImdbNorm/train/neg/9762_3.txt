alan alda plays real-life "sports illustrated" writer george plimpton, who was once invited to join the detroit lions football team as an honorary member. rather wan, uncompelling drama curiously tempered with fantasy. director alex march takes an interesting tack on this material, shooting it in a quasi-documentary fashion (with macho commentary) and yet giving the tale a touch of capraesque whimsy; still, by bringing out the cinematic flashiness in this set-up, he turns the main narrative into a jumble. alda's smug, uncharismatic performance is another handicap, though the supporting cast is filled with real-life pro-athletes (and scintillating lauren hutton as alda's girlfriend--how's that for a fantasy?). *1/2 from ****
