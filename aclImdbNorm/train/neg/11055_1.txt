i just watched this movie in high definition on television. i am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities.<br /><br />at first i found the main character somewhat noble and captivating. his message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society's job market is great. and my problem isn't with the real person who did these things. he was a great man. but this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching, that i found it insulting.<br /><br />first of all, they didn't cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability. sure they were competent actors, but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually hiring the disabled for anything in the film. further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches, appearing to have only one leg. but the cgi in this scene is so apparent it is shameful. what? they couldn't find an actual amputee anywhere for the film? for a 5 second shot it was more financially sound to do cgi effects than to just hire an actual amputee? at that point in the film i found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that i came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple i am.<br /><br />figure that out.
