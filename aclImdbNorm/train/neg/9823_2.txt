there is an interesting discussion in this movie. is being a moral person good enough, or do you need something more?<br /><br />the movie preaches that without the guidance of god, being a morally good person is not enough. there is a line early in the movie, "you and i can look at a person who is morally good, but both know he is going to go to hell."<br /><br />while i am not a christian, the discussions about this throughout the course of the movie were fascinating, but not in the way the movie intended. i left the movie with a stronger feeling that being morally good *is* enough. the arguments and discussions presented were heavily biased, so much so that they crush themselves in the weight of their own ignorance. fanaticism can be a powerful thing, especially when inferenced in the minds of the ignorant and uneducated. as george carlin's character in dogma said: "hook em while they're young".<br /><br />the basic premise is a very interesting one also. a bible scholar from the 1890s is attempting to publish a book that says that morality without god is ok, as long as the morality is meaningful. do you only tell a child not to steal? or do you tell him not to steal because god tells you not to? (not bothering bringing up that telling the child not to steal because, well, how would he feel if it was his marbles that were stolen?)<br /><br />the author, carlisle, wants the recommendation of his school to help sell the book (to spread the world). however, it needs unanimous consent, and one of the scholars opposes it. he brings up, in a very interesting discussion early in the film about the morality for morality's sake vs god's words argument. to prove his point, he produces a time machine (put in the movie solely to make the plot work, which i'm fine with), and sends carlisle to the year 2002 to see where teaching morality without god will lead us.<br /><br />as should be obvious, he has his opinion, and is changed by what he sees, and has reversed himself by the time of his return (for he does return, that's not really a spoiler, this is a bible movie after all).<br /><br />as for the movie as a movie itself, it's pretty slow and pretty poorly acted. something that was *not* needed in this movie, is that it produces two "bad guys" who want to try to figure out who carlisle is, even tho he hasn't hurt anyone, committed a crime, or anything. what's wrong with the movie just showing carlisle's opinion, showing his view of this "sinful world", and returning him with a new viewpoint? <br /><br />also, there a few points in the movie which affirm to me that i'm happy i'm not a christian, or at least someone who says "it's god or nothing". three near the end of the movie rather disturbed me.. first, when the two "bad guys" corner carlisle right before he jumps, carlisle does his *only* truly despicable act.. he fakes like his time-jump is the coming of jesus, and makes it so the "bad guys" (who are also christians btw, oddly enough), think they just missed the rapture. <br /><br />secondly, after carlisle returns, he finds a boy in which he scolded at the beginning of the movie about not stealing (but not mentioning god, kid kept the marbles and ran away), and tells him this time that stealing is wrong because god commands it. like the carlin quote above, scaring kids into religion is a faux-pas in my book.<br /><br />and lastly, the epilogue. another scare tactic. carlisle asks the inventor how far into the future they could go, and he says he doesn't know.. the epilogue shows him trying to warp a bible into the distant future (starts at 2100), and it fails.. he keeps decrementing the years by 10, and trying again, and by the fade-out, he's at like 2030 or so. throughout the movie, carlise mentions that he felt the end of the world coming, because the world was rife with sin and the loss of the name of god.. scare tactics have been in use for thousands of years.. you would think in these enlightened times, the church would have enlightened as well.<br /><br />i'm glad i saw this movie. while i was fairly certain before that being morally good was enough, now i know it for a fact. worth watching if you are not a christian, to affirm how happy you are to not be as ignorant as the folks in this movie.
