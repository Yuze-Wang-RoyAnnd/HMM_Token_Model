i totally hated the movie. it was so retarded. they need to get some acting lessons....no, wait, that won't help because the naked brothers band people a retards. you know why i am here even though i am a naked brothers band hater? to warn people before they watch the dumb movie so that the nbb doesn't get any money from it so then they can't make any more amateur stupid songs that are so retarded that any old guy could go and write it in 10 seconds. not only are the song lyrics retarded, they sing badly. okay, i'm kinda getting off the movie here.....anyways, it was boring and they acted horribly. it was not funny at all even though they tried really hard for it to be. i guess they deserve some credit for that...well, the movie isn't worth your time. just look at its rating. the movie (and the series) is very painful to watch for anyone who has even half a brain. seriously, if you liked it, you need to go watch movies where the actors actually act, not babbling their lines in a monotone. i am on the drama club at my school and some people there are actually better than those nat and alex guys. hurry before it's too late! i seriously thought that herbie fully loaded was better than this piece of poopie. i don't even know why i went through even half of that film. i don't think it even deserves to be called a film...
