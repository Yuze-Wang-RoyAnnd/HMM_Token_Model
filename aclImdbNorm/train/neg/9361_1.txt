when i saw the preview for this on tv i was thinking, "ok its gonna be a good werewolf movie" but it was not. it was not scary at all! acting was good, plot was horrible, the military bid was just plain stupid. i think the sci-fi channel could of done better than this piece of crap. the movie made it sound like arron was going to turn into a werewolf, instead he turned psycho and bit some doctor's throat out. if you have read some of my other reviews on other movies, there all positive, but this one is not simply because the story was terrible. one out of 10 max. im sure you all were expecting some werewolf flick, but i bet you didn't expect this. beyond loch nes was way better than this movie, heck, any movie thats on the sci-fi channel is better than this movie.
