this is the most depressing film i have ever seen. i first saw it as a child and even thinking about it now really upsets me. i know it was set in a time when life was hard and i know these people were poor and the crops were vital. yes, i get all that. what i find hard to take is i can't remember one single light moment in the entire film. maybe it was true to life, i don't know. i'm quite sure the acting was top notch and the direction and quality of filming etc etc was wonderful and i know that every film can't have a happy ending but as a family film it is dire in my opinion.<br /><br />i wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained by a film. i can't stress enough how this film affected me as a child. i was talking about it recently and all the sad memories came flooding back. i think it would have all but the heartless reaching for the prozac.
