this film is regarded by some as a classic - i've no idea why. it is terrible to the point of being laughable. the only saving grace with this movie are the delivery of cheesy lines that are so toe curlingly embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them.<br /><br />there are a couple of good songs and good choreography in this film, but so what! there is no plot, it is set in a theatre with no change of scenery, and michael douglas is as depressing as ever. my brother once forced me to watch this film, because he said i wouldn't believe how bad a film can get! he was right.<br /><br />normally with a film this dreadful i would recommend that people shouldn't watch it, but in this case i think people should, as it will put every other bad film you've seen in perspective.
