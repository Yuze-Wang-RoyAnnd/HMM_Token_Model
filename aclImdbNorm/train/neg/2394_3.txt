this movie was strange... i watched it while ingesting a quarter of psilcybe cubensis (mushrooms). it was really weird. im pretty sure you are supposed to watch it high, but mushrooms weren't enough. i couldn't stop laughing.. maybe lsd would work. the movie is a bunch of things morphing into other things, and dancing. its really cheesy for todays standards but when it was released im sure it was well... one of a kind. i could see how some people would think this movie was good, but i didn't think it was very interesting, and i was on mushrooms at the time. if your having a party or something and everybodys pretty lit, pop it on you'll get a few laughs.
