dear me. where do i start? the dad isn't anywhere near old enough to be the girl's dad. he corpses on camera in the first 5 minutes of the film. the favoured exclamation in this film is "jesus christ!!!". zombies are agile, stupid and few and far between. motives are utterly incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist. people 'rush' to their destination in jeeps driven at 3 mph. the world seems to be carrying on as normal yet these are supposed to be the end days. breasts appear for the sake of breasts. normally such an approach would provide some redemption but the rest of the film actually made me uninterested in breasts or the future of humanity. there's a dog for no reason and thin, orange blood that turns the stomach. the general and his catchphrase of "shut the f**k up!" is the only redeeming feature. as for the rest, i sincerely hope to hear that they had done the decent thing and killed themselves.
