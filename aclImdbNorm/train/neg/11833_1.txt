so don't even think about renting this from the shops, because this is one hell of a bad movie. you'd think that jj abrahams had written this movie. basically, a rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to get back out. fans of the completely terrible "shrek" might enjoy, but "wallace & gromit" fans will probably turn away in disgust. also, why didn't they do it in plasticine or clay? i mean, cgi animation?? for an aardman movie??!! obviously, aardman lazed around while they let dreamworks do the whole thing. wrong, wrong, wrong!!! nearly every single character is awful, apart from that freaky frog guy, who is just right for a movie villain. but everything else about the movie is dull, dull, dull!!! i almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie. no, wait, actually, i did fall asleep with boredom watching this movie. it's just terrible. but thankfully, it's not as bad as "shrek."
