stephen j. cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and dabble in horror. the result, "dead above ground", is an abysmal piece of junk. now, had i noticed his name in association with this particular film i'd have put it back but no, i didn't have my glasses on and therefore i missed it, damn, i really do need to bring those with me while video shopping. first question would be, who the heck is the target audience for this? it's almost like a "scary" kids movie, but then again there's topless babes and some gore and some bad words spouted here and there. the main characters are so cute that you want to see someone, anyone, go after them with farm implements of some kind. seems that a guy opens a bed and breakfast that has a checkered past, a child-murdering witch that collected children's teeth lived there. probably something the real estate agent failed to mention. of course now in the modern day there's a little girls ghost around to warn the real-live little girl that now lives there that something bad is going to happen. it does, and there's also two bubbas that were squatting on that property when the new owner took over so they're out for revenge too. this whole thing has the feel of some made-for-cable junk that's for the kids at halloween except for, of course, the things that aren't suitable for little kids, so not only is this mediocre, it's confused, too. a big boo and hiss to anchor bay for putting this out too, considering their usual track record with fine releases this is a new low. the uk gets a phantasm box set, we get "the tooth fairy". hardly seems fair. 1 out of 10, absolute garbage.
