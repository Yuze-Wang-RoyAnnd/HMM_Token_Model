twist endings can be really cool in a movie. it's especially interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes, but we just don't pay attention. those type of twist endings are the one's that make people think. then we've got twists like this film has. twists that, whether or not you pay attention, you have no clue what's going to happen. when they reveal this kind of random twist, instead of shock, it's somewhat a dumbfounded reaction. this film starts off like it's going to be an interesting take on horror, but after about 20 minutes, it's nothing but boring dialogue and a stupid twist.<br /><br />three young women are going to a concert, so they get lost traveling through the woods, and hit a tree trunk. they end up at some old creepy lady's house, who hates men, and they are greeted by her homely daughter marion (laurel munson). strange goings on happen as these girls stay at this house for several days instead of trying to leave or get home, and the suspense progresses into a dumb slasher.<br /><br />this film is too caught up in it's dialogue, and it's always between only a few characters. we have the main three girls, the creepy spinster and the old lady, and conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five. to make matters worse, they never have anything interesting to say. it's actually quite maddening sitting through their conversations. we want to know what's going on, and instead they just talk and talk and talk (about nothing).<br /><br />plot holes are abundant here. the house these girls stay at when they get in their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere...wow, three miles! a two hour or less walk will kill them. why didn't they get a ride with the worker for this household who was driving into town? did he have a one seater? how come these girls never question leaving and just willingly stay, rarely even checking up on each other? why did this have to have so many dumb twists? maybe the answers are in the boring script.<br /><br />having a slasher film with five characters is really a bad idea. it's not thrilling, it's not scary, and the ending is definitely out there, but undoubtedly dumb.<br /><br />my rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 79 mins. r for nudity and violence.
