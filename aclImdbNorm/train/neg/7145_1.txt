apparently hollywood is just handing out money to anyone with a camera and the ability to speak. this movie was mind numbingly bad. the casting was terrible, the acting unspeakable, and the story filled with holes. script? who needs script? i was surprised that the movie wasn't as verbally vulgar as i thought it would be, however i got enough shots of t&a to last me a lifetime. the movie was like listening to a 19 year old street racer with add (who decided to buy a car instead of go to college) tell a story. being so poorly scripted, i thought the two brothers in the film were lovers at first. the scenes at the racetrack, along with the main female actor in the film kept making me think of herbie: fully loaded. this is the kind of film is what grindhouse modeled itself after...only the writers thought they were being serious.
