in my humble opinion, this version of the great bdwy musical has only two things going for it - tyne daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script. (ok vanessa williams is good to watch.)but to me that's all there is. most of the cast seem to be walking through the show - chynna phillips has no idea who kim really is and no wonder people walk over harry mcafee when it's played by george wendt who looks like he'd rather be back on a bar stool in boston. jason alexander is passable, but that wig has to go and i saw better dancing in bugsy malone. as i mentioned, it's good to have a version of the stage script now, but i hope the young out there, who have never seen a musical, don't judge them all by this.
