on the back burner for years (so it was reported) this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly - and went straight downhill from there. mary richards (mary tyler moore) and her best friend rhoda morgenstern (valerie harper) meet in new york after a long estrangement and catch up on each other's lives. what a novel concept! but, sad to relate, nothing worth talking about (let alone making a movie about) has happened to either of them in the intervening years. so, instead, the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another (most having to do with older women in the workplace), while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner. the supporting cast is instantly forgettable, the humor is nonexistent, and the chemistry which moore and harper once had together is gone. moore allegedly stalled this project for years, waiting for "just the right script" before committing herself. if this was the one she considered "right", what on earth were the ones she turned down like? it's not the age of the characters that does this in (for time inevitably marches on), but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work. at one time this was intended as a pilot but, all to obviously, it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors. or for that matter, among potential audiences. quickly and mercifully forgotten, the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic.
