quite possibly the worst movie that i have ever seen. when has hollywood ever made a successful movie that attacked republicans? why don't they learn. the dixie chicks haven't. these lefties live in their own elite bubble interacting among themselves; oblivious to the fact that most of america is much further right than they are.<br /><br />the best hollywood productions are not partisan and are rarely political at all.<br /><br />dan akroyd's imitation of cheney was bad.<br /><br />i would have thought cussack could have landed better movies.<br /><br />it wasn't funny.
