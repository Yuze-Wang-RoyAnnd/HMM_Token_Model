carnosaur 3: primal species (1996) d: jonathan winfrey. scott valentine, janet gunn, rick dean, anthony peck, rodger halston, terri j. vaughn, billy burnette. why even bother reviewing this movie? another stupid dinosaur movie in which top secret military guys discover those lethal (and very fake-looking) prehistoric monsters running around killing people in gory ways. the original was bad enough, the sequel was even worse. this falls somewhere in between, though unrelated to either of the previous carnosaur films. rating: 2 out of 10. rated r for graphic violence and gore, grisly images, and profanity.
