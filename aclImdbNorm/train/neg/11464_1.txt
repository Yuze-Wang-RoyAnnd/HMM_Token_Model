while i don't claim to be any sort of expert in marine life, i must say anyone with a modicum of intelligence could not possibly buy in to this notion of a whale (and not even the mother!) having a clue about revenge because it witnessed his dead mate having a forced abortion by humans! i mean, really! this is basically the whole plot. richard harris must have been extremely hard up for roles to have accepted this junk. this is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it, you would feel like demanding your money back.
