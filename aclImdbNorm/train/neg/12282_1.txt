this was one of the most boring "horror" movies that i have ever seen. a college kid has an epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at alcatraz. trying to deliver a mix of "nightmare on elm street" and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad 80s music video, this movie is jammed full of bad acting and an exhaustively slow moving story. although, being such a bad, and often laughable movie (dig those mullets and the terrible dialog), it would be good material to spoof on for an episode of mystery science theater 3000. don't be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the 1987 winner of the silver scroll award by the academy of sicence fiction, fanatasy, and horror, or that devo contributes to the soundtrack, or that tony basil has a part in the film. it is a giant disaster, though one with a small cult following (see the other imdb comments for this film).
