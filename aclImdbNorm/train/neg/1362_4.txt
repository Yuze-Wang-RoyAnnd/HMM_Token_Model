maggie smith and peter ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very not likable film at all.<br /><br />the film shows promise for ustinov is released from prison for embezzling. he convinces robert morley to go away so that he can assume his identity and begin hacking away at computers at a very fancy firm run by karl malden and bob newhart, another unusual duo for films.<br /><br />morley sounds just as he did in 1938's "marie antoinette." perhaps, he needed to return to that genre.<br /><br />this film is ridiculous at best. hard to believe that the following year, maggie smith totally changed her ways and gave a shattering oscar performance in "the prime of miss jean brodie."<br /><br />ms. smith is made out here to be an apparent dumb-red head, but by film's end, she is the brains of the outfit. too bad the writing didn't go the way with her.
