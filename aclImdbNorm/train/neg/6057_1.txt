could anyone please stop john carpenter from continuously and deliberately ruining his reputation? how low can you go? it seems this man has lost any self respect.<br /><br />this episode looks like it has been done by a film student, it isn't even worth beginning to talk about what was bad, because it was just a borefest, directed by somebody with no talent as a filmmaker or without any motivation...<br /><br />come on, mr. carpenter, please retire immediately with a rest of self-esteem and stop spilling out trash like this in a bad tradition from escape from l.a. to ghosts of mars.<br /><br />get drunk instead.
