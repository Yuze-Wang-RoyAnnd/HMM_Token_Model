i finally got to have a look at this experimental lynch short after waiting for so long....and unfortunately, it wasn't worth it! even for a die hard lynch fan, i found this to be really tedious....<br /><br />nothing happens, there are long, long, long painful pauses where nothing happens, long, monotonous speeches where nothing is said and the whole thing finishes with the viewer not knowing, or caring, what the hell it was all about, what happened before and what happened afterward. <br /><br />there was a mulholland drive allusion - the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very diane and rita -esque, and a lost highway moment with allusions to some significant event that happened but cannot be talked about clearly. <br /><br />unfortunately, it's all very uninteresting and very dull, nothing happens, it's very forgettable and i think i will delete it from my computer and forget i ever watched it. sorry david!
