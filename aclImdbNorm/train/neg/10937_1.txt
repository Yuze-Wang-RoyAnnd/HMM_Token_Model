every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people. if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie, how great will be my joy.<br /><br />where to begin my discussion of pain. for starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes. there was no character development. every character was a stereotype. we had swearing guy, fat guy who eats donuts, goofy foreign guy, etc. the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot. the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation. have the directors, producers, etc. ever even seen a movie before? halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry. the concept for this movie sounded so funny. how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors. but trust me when i say this, things went wrong, very wrong.
