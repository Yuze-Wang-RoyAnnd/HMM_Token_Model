the dialogue was pretty dreadful. the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents. not visually stunning. actually visually annoying at times. most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button. if you could watch it for free, have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady... well maybe i'd recommend it to you, but not anyone else i could think of at the moment.
