i thought this was a great idea but, boy, was it poorly executed. we do get a broad sense of how complex and challenging the backstage operations of a show are, but virtually no specifics about any of it works. the producers don't seem to have found any way to tell a story or give the viewer a "through-line." (which is not to say they didn't try, but having the stagehands relate a synopsis of the ring cycle as the program's narrative does nothing to tell us about the job of physically mounting an opera.)<br /><br />we see lots of things happening, but are told little about what it is that the people are doing and why. there's little sense of who is who, or how the various production departments fit and work together. for instance, several times we hear about a problem of some sort -- one expects then to see the problem and its consequences and/or how it gets resolved. but instead the filmmakers generally just cut to something else (generally, pretty generic footage of people pushing stuff or talking into headsets.) <br /><br />overall the film ends up feeling more like a pastiche of images that you'd see run under the closing credits of a show, rather than anything worth watching for its own merit.
