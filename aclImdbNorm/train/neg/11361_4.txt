it is pretty surreal what these flies can do... eh well... this is a cartoon, so anything can happen in it.<br /><br />at first i must tell you that i love animated movies. unfortunately this year's repertoire is very weak. this cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws:<br /><br />1) i quoted the tag line. it suggests that this movie has great 3d effects. well, i did not see any, at least not something special i never saw before.<br /><br />2) the "flies" in this movie look nothing like real flies. at least they could've make them black. but cyan flies, seriously? with giant heads and slim torsos?<br /><br />3) the story. i guess it was written for 6 year old kids. i could tell it in two sentences it is so over simplified.<br /><br />4) excessive patriotism. for example: "they are american files after all!" oh, give me a break.
