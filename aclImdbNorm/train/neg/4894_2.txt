redundant, everlasting shots, useless shots, useless scenes are what you will find in this film. in other words, it seemed technically poor to me. the musical bits are amateurishly directed (no synchronization in the would-be dancing, badly post-synchronized, bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time, etc). <br /><br />the film is long and boring. eventually, it makes few point and even less sense. <br /><br />there are some good ideas though. some of the comic elements are actually efficient, especially the opening scene. however, the film gets worse and worse so that it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand by the end. <br /><br />the trailer i saw was very dynamic, that is not true for the film. that is to say the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual film is something very close to a rip off.
