dolph lundgren stars as a former cop/boxer who searches boston's kinky scene to find out who killed his brother,who was well thought of in the community, however along the way he learns how his brother enjoyed kinky sex and that a serial killer is to blame. dolph lundgren is very good in this movie, in fact on the basis of his performance here, one would forget lundgren's rise to fame involved action roles. that said the material gives lundgren nothing to work with, in fact, lundgren is completely left out to dry in a dreary thriller which is both predictable and incomprehensible. co-star danielle brett is also good, in fact the film works best when it centers around the chemistry of lundgren and brett, indeed had the film taken the time to explore their relationship the film would've been fairly decent. however the movie is lackluster, the action is non-existent, the plot not given enough exploration (too much boring b.s around lundgren's investigation of his brother's employer) and the film is needlessly gory and ridiculous. once again, lundgren is actually really good (as is newcomer danielle brett) but the film just lumbers from one sequence to the next, which makes this movie particularly disappointing. if anything else though, it shows how underrated lundgren is, as an actor.<br /><br />*1/2 out of 4-(poor)
