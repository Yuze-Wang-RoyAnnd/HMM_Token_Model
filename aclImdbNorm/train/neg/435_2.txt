an old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies. you get your hitchcock, your chaplin, your bergman and some other stuff prior to the 80ies. to disguise that he has no clue what is going on in cinemas these days, he throws in the matrix.<br /><br />but it's not only the same lame film-as-art speech all over again. this speech is reduced to outdated psychological platitudes: it-ego-super ego, anal phase, sexual insufficiency. <br /><br />it is garnished with the cheesy effect of having zizte edited into the movies he is taking about. for someone who is supposed to know much about movies, his own is, cinematographicly speaking: yeiks.<br /><br />to put it in zizek's own words - i saw 5\-\!7 on the screen, last night, or in the words of a great movie maker:<br /><br />mr. (zizek), what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard. at no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. i award you (two) points (only), and may god have mercy on your soul.
