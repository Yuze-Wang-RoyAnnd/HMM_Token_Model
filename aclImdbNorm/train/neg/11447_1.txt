quite possibly the worst movie i've ever seen; i was ready to walk out after the first ten minutes. the only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners. don't get me wrong, i love silly, stupid movies just as much as the next gal, but the whole premise, writing and humor stunk. it seemed to me that they were going for a "napoleon dynamite" feel - strange and random scenes which would lead to a cult audience. instead, it ended up being forced, awkward and weird.<br /><br />the only bright light was isla fisher and i just felt utterly awful that she (and sissy spacek) had signed up for this horrible thing.<br /><br />thank gosh i didn't pay for it.
