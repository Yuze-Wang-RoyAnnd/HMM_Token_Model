for me every piece of art is to be judged by these criteria: form, function and meaning. guernsey seems to be dedicated to forms: nice shots and sometimes interesting acting. the long close ups suggest a function that the viewer may fill in by himself. because of lacking texts the story becomes a quiz. an introvert person suggests to have depth, but sometimes it turns out he has nothing to say. this film acts like an introvert person. if you have not read the synopsis you cannot see that it was the suicide (and the unanswered question why?) that changes anna's view on life and makes her suspicious. 'why don't you speak to me?' asks sebastiaan. anna doesn't answer, she only starts looking a long time at him without saying a word. what is the function of that shot? what does it mean? my question is like sebastiaans: what has this film to say? what is meant by this movie? the answer for me: it shows us a handful of persons with the passion of a glass of water. the story of their lives is simple and boring. motives behind their actions are not shown. the rest is: skins, residences, landscapes. nice and artistic done, but meaningless without having disposal of 'instructions for use'. in my opinion this film is made for fellow artists, not for the common viewer.
