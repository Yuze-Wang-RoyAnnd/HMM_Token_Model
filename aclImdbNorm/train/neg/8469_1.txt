"kids like these" could have been a decent film, given the subject matter. but instead it has become a below-average, run-of-the-mill tv-movie of the week, with not much going for it. the acting is stale, the plot predictable and the direction non-existent. for a better movie on the same subject, try the excellent "le huiti`eme jour", a film that really cares about the people with down-syndrome. in "kids like these" they are merely used as an excuse for weepy sentimentality. pretty appalling. 1/10
