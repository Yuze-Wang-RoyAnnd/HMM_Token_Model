well i guess i know the answer to that question. for the money! we have been so bombarded with cat in the hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie. i admit, i thought the trailers looked bad, but i still had to give it a chance. well i should have went with my instincts. it was a complete piece hollywood trash. once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good. aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it obviously started with a moth eaten script. it's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor, and awful pastel sceneries. it jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction. this is then compounded with, ............................yes i'll say it, bad acting! i couldn't help but feel like i was watching "coffee talk" on snl every time mike myers opened his mouth. was the cat intended to be a middle aged jewish woman? spencer breslin and dakota fanning were no prize either, but mr. myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another austin powers movie. f-, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. save your money!
