for those looking for a sequel for the fine south african miniseries of the 1980s, this isn't it. nor is it a historical drama. rather, it is a dreary little fantasy which has nothing to do with the historical shaka, but merely uses his name to give a certain cachet to sinclair's idiotic story about an african superhero who is a combination of jesus, lincoln, superman, and nelson mandela.<br /><br />on the other hand, there are a few laugh-out-loud moments, as when shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained and kicks some serious slaver butt. you know, like jesus would have done if he hadn't been such a wimp.<br /><br />true, i saw only the 98-minute version, but i can't imagine that twice as much of this crap would have been better.<br /><br />and what kind of a name is mungo?!
