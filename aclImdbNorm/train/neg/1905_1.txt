i am one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and have probably reviewed more buster keaton films for imdb than any other person. every film he made from the beginning of his career to the early 30s with only two exceptions have i reviewed, so you can tell i am a major fan. it's because of this that i found this episode so painful and hard to watch. i loved this man's films and kept thinking "buster, how could you?!". well, now that i think about it, i guess i can see why buster keaton starred in this god-awful episode of the twilight zone. he'd lost much of his fortune after a messy divorce in the early 1930s and his film career as a leading man was long passed as well. now, in the 1960s, keaton needed the money and loved his resurgence in popularity so he whored himself out to anyone willing to pay--appearing in beach films and this mess of an episode of a great series.<br /><br />the biggest problem with the episode is that it is just terribly written and buster deserved much better. the show is supposed to be funny but isn't and instead of a homage to silent films is just painful to watch--particularly with keaton putting that stupid time travel helmet on as well as all the poorly executed slapstick. do yourself a favor, skip this one--it's a pale imitation of the greatness that once was keaton's career!!!
