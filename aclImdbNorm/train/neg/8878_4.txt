judy holliday struck gold in 1950 withe george cukor's film version of "born yesterday," and from that point forward, her career consisted of trying to find material good enough to allow her to strike gold again.<br /><br />it never happened. in "it should happen to you" (i can't think of a blander title, by the way), holliday does yet one more variation on the dumb blonde who's maybe not so dumb after all, but everything about this movie feels warmed over and half hearted. even jack lemmon, in what i believe was his first film role, can't muster up enough energy to enliven this recycled comedy. the audience knows how the movie will end virtually from the beginning, so mostly it just sits around waiting for the film to catch up.<br /><br />maybe if you're enamored of holliday you'll enjoy this; otherwise i wouldn't bother.<br /><br />grade: c
