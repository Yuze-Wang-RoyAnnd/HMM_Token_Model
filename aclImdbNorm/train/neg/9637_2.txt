boy, this was one lousy movie! while i haven't seen all of the burton/taylor collaborations, i can say with confidence that this is the worst. this rich but ill woman (taylor, of course) owns this beautiful island in the meditteranean, ruling over a put-upon staff when she's suddenly visited by this traveling poet, who mouths platitudes. in fact, the whole film is just a talk fest, with much of the talk making no sense. even in 1968, no one could make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense, and the passage of time makes that even more clear. if it weren't for the beautiful cinematography and scenery, it would deserve a negative rating. the only thing this film is good for is its unintentional laughs at the expense of the stars.
