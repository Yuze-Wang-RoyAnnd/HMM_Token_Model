i watched the unrated version of this film and realised about 30 minutes into it that i was never getting my time back. i persevered to the end hoping that the dialogue would improve, the martial arts would look realistic eventually, the special fx would actually look special. i was so wrong. i love horror, i am a complete gore hound. i number some of the eighties splatter flicks amongst the greats of the film world. this however was not made in the eighties, if this film had come out in the early eighties the fax could be forgiven for looking so bad. it wasn't so it hasn't got that defence. the dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines i was wincing at the writing rather than squirming at torture. i don't like hostel, never have, i thought it was over rated, over hyped and i felt nothing for the protagonists, however it shines as a beacon to greatness next to this garbage. the back of the cover for live feed promised a twist you would never see coming, i'm still waiting for the twist that was promised.
