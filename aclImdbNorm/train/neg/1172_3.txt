every so often a movie comes along that knocks me down a notch and reminds me that my taste in films i seek out to watch isn't always impeccable. i normally would stay away from stuff like this, but i was duped by some glowing reviews and the rohmer pedigree.<br /><br />there's an initial and intriguing novelty to the production where rohmer essentially superimposes the actors onto painted (digital) back-drops of revolution era france. this quickly wanes and becomes about as interesting as watching the paint dry on a paint by numbers scene. what we're left with is a boring and stuffy film about aristocrats in 18th century france. none of the characters are appealing or sympathetic. the pace is so languid, the dialogue so arduous, and suspense is clearly a foreign concept to rohmer, that i ended up not caring whose head rolled, who was harboring who, or what the devil the revolution was supposed to be about. the movie would've greatly benefited from some semblance of emotional build-up and a music score (there's some fine classical music used at the very end). despite being so "talky", the film plays much like a silent film, and the worst kind of film at that, a dull and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting subjects. only the most astute french historians will find anything to take from this film, as it dose seem to paint well known events from a new angle (the lady is english and a royalist). otherwise, avoid this yawner at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia (i dozed off twice).
