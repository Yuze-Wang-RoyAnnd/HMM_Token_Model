well, on the endless quest for horror, we will come across this film, apparently re-released on dvd recently for some ungodly reason. the transfer is awful and the quality just sucks. i don't think this is due to a bad remaster or anything, i just think the film is poorly done.<br /><br />obviously filmed at an abandoned school with a budget that was no doubt wasted on cheap beer and no talent hacks, "slaughter high" starts out slow and doesn't pick up pace until about an hour in. first, we get to see a 'nerd' as he is picked on by a group of...i actually don't even know what they were supposed to be...jocks? the ringleader, with his ultra hooknose is so ugly he should have definitely been cast as the nerd. then, there is a 'big guy' and a couple of dumb losers and chicks who are supposed to be 'hot' but aren't. it's a mystery why this group of rejects is picking on one of their own, but i guess the viewer is to assume these are 'cool kids' picking on a dweeb. the casting choices are horrendous as most of the high schoolers are played by thirty-somethings. as other reviewers on here have pointed out, the actors (if you can call them that,) are a bunch of brits whose accents slip out numerous times throughout this piece of crap. we are left to assume that this group of 'children' were the only students at this school, as their 'reunion' is only them at the school, which is now shown to be abandoned, is just them.<br /><br />the kills are lame, the gore is not great and the script is like scooby doo with real people; lines like: 'this place gives me the creeps...' and 'someone gimme a beer' are highlights...it's just not good. skip this one unless you are getting wasted with some friends and wanna laugh at a real lame attempt at a slasher. if you wanna see good, get bava's "bay of blood," done 14 years earlier and a heck of a lot better. if you wanna see a good bad slasher, see "just before dawn" or "the burning." 2 out of 10, kids.
