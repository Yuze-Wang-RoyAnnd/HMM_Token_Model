tromaville high has become an amoral wasteland of filth thanks to the aftereffects of the nearby nuclear plant's accidental release of toxic waste.<br /><br />unrestrained chaos crammed with absurd violence and crude behavior. rather horrible, obviously intended to be, mess of a film with the filmmakers cutting loose the reins allowing the untalented cast free reign to ham it up. craft was far down troma's list of objectives for this gory sleazefest. the honor society are punks with eerie face paint jobs and wacky outfits. the german teacher who becomes a member, through a "toxic kiss" has the streaks down one side of her face that really gave me the creeps.the toxic monster, which dispatched the annoying punks towards the end, is pretty cool, though.<br /><br />kind of movie trash connoisseurs will embrace wholeheartedly.
