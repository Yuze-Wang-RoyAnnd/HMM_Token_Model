i was not entirely impressed by this film. it was originally named sin eater and should have stayed that way considering that is all that was talked about for the last half of the film. i'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the film had to do with any of the rest of it. it was very slow and what was with picking robocop (peter weller) as one of the main actors. that was a sad point.<br /><br />all in all i would say check this out if you are into things dealing with the catholic religion but don't expect an exorcist or stigmata from this film. it will surely flop after a few days and word gets out.
