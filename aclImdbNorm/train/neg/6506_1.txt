unless you are geeky film student who has to see everything, this film will not only be a waste of your time and money and a huge disappointment, but it will also make you angry beyond belief.<br /><br />there might be a story worth telling somewhere inside, but hopkins decided to hide it and encode under so many incessant chaotic layers of apparently random audio video microcuts, making the viewer's patience run thin after a very short while.<br /><br />why would someone like hopkins choose such a heavy, most difficult and highly unstable project as his first script, first score and third film can by anyones guess. maybe he played with it in his mind for such a long time until it became unrecognizable as what it became, not even for himself. the result proves that he has by far not enough experience or skill to achieve the desired result.<br /><br />even the weirdest carpenter and lynch films, to name just two uncoventional filmmakers, had 90% more coherence, 95% less characters and 99% more story flow.<br /><br />sir anthony you aimed for the stars, but unfortunately missed by a couple of light years. please stick to acting, in that department you are a unequaled giant and nobody should ask more from you, not even yourself!
