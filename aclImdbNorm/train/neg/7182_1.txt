i couldn't not recommend a christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drivel (trust me, double negatives are required here -- it's that bad). this film was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter. the musical numbers are all far too long and none of them any good ("thank you very much" has a decent melody, but the lyrics are stupid beyond words). i would gladly bear the chains worn by scrooge in the film's bizarre hell sequence than sit through this insult to movie musicals again.<br /><br />the only entertaining part of this movie (completely unintentional by the way) involves alec guinness as jacob marley. dressed in a silly powder white costume, guinness foppishly prances through his scenes in what was either an attempt to make it appear as though he was floating like a ghost, or to show his utter disdain with having to be in this dreadful movie. albert finney, meanwhile, blends the best of alistar sim and charles laughton to create his hopelessly loathsome character of quasimodo/scrooge. finney's scrooge is so hideous a person, it's impossible to believe his transformation.<br /><br />steer clear of this abomination of filmmaking at all costs.
