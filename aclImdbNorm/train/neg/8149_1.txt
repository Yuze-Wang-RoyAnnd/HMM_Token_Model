what an absolute pile of pants. having read chris brookmyre's books religiously since i came across "quite ugly...", i was delighted to find out that this drama had been commissioned.<br /><br />i obviously had too much faith. <br /><br />nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and even he doesn't quite fit. how anyone can read the book, and then adapt it to this piece of dross is beyond me.<br /><br />entire characters are changed, situations are dropped, and to see parlablane's dramatic break-in reduced to nesbitt doing a quick chin up and sliding open a bay window... it brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />i dread to think what's going to happen with "country of the blind" if this is the benchmark...<br /><br />please, just avoid it...
