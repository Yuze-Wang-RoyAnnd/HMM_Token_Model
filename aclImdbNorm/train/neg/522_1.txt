about 15 minutes in, my wife was already wanting to leave. not so much because of the material, but the lack thereof. they decided to fill in the blanks where the funny stuff should've been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could. when this would let up (very rare), we'd sit back and watch (not laughing, mind you) and wait for the next gross-out or offensive remark(s). after about 35 minutes, we both got up and left. everything we'd read said how great this was. the trailer looked good and roger ebert actually called it "intelligent" and said it wasn't a crude sex comedy. did he go to the right movie? along with be cool, it's the only other movie i've ever walked out on...and i have no regrets. i'm sick of trying to go see comedies in america.
