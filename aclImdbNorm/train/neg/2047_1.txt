i don't want to go off on a rant here, but.....this is the worst "film" i've ever seen. worse than the avengers. incompetent directing, disjointed writing, and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout. shot on very cheap video, it looks like a high school project, but without the emotion. the lighting frequently looks like a single sun-gun. the sound is slightly better than a single mic on the camera, but everything else about this thing is just awful. the plot heads off in strange directions with no foundation or later resolution, the techie elements are patently absurd, and the editing looks worse than a rough cut. it's not even bad enough to be funny. it's just bad. btw, the packaging is intentionally misleading.<br /><br />lion's gate owes me $4.00.
