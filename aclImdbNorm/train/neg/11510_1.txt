it's not my fault. my girlfriend made me watch it.<br /><br />there is nothing positive to say about this film. there has been for many years an idea that madonna could act but she can't. there has been an idea for years that guy ritchie is a great director but he is only middling. an embarrassment all round. <br /><br />
