predictable parody, just about failed to impress throughout it's looooooong eight minutes. the only thing that made it worthwhile was the do not colorize line at the end credits. shame something more entertaining wasn't put on the dvd, like jonathan ross' enjoyable profile of romero on 'the incredible strange film show.'
