i am very tolerant of really bad sci/fi and horror movies - i've been watching them since i was 4 or 5, so i've seen some really bad stuff, but i deal with it. i've even watched a lot of scifi channel movies so i know not to expect much - a usually promising movie that has no ending to speak of. hope springs eternal, i guess - or the triumph of hope over experience, as they say. unfortunately, this is a dog right from the beginning and i knew it, but like a moth to the flame, i kept thinking something, anything, interesting would happen. it doesn't. all of the actors give a decent performance - given the script, i don't know how they all kept straight faces. it has something to do with collagen-starved worm parasite creatures who are slowly taking over the human race, one body at a time. there's an evil plastic surgeon who collaborates with the enemy by giving them the outward appearance of humans...don't worry, he gets what's coming to him. the slug people themselves don't really know where they came from, they think they might have thumbed a ride on a meteor that landed on earth, but...somehow they know about the members of slug royalty among them - the slug princess has managed to breed with a human being who knows that she's the worm queen and loves her for her self...oh, must i go on? please, i implore you, do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this...anything would be better...think of the worst, least enjoyable way you can spend two hours...it would be better than this.
