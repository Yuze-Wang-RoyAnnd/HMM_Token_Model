you gotta love the cheesy low budget movies. this one comes complete with bad effects, props and bad acting (really bad). plus, every time i see mercedes mcnab (the sister) i keep thinking 'watch out! she's a vamp!"- for those that know buffy/angel.<br /><br />a perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick, the little that was spent of course. i don't know if i feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didn't make back any money.<br /><br />i'd say it's good for little kids in it's simplicity, but i don't know if i'd want to subject a kid to it...<br /><br />umm...1/10 because that's the lowest it will go.
