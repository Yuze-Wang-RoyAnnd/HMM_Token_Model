there may something poetically right in seeing dentists suffer. suffer they do, in this dreary, truly dreadful film, but they cause the audience to undergo pain of the non-dental variety too. if you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids, barfing kids, sick kids, lots of long, long meaningful glances, a deadpan wife and a concerned husband: it's all here for you. boring, overlong, it stands out as one of those examples that scream out: why? is there a saving grace? yes, there is. there is a short scene from nabucco, with some pretty good singing. save your money, or if it's on tv or cable, save your time. you can always read a book or make an omelette.
