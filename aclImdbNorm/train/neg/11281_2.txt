i have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as i personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film....the road side bar scene in russia. in this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - "50 dollars..you drink and talk", but i felt that my polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing russian accent than i could, so i declined to take this speaking part on. i was slightly starstruck as this was my first film experience....and who knows... these lines could have ended up there with lines such as "i'll be back" and "quite frankly my dear, i don't give a damn". had i spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of rancid aluminium as 'heavy 1' instead of the name of ryszard janikowski. <br /><br />as time goes on, i am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film.<br /><br />even though i spent a whole day on the set, in south wales hot-spot barry island, no one could tell me what the actual storyline was. the caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it..... things could certainly have been worse if i'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films....<br /><br />still.....on the positive side....i got chatting to rhys ifans during one break. i had no idea who he was, as "notting hill" was yet to be released, and not an inkling that he might be welsh. made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit barry island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. it was only when keith allen showed up that i realised i was in a quality production........
