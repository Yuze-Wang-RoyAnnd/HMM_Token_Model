this was a weird movie. it started out pretty good. a solid sound track behind flash images of gore and mayhem as our psychopath did his thing.<br /><br />next comes his "down fall" here i could tell i was in for a real cheesy "b" movie. poor acting , i mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop? these guys could not. after the death scene of our psychopath we get the opening credit and the movie starts...<br /><br />from this point on it is bad acting big boobs, the occasional bucket of blood and poorly done death scenes.<br /><br />that said i gave the movie a four because in spite of its flaws it did maintain a sort of creepiness that i just could not quite shake off.<br /><br />i do not recommend this movie but i have to admit i have seem worse.
