ok, the box looks promising. whoopi goldberg standing next to danny glover parodying the famous farmer and his wife painting. then you pop this baby in the dvd player and all hope is lost in less then five minutes. supposed to be a comedy. and i must admit i did laugh once about ten minutes before the ending. this movie has the following elements: a battered and abused next door neighbor, a boring legal trial, racisim, talk of lynchings, and death and arson. hilarious, huh? no, please, if you never listen to anyone's reviews, please do here. you cannot even force yourself to watch this crap. crap! i said it, crap! whoever put there name on this should indeed sue.
