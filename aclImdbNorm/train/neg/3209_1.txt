i also saw this amazingly bad piece of "anime" at the london sci-fi festival. if you have to watch this thing, do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers, you may then glean some enjoyment from it. <br /><br />i found the dialogue hilarious, lodged in my mind is the introduction of cremator. the animation is awful. it is badly designed and badly executed. it may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour blind.<br /><br />there's nothing else to say really, this film is a failure on every level.
