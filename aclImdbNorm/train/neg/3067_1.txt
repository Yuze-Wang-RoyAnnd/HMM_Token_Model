this is just plain bad. sometimes remakes, even if they stray from the original, are good on their own. they can bring another viewpoint and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable. this was as poorly thought out and carried out as can be. this wasn't any good even standing on it's own. viggo mortenson is a top-notch actor, but some of his selections of roles and projects leaves something to be desired. the original "vanishing point" was such a thrilling, psychological adventure; this is not an adventure at all, and is not enjoyable or entertaining whatsoever. this was made from a by-the-numbers approach to film-making, stuffing in plot points that someone in hollywood believes will please what they see as today's film-going audience. basically, they see us as a bunch of idiots. it's insulting that someone will put this out as a feature film, and even attempt to remake a cult classic this sloppily. the manipulative plot devices, the "make-it-obvious-so-they-don't-miss-the-point" aspects, ridiculous dialogue, stereotyped characters, amateurish direction...<br /><br />this is plain bad....
