i'm a big fan of the tv series largo winch. this movie was pain for me. i had to use fast forward not to fell to sleep. it was boring! how can somebody ruin this title so much? the story was the only good thing. actors were sh.t. they can't live the role. the main actor(tom ... ) is a null. watch the other roles of this actor. the fighting scenes were unbelievable boring and not to followable,somehow they were not to follow the situation. like other reviewer said low budget film with bad actors.maybe next time somebody else can do better thing out of this title. french can't do right thing with big films,like alien 4. that was bit brrr, after alien 1,2,3.
