i went to see this a few days ago, and it's hard to forget that film...for the wrong reasons. this film is supposed to be funny, it's not, not a single laugh in the theatre( perhaps for jos'e garcia and g'erard depardieu ), and it's boring, boring, boring. it was even hard sometimes to understand what they were saying. they just talk to fast and don't open their enough for us to understand. i was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times i caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be funny " what, what did he say", and i'm french. i hate to say that, given the fact that i think good films are made here, but i apologise in advance for all foreigners who will go see the film ( if ever shown outside of france ).<br /><br />we're deeply sorry for that cr@p. 2/10
