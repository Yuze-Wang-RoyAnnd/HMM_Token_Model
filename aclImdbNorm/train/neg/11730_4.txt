investigative reporter darren mcgavin (as carl kolchak) is back; this time, he's after "the night strangler". once again, police officials and fellow journalists either disbelieve, or want to cover-up, the supernatural angle. producer-director dan curtis presents the same basic story as his preceding "night", with understandably less success.<br /><br />mr. curtis assembles a fun supporting cast, included are "dark shadows" alumni george dicenzo and ivor francis. jo ann pflug (as louise harper) heads up a sexy collection of belly-dancers. and, although i've never seen it mentioned anywhere, that must be roger davis as mr. mcgavin's dining companion in an early scene, feigning disbelief in the existence of vampires! <br /><br />**** the night strangler (1/16/73) dan curtis ~ darren mcgavin, jo ann pflug, simon oakland, wally cox
