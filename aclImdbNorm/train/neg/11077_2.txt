the only reason i elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of oscar winner ernest borgnine. all i can say is, it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film. as far as i could tell, borgnine was the only actor in it. the other performances were so uniformly terrible, i am amazed a studio would actually pay the "performers" to appear. couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that i thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled, and you have a perfect cinematic disaster. obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children, and to its credit, it was better than most of the original programing on the disney channel and similar kid-focused networks. but honestly, that is not saying much.
