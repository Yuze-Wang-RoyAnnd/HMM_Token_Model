for all its visual delights, how much better renaissance would have been in live action. the animation is fantastic in the big picture, yes, but the characters are cold and hollow, much like the story and the style of this film. with real actors, perhaps the world of the film would not have felt so lifeless. there is much to admire here, but at the end i found that all i could do was admire. i did not enjoy the movie that much, and it clarifies something that i did not see before: that the visual elements can be the defining positive aspect of a film, but without a good story and strong characters, it can all be for nothing. i will not go so far as to say that this movie comes to nothing, but sometimes it comes dangerously close. i love dark sci-fi thrillers. blade runner and dark city are two films i thought were wonderful. but blade runner had its tragic villain and dark city had its thought-provoking story arc. renaissance has shadow and light, but little else. i wish i could have liked this movie more, but the weak story and the empty characters stood in the way of that. the renaissance was a historical and artistic burst of color and life. how ironic, then, that one of the most bleak and lifeless movies i've seen this year takes its title from the renaissance.
