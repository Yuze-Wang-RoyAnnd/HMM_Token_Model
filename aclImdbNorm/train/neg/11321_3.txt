you can't really go far when the initial story isn't all that great. the premise of cyborg's needing blood is just dopey.<br /><br />the script is blas'e'. the actors don't have much to work with. the sets were staged out in the desert to cut costs. it's a trademark that if the background is the desert, then the movie has no budget.<br /><br />lack of budget is okay, if there's a story. "solarbabies" and "blood of champions" are examples of decent work from no $. but this movie looks as if they had to scrape their change together just to buy the cameraman a sandwich. again, forgivable if only the story didn't just plain suck.<br /><br />finally, this movie commits the biggest crime of all: it doesn't finish! it simply ends as if it's a commercial break away from the rest of the movie. but the rest never comes. just odd.<br /><br />just bad.
