lucy alexis liu and cillian murphy are both excellent actors, who can certainly rise to any acting challenge put to them.<br /><br />unfortunately 'watching the detectives (2007)' offers only one to both actors and audience alike: not to fall asleep during a mind-numbingly boring, very predictable and unimaginative story.<br /><br />'watching the detectives (2007)' tries very hard to be funny, but the comedy is forced, extremely poorly directed and embarrassing to the verge of complete ridicule.<br /><br />after a third of the film still nothing that may capture even the most willing audience, like the director's friends and relatives, is even hinted at, not to mention actually happening.<br /><br />i'm pretty sure everybody who liked it faked it or had to fake it like neil's ex-girlfriend did when he showed her an old b&w film she couldn't care less about. 'watching the detectives (2007)' is nowhere near category b, it falls somewhere between q & r, like -questions? and -repress the questions! the director knows what he's doing! well, if his goal was to bore the viewer to death, he has done a very good job!<br /><br />'watching the detectives (2007)' was a complete waste of time for lucy alexis liu and cillian murphy, bur please don't let it be a waste of your time!<br /><br />rating: 0 out of 100.
