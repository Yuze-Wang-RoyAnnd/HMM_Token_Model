what a powerful start to a film when julia roberts character is punched in the face by her abusive and anal husband played by patrick bergin and i felt ready to experience a powerful film on the same level as farrah fawcett's the burning bed. well, as the summary says i was mis-lead. this film was nothing like the burning bed, which had power and farrah played the part of a woman you truly felt for, and felt her pain and her need to survive. sleeping with the enemy drifted off after the first act into cheap thrills with roberts faking her death to escape her husband and goes to live in iowa. her husband at first believes she is dead but starts to grow suspicious that she may still be alive and sets off after her. the rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game with julia getting a house in this small town in iowa and changing her identity....there is no mention of course how she got the money for this but at this point in the film i did not care all that much. she meets a guy (mr. nice wimpy) and falls for him and her husband does finally catch up to her but not before he re-arranges her soup cans and straightens up the kitchen. this was i assume to provide a cheap thrill to the audience. but i did not care much if she was an abused wife because the film as i have said cheated the audience. if it had stayed the course i might have felt for her and her situation. of course the husband is killed and all is well for little ol ms roberts. if only the real world was anything close to this....see the burning bed and you understand what a film is suppose to be like on the subject of domestic abuse.
