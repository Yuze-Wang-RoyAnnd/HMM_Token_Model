horror spoofs are not just a thing of the 21st century. way before the 'scary movie' series there were a few examples of this genre, mostly in the 80s. but like said franchise most of these films are hit or miss. some like 'elvira, mistress of the dark' mostly rise above that, but other like 'saturday the 14th' and it's sequel fail to deliver the laughs. but out of all these types of films there is one particularly big offender and that's 'transylvania 6-5000,' a major waste of time for many reasons.<br /><br />pros: a great cast that does it's best. some of the dopey humor is amusing. a corny, but catch theme song. some good transylvanian locations.<br /><br />cons: threadbare plot. mostly tedious pacing. most of the humor just doesn't cut it. the monsters are given little to do and little screen time. i thought this was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies? lame ending that will likely make viewers angry.<br /><br />final thoughts: this is a comedy? if it is then why are the really funny bits so few and far in between? comedies are supposed to make us roll on the floor, not roll our eyes and yawn, aching for it to be over. i can't believe anchor bay released this tired junk. i'll admit it's not one of the worst films ever made, but it's not worth anyone's time or money even if you're a fan of any of the actors. see 'transylvania twist' instead.<br /><br />my rating: 2/5
