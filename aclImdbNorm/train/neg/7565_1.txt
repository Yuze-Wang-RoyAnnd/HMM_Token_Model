this movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that i've spent in a very, very long time. if you knew how often i went to the movies you'd probably say, that's hard to imagine, but never-the-less, it's true! after seeing the trailer for this movie, i knew that i had to see it! if you're a fan of horror, mystery, and suspense, why wouldn't you? the trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting; unfortunately, the movie is none of these.<br /><br />from the cinematography, to the script, to the acting, this movie is a complete flop. if you're reading this, planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills, mystery, action, horror, or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes i'm afraid you are in for disappointment.<br /><br />"why is it so bad," you might be asking yourself. let me tell you. the movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful. nothing about the movie made me the least bit "on edge," frightened, or curious. the script was at best laughable. there were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous i began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasn't. the acting was absolutely dreadful. i like nicholas cage but this was a miss. without exception, every performance in this movie was incredibly below average. the cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique. finally, the story is completely transparent. you can see the end of this movie coming a mile away.<br /><br />i am not usually a very harsh critic. frankly, when i go to see a comedy i want to laugh and when i go to see a mystery/suspense/horror, i just want to be surprised. this movie was boring, poorly acted, poorly written, and an overwhelming disappointment. do yourself a favor and go see something else.
