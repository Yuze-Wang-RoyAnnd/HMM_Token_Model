jesus christ, i can't believe i've wasted my time watching this movie. i only watched because i have such a crush on jordan ladd. but watching this film almost put me off her. this is absolutely awful! i could have been watching survivor series 93 over this.<br /><br />the lead guy in this was so bland and generic. i would love it if the great mistuharu misawa tiger drove '91'd his ass through a glass window. i was enraging every time he was saying "lake" and "cabin". i'd kick his ass.<br /><br />jordan ladd, on the other hand, was absolutely wonderful. a true angel. but she couldn't even save this utter joke of a film. sadly, she couldn't even act like she was off her nut when she took that truth drug. it looked hilarious.<br /><br />i also loved the bit where jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her. it reminded me of a time where...nevermind.<br /><br />anayways, do watch this film because of it's awfulness.
