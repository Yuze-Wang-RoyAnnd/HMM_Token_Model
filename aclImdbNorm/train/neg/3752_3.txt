i grew up watching and loving tng. i just recently finished watching the entire series st voyager on dvd, which may have heightened my sense of disgust with this episode, as the difference in style and approach between the two shows couldn't be more stark. the idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand riker's character, which is how it probably would have been treated on voy. they could have featured memories that would be "new" to the audience, rather than simply regurgitating old show clips. the in and out transitions between the "memories" and the "present" in this episode start as clich'e in the beginning, and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern wears on and on. bar none- worst episode ever.
