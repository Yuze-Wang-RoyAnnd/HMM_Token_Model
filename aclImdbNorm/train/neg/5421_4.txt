this is one of those topics i can relate to a little more than most people as i hate noise & have no idea how those in big cities, new york especially how people get any sleep at all! it astounds me that people can stand all the noise out there these days. the basic plot of the film is that it makes for an interesting topic. it's too bad that's about it. tim robbbins is decent although except for a couple of scenes (especially with the absolute supermodel looking margarita leiveva) he didn't seem to really be altogether there. my biggest hope for this film is that casting agents will see the absolutely stunning & talented actress to boot, margarita levieva. she doesn't have a lot to do, but she is supermodel beautiful. even when they are trying to make her look at more girl next door. it makes me sad that there can be people such as paris hilton & kim kardashian in the world w/no redeemable skills or talent, to have more fame and success than this talented beauty. i didn't care for much of this film because the script isn't very good, but am glad i got to see some new talent. i hope that producers & directors think about margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be in there big budget film. if they can make megan fox a star (c'mon she isn't that hot, & her acting "talent" is worse than made-for disney channel tv shows) from 1 film, it should happen easily for her, as she is gorgeous & has talent! i'd recommend her changing her last name so we can pronounce it and make it more marketable. here's hoping this makes her career, & if there is any justice she can pop up on some big summer movie or two in the next couple years.
