this waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great film. nothing new or original is added other than perry's backflashes, which are of marginal interest. it lacks the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective. also painfully missing is the sharp quincy jones soundtrack that added to much to the original film. i can't understand any high ratings for this at all. it's quite bad. why does anyone waste time or money making crap like this and why did i waste time watching it?
