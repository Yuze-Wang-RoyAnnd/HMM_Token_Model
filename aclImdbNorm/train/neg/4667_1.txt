visually cluttered, plot less, incredibly mind-numbing rubbish. not even close to greenaway's better work. avoid at all costs!<br /><br />the overlapping 'split screen' effects do nothing more than confuse, the film is very dark for a lot of the time and the 'artistic' composing of images is pretentious in the extreme.<br /><br />there is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film; even the nudity is incredibly unerotic, which seeing it fills a large part of the film soon gets very boring.<br /><br />plus, how anyone can say that the acting of ewen macgregor is brilliant is beyond me. he showed more ability in the star wars series, and that's saying something.<br /><br />i've not been so unimpressed with a film since i saw 'darby o'gill and the little people'!
