this wasn't funny in 1972. it's not funny now.<br /><br />unlike a lot of other people, i'm not bashing the film because it is incredibly sexist - i quote enjoyed that bit, or rather i enjoyed the reaction it generates in annoying pc people - i'm bashing it because it is poorly written and acted.<br /><br />the only really memorable character is blakey, which british people 25 years old will recognise immediately since he was a favourite with impressionists for a long time.<br /><br />avoid.<br /><br />
