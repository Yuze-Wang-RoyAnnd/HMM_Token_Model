the plot is about a female nurse, named anna, is caught in the middle of a world-wide chaos as flesh-eating zombies begin rising up and taking over the world and attacking the living. she escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer. so far, so good! i usually enjoy horror movies, but this piece of film doesn't deserve to be called horror. it's not even thrilling, just ridiculous.even "the flintstones" or "kukla, fran and ollie" will give you more excitement. it's like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to get into a shopping mall to by more liquor. the heroes who has locked themselves in, inside the shopping-mall to avoid being eaten by the hoodlums outside, are not better either. even though they doesn't seem to be drunk, they give the impression of being mentally disabled. save your money instead of spending it on this!
