if you want an undemanding and reasonably amusing hour or so, then it's ok to watch this. it's not all that bad, really. yeah, it's got more lapses in logic than i care to describe here and might tax the patience of people - like myself, i have to admit - who are inclined to throw things at the tv on occasion, but it's funny at least. just because it's not always intentionally funny, there's no need to let that get you down.<br /><br />however, if you've read the book - or any of the other books by brookmyre - then you'd probably best avoid it. i've read them all and when i first watched this film, i despised it. i've trashed it in detail and at great length on another site, in fact. the tv plot bears practically no relevance at all to that of the book and served only to outrage and infuriate many faithful (and admittedly rabid) brookmyre fans.<br /><br />best bit of advice..? watch this, then read the book and only then make your comparisons and submit your judgement.
