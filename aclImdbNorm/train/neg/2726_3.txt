considering its pedigree, this should be a far more enjoyable film than it is. even with a lip-smacking collection of eccentrics in the cast - what aficionado would not eagerly anticipate a movie which brings together lemmon, lanchester, kovacs and gingold? - the entire event is dully paced, drearily shot and, more often than not, witless.<br /><br />kim novak's gifts were not essentially comic, as she went on to confirm in kiss me stupid. james stewart was a fine comedian, as he ably demonstrated in movies from ranging from the philadelphia story to harvey. i think he comes out better from this mess than anyone else does. except maybe the cat.
