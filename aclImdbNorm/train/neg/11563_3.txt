this italian semi-horror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good, that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes. the only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film. the story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon, go berserk and seemingly kill them. they show the nudity, but they never really show the murders at this point in the film. then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her. he has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife evelyn was also one, she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience's business. after a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes, foxes and such. at this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely. this movie just did not work for me, it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film. explaining evelyn's death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where evelyn did rise from the grave. granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave, just not under her own power. the gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too. i just thought for the most part this movie was a tad dull.
