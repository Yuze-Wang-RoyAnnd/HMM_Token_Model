things i learned from "the list".<br /><br />a decent cinematographer, a hot girl who can act and malcom mcdowell couldn't stop this movie from sucking.<br /><br />blockbuster won't give you your money back.<br /><br />even when he reads the script and says "ugh! really?!", malcom mcdowell still tries.<br /><br />chuck carrington desperately needs acting classes.<br /><br />hire a writer.<br /><br />jesus hates me too and punished me by making me pay $ 5.50 to see this movie.<br /><br />when making a movie, you don't need an ending. just leave everything unexplained, unresolved an uninteresting enough so that the audience falls asleep before the ending. genius.<br /><br />any random landlord can cure death just by drawing a cross on a window. so make friends.<br /><br />your maid can sing you back to life.<br /><br />chuck carrington still needs acting classes.<br /><br />your roommate will hate you and make fun of you if you bring home this movie.<br /><br />apologies will not be accepted.
