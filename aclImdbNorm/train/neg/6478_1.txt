i'll say it again: this movie was totally lame. kids will like it, sure, but adults...doubtful. the whole thing was basically a rehash of the original, which is to be expected, since they pretty much explored the whole concept in the first movie, but still, did they have to completely rehash the entire movie? i mean, everything is re-done from the little mermaid. the worst part of it is morgana "ursula's crazy sister" who appears out of nowhere and threatens melody, which is ridiculous since triton is there with his magic trident. why didn't triton do anything about it? because the plot required him to do nothing. i could go on, but i won't. the whole thing is a shameless attempt to rake in more money from the little mermaid, and was obviously thrown together without any thought, because they knew it would sell. overall it is a terrible waste of time.
