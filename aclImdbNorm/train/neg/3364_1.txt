so it starts with a beautiful old house in the country. you have a group of people who get asked to come to this house and (not surprisingly) the caretakers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason. anywhoo, the people laugh, joke etc. this dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids. they get scared, they start to feel stuff. oh no, a girl see's s ghost. some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc. this girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls, yeah yeah, blah blah. she does but, oh no, she dies as she does. and goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell. two people survive and escape the house. the script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and elanor (the one who dies saving the kids) says "oh no". the acting is wooden, the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again. basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it, but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss. i was extremely disappointed when i watched this. a very big let down. my sister (who gets sacred very easily) got bored in this film it is appalling.
