one of the worst films i have seen to date. pathetic action scene and really bad acting also do not help. the only good point is gary busey's parts but this does not lift the film very much. it lives up to its b film ranking and passes the test with flying colours. a waste of my money although i found entertaining to begin with its gets annoying after a few watches. i do not recommend this film unless you watch it for free or its a gift. ( a gift you can ask for the receipt and send back for a complete refund).<br /><br />really bad.<br /><br />1/10.
