next to the slasher films of the 1970s and 80s, ones about the walking dead were probably the second most popular horror sub-genre. while slasher films had 'black christmas' and 'halloween' to get the whole thing going, zombie flicks had george romero's 'dead' films. and unsurprisingly soon after the success of his first two in the series, other directors wanted to cash in. a lot of italian directors were especially interested, such as lucio fulci who brought us 'zombie' a year after romero's 'dawn of the dead', known as 'zombi' in italy and some other countries, and it was there that fulci's film was known as 'zombi 2'. apart from the walking dead it has no relation to romero's film, but is a good film in it's own right. it was a big success in europe and 9 years later a sequel was born.<br /><br />pros: lots of beautiful, lush scenery. awesome score. the acting isn't exactly good, but the cast is game and seem to be enjoying the experience. after kind of a slow start, the pace moves along like that of an action flick. plenty cheese and unintentional hilarity for bad film lovers. good job on the make-up effects. lots of blood and some decent gore.<br /><br />cons: virtually plot less. nothing you haven't already seen before. blatantly rips off some things from the first couple of 'return of the living dead' films. cardboard characters. hasn't aged too well due to the bad 1980s rock music(not that i'm saying all rock music of that period is bad), clothing, and overall feel of the movie.<br /><br />final thoughts: first of all, this is not a true sequel to fulci's cult classic. in fact, i don't know if it was ever meant to pick up where that film left off. for those that don't know, fulci was ill during production and ended up leaving and was replaced with bruno mattei. mattei's films are pretty laughable, but like this film many are good campy fun. and that's all this film really is, just something to watch for fun.<br /><br />my rating: 3.5/5 (so-bad-it's-good rating) 2/5 (serious rating)
