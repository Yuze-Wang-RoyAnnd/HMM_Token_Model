the premise of the film is that thomas archer's son was murdered and his wife was brutalized -- and he is given a chance at revenge when (after post traumatic stress disorder therapy), he is put in a room with a man strapped to a chair and told this was the culprit. he is given a large table of implements with which to offer retribution: drills, bats, nails, sledgehammers, torches, whatever you can think of that someone could possibly want to use to physically hurt another human being.<br /><br />we go way too many scenes of torture before we figure out that the man archer is torturing is not the man who committed the crime. the two then create an uncomfortable alliance; who put them in this situation and why.<br /><br />well, when all is said and done, we don't really care...
