this hamlet made for one of the boringest mst3000 episodes ever. i am not a shakespear fan, but i do not believe he ever intended his works to be this slow paced and drab. it is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are so many hamlets listed. like i said though this one is quite boring. it is in black and white, the pacing is slow, and there is minimal scenery. the actors are all dubbed too so that doesn't help. this is the one mst 3000 i can't watch in one sitting cause the way the guy playing hamlet says his lines can put anyone to sleep.
