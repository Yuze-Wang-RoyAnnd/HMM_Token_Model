why did i waste 1.5 hours of my life watching this? why was this film even made? why am i even commenting on this film?<br /><br />one reviewer said this film took patience to watch and it was n't for everybody. i cannot figure out who this movie is for. maybe after dropping a hit of acid, somebody, somewhere could watch this and make some sense out of it. it is incoherent, it isn't experimental, it's plain and simple garbage. the film follows no plot line whatsoever, just when you think you have something, well.....you don't. <br /><br />i think the ending brought some finality to the film (no pun intended), the viewer gets a glimpse of what might have been going on. i don't think i put a spoiler in here, not that it would matter. this film is another must miss in the world of filmdom.
