this movie features an o.k. score and a not bad performance by david muir as dr. hackenstein. the beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the "special effects" that this is a low budget movie. there is nothing in this movie that you could not find in other mad scientist, horror/comedy, or low budget movies. not special for any nude scene buffs or bad movie lovers either. this movie is simply here. anne ramsey and phillis diller are nothing to get excited about as well. if you are curious as i was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of the one line summary.
