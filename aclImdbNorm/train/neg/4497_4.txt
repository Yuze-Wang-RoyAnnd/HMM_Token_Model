- i had planned to write something explaining what i didn't like about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than i thought. honestly, i can't remember much about it. i watched it just three days ago and it's made almost no impression on me. that's usually the sign of a real stinker. about the only thing i remember was being incredibly bored by most of it. the novelty of having a humphrey bogart look-a-like as the detective wore off real quick. it would be different if he could act, but he's a one-note entertainer. the kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them. if you can't spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you need to see more euro horror. the casting is a dead giveaway to the killer's identity.
