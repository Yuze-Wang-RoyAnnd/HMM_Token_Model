if there's one thing you can count on disney to do, it's their uncanny ability to take a story and tell it again and again and again. even watching the commercial for lady and the tramp ii was a horrible experience. disney's going to ruin one of their most awesome classics ever. it even had that spaghetti meatball scene. it's been done before! and that's what i say to this sorry direct to video(the entire concept should be banned). everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of bluth's really bad movies. the penguin and walrus duo(i've even forgotten their names) are just a really poor carbon copy of timon and pumbaa. morgana is another ursula. she even repeats practically all her old lines. the songs are pathetic, really abysmal. i've never heard songs so bad from them before until now. and the dialogue is atrocious. it's pathetic and simplistic. on the plus side, at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent. all of the usual characters aren't as annoying as they used to be(or maybe that's a minus for little mermaid fans). back on the negative, melody is just so sickeningly cute you just might vomit. i almost did. do yourself and your little mermaid fan a favor. don't waste your money on this. true, it's not as horrific as return of jafar or pocahontas ii, but that's little consolation.
