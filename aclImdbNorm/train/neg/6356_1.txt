if i accidentally stumbled across this script in textual form i would read it and maybe laugh. i would not, however laugh at the points in the film where the director would seem to want me to laugh. although i am still not altogether sure where these are. i don't care if this is woody allen, this writer cannot write dialogue, or at least he cannot knowingly write dialogue then draw performances from actors capable of drawing laughter from even the most ticklish of clowns. for example:<br /><br />(paraphrase) "i'm an art historian, i'm looking to get a job in an art gallery." <br /><br />ok, so it states the fact but honestly, do you know of any art historians who would say that? how would you answer? <br /><br />"really? an art gallery? who would've thought it?"<br /><br />the entire script is littered with the kind of tawdry quasi-intellectualism that i would not have expected from such a respected character writer. i admit that i have no knowledge of allen's other work and, judging by this one i don't want to start learning. the characters are loathsome without exception, an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from the human condition? or really really poor character writing? you be the judge.
