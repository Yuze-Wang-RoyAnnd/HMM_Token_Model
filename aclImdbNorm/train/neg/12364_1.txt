god, i am so sick of the crap that comes out of america called "cartoons"!<br /><br />since anime became popular, the usa animators either produce a cartoon with a 5-year-old-lazy-ass style of drawing (kappa mikey) or some cheep japanese animation rip-off. (usually messing up classic characters) no wonder anime is beating american cartoons! <br /><br />they are not even trying anymore! <br /><br />oh, i just heard of this last night; i live in the uk and when i found out this show first came out in 2005,well, i never knew the uk was so up-to-date with current shows.
