the summary provided by my cable tv guide made it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is. "slaughterhouse rock" is by far the worst horror film that i have ever seen, a title previously held by "urban legends: final cut". from its opening scene i could tell it's going to be really bad, but i was so bored that i couldn't care less. this film contains laughable acting, especially by the guy who's tormented in his dreams, incredible as in not credible plot twists, and some of the crappiest music i've heard, and i'm living in a period when the likes of britney spears and nsync dominate the air waves. the biggest problem with "slaughterhouse rock" is that it's not funny. one would a film as dull and boring and so not scary as this would try to spice things up a bit with a few funny one-liners here and there, but no. we have tormented guy's self-centered friend trying to be funny, but came across as annoying instead. (spoiler) and please, do tell me, who in this crazy world is insane and self-loathing enough to visit a creepy jail in the middle of the night? no one! if you're going to make a horror movie, at least make it believable. this one is anything but.
