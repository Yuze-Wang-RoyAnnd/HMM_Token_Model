this movie was like a bad train wreck, as horrible as it was, you still had to continue to watch. my boyfriend and i rented it and wasted two hours of our day. now don't get me wrong, the acting is good. just the movie as a whole just enraged both of us. there wasn't anything positive or good about this scenario. after this movie, i had to go rent something else that was a little lighter. jennifer tilly is as usual a very dramatic actress. her character seems manic and not all there. darryl hannah, though over played, she does a wonderful job playing out the situation she is in. more than once i found myself yelling at the tv telling her to fight back or to get violent. all in all, very violent movie...not for the faint of heart.
