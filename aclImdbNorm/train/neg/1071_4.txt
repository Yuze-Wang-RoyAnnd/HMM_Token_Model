a very weak movie, mainly because of a poor story, but also poor acting in the case of robert downey jr., and irrational behaviour by many of the characters. if you are someone who likes to switch your mind off and simply watch a movie for it's creativity or acting criteria, then you may like this movie. personally i can't do that with a drama and found this too far-fetched.<br /><br />i'm particularly annoyed when a main character, that is supposed to be an intelligent person, continually acts like a complete imbecile. in this movie, if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations, there would be no movie.<br /><br />the first highly unlikely act is when the main character, a successful attorney named magruder, played by kenneth branagh, is leaving a party and happens upon a girl, mallory doss played by embeth davidtz, who is screaming that her car has been stolen. they are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers her into accepting a ride home.<br /><br />she tells him about her weird father who belongs to some kind of weird sect and does crazy things. when they arrive at her dilapidated shack in the poorer part of town, they notice that her car is in the driveway. also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been broken.<br /><br />things are very odd, she's weird (looking like a tramp, she undresses in front of him until she's completely naked
