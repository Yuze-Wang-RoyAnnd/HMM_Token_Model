i am watching this movie right now on wtn because that was the channel that the tv was turned to when i turned it on. it is a not very credible and fairly boring story about a minister's wife (alexandra paul) falling in lust with a young stud/drifter (with washboard abs) played by corey sevier. there may or may not be a plot. corey whips his shirt off a lot and alexandra swoons. i'm getting the feeling he's supposed to be up to no good, and that's why he's messing with skinny alexandra paul. it's not really important because as i said he takes his shirt off a lot and i just caught a glimpse of butt cleavage. there's a lot of sax on the soundtrack, which is just painful.
