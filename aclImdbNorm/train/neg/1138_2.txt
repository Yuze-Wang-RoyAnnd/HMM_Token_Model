this was a complete disappointment. the acting isn't bad, but the production was just so bad that at times i felt i needed to stop it, but i sadly made it through and was able to finish it a bit embarrassed by the whole poor movie. it is o.k. if you are o.k. with cheesy moral plots and don't mind watching a movie that vastly misconstrues whitman. if you want a cheesy fictional story go for it.
