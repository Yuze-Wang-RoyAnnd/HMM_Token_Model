i found this film embarrassing to watch. i felt like it was shoving the storyline down my throat as if i couldn't pick up the subtleties i needed a voice over to spell them all out for me constantly.<br /><br />having a father who is still an alcoholic, i didn't really feel it was a film about alcoholism as such. alcoholics, true alcoholics are very lonely people inside, in my opinion of course. they find it hard to communicate, something that the main character had no problem with really, except he did have a problem saying i love you at one point- which was a bit of a feeble effort at establishing his cold character. he was constantly surrounded with people too!? <br /><br />i felt cheated that at no point were we really alone with the character to really get a sense of his inner loneliness and turmoil. i couldn't connect with the character and felt no link at all considering my father. i felt nothing at all when it had finished, just relief it was over.<br /><br />kevin mckidd is an okay actor but not a tough guy feature lead! the clockwork orange thing was as subtle as a brick. mckidd was too old for the teen, they should have got three different characters or avoided the teen stage and concentrated more on the adult mckidd.<br /><br />on a good note, i felt the little boy actor was really good at the start of the film!!
