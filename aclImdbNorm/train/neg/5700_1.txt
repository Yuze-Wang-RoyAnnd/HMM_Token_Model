how this film gains a 6.7 rating is beyond belief. it deserves nothing better than a 2.0 and clearly should rank among imdb's worst 100 films of all time. national treasure is an affront to the national intelligence and just yet another assault made on american audiences by hollywood. critics told of plot holes you could drive a 16 wheeler through.<br /><br />i love the justifications for this movie being good... "nicholas cage is cute." come on people, no wonder people around the world think americans are stupid. this has to be the most stupid, insulting movie i have ever seen. if you wanted to see an actually decent film this season, consider kinsey, the woodsman, million dollar baby or sideways. national treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific films. i bet most of you reading this haven't even heard of them, since some haven't been widely released yet.<br /><br />nicholas cage is a terrific actor - when he is in the right movies. time after time i've seen cage waste his terrific talent in awful mind-numbing films like con air, the rock and face-off. when his talent is put to good use like in charlie kaufman's adaptation he is an incredible actor.<br /><br />bottom line - i'd rather feed my hand to a wood chipper than be subjected to this visual atrocity again.
