whoever wrote the "nice" post about this must have been a friend of these guys. this is bad even for backyard wrestling. in fact this isn't even backyard wrestling really, it's a few guys hitting each other on a trampoline. each guys is about 45 lbs wet and there is not one ounce of entertainment value in this. it is just a few bored kids that even give yard tards a bad name, if that is possible. if you want to see some entertaining backyard wrestling, pick up backyard wrestling a pleasure for pain. it stars the 2 biggest names in byw, mdogg20 and josh prohibition. these guys are good. they have actually went since yarding it and gotten professionally trained as "real" pro wrestlers. they went legit and have gotten better. i recommend checking out those 2 guys. mdogg is insane and off the hook. so don't waste your time or your cash on this crappy dvd, there are "better" back yard videos out there.
