when you have a disembodied skull, an empty mansion, a schizophrenic wife, a scheming cad and a nutzo gardener, throw in a minister and his wife - what have you got?<br /><br />aip's answer to insomnia.<br /><br />"the screaming skull" gets points for audacity, offering free caskets for anyone who dies of fright from watching the film. pretty safe bet, when you're lulled into a stupor by people who think they're in a production of "suspense for dummies".<br /><br />but peggy webber was a cutie, anyway. she had a few good moments of acting here and there (especially when trying to communicate with the gardener) and no one else fills a nightgown like she. but that scared face she makes - scary in itself. whoa.<br /><br />as a whole, though, there is little suspense here and everything is telegraphed like a punch thrown by a mime. you can't be scared by this film, it's impossible. it has its moments, but not enough of them.<br /><br />however, thanks to a certain mike nelson and his two robot pals, there are several moments of pure joy, especially in the copy they got hold of ("the film jumped, and it was really scary!").<br /><br />one star for "the screaming skull", eight and a half for the mst3k version.<br /><br />talk about a "screaming" bore....
