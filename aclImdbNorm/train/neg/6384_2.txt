i was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies. in their long list of films was this film and i thought i must be hallucinating at such an offensive title and premise. but, no, that's really what it was. and since the film was only about 27 minutes long, i decided to give it a try. if it had turned out to be some porno movie, i would have stopped watching. instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre film i have ever seen. the danish production crew tried, with a budget of about $49, to make a star trek-style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women--like they proceeded to do on the earth! and in every case, they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet.<br /><br />subtle, this ain't. with some of the most obscene and juvenile names of characters i've ever heard, i don't even think i can write them on imdb without having my review removed! however, despite the utter crappiness of it all, it was strangely watchable and worth a peek. but, as i mentioned already, due to the crude names and odd subject matter (though no nudity), it's a film for adults only. <br /><br />by the way, this movie left me with 1001 questions as to who would make this, why make it and who was the intended audience?! it may not be the absolute worst thing i have ever seen, but it probably is the weirdest and possibly the most offensive!
