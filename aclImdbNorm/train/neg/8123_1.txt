(spoilers)wow, this is a bad one. i did a double take when watching an old star trek episode the other day-it was the one where everyone gets infected with that space sickness and then go a bit nuts-and there was stewart moss, a.k.a the unlikable 'hero' of it lives by night! he played the first crewmember infected, who dies from terminal depression. all i could think was that he'd watched his own movie too many times, that's what caused the depression. this movie is full of truly unlikable people. there is no redeeming character in the film, not one. it's very hard to feel bad about dr. beck's turning into a bat(or whatever he actually turned into), because you just don't like him. and you don't like his shrill, bony wife, or the nasty sleazy sgt. ward, or dr. mustache love...so why would you invest any time or energy in this movie? where there is no empathy with the characters, there is no reason to bother caring about it. not to mention the horrible cinematography, which made it look like they'd filmed the movie through urine, and the five cent bat special effects, many of which appeared to be pieces of paper thrown into a fan to simulate hordes of bats flying. not the worst film i've ever seen on mst3k, but down there in the bottom ranks, definitely.
