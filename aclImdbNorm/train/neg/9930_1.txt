a mercilessly corny and painfully unfunny attempt to transplant the character of sheriff bart from mel brooks' blazing saddles into his own weekly sitcom, this is really as bad as some people say it is!<br /><br />the laugh-track only serves to remind the unamused viewer what all in this supposed comedy is intended to be a joke and just how desperate for laughs it really is!<br /><br />however, it is somewhat interesting to see louis gossett jr. trying his best to impersonate cleavon little. his embarrassment shows through in every scene. he was much funnier in the hbo movie el diablo than he was here in this slab of cheese!<br /><br />truly the best and funniest thing about black bart is the name of his horse!
