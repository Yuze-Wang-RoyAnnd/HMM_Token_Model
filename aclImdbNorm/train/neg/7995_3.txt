i remember watching this movie when i was young, but could not recall the title to it then going through horror movies i find it and think to myself "that is the title?" this movie is a kind of combination disaster film/insect attack film with fewer notable stars in it. it is also somewhat boring too, as it has that television vibe to it where you can see the movie fade out for commercials and such. the plot has this sort of resort being invaded by ants. i think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby, but do not quote me on that. the most memorable ant attack for me in the whole flick was the first one involving the kid who falls into the swimming pool after being swarmed and of course summers attack scene too. what else stands out in this one is the very goofy ending where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breath through. in the end though like most television movies this movie is very tame and not very scary in the least unless you panic at the sight of ants.
