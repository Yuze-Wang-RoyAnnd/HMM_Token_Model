this has the absolute worst performance from robert duval who sounds just like william buckley throughout the entire film. his hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest. i'm not sure if this was deliberate scene stealing or inadvertent but it's the only thing i can recall from a truly forgettable film. this picture should be shown in every amateur acting class of an example of what not to do. thank god, duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to effect a cultured accent. he is a good character actor but that's about it. klaus is so much better. his performance is muted and noteworthy.
