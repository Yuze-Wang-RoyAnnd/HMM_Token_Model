this film was the worst film i have ever viewed. it was like a "homework assignment" for a film class. it totally misses the mark when it comes to the "message" it is trying to relay. characters are over exaggerated, poor acting and as for a plot...well it is utterly ridiculous. the cover shot is what made me think it may be a decent film, the co-actor is handsome and that's about it. moral of this movie: never judge a movie by it's cover! save your time, money and energy and make your own home movie and you will be far better off than i. it was painful to watch and quite frankly i am surprised that anyone would spend money to make and distribute it!
