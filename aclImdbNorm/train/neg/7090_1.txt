i fell asleep on my couch at 7:35pm last night watching larry sanders (i usually directivo it, but not last night). woke up at 3am (invesment banker on the west coast), and was fascinated to see this on hbo2. i was shocked on how poor this 'movie' was. seriously. shocked. so shocked that i had to write a commentary on imdb. this is really really bad. the writing is boring, but the directing and editing are simply below those of a freshman at a film school.<br /><br />yes it is shot video. mind you, that is shot on video, not digital video. it does look like a soap opera. the clips from skateboard videos have a more 'film' feel to them then this horror.<br /><br />i wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly cant remember anything. the shots and blocking are stupid. yes, i chose the word 'stupid'. not unconventional, not daring, not bold, not boring, just stupid. i know people reviewing this review will say "well give me an example". i cant. it was 3am. but trust me, i know you will watch it anyway, you will be drawn by the horrible reviews.<br /><br />
