yet another insult and slap in the face to gay men everywhere. this lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend it. once again we have an attractive 'straight' hero who supposedly can't get any woman to be interested in him. yeah, right! and we're also presented with the 'sympathetic, attractive' gay friend who is actually a fat, balding, ugly old man whom the lead is supposed to find attractive. even i didn't find him appealing and i'm a fat, ugly old gay man (but thankfully not balding)! whatever acting talent there may be here has been thrown away on a bad script, and truly awful direction. mr. sneedeker should be banned from filmdom, but then he's no different than the countless other hacks working in hollyweed.
