watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue. it initially looks great but ultimately provides no satisfaction--none.<br /><br />the plot is a muddled mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil. so, how is it possible that with this basic plot and robin williams that the movie still turns out so badly?! it's because the picture is all appearance with no substance whatsoever--much like the terrible popeye picture williams did at the beginning of his film career. the film must have cost a fortune but perhaps there wasn't enough money left over to hire writers who had graduated grade school.<br /><br />the film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on. i really am unsure why it was made in the first place--it certainly wasn't made to provide any sort of entertainment.
