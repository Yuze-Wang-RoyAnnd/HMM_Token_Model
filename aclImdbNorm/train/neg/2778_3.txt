this movie seemed to have it all going for it with good camera, sound, film, sets, music, costumes ... but drum-roll, gary stretch spoke! i don't know if it was his poor acting or simply a bad script, but would say it was both. considering the casting of him in this role, i found it difficult to root for him even to the very end. i wished he'd have died in battle or one of the sword/knife scuffles.<br /><br />then, the tinder for the plot to kill the king was because the king didn't have dinner and sex with his queen? pretty lame. and to go to the extreme to kill her own son? and to then push up her lover as succeeding king? i see a thread or two here and there of historical bytes, but the manner in which this was all presented was farcical.<br /><br />i don't recognize gary stretch from anything else, but he was dreadful. i read another user's comments about audio being dubbed, but don't think his was dubbed ... after all, he speaks english, right? it really was awful. the lines were read right off the coroner's table ... flat-line. it could be he just doesn't have the voice to carry tone fluctuations.<br /><br />aside from this, i did watch it to the end, so the movie had at least an "interest." it could have been more if the script/lines and casting had been given more work. the scenery and filming crew along with very good quality film is what really made this movie above all else. the cast and story were all secondary. i give the film crew a 10.
