i figured the whole joke of the movie would be to see some rich white guy acting like chris rock, and then see chris rock react to people's reactions. instead you just see chris rock being himself and people not understanding him. there are maybe 2 scenes in the entire movie where they use their gimmick. this should have been a lot better.
