i usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review but in this film there's really not much to talk of. just a mish-mash of other far better sword & sorcery epics. lack of cohesiveness runs rampant as does banality. even the main villaness refusing to wear clothing other then a loincloth is pretty boring as she pretty much has a chest of a young boy.mildly amusing in it's ineptitude at best and severely retarded at it's worst. lucio fulci was scrapping the bottom of the barrel here and it shows.<br /><br />my grade: d- <br /><br />dvd extras: posters & stills galleries; lucio fulci bio; and us & international theatrical trailers <br /><br />eye candy: sabrina siani is topless throughout (some may consider that appealing, i did not); various extras are topless as well
