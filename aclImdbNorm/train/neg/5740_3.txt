i found darkness to be just too dark. it had a kind of cool idea and some ambitious ideas, not bad action scenes and a few splashy moments to make you go ugh! but, it was underlit to the point of confusion. you don't really know what is always going on in the dark scenes and for a film that is shot on super 8 film, you already have all that nasty grain to deal with. as with nathan schiff movies, it's just too much. director leif jonker seems to want to make an original film, but he lacks the know-how to do it. the camera is never pointed in the right place, lack of fundamentals such as how to shoot simple dialogue scenes and how to light a movie hurt as well. the actors are all pretty uneven and hammy. but despite these negatives, the music is good, the gore is plenty and ranges from silly putty to really good appliances. is this a classic like it says? is it worthy of the two discs worth of praise? no. but it is a good first try. now if these guys would stop patting themselves on the back about this movie (from what i understand here the only one they have ever finished) for a while and try again, they may do better.
