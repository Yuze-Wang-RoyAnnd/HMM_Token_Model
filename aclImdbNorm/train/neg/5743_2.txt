yes, i know i'm one of the few people longing to trample this movie into the dust of oblivion.so let me me tell you why i feel this way. in truth,had it been advertized as a zombie film or the like,i might have enjoyed it.but right now,i'm totally speechless.<br /><br />*spoiler...though i'm not sure what's to spoil* let's start with the first huge flaw. if i did not know that the movie is called "darkness - the vampire version" and had i not seen some sequences where some individuals seem to be sucking blood, i would not have seen the connection with vampires. i mean, fangless???? give me a break!!!<br /><br />second bad point: what's with the metal? it appears that all young people, but mainly those so-called "vampires", are into various kinds of metal,judging mainly by their shirts! don't get me wrong, i've been into the more extreme forms of music for almost 15 years, but nobody 's going to scare me by showing me some ridiculous teenagers in iron maiden (of all bands!!!) t-shirts running around,pretending to be vampires! "pathetic" is the only only word that i could use here.<br /><br />third weakness: the actors. wait a minute. what actors?! you mean the director's wooden friends! words would be a waste here.<br /><br />yes, alright, the movie is very gory, but what difference does that make? it would have been a strong point and something to enjoy if the "briliant" director had not chosen to create an artificial vampire topic in this movie. i wanted to see vampires,but was treated to some stupid looking kids i would have loved to use my baseball bat on. the film-makers should simply have advertized the movie saying "cheap b-grade horror with no plot but a lot of gore" !!!<br /><br />this movie is blasphemy against the whole concept of vampirism. and it makes me sick.
