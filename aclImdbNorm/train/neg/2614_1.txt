a sequel to (actually a remake of) disney's 1996 live-action remake of 101 dalmations. cruella devil (glenn close) is released from prison after being "cured" of her obsession with fur by a psychologist named dr. pavlov (ugh!). but the "cure" is broken when cruella hears the toll of big ben, and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of dalmation hides.<br /><br />this movie is bad on so many levels, starting with the fact that it's a "thanksgiving family schlock" movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the disney marketing machine. glenn close over-over-over-over-acts as cruella. with all that she had to put up with in this movie -- the lame script, the endless makeup, getting baked in a cake at the end -- i hope they gave her an extremely-large paycheck.<br /><br />(speaking of which, where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory, a bakery with a rube goldberg assembly line, and a candlelight restaurant all located within the same building -- as you do in the climax of this film?) of course, the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs. they serve as the "macaulay culkin's" of this movie, pulling all the stupid "home alone" gags on the villains. (biting them in the crotch, running over their hands with luggage carts, squirting them with icing, etc., etc., etc., ad nauseum.) i have to admit, the dogs were fairly good actors -- much better than the humans.<br /><br />gerard depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a freaked-out french furrier. the two human "dog lovers" -- rehashed from the earlier film, but with different actors -- are completely boring. when they have a spaghetti dinner at an italian restaurant, the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers, and their dogs at home, watching the dinner scene from "lady and the tramp." i thought to myself, "oh please, don't go there!" i half-expected the humans to do a satire on the "lady and the tramp" dinner scene -- as charlie sheen did in "hot shots: part deux" -- doing the "spaghetti strand kiss," pushing the meatball with his nose, etc.<br /><br />and don't get me started on the annoying parrot with eric idle's voice.<br /><br />the costumes were nominated for an oscar, and the costumes in the movie *are* good. but they are the only good thing in the movie. the rest of it is unbearable dreck.
