this movie isn't about football at all. it's about jesus/god!! it's the same kind of sappy sanctimonious religious drivel you get from those arch idiots who wrestle for jesus, or pump iron for jesus. yeah, jesus was totally buffed, liked contact sports, and definitely owned a full set of dumb bells. duhhh! this movie should have been entitled "hiking for jesus," or something along those lines just to let the general public know that the real intent of this movie is to convert people to christianity, and to pander to those whose brains have already been thoroughly washed in the blood of the lamb. that the title is derived from the bible is made clear when the head coach is reading his bible and asking jesus for help. the recent sports movie "invincible" was 100 times more inspiring than this was, and jesus wasn't even a factor. it was just the desire and determination of an individual with a dream.<br /><br />any broad appeal as an inspirational sports movie is ultimately lost amidst all of the blatant bible thumping and sanctimonious religious propaganda. one gets the impression that the sole message is the only way you can succeed and make positive gain is if you accept jesus as your personal savior. but this is simply not true, and is therefore a lie being perpetuated by those who believe that it is true and want everyone else to believe it. the image of the winning athlete thanking jesus when he wins comes directly to mind. what does he do when he loses? does he curse jesus? of course not! when he loses jesus isn't responsible. jesus is only responsible when he wins. and the logic goes round and round and round, and it ends up exactly where the true believer needs it to be, every time!! i had to hit pause when the scene with the coach receiving a brand new truck came on so i could stop rolling on the floor laughing my ass off and catch my breath. materialism is not what jesus taught. i find it odd that most so called "christians" seem to either forget or ignore this message from their "savior," especially when i see a jesus fish on the back of a huge gas guzzling suv that passes me like i'm standing still.<br /><br />another message this movie implies is that jesus apparently cares more about the win loss record of a mediocre high school football team that he does about the millions of starving children in the world. the final scene where the insecure and unsure kicker boots a 51 yard field goal and it is hyped up as an unbelievably incredible miracle puts the final gag me with a spoon religious red flag on this turkey. i only gave it three stars because the guy who played the black coach could actually act.
