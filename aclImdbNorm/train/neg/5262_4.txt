we had to go to an appointment, so we turned on the dvr to record the ending. after it was over, i looked at my husband and said, "do you have a clue?". he shook his head no. i said, "so you made me watch the end of this movie and i have no clue what just happened". he didn't "make" me, but you know.<br /><br />the movie body itself was quite good. there was a lot of suspense. it kept you wondering. then came the ending. the ending was... well it just ended. you weren't let in on what happened or why. right up until the credits i kept thinking something would happen to explain it, but it never did. so i came here expecting someone figured it out and i just wasn't paying attention. nope. here four years later, i'm just as clueless as tom sawyer was.<br /><br />i still have no clue what went on. i'm just glad i didn't waste any $$ to buy it because i sure would have been mad.<br /><br />ohhhhh! i get it! the end of the movie is what disappeared! rofl
