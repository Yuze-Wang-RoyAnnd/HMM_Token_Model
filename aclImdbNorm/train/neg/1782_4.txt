a charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town, cats and death soon follow them. that about sums it up.<br /><br />i'll admit that i am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie. but in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film, and believe me there is plenty of that to go around, it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />the characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on. fear, greed, pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people. although it can be argued that that seeming failing, in actuality, serves the telling of the story. the supernatural premise and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplay(not that i have anything specific against mr. king) are quite nicely supported by some interesting fx work, makeup and quite suitable music. the absolute gem of this film is without a doubt alice krige who plays mary brady, the otherworldly mother.<br /><br />king manages to take a simple story of outsider, or people who are a little different(okay - a lot in this case), trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan.
