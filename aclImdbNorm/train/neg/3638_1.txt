the film portrays france's unresolved problems with its colonial legacy in western (francophone) africa through the befuddled and complex psychoanalytical prism of a young woman, france (herein symbolically representing her nation). it is an often engaging and challenging portrait of a young woman's desire to come to terms with a traumatic moment in her past, in particular, and a nation's desire to reach out to the 'other' it once 'owned' and moulded. this is reflected in the way in which it centres entirely around the notion of travelling (or being in transit) from the present to the past; remembered realities to undeniable contemporary political and economic actualities.<br /><br />the characters all play a symbolic, albeit a limited and unconvincing role. france, meant to be a visual as well as a totemic representation of contemporary french society, leaves one indifferent to her plight as she seems still to be imbued with the same naivet'e she enjoyed as a child-in fact as a child she seems more in possession of her reality. the rest of the rag-tag ensemble is just forgettable. the black africans are, to say the least, offencive impressionistic portraits of former colonised peoples now colonised by the director's poor handling of her material. they are no more than a dark and moribund backdrop against which the blythe-like france wonders seeking a world she never knew, and hoping for one that can never be found in cameroon.
