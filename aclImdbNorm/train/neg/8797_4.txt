a never ending frenzy of clever visual ironies does not necessarily create an engaging film. the "blonde wig" half of the movie never took off perhaps due to too much self-indulgence by its makers.<br /><br /> the wong faye half (featuring a very playful, if karen carpenter looking, faye wong) holds much more appeal. all the ingredients are there, however, the girl-meets-boy story element takes a back seat to artsy cleverness. character development is uneven. emotion is missing.<br /><br /> for music lovers, wong faye's "mung jung yun" (cantonese version of the cranberry's smash hit "dreams") is used effectively in chungking express. faye wong also recorded a mandarin language version called "zhen tuo." both are on cd, although only "mung jung yun" is found on the official movie soundtrack cd.
