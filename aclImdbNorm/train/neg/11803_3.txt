when someone remakes a classic movie, the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original. also, there's a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences.<br /><br />well, the 1973 tv version of "double indemnity" has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original. the main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all. fred macmurray was great as the lecherous, leering insurance agent walter neff in the original; richard crenna just seems world-weary and tired. edward g. robinson brought great manic energy to his role as macmurray's boss barton keys; lee j. cobb, a fine actor, appears almost bored with the proceedings. samantha eggar is all wrong as the conniving, back-stabbing phyllis dietrichson; while barbara stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role, eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place.<br /><br />robert webber, in the old richard gaines role as robinson's boss norton, and john fiedler taking the porter hall role as the crucial witness, bring some life to the movie. in particular, webber recreates the norton role well in a 1970s context.<br /><br />however, after the movie starts, the whole thing just sort of lies there, without any life or electricity. this is one film that never should have been remade.
