so, american pie: beta house is the 6th american pie movie in the series. although, it really has nothing to do with the original three american pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and eugene levy is in it (can't that guy get better gigs?).<br /><br />there is very little to compliment this movie on. there aren't any funny jokes. the acting is painful to watch, especially the girl with the "southern" accent which sounds more like a canadian's impersonation of a british woman pretending to be a hillbilly by using the word "ya'll." this movie makes me feel like such an idiot. why didn't i apply to a college where nobody goes to class (but everybody gets good grades), girls consistently take their clothes off in public, everybody has promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of babies and stis, and you can ejaculate all over a girl's family photos without her minding? really, this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn. maybe for the next one, they'll finally break down and hire ron jeremy as the lead. i'm sure they can just tie it in to the series by making his character stifler's 3rd uncle once removed or something like that.
