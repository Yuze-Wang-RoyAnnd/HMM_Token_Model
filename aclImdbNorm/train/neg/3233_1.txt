c'mon people, you can't be serious, another case of advertising snuff when it totally isn't! this isn't even remotely scary nor is it terrifying or depraved - it is just utterly terrible amateurish videowork, made for the next party to get the girls laid.<br /><br />the gore is incredibly bad, even the eye-scene is far from making me want to puke but just making me want to take the camera and hit those guys over the head. the girl is just laying there rubber-faced, not moving at all. it would have been funnier to use a real doll instead.<br /><br />one season of "i'm a celebrity, get me out of here!" is more frightening than this one. don't waste your time or your money.
