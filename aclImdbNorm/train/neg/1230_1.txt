words can't describe how utterly stupid this story (and therefore bad this movie) is! basinger, del toro ... what were you thinking ?? so there's a mall and its parking space is totally full. basinger's character goes in to buy a cup of tea and some packaging paper.<br /><br />when she comes out, the whole place is so empty, that nobody hears two gunshots fired nearby ?? even though she lives there, when she drives away from the baddies, she goes to the most remote and godforsaken place possible instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place ?? come on !!! i won't even go into the infamous red toolbox, since other people have done that before. let alone how she kills the moronic thugs one by one.<br /><br />this is so stupid, without the least bit of logic, i can only warn you watching it, it's a total waste of time, honestly !!
