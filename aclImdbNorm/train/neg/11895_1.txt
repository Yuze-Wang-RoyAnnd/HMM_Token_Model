oh my god what the hell happened here?!! i'm not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this? the dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in "king kong vs godzilla",linda miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy.its about some villain called dr.who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as king kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap kong.when he does(thats when linda miller gets annoying)he makes kong his slave but everything goes wrong and king kong escapes.then dr.who sends the robot after him.<br /><br />later when i was watching the movie i got a headache when linda miller and the other clowns started moaning.as i sat through the misery of watching the dvd while it was playing i was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fight.the ending has to be a really bad one because they could've shown kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again.<br /><br />don't watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do... beware of the disappointment you will receive.
