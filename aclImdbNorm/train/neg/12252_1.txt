**spoilers**<br /><br />this is one bad movie. seriously. acting in absolutely horrible, the fx are dreadfull and the plot is down right awful. but hey, its so bad that its fun watching! the script is so bad that its enjoyable! you just have to cringe and laugh at lines such as "i guess thats what you call crocteasing." as the women flash their breasts at the crocodile. i mean come on thats funny cause its so bad! it has such horrible jokes that they're funny! but after a while it just becomes to much as the movie turns into crap. i really started to fall asleep. trust me though, the plastic croc foot stamping on the leaves and the constant swishes of a crock tail well keep you laughing for a long time. though i have to say it had one cool part when the croc ripped that dude in half and he just hung there for a while figuring out what to do. heh heh mindless movie, which has to be nominated for the mst3k line!!
