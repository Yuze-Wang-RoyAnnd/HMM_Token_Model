necessarily ridiculous film version the literary classic "moby dick". john barrymore is captain ahab, who falls in love with the pastor's daughter, joan bennett. his brother derek is a rival for ms. bennett's affections. when mr. barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident, bennett rejects him. he must slay the whale and win bennett back...<br /><br />there are several scenes which may have thrilled 1930 theater audiences; particularly the scenes involving barrymore losing his leg. the film hasn't aged well, however; there are much better films from the time, both 1920s silents and 1930s talkies. the two name attractions, john barrymore and joan bennett aren't at their best. <br /><br />**** moby dick (8/14/30) lloyd bacon ~ john barrymore, joan bennett, lloyd hughes
