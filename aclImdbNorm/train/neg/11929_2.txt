i had watched "the eye" before i watched this one. i really liked "the eye", it was one of the best movies of the recent asian horror-cinema. so, i picked this "bangkok haunted" because it was the same director, and it was kind of popular round here. but man, what a disappointment... "bangkok haunted" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are no scary at all, not even disturbing (as "the eye" was)... no nothing. i can't even fill the 10 lines required for the comment... <br /><br />100% boring.<br /><br />*my rate: 2/10
