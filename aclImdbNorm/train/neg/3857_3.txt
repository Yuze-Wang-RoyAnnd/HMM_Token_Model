i had hoped this movie was going to be mildly entertaining, like other sorts of its genre. however, it was lame and i didn't find myself laughing very much. watch it on hbo, maybe, or if you've got a free rental to waste and you need a movie to pass the time. but i don't recommend paying to see it.<br /><br />the plot is simple and straightforward, and it could have been funny, maybe, if the script was better. jason lee can be hilarious, and he gets a few laughs here and there, but the movie falls flat. just don't go see this one. the directing is lackluster, but for what it is, directing isn't that important. i guess its main drawback is that it is just not very funny. see something else, don't waste your time here.
