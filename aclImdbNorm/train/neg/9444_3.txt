there's only one thing i'm going to say about cat in the hat...as a kids movie and a good comedy movie it sucks...i lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren't exactly kid appropriate. oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying...as for the plot i completely forgot. who cares it sucked anyway. i'm not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded- but so what it was annoying. don't see it-it belongs in the bottom 100.............................. the jokes are so unkiddy it's funny
