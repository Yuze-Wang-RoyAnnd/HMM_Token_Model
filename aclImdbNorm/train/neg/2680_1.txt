brokedown palace is not the kind of movie i would ever like to see. i also did not like the movie when some aussie man smuggled drugs in thailand and accused claire danes and kate beckinsale of drug smuggling. i would not go to that country no matter what after i saw this movie. in fact this movie stinks. i prefer to visit germany to meet beautiful single women. germany is the country i tolerate. i also would rather stick to the united states instead. after i saw some of the movie in the theatre including the false accusation of drug smuggling, i left the theatre and had my money refunded because i cannot tolerate this movie. if you are going to to thailand to meet someone there who could be a drug smuggler, forget this!
