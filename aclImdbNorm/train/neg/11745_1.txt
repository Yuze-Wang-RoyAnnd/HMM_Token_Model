the fact that i did not like the music is a very personal opinion, the historical innacuracies are not. i do realize that it is an opera and not a documentary, but some important aspects are missing, especiallly if other people comment falsely because of it.<br /><br />abbu abas was the mastermind of this operation, which was staged and reorganized due to discovery on board the shiph, in order to free 50 terrorists from israeli prisons, one of which was samir kuntar, a heinous terrorist whose story you can find by searching for "klinghoffer samir kuntar" on google. abbu abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, even if he never set foot on the achile lauro. ben laden never set foot on the planes that hit the wtc, did he?<br /><br />*** possible spoilers ***<br /><br />the movie almost excuses the terrorists' actions and reactions because of horrors they might have lived, always accentuating and exaggerating how much the israeli's have done to hurt them. however, they never portray the hurt that the palestinians have ever caused to the israelis. the movie uses (quite horrid!!!) images from the sabra and chatila horror, and nothing is said, understating the general belief that it was israel who was responsible, without ever mentioning that it was a syrian-les lebanese army who conducted the massacre.<br /><br />the acting was generally very bad, but i guess that's what can be expected from opera singers?<br /><br />on another note i am shocked at how a person can excuse terrorists killing a hostage because the hostage tried to stir the 400 innocent hostages against the armed terrorists, and add that the person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of zionism. imagine how unsympathetic his wife was, spitting on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea. i hope no one in the world is as cruel as she is(wink wink)
