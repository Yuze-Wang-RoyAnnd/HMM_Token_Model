i wouldn't normally write a comment on-line, but this is the worst movie i've ever seen. not only that it's filmed just like a soap series ("the young and the restless" is really filmed by professionals compared to this), but it also has awful cuts. it has no action. it is full of useless garbage.<br /><br />here's an example: a guy wants to kill the main character as he got fired because of him. so (after loads of crap) here they are: the guy puts a knife at his throat and says something like "you're dead now". then the main character says: "if you kill me you're dead. i've told the police you're threatening me". so the (killer) guy goes like (just about to cry): "oh no... the cops are following me!?!! oh... my god".<br /><br />remember: this is just an example. i really cannot believe this movie actually exists. so: if you want to see the worst movie ever... go ahead, i recommend it :)
