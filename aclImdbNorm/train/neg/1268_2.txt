oh what a condescending movie! set in los angeles, the center of the universe from the pov of hollywood filmmakers, this movie tries to be a deep social commentary on contemporary american angst.<br /><br />stereotyped, smarmy characters of widely varying socio-economic backgrounds cross paths in their everyday, humdrum lives. the plot is disjointed and desultory. numerous unimaginative plot contrivances keep the film going, like: a drive-by shooting, an abandoned baby left in the weeds, a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer, a guy flying through the night sky over the city, a kid at summer camp.<br /><br />and through all these events, the one constant is the generous helping of sociological "insights" imparted through the dialogue, as characters compare notes on their life experiences. one character tells another: "when you sit on the edge of that thing (the grand canyon), you realize what a joke we people are; ... those rocks are laughing at me, i could tell, me and my worries; it's real humorous to that grand canyon".<br /><br />and another character pontificates about the meaning of it all: "there's a gulf in this country, an ever widening abyss between the people who have stuff and the people who don't have ... it's like this big hole has opened up in the ground, as big as the ... grand canyon, and what's come pouring out ... is an eruption of rage, and the rage creates violence ...".<br /><br />aside from the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue, aside from the shallow, smarmy characters, aside from the dumb plot, the story's pace is agonizingly slow. acting is uninspired and perfunctory. the film's tone is smug and self-satisfied, in the script's contempt for viewers.<br /><br />this was a film project approved by hollywood suits who fancy themselves as omnipotent gurus, looking down from on high. they think their film will be a startling revelation to us lowly, unknowing movie goers, eager to learn about the real meaning of american social change.
