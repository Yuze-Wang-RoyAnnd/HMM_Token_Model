i stumbled upon nine dead recently and read the current reviews thinking i could deal with an average movie. this movie however was slightly below average, yet watchable. the script was poorly written and the acting was at average for a b-level movie with a couple standing out as pretty good. the plot borders on that of saw, teach people what they did wrong in a situation and try to make them appreciate life more, but that is really where the comparison ends. nine dead tries to have heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new. the main fault that i found in nine dead, was the slap in the face to the viewer of flashbacks that occurred 3 minutes before in the film and were completely unnecessary and a completely inadequate ending that people won't see coming, in a bad way. barring any spoilers i have seen the worse of bad movies and even they didn't end this poorly. decent flick, bad acting and ending though...
