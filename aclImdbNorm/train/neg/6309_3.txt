this movie had good intentions and a good story to work with. the director and screenwriter of this movie failed miserably and created a dull, boring filmstrip that made me feel like i was back in mr. hartford's 8th grade social studies class -- way back in 67.<br /><br />what a waste, will somebody please take this story and make a real movie out of it - the story deserves it.<br /><br />every time a scene had potential, all we were left with were a few clich'es, combined with black and white footage that they probably got from the history channel to show the action. shameful.<br /><br />ossie davis was the only bright light in this dull fest. the other acting was incredibly dull - it fit in with the movie well and whomever played the captain set a new low standard for line delivery.<br /><br />however, if you are willing to accept all the numerous flaws in this movie and aren't concerned with being awed or entertained, but want to learn about the uss mason, it is worth a watch.
