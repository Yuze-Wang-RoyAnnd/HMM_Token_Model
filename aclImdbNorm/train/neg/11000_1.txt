words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is. it is a series of random, unfunny clips about everything from a stupid batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady (really disturbing). the only remotely amusing thing about the underground comedy movie is watching joey buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie. also, it is rated nc-17, shunning away the only people that might tolerate it.
