i would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash! there are films that are bad, but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you! the sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. the so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night marxism. the film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. the photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. even the sound is bad! and some people call this art?<br /><br />
