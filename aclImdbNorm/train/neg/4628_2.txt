misty ayers had a smoking body, and that's all this movie was about. pure exploitation flick. i started playing a game with myself, counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music. and of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes. case in point: casually walking into a room and saying "hello" was scored with chase music from a roman epic. i'd like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released. what i learned from this movie: that women's low-rise panties existed in 1954. i'm talking sigourney weaver in the original alien movie panties. at least 20 of the first 30 minutes is misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing (except for bra and panties, sadly). also includes horrendous dubbing, leading to a "look out! godzirra!" effect.
