it's interesting at first. a naive park ranger (colin firth) marries a pretty, mysterious woman (lisa zane) he's only known for a short time. they seem to be happy, then she disappears without warning. he searches for her and, after a few dead ends, stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and sleazy recent past, which may include criminal activity. and then, it seems the filmmakers didn't know what to do with the story. the beginning, while not as suspenseful as it sounds, is at least watchable. then it ceases to be interesting or even make much sense. and the ending is so lame, so dull, and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence, you'll think the screenwriters didn't know what to do with it and got bored trying. what a sorry waste of a good idea!
