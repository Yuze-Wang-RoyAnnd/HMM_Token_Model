this is the prime example of low budget, winning over what would be a good story line. let's bring back samaire armstrong (having seen her work on the o.c. i know she can do better), then find a better script and budget.<br /><br />the special effects were so bad, and mostly badly computer generated, that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on-screen. and samaire armstrong's (alert!)changing into a werewolf was done by reducing her at first to a bad gcif figure before she even begins to change(final fantasy's humans, as well as pixar's made these laughable, think of the figure as a nude barbie doll).<br /><br />the story of was interesting, though the idea of bloodline in werewolves is nothing new. as it also got into the balance between evil, (maybe) not so evil, and the possible end of human-kind should the two lines mate. the subplot of a "book of werewolf linage" which effected some of the other characters in a spell-like manner for a while was effective, but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past. <br /><br />bring in a better script and direction, and i'd come back again.
