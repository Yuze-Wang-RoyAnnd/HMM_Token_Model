this movie lost me with the crossbow rpg (rocket-propelled grenade). it was like someone cut and pasted a scene from robocop. i half expected beowulf to say exclaim, "i like it!"<br /><br />i watched this because i like chris bruno from "the dead zone" tv show and he did his part. he chose a strange accent, but at least he kept it consistent for the whole movie -- unlike any of his costars. they kept slipping into all kinds of speech from old english to modern english, sometimes in the same sentence.<br /><br />there are already many comments on how this movie is different from the source material. however, even on its own, this movie's plot is not good. it's just boring, which even the low budget doesn't excuse. having a low budget means that you need to at least have a good story, dialog and decent acting. those things don't cost much. instead, they spent their money on half-assed cgi and some decent costumes and sets.<br /><br />life is too short to watch this movie.
