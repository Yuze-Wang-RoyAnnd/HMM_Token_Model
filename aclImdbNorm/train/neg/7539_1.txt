where oh where to begin in describing the comprehensive wretchedness of neil labute's latest attempt at film making? <br /><br />there are many kinds of film fans out there, but by far the most annoying and shallow is mr. intriguing. you know mr. intriguing, don't you? <br /><br />he's the fellow that no matter how stupid, lame, and incomprehensibly dull a film is, he says "gee, i don't know why everyone hated it, i found it intriguing." he's the kind of guy who finds the scent of dog poop intriguing. especially when he smears it in the shape of a hitler mustache on his upper lip and marches about the house ranting about the brilliance of science fiction that features thinly veiled references to greek mythology. he's also the guy this version of the wicker man was made for. no one else could stand it.
