this film was a big disappointment.<br /><br />i take the opposite view of the critics. this is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors; here the actors (bette davis and james cagney) are simply not up to the level of the material. clark gable and claudette colbert were every bit as big as davis and cagney, and look how it happened one night turned out - an all-time classic. with a very similar story, davis proves that she has no talent for comedy (good thing for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted!) davis' one-note performance oozes petulance, but none of the nuances of colbert's acting in it happened one night. cagney, who was a great comedy actor, just seems out-of-sync with his costar, davis. the script provides some decent lines and gags, but the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy.<br /><br />part of the problem is the soundtrack, which, like the delivery of davis and cagney, seems more suitable to a light drama than a comedy.<br /><br />jack carson, who played similar roles throughout his career, has more capably handled very similar material. in a fairly typical supporting role eugene palette delivers a respectable performance. in a slightly different role as an old west relic, harry davenport, is very good. but in one of his poorest performances, william frawley is quite irritating. his character's constant references to fictional cops are a poor effort at irony. <br /><br />i really love every one of these performers, and it is a shame that, as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and no better result than the bride came c.o.d.
