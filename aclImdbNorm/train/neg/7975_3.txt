as i sat in front of the tv watching this movie, i thought, "oh, what alfred hitchcock, or even brian depalma, could have done with this!" chances are, you will too. it does start out intrigueing. a british park ranger living in los angeles (collin firth) marries a pretty, demure brunette woman (lisa zane) whom he met in a park only a short time ago. then, one day she dissappears. the police are unable to find any documentation that she ever existed, and firth conducts his own search. so far, so good. just as he's about to give up, he turns to his womanizing best friend (billy zane), and they stumble onto her former life in l.a.'s sordid underground of drugs, nightclubs, and ametuer filmmaking, and then to her history of mental instability. at that point, firth's life is in danger, and the film falls apart. none of the characters from lisa zane's past are remotely interesting. the film moves slowly, and there's very little action. there is a subplot regarding missing drug money, but it's just a throwaway. no chases, no cliffhanging sequences, and no suspense. just some dull beatings and a lot of chat by boring characters. one thing worth noting, lisa zane and billy zane are brother and sister, but they never appear in a scene together. by the end of the movie, you're torn between wondering what might have been and trying to stay awake.
