i've almost forever been against the inclusion of songs in a movie. my belief was that the quality of the film would automatically be improved if only those extremely annoying songs would be axed. however, things have quickly changed after watching that horrible black (no songs) & this movie, page 3 (plenty of songs). while black was weak to an extreme, page 3 delivers a gripping story with some strong acting & good direction. the songs were almost incidental & blended in almost seamlessly with the film. there certainly weren't any women getting sprayed with water for no apparent reason from mysterious water sources while gyrating wildly on the streets at night.<br /><br />i was pleasantly surprised with the bold and unabashed approach used by the director. there was no glossing over of anything and almost every scene was completely believable.<br /><br />i'd recommend this films for hindi-speaking people with at least a slight understanding of mumbai life. the former because the english subtitling was below par and contained many errors which, at times, completely reversed the meaning of the actual statement. the latter because you'll definitely appreciate the accuracy of the depiction once you've lived it yourself.<br /><br />i'd definitely rank this as a work worthy of international recognition. the scenes with the gossiping drivers was a nice touch and it served simultaneously as a source of genuine humour as well as another perspective on the whole mishmash. the movie does fall short in a few places though, where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things which detract from the overall direction of the film.<br /><br />i also thought that a couple of the sadder scenes were not done very well. it was a touch amusing to watch, rather than arouse any feelings of sadness & the whole scene tended to come across as a bit foolish. these are minor issues though, because the film, on the whole, is truly a rare treat to watch.<br /><br />overall, it's a cynical, pessimistic outlook and a refreshing one at that! actors, not 'heroes' - that's the key. a chance to glimpse believable human beings in an extraordinary setting - everyday life. a behind-the-scenes look at the extent of the depravity and a rare ray of hope for indian cinema.<br /><br />8/10.
