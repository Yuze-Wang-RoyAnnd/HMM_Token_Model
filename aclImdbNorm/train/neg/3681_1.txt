my goodness is this movie bad. i was totally misled by my local movie review because this is certifiable garbage. yeah, yeah, good guys wear white, bad guys wear black....and the good guys always win. now go home and hug your kids, and feel how good hollywood has made you feel. blech! i can't believe this brain dead movie was made by wes craven. i'm guessing he needed a little money to pay the mortgage, so he made this piece of dung. it is the sort of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly believe they could do as good or better than such an experienced director.<br /><br />ya see, a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her daddy to do a wittle il' bad thing or he's gonna hurt her daddy. but being ms. all-american girl next door, we know she's gonna save the day and beat the bad guys...the end. girl power rocks.<br /><br />c'mon now, only an idiot would find this entertaining..."a roller coaster ride," let alone something fresh or new. all those "super-duper" reviews you see on this site are from industry hacks who are either making money off this flick, paying back a favor, or they have sold their souls to the devil.<br /><br />rachael mcadams is beautiful....yup, that's it. not a good performance, not a horrible one...she's just cute. she would have had to show a whole lot of skin to save this movie. she isn't tough enough to be a good female action lead.<br /><br />cillian murphy was at least passable in 28 days. but here he plays a dumb villain pretending to be a smart one. he gets his ass kicked to and fro by the 5'5'' mcadams, because after all, she was a cheerleader...and a field hockey player...and i'm sure she owns all the tae bo tapes...so she should be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist for hire. i wouldn't trust him to steal a pack of gum from 7-11.<br /><br />ya see, this movie was done before, except before they did it well. go re-rent any of the die hard movies. you have loved ones in danger, international terrorists, except the characters are more likable and believable and the bad guys are way more competent and interesting. i simply don't understand how hollywood can continue to make such crap as if they were oblivious to the proper models they can readily copy. no wonder movie revenues are down.<br /><br />throw your $6 down the toilet and save yourself 2 hours of your life you'll never get back.<br /><br />ciao, freddyshoop
