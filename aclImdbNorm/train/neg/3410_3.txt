yes, this movie has kids going to space camp and it starts out okay enough as you have the kids meeting one another and learning the ropes. then they introduce jinx, a robot that could not possibly exist in 1986 as they do not have anything with that kind of artificial intelligence now. kid becomes buddy with robot and robot repays the kid's kindness by shooting him and a group of other kids in this camp into outer space with a very limited oxygen supply and radios that do not have the signal to reach into space. this camp is also not very fun as these kids are put to real training and the instructors get all over them for failing missions or not doing the right things. give it a rest, they are there for fun, not to become astronauts just yet, just give them the experience of space flight not a military like camp. however, you do get to see joaquin phoenix in a fairly early role. so in the end a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of jinx and other factors you might as well had the kids battle space aliens on top of everything else that was happening in the movie as that would have made the movie a bit more enjoyable at least for me. probably for a few others as well, who else would like to see kate capshaw's face ripped apart by some strange super alien creature.
