unbelievably bad acting, a no good, unclear story and flashy images and slow-motions where they are needed the least: adrenaline is everything a movie should not be.<br /><br />georgina verbaan (a so-and-so dutch soap actress who hasn't attended her english classes) plays rich girl freya, who has the habit of 'thrill-seeking'. which basicly is doing dangerous stunts, break stuff and annoy people. and not in a fun jackass way. then there's dracko (rivas). he kinda leads the bunch but has other illegal activities on the side. then there's freya's dad (lockyer), who plays a dubious role as well. and, in the end, we got jason (debutant fyall), the boyfriend of freya.<br /><br />one day, freya gets disappeared and everybody seems involved but we, the viewer really don't care as nobody of the cast is either likable or believable, and the story doesn't make any sense.<br /><br />why was this even made? 2/10.
