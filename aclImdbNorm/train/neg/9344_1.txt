as others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists.<br /><br />we all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. but unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work. and even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new, inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie.<br /><br />the fact that this movie won a couple of bafta's shows how bad the british film industry is at the moment. i thought the aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the british industry is even worse.<br /><br />this movie is so bad i wouldn't even bother renting it from the weeklies section.<br /><br />do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth.
