i am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film. thought visually stunning like all of ang lee's work (each still frame seems worthy of a print), i was really disappointed by the film's disjointed pace. it really was too long.<br /><br />the story is set in civil war era missouri, and is about a young man (roedel) who joins the feral forces of the bushwackers, sort of renegade confederate sympathizers who conduct geurilla type fighting with the jayhawkers, their union counterparts. he and his close friend, jack bull chiles played by skeet ulrich, join the group after chile's father is shot point-blank and his home is burned, presumably by jayhawkers. the story follows roedel's and chiles' raiding adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war, including former slave who fights for the bushwhackers (daniel holt played by jeffery wright), and a war widow played by jewel.<br /><br />it seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point, it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped. for example, the agitation among roedel's group caused by former slave holt participating in the confederate cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding propriety and protocol, and then dropped until later in the movie. a young villian/bully bushwhacker hates roedel and directs much angst and violence against him, but, we never know why. some of the characters never seem to surface; i think that is because the movie embraces too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of history.<br /><br />the historical detail was excellent. i loved looking at the housing, furniture, clothes, etc., and i thought the lead actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters, though they stumbled a bit with the dialog. unless you really enjoy history or are a huge ang lee fan, though, take a pass on this one.
