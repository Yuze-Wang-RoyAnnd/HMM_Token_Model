to be completely honest,i haven't seen that many western films but i've seen enough to know what a good one is.this by far the worst western on the planet today.first off there black people in the wild west? come on! who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly, no no, completely retarded!secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns.thirdly whats with the asian chick speaking perfect english? if the setting is western,asia isn't where your going. finally,the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning.now don't get me wrong i'm not racist or white either so don't get ticked after reading this but this movie,this movie is the worst presentation of black people i have ever seen!
