"the rainmaker" released in 1956 - has some of the finest actors of its time. katharine hepburn, lloyd bridges, and burt lancaster being the principle players. not even they can save this completely over acted melodrama. first of all, hepburn is horribly miscast as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress, not even she can pull this off. she is too strong to be credible as being this much of a simpleton, and was just too old for the part. lancaster over acts to the extreme, and earl holliman is way too hammy and comes off more like jethro clampett. only bridges and the ever reliable wendell corey seem to rise above the cast a bit - but even they can only do so much. it seems like the 1950's was a time when katharine hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress, and that is fine. she just made a bad choice here. fortunately for her fans (me being among them) she didn't make too many of them. despite an a-list cast and good production values, it doesn't work.
