former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy rob lowe stars in a film set in a high security american prison . i had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like tobias in the first series of oz , but proximity isn`t that kind of film , it`s more like a " man on the run " film like the fugitive . it also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with james coburn putting in a cameo as the spokesman for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases
