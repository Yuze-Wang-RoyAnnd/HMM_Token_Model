this is not michael madsen's fault, he was hardly in it. this movie was just awful. if you want to laugh and be bored, go ahead and watch this movie. words cannot describe how idiotic it is. sorry michael. the cinematography was dark. all the other actors are unknowns. when watching it, it feels like a soft porn, but with no nudity or heated scenes. this movie had sexual overtones, since it is about a underground s & m killer. the acting was bad, except michael madsen's parts. he looked like he wanted to laugh. i hope he got paid well for this lousy movie. it is something i would not be proud of. it is not even a b movie for cable, it is more like a f and it should never be shown, ever.
