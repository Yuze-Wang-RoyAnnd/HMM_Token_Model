...not that all disney films are garbage.<br /><br />anyway, i saw "legend of boggy creek" first and absolutely loved the film. when i heard it had 2 sequels, i was ecstatic. i finally found a copy of this and watched it one night. i don't see how they can make a g-rated sequel to a horror film. the original is a movie/documentary about the fauke monster, and can scare anyone. "return" is for kids and should not be watched by anyone. i don't remember the plot too well, as it's been quite some time since i watched it and i will not watch it again, but... it's about these hunters coming to town and they go looking to kill bigfoot. three little kids sneek out of the house to stop them. a big monsoon comes through. the hunters get hurt, are saved by the kids. then they all hide out in a boat with a big piece of tarp on top and try to wait out the storm. then all of a sudden, bigfoot comes and does something really sick. i don't wanna ruin the ending for any of yas, but it's not scary. well....
