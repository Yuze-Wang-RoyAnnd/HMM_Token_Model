i think that can sum up this show about as well as anything. batman tas may be the worst thing to ever happen to cartoons based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has measured up yet. it's just too damn good. was batman beyond good? "yeah, but it was no tas." is justice league good? "it's not too bad, but it's no tas."<br /><br />the batman is certainly no tas, either, but i won't hold that against it. it would be unfair and besides, it has plenty of other problems with it.<br /><br />the concept of a younger, less experienced batman fighting crime is a fine one, and at times the art is very nice. but all of the rest of the time, the art is worthless americanime, and this betrays a lot of the flaws of the show itself. it is paced, written, and designed like an americanime. if i wanted to watch jackie chan adventures, i'd watch jackie chan adventures. or i could just bang my head into a wall any time and get the same effect. the joker is a homicidal, mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits, unpredictability, and clever gadgets to fight batman. when he is forced to fight hand to hand, he will either resort to something cheap or be totally outmatched. he is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kung-fu and can leap into twenty feet into the air, accompanied by speed lines. if they had wanted to do that with a villain, there were other less important characters they could have used or *gasp* they could have created a new one entirely. and it's not that re-imaginings are a bad thing, don't get me wrong. tas (there i go again) took mr. freeze from your standard icegun-wielding b villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character. of course freeze wasn't exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an upgrade, but the point stands. what the batman does is it takes everything you liked about batman comics and lore and takes a large, smelly dump on them. guess what? they were eating corn.<br /><br />it's obvious this show can't stand against tas but stand it on its own legs and it still doesn't work for me. the plots aren't good and they don't develop any better. they've been written for the demographic of children under twelve. should children be able to enjoy a show? of course they should. this shouldn't be an adult show with swearing, nudity, and gratuitous violence. but the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels by all ages. this show misses that mark.<br /><br />is this show a tas? no, of course not. the problem is it's not even a jlu.
