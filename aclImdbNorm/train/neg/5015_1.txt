as a movie critic for several dutch websites, i have to see lot's of movies, and not all very good ones. some movies are so bad, you won't be surprised that they are released straight on video. with taboo, i'am surprised that it is released on video at all. this is really low budget bad quality bad written rubbish. <br /><br />a group of youngsters plays a game of taboo. they write down their most sickening wish or act, and later on people are murdered for their taboo's. the question is, should we believe what we see?<br /><br />the movie has a potential interesting plot-twist, and i won't give it away here. but what could have been interesting stays stupid, bad acted and without any reason.<br /><br />some of the actors have played in bigger titles before, so why on earth did they sign up for this? if you see this anywhere, try to dodge it. there is no logic, no human sense of quality in this movie.
