this is the worst movie i have seen for years! it starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way. i thnik when is something going to happen in this film,,,, and the the acting is worse. the ending lifts it a bit and saves the movie from a total flop. mark wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. sorry tim burton batman was good but this one sucks.
