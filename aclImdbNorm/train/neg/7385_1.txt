the movie is boring, the characters and scenarios are unrealistic, unbelievable, the action is hilarious. this movie is a big mess. it almost seems like when the action music kicks in, the most impressive stunt is running. either voice is dubbed over with mr. mcgregor or steven sang too much and it changed his voice. there is way too much dialog in this movie, and extremely bad acting on everyones behalf. the movie is great sleep therapy. the fighting is laughable. the eye shape shift effect on the evil designer drug addict females was decent. the main villain was a joke and his character was poorly developed. the main villain was used to explain the story through interrogation, he would just throw random plots in such as (spoiler) "ctx (his designer drug)is going to be in the water supply" which is never addressed in the conclusion or even mentioned again in the movie. this movie is highly recommended to pass.
