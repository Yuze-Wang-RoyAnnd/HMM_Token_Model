the acting was horrible and they got both of the sports wrongggg.......not only did they get the figure skating rules wrong, but also they rules of girls ice hockey. in girls ice hockey you cannot check. you also don't block for someone. not all they girls are disgusting gross mean and big. i play hockey and i'm only 4'11 and have been asked to go to schools like the one in the movie. also not all hockey players hate figure skaters. a lot of current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves. also we skate a lot faster then the ones in the movie. i was embarrassed by the movie it gave people the idea that we suck.......although i must mention that it is difficult to transition between the sports because of the toe pick on the figure skates.....also some of those twirly moves katelin was doing on the ice you couldn't do in a regular hockey game. she basically tripped the person, which is illigal. its also unrealistic that she would get a hockey scholarship when she figure skates. that really made me angry that scholarship would normally be used to someone who could benefit the team.
