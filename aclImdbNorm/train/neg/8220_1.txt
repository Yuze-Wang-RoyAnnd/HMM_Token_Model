less than 10 minutes into this film i wanted it to end as it was painful. all this "horror" movie was about was a group of whiny bitches doing stupid things for 90 minutes, arguing, crying and screaming. do not let the positive reviews fool you as this really is a terrible movie and you really shouldn't watch it.<br /><br />the movies plot had potential to be something great, but it just doesn't happen. a group of five "teenage" girls are driving home one night when they find themselves being pursued by a crazed female driver who wants to kill them. two minutes into the movie, and the characters are already arguing and this doesn't stop. all we have for 90 minutes is a bunch of girls whining, crying, screaming, "acting" and arguing. none of the dialogue is even remotely interesting too, so you don't get to really know these characters or enjoy them.<br /><br />the acting was terrible and i was shocked to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers. none of these women looked a day under 20, and one of them easily looked like she was nearly 30 years old. at least get people who look the age. none of them gave even remotely decent performances, and just seemed like they were picked off the street or were friends of the director with no acting abilities. the "actress" who played the killer overdone it, but she at least showed something that the other girls didn't - a little bit of talent.<br /><br />the characters don't help things because these girls are a bunch of whiny, stupid bitches. that is all i can really say about them, and it did not help that they all survived. if i have to go into detail, in one scene the girls are being chased by the killer and having their car knocked a lot. one girl injures herself and is whining about it...four of them aren't wearing seat-belts...what do you expect? one of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killer...and you all just happen to be conveniently "too hurt" to help? whatever.<br /><br />the filming of the movie is absolutely terrible. i don't care if this movie had a budget the size of a peanut, the filming was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie. the cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls, pushed up against a window somewhere and the amount of times the camera blurred out, shook and brushed up against an "actress" was horrendous. it was also grainy, and at times you couldn't hear what characters were saying (not that it was anything worth listening to).<br /><br />supposedly the killers car in the movie (that supposedly got hit, even though we only heard the accident) is actually the directors car in real life. no wonder they didn't show the car getting hit! this movie is so cheap, they can't even show a car getting a little scratched up. oh, gotta mention the soundtrack also...if that's what it was. it was horrid...sad one second, then hard rock the next. <br /><br />at the end of the day, five across the eyes just feels like a terrible home-movie filmed in the middle of the road at night with a bunch of stupid girls screaming and arguing for 90 minutes. it doesn't help when the script is terrible, the scares/tension/suspense and (hardly even any gore to make up for it) are absent, the acting is terrible and the picture quality and filming are horrendous.<br /><br />this was a horrible low-budget movie. avoid it at all costs.<br /><br />1/10
