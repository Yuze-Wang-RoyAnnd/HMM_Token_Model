she may have an oscar and a golden globe, but this film shows why she also is a perennial razzie nominee. to do a film that is so bad must be an indication that she needs money. she could do ads on why you shouldn't talk on a cell phone while driving, especially at night on the way to a crowded mall.<br /><br />susan montford should stick to producing (shoot 'em up ) as she is not very good as a writer/director.<br /><br />she is accosted by four thugs in the mall parking lot, and the first thing they do is tell her they have a gun. what does she do? she starts pushing and cursing them like she knows martial arts or something. she manages to get away, but gets lost in the forest after crashing. why didn't she run to someones house? we get four thugs with guns chasing a lady with a toolbox. of course, their guns are no match for her wrench. ha! of course, she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver. those poor thugs.<br /><br />now, she's home for christmas - and she brought a gun!
