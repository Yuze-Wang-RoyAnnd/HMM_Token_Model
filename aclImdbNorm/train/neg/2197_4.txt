this one hearkens back to the days of the matin'ee, when kids with nowhere else to hang out took their dates to the balcony after dumping their younger siblings below. it didn't matter what was on the screen - the little kids would sit through it and the big kids would ignore it. the adults, of course, would never see it.<br /><br />but they put it on video, anyway, along with most of the other creaky, low-budget "b" horror flicks of the golden age...of television. this film's inherent and unintentional humor is derived from stale ideology (the "bad girls" harvested to replace poor jan's crushed body - they had it comin'), overused plot (a mad scientist, trying to play god), violent yet conscientious monster (whose presence in the heretofore-normal-seeming scientist's rural lab is never fully explained), and acting that polarizes at wooden or over-the-top.<br /><br />this is a great party film, assuming your guests enjoy adding dialog and commentary to otherwise abominable cinematic exploits. in fact, should you or your guests prefer more passive entertainment, this film is also available on video in its "mystery science theater 3000" treatment, in which the host and puppets of the cult tv series make the necessary additions for you.
