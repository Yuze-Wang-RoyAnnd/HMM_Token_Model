this movie is awful. at the end of it you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can't get back. the "twist" ending is very contrived. the character development leading up to this ending is not consistent with their final actions at the conclusion. ninety minutes of preparation-- with the premise that the rob lowe character will die on christmas eve-- is explained away in literally ninety seconds of "no we were just tricking you." then the rob lowe character is not even upset about it! "i will forgive you if you can forgive me," is as upset as he gets. if someone took weeks to convince me i was about to die and then said "no, sorry , just fooling you" i would raise some serious hell. i don't feel bad about giving away the spoiler because i might be able to save some of you out there from watching. please save yourself and don't watch this movie.
