this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative. it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection.<br /><br />the animation is well done but i feel like it is too presentational. i would have preferred more images from behind, more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to me.<br /><br />but for a hollywood style film it works ok but it is very derivative of aardman films and this is bothering to me. perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voice-over.<br /><br />i think the voice over is too glib.
