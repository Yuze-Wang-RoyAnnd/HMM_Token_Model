the social commentary was way overblown and the mystery itself is built and solved through a series of implausible coincidences that were entirely unbelievable. nothing has changed in fitz's personal life in the past decade that makes it remotely interesting. <br /><br />i even had trouble understanding why he was complaining about his stay in australia as compared to the opportunities to solve mysteries that he has in england. can he not insinuate himself on the australian police? it seems like a very artificial plot point to get him involved in a crime investigation.<br /><br />the latter episodes of the original series were pretty melodramatic and implausible, sometimes bordering on silliness, and this one picks up that mantle rather than returning to the focus of series one. sad.
