unfortunately this film, 54 was a pathetic attempt of the true story of 'studio 54.' the only thing that was good about the picture was 'mike myers' who was a joy to watch. 'neve cambpell,' although her role was little was unfortunately bad. the bottom line is that this film lacked a good performance from the actors, except one and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt for a good screenplay.
