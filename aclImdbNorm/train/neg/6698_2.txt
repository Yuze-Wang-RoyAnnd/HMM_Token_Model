to say funky forest: the first contact is a bad movie is an understatement of incredible proportions. i can really get into a good art house film, even a surreal and twisted romp like el topo, naked lunch, and survive style 5+, because those movies actually have something worth discussing when the credits roll.<br /><br />fffc attempts at every avenue to be this deep and intellectual, essentially there is no substance in this movie. this movie is badly done, the visuals in this movie are not inspiring, the dialog is worse, the musical numbers destroy this movie.. i chuckled for guitar brothers, but that was immediately wiped out by something completely unnecessary, and irrelevant. it attempted to be deep and meaningful i think, but its just pretentious disoriented nonsense. freshman film students without a camera could craft something more interesting.<br /><br />guitar brothers and the stand up routines in between skits get 1 point each, everything else is just badly paced, pseudo-creative, heavy handed attempts at being as good as films by other real directors like, sogo ishii, david lynch, and jodoworsky. give me a break. i am convinced that people that rave about fffc are doing so because they have no idea of what they saw, because it was nothing but mild pertinent statements here and there mixed with stupidity and blended until you puke on your own shoes.<br /><br />this movie was an extreme disappointment, coming off the high that was survive style 5+, a film that actually has meaning, combined with excellent use of scenery, cinematography, catchy dialog, funny moments, good soundtrack, excellent performances, fantastic pacing and flow. fffc features the exact opposite in every way, boring scenery (20 minutes staring at a bland beach at night? a completely white stage? alien balls floating in white space? a dinky school hallway and then a... school hallway?), terrible cinematography, forgettable dialog, nothing funny or humorous, save the fact you just wasted your life for two hours, soundtrack?, amateurish performances, uneven, disjointed, and often flat out dragging pacing, zero flow whatsoever.<br /><br />there are those that claim this is what makes fffc a great movie, that it is so unconventional at every turn that its pure genius. this is simply a way to stroke your own ego it seems, because "unpredictable" could be a good quality for a film if it wasn't coupled with "boring", "innane", and "terrible". personally i have spoken with two people who admitted to me that fffc was terrible when they left the theater, but overwhelming rave by art-house elitist made them watch the movie again and then come back to me with a... "hey it was pretty good i liked it".<br /><br />i'm going to put my foot down, this movie is slop, i don't care if roger ebert says this film is the best thing he's ever watched since he lost his own virginity. "the emperor's new cloak" i say... this movie is no way indicative of the other psychedelic/trippy films to come from japan in the last 10 years. taste of tea, party 7, and kamikaze girls are much better movies (even with a low budget), and none can honestly compare with survive style 5+. watch fffc only if your interested in making a pretentious pile of nothing on a shoestring budget.
