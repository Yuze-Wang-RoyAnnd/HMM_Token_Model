every generation fully believes it is living in the end times. this has been true for thousands of years now. and movies like this feed on this. how did they get the great orson welles to narrate this train wreck? this is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of armageddon. it tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made, making it obviously dated and kind of silly.<br /><br />the reenactments look like they are out of "unsolved mysteries" but without the high production values. people should have been embarrassed to take part in this.<br /><br />in short, the movie is dated, silly, reactionary, and useless. good if you want a good laugh, but not good enough to actually look for.
