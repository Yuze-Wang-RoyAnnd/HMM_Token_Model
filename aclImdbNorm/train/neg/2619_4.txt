it is a good film for kids who love dogs. it runs a bit slow early on but ends if a flurry of gooped up de vil. the basic plot is the same as the first movie. the bright side of the movie for adults is the talking bird that thinks it is a dog. the bird talks like a human(eric idle of monty python) and barks like a dog. it is the comedy that the film needed more of. see it in the matinee so you don't have to pay full price or wait for it to appear on disney.
