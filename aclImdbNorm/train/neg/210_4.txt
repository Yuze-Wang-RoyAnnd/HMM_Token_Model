maybe you shouldn't compare, but wild style and style wars are original hip hop. beat street does have a lot of the original artists of early hip hop, but they've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break, of course for some it was and that's nice. but if you view this as original hip hop culture you're wrong. it's overproduced and has a hollywood sauce. rather look for the first two movies i mentioned. they have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving. this is probably because although the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful, the music and dancing is what the people love about it. me, i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of hip hop (i was so glad when round '86 a new generation of now classic hip hop artists appeared, like krs one, public enemy, ultramagnetic mc's, jungle brothers, bizmarkie to name a few), and i still don't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn't work for me. i mean, wild style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic. of course tastes differ and that's alright. but as far as i'm concerned, this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten.
