any one who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this dreadful remake. alex baldwin trying to imitate the late steve mcqueen in a word for word remake just doesn't work. while baldwin has done some admirable work this is a flop from start to finish. mcqueen had charisma, never try to compete with a star. as for kim in the role of ali mcgraw enough said. mcqueen looked dangerous, menacing and believable as doc, the film had excitement and suspense,baldwin and company made this into a comedy,i laughed the one and only time i saw this miserable film. and that dreadful hairstyle for michael madsen who is one of today's more exciting and believable actors! did the makeup people have it in for michael, what were they thinking.if you wish to see movie-making the way it was under sam peckinpah's direction get the original!
