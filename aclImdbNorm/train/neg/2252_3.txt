so i had heard from a few people that this film had brought them to tears in the theater. as i watched it for the first time i was expecting another romantic, tear-jerking barbra streisand film; something like the way we were. i was certainly wrong. the chemistry between the two main characters, esther hoffman and her john howard, was nonexistent, making it impossible to get attached to the characters. there wasn't anything romantic about it. streisand's character fell for an alcoholic drug addict who couldn't sing a single note without making me want to hit the fast-forward button. at one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later. there's nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who can't seem to realize it until he actually dies. parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on, and i kept asking myself when it was going to end.<br /><br />the death of john howard was completely predictable. there was totally obvious foreshadowing of his reckless behavior early on in the movie, and when he died i felt no emotion whatsoever. it wasn't a tragic accident, it was him basically being an idiot. not to mention throughout the movie i was distracted by his hideous beard.<br /><br />the only parts of this movie worth seeing are the streisand songs. the ending of the movie when she sings "with one more look at you/watch closely now" was my reason for giving this film a whopping 3/10. those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie i actually felt an emotion other than irritation and anger.
