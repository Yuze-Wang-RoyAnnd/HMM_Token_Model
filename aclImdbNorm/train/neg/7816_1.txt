it really doesn't matter that superman comic books are unbelievably naive and their target is ten year old. what matters is that "superman returns" is bad movie. <br /><br />in the beginning,a question for you dear readers, how many of you actually believe that superman will be defeated by bald kevin spacey? anyone? just as i thought. no spoilers here. so let's get to some major issues right now.<br /><br />firstly, this movie looks like commercial (scene in the bar with superman/clark kent drinking budweiser is only scene which looks as it supposed to). imagine commercial of superman, two and half hour long. let's be serious this isn't "amadeus" or "the departed". you actually feel, that this movie is way too long. and special effects are not so special by the way.<br /><br />secondly, scenario is silly. sometimes even if something is acceptable in comic, in cinema it looks just stupid. and it's like that in this case. of course dialogs are disgrace. i can't believe somebody took money to write them. how many times we will be fed with villain making speeches? how many times laws of physics will be raped? (jesus, it's not only the matter of superman's strength but also a resistance of materials his dealing with.) how many times lois lane will be fooled by kent? how many times hollywood producers will seek for a story in a trashy comic books? since there's hard to make a good story, why having a weak story for a starter? it just doesn't work. guys, get a grip. try harder, please. or just stay on this strike forever, who cares. i got the feeling that wga is permanently on strike. no offense. i'm not questioning the lame money those people are paid, but the quality of the product they deliver. in this case there is no quality at all. (at this point you may ask yourself: is it that bad? yes it is.)<br /><br />thirdly, acting is weak, which is quite a surprise since bryan singer (usual suspects) is directing. kevin spacey is having fun, but he's the only one. audience is rather not in the mood for jokes. thing is that comic book hero can be developed into real personality, with clear motivations but also with doubts, fears, some depth. in this case nobody did that job, and characters aren't really interesting.<br /><br />finally, whole effort of creators turns this movie into parody. second unit is so bad that attracts attention, since there's nothing interesting going on on screen anyway. the harder they try (if they try), the funnier it gets (but it isn't laugh you could expect).<br /><br />final conclusion? one word: shame. <br /><br />this particular movie, ladies and gents, is camp. don't waste your time and don't waste your money too. stay home, read a book.
