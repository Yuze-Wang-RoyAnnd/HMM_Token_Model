oh my god. i bought this movie and...i...watched...the...whole...thing. . . okay, it's going to be alright... i'l know i'll be okay in a month or two. some time soon i hope to be rid of the flash backs. i was going to eat something after the movie but i just can't seem to get up the courage to try and hold any food down at the moment. bad? yes bad. very bad. bad bad bad bad bad. wait, bad doesn't seem to get the message across in quite the right way. hmm... there isn't a word to describe just how awful.... not awful... hmm disgustingly horribly casted/acted/filmed/directed/written. now i don't know what to do but throw it out. possibly burn it i wouldn't want it to end up at the bottom of an architectural dig a thousand years from now. the worst movie ever since "hey happy"
