is this film a joke? is it a comedy? surely it isn't a serious thriller? there is no suggestion that there is any intended humor, but on quite a few occasions the poor acting, poor directing, and appalling script had the audience laughing out loud in the cinema. the plot is acceptable - a promising young artist just reaching his peak shot dead by an assassin he walks in on by mistake. the killer sees the young artists work portfolio he is carrying and decides to attend an exhibition of his work. at the exhibition the assassin meets the dead artists sister and they end up falling in love. it is all very predictable stuff and the end will not have anyone guessing as it is so poorly scripted. the film takes place mainly in and around vienna, austria, and shows what a beautiful city it is. do not waste your time on this film though, unless you are studying how not to act, direct or script a film!
