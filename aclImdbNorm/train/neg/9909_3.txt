this was not a well done western. you've got this nut riding around in the blazing sun in a buggy with a parasol over it, killing people for his own reasons. you've got this same person sitting in a snow cave during a blizzard, cutting off pieces of his anatomy which have been frostbitten. then you've got some woman in a house out in the middle of somewhere shooting wolves that are not there. what is the point of this film? couldn't bruce dern find something better to do? this was a waste of film.
