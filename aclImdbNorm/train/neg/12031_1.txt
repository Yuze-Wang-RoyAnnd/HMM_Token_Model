first of all this movie is not a comedy; unless you really force yourself you can hardly laugh. secondly, the movie is slow and boring. the acting is not bad but not special. there is a lucky luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town... you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie. religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule. there is a similar subject comedy '' the home teachers'' ; this had some good moments. my final comment is: do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring film.
