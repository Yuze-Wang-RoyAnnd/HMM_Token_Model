this movie was so bad it was laughable. i couldn't resist watching it though. the plot is standard, the acting quite horrible (supporting cast such as the nutty neighbor and the lawyer friend were better actors). kind of amusing if you have some time to waste and like seeing the conclusion to a dramatic plot.<br /><br />the headliner who plays "kathy" was just fascinating because i couldn't decide if her deadpan, flat affect was the result of bad surgery or simply bad acting (i decided it was both). this leaves the script to comment on, which was pretty awful. pat remarks, idiotic decisions, and reckless stupidity on the part of every character in the movie. maybe this is what was so riveting; i don't know. i just watched it to see how bad it could be. (actually the dialog doesn't even qualify to be called "cliche'" - but it's almost completely inane.)<br /><br />all in all, very bad, cheaply made movie. the sets, the same scenes (a house, a building) were shown over and over with no artistry or actual tie-in to the action; more like props that were randomly dropped into the action in a bad play. a chase scene could have been shot by any juvenile in a warehouse or an old school: poorly shot, cheap props, minimal action.... and i still wanted to see the ending. go figure.
