not a knock on korman as he was very funny on the carol burnett show. he was also good at playing secondary characters in mel brooks' movies ("high anxiety" comes to mind). he is, however, not a person who can carry a movie in dueling roles no less. this one is basically a "gremlins" knockoff, following a tradition of such movies as "critters" and "ghoulies". it is not a very good knockoff either, on par with "ghoulies", but with a much lighter tone to it as it is no where near as dark as that movie got. in fact, this one is too light and frothy, and unfortunately many of the jokes end up falling flat. though i did give it a 3 for a score, this is only because there is a movie that is even a worse "gremlin" knockoff. if you watched mystery science theater 3000 you know the one i am talking about...the infamous "hobgoblins". this one has a guy finding a little critter in some underground place (i only saw this movie once a long time ago so i don't remember everything to clearly) and it starts out friendly enough. however, this creature quickly becomes unfriendly and of course more are spawned and that is the movie. more misses than hits in the joke department, and it is also really lame to see korman playing the evil brother role. best to skip this one, but then you may want to check it out just for kicks.
