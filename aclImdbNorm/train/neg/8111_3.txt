another great movie by costa-gavras. it's a great presentation of the situation is latin america and the us involvement in latin american politics. the facts might or might not be accurate but it is a fact that the us was deeply involved in coups and support of latin american dictatorships.<br /><br />despite this though the spirit of the movie follows the typical leftist/communist propaganda of the cold war era. costa-gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his movies are always biased. for example he presents the us actions as brutal and inhumane, while representing tupamaros' extremist activities as something positive.<br /><br />as it turned out it was a blessing for uruguay and the rest of the latin america that the us got involved. europe is filled with poor east european prostitutes. i never heard of poor uruguayan or chilean girls prostituting themselves en masse as it happens in most east european countries. the us was fighting a dirty war and god bless us all the monster of soviet communism was defeated. it is unfortunate the us had to do what it did in latin america (and elsewhere) but sometimes you need to play dirty. this is not an idealistic world as costa-gavras and matamoros like to believe. had matamoros come to power in uruguay, we would've had another ukraine in latin america.<br /><br />all in all this movie follows corrupt and bankrupt leftist ideology of times past and tries to pass it as idealistic and morally correct.
