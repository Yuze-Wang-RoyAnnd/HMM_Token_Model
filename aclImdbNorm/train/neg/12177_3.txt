since the 70s, writer/producer/director charles band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science-fiction, fantasy and horror b-movies. some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget to maximum effect; many of them are pretty bad. trancers (1985) was one of those rare gems.<br /><br />a terminator style tale of time-travel and action, trancers saw tim thomerson playing jack deth, a future cop given the task of tracking down bad-guy whistler, who travels into the past by inhabiting the body of an ancestor. whistler is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers, converting them into obedient zombies (the 'trancers' of the title), and attempts to alter the course of history by killing off the ancestors of the leaders of the future. jack follows him to 1985, determined to stop him.<br /><br />in this 1991 sequel, jack is still living in 1985. having destroyed whistler, he has settled down and married leena (helen hunt), the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie. but, for jack, things don't stay calm for long, and trouble appears in the form of whistler's brother, e.d. wardo, who is trying to build a trancer army.<br /><br />trancers ii lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was. the story is difficult to pick up if you haven't seen the first film (or at least not for a long while), and there is loads of unimpressive action and a few poor special effects. gone is the inventiveness and wit that made trancers so much fun; instead we get some cheesy one-liners and a script that feels like it was written on-the-fly.<br /><br />about the only reason i can give for recommending this film to fans of the genre is the cast, which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of sci-fi and horror movies: jeffrey combs, barbara crampton, richard lynch, martine beswicke. unfortunately, most of them seemed to be having an 'off day' whilst filming trancers ii, and performances are mediocre at best.<br /><br />the trancers series obviously has its fans; four further sequels have since been churned out. unless the quality has taken up massive upward swing, i can't imagine them being any good.
