<br /><br />i'm not sure who decides what category a movie fits into, but this movie is not a horror movie. as for the story, it was fairly interesting, but rather slow. i was especially disappointed with the ending though.<br /><br />**spoiler**<br /><br />tell me why on earth does she run over to her uncle's(?) home without at least calling the detective or the police first? she knows exactly what's going on at that point, plus she has a video tape as proof. instead, she runs over there and starts going nuts and saying "i know everything, i have proof! you didn't expect proof, did you?!" then she acts surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking over to her as if he's going to harm her. well duh! of course he's going to harm you idiot, you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything. what a dumb ending.
