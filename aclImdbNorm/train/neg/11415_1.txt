well, awful is just the first name. this movie is a clich'e-ridden piece of junk. a high school comedy setup in a military training camp. i'm sorry i had to give this 1 star which it did not deserve.<br /><br />this may contain spoilers:<br /><br />just about everything is totally forced, unconvincing and unrealistic. the hepo (military police) will not come to get you if you don't make your appearance, especially not on your wedding day. the actors were pretty embarrassed during this scene, because the scene didn't work as it was so highly unlikely. you can sense it in their voices. even if they were not such bad actors, they wouldn't have been able to save the scene. <br /><br />next the guy has to exercise in his wedding suit. no, there was no time to get him an uniform first. man, this is great cinematography! i will remember this scene for the rest of my life.<br /><br />there are also girls in the camp--exciting--one of'em even a model, though not looking that great--and the baddest actress i've ever seen. i doubt in hollywood they would let her say a single line in a b movie. <br /><br />okay girls in the military! now this is getting fun. the girls are even placed on the same floor, so we can sneak to their room at night! in reality they would be placed in a different building a quarter mile away, separated by two fences with barbed wire. <br /><br />there are tanks available we can use for a fun ride in our spare time, of which we have plenty. no, the tanks are not locked, and the ignition keys are inserted. no one will notice the engine sounds, especially not at night.<br /><br />there is a bunch of sex scenes and references and all are below the waste line. we need those so the sexually obsessed germans will like the movie as well. switzerland is too small a market for any feature film. well done!<br /><br />one sex scene takes place in the kitchen. surely, none of those facilities are ever locked. the military routines are as sloppy as they can get.<br /><br />in the end of the brainless flick, the mafia hit men are about the take revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him! because he deserted his fianc'ee! sure i buy that, the italians are that way--a jealous bunch (not). <br /><br />the bad guys attempt to do this in open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses. not at night in a dark alley. again, military training grounds (where there is shooting with live ammo) are open to the public, anyone can freely drive or walk in there. there are no such things as guards or fences. <br /><br />the deed however is prevented by the good captain timely launching a rocket into the italians' car. the explosion knocks the hit men and the enraged fianc'ee off their feet. no one in 40 feet distance is hurt when the car is blown to smithereens. it's a comedy, remember.<br /><br />okay. it's a comedy, i got that, and i can live with that. no realism needed. filmmakers can easily get way with this if it is hilariously, side splitting funny, or entertaining, interesting, challenging. unfortunately it is none of those. it's just embarrassing. a rip-off from brainless american comedies. the latter are at least done professionally, with no amateur actors.<br /><br />it is pretty boring and predictable, a waste of time and energy, especially to those sitting through the entire movie as i unfortunately did. yawn.
