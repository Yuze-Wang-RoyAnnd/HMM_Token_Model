i went into this movie expecting it to be really god-awful. and it was. i really felt sorry for the star-studded cast- kathy bates was a wonderful actress... before she made this movie- vince vaughn and paul giamatti were disappointing as usual but miranda richardson couldn't put in one of the fabulous performances i know and love her for. fred's dad, played by trevor peacock (of vicar of dibley fame, amongst others), had about one line.<br /><br />the plot was predictable and all over the place, and the humour was... lacking. (however, there was one part of the movie where santa enters the house of a jewish family... that made me laugh just because their expressions were classic) don't see this movie unless your only other alternative is having a head-on collision with a train (actually- maybe the train would be better...)
