the proverb "never judge a book by it's cover", was coined as a warning to those who fail to look beneath the surface. <br /><br />as i viewed the artwork to,"king of the ants" i instantly thought horror! the arcane imagery proudly displayed on the cover & back spoke of a dark vision, the synopsis promised a story of murder, betrayal, & retribution. instead what i discovered beneath that surface, was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock.<br /><br />"king of the ants" features chris l. mckenna as sean crawley, an average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. except sean crawley is someone you don't care about, never once did i feel any compassion or sympathy for this character. in fact he's downright unlikable, but not as much as daniel baldwin (ray mathews)who turns in an uninspired performance as a made all the worst by the utterly laughable dialogue he is forced to recite. throw in kari wuhrer as a grieving widow who apparently has unconditional trust (esp. in the homeless), and little to no common sense, and george wendt as duke, which is basically a sober norm from cheers but mean!<br /><br />now there are a couple of interesting "hallucination" sequences in this film (the source of the cover images) but this film never delves further into that world. it prefers to bombard you with unmotivated characters, bad dialogue, and unlikely event after unlikely event. oh the horror!
