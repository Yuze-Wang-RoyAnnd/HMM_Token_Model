have you ever sat watching a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have gone by and suddenly you realize that you have actually seen the movie before? that happened to me with "the young graduates". the cover of the video box, if you can find the video, is extremely deceiving. i'd swear that the two women on the cover aren't even in the film.<br /><br />anyway, i was either born a decade too late to appreciate the finer points of this film or...it is simply pointless junk. i'm heavily leaning toward the latter but i guess some out there have developed a connection to this movie.<br /><br />hmm...plot. a plot. let's see...there must be a plot around here somewhere. nope, i can't find it. it's pretty much about some high school seniors acting dopey and doing drugs and speaking in a language that became outdated decades ago. one of the female students has a crush on her teacher. the teacher has a frigid wife (whom he indeed refers to as an iceberg) so he is receptive to the girl's advances.<br /><br />there's a lot of driving around and inane dialogue and plenty of spastic dancing. our cat, booboo, was transfixed by the dancing high school kids. she watched with amazing intensity as the dancers gyrated and shook out on the dance floor. it's nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic. 1/10
