this movie shows a row of sketches, which partly pass over into one another. i realized the passing over late in the movie, at first it only irritated me. <br /><br />many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact, using absurdity and obscenity. the attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails.<br /><br />my personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie (my god, it hurts in my head every time i call it "movie"): a bold attempt to turn nothing into something great. but it failed. at least the director made something out of nothing. but it isn't something good.<br /><br />many movies didn't turn out as funny as they were planned, but this one tops them all. it's the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making. no. to correct myself, it's even worse than that. a movie with gags so bad, that they aren't funny at all. it's not even fun to watch the lead-actor, writer and director (all three the same guy by the way) perish by drowning in the sea of bad movies. the movie is too bad for that.
