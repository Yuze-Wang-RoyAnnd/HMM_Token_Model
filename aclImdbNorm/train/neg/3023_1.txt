it's rare that i come across a film this awful, this annoying and this irritating. it is without doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen.<br /><br />the plot, when it's not a blur of confusing and pointlessly over flashy editing, is ludicrous. why did domino become such a bad-ass tough bitch? because her gold fish died when she was a kid and this "traumatic" event left her emotionally stunted, and hating everyone. when the dialogue is not clich'ed or banal, it's littered with laughable lines such as: "there are three kinds of people in this world: the rich... the poor... and everyone else". at one point the bounty hunters have some guy tied up in the back of their bus who has a combination number tattooed on his arm. because of a confusing mobile phone call, instead of rolling his sleeve up and just reading the number, they blow off his arm with a shotgun. at another point, the bounty hunters take a bomb to a meeting arranged with the mafia and threaten to set the bomb off unless the mafia let them go!? clearly not going to the meeting would have been just too easy.<br /><br />keira knightley is unconvincing and dreadfully miscast. mickey rourke does manage to salvage some credibility from this mess.<br /><br />i have enjoyed some of tony scott's previous films, true romance being one, but all i could think while suffering this drivel was that it must have been made by a complete idiot.
