i'm afraid that you'll find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a 10 are highly christian. i am not. if you are looking for a christian movie, i recommend this film. if you are looking for a good general movie, i'm afraid you'll need to go elsewhere.<br /><br />i was annoyed by the characters, and their illogical behaviour. the premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong. one scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal, and then the character goes on to say that it was jesus who taught us this. i find that offensive: are we to believe that "thou shalt not steal" came from jesus? i suppose he wrote the ten commandments? and stealing was acceptable before that? i rented the movie from netflix. i should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments. oh well.
