where to begin, there's so much wrong and horrible about this movie i am not sure where to start. okay, the two stooges who wrote this crapper. joseph green and rex carlton, first they couldn't make up their so-called minds for a name. my guess they split the difference, that's why the main title is brain that wouldn't die, but the end screen says head that wouldn't die. neither one knows anything about the medical profession. after all doctors take oaths to "do no harm". killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered "harm". plus, a little thing called blood and tissue matching. rejection would spell death for jan in the pan. plus who keeps a patch work monster. what medical school did bill graduate from, frankenstien university? old fu, or mad scientist tech? the monster had no name, that bugs the hell out of me. plus, the brilliant surgeon doctor bill cortner doesn't know how to keep a patient sedated? all and all a disaster of a movie, it's incredibly stupid and unwatchable, except on mst3k. i give it the thanksgiving turkey.
