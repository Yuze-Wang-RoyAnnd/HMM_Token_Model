whoever wrote up "redline" as a great car movie must be getting paid off by daniel sadek to promote this ultra crappy flaming, steaming pile of amateur crap. easily the worst automotive movie or any movie ever made. this makes showgirls look like citizen kane.<br /><br />take every cheesy clich'e out of an 80s action tv series, put in some really crappy special effects and lame characters with no relevance and you have living proof that daniel sadek should not write screenplays and produce movies but should remain in the real estate business.<br /><br />this is such a lame movie with such a lame plot and the most contrived action sequences ever. what offends me is not that the makers of this film are idiots but that they consider the movie going public to be idiots enough to fall for this crap.
