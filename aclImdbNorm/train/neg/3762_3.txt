i got this movie out of blockbuster in one of those racks were you can get like 5 movies for 20 bucks. i'd have to say i got my money's worth on this one. i had expected horrible dialogue, crappy monsters, and shaky cameras. well, as meatloaf said, two outta three ain't bad.<br /><br />the acting is bad, though not as bad as some movies i've seen. or maybe i've watched so many low budget movies recently i've lost perspective. there are some bits were the acting is downright terrible, but for the most part it's of at least high school play level.<br /><br />the cg for the sasquatch in this movie is probably the second-worst part. the first thing i thought when i saw it (and i noticed another reviewer agreed with me) was that a man in an ape suit would have been better. clunky stop-motion animation would have looked better.<br /><br />so you may be asking why i call the cg the second-worst part. that's because the very worst part of the movie is the sound effects. they are loud, annoying, and constant. i've been camping, i know what insects sound like in the woods at night, and while they can be loud, they're not deafening like the cacophony in this movie. usually when the "background" sounds drown out the movie's dialogue, it's a bad thing, but from what i caught of the dialogue of this film, i wasn't missing much.<br /><br />the action was infrequent and boring. the tension was non-existent, as was any sense of empathy with the characters. speaking of the characters, they were all cookie-cutter and bland. the only mildly engaging byplay was between...actually, i can't think of anything. there was a line or two that made me crack a wan smile, but that was about it.<br /><br />the cinematography was decent, a step or two above what you'd normally see in a movie like this. however, it still had that "home movie" quality to it that you get with movies made on pocket change and a prayer. <br /><br />if you're like me and get a kick out of shoestring budget genre flicks, and you see this one in the dollar bin, think about grabbing it. otherwise, stay away at all costs.
