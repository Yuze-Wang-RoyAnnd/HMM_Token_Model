ok so i am like most people, give me free tickets and i will go and see most things, now that multiplex cinemas are so good (i remember the old "flea pit" single screen cinemas and i am the healthy side of 40). in england this film was released as "liar", it's a dog. it is a total waste of good celluloid. 4/10 for the photograpy and set only.
