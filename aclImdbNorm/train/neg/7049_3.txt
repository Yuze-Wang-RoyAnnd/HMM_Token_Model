the only thing worse than surfers without any waves is a film about surfers without any waves. for viewers who love surfing this film will be a gigantic disappointment since the total number of minutes of surfing footage struggles to reach three.<br /><br />the story is a slice of life about beached surfers who are waiting not for the perfect wave, but for any wave at all. j.c. (sean pertwee) is an aging super surfer who is flirting with a commitment with his girlfriend chloe (catherine zeta jones). just as he is about to find grown up bliss with the woman he loves, three old surfing friends turn up and convince him to hit the beach looking for monster waves at the bone yard. the trouble is, there are no waves until the very end of the film, so most of the story dissipates itself on a meandering succession of disconnected beach happenings.<br /><br />the acting is mostly mediocre. sean pertwee has a few comical moments, but mostly his acting was mundane. ewan mcgregor was decent as the drug dealing wild man, by far the most interesting and peculiar character of the bunch. probably the funniest performance was turned in by peter gunn as terry who turned his corpulent body into a continual sight gag. catherine zeta-jones was sexy as usual, but her character didn't really have enough meat for her to show much acting ability.<br /><br />there is really not much here on which to comment. i rated it a 3/10. it's a real beach bummer.
