i watched this immediately after seeing hillside cannibals so anything would have been an improvement . on top of that it stops me from comparing zombi 3 to 28 days later and its sequel . unfortunately the more i watched it the more i realised how well made danny boyle's original was and how much this movie influenced 28 weeks later <br /><br />one can't help noticing how much the 28 franchise has dated this type of italian horror movie . i was totally convinced zombi 3 must have been made in 1980 or 1981 at the very latest - in which case i would have called my summary 28 years later ( geddit ? ) - but wasn't until i came to this page to find it was released in 1988 . all the production values scream that it's a low budget splatter flick from the very early part of that decade . i might have enjoyed this movie as a fifteen year old schoolboy in 1982 as would have my peers but not now <br /><br />much of the problem involves a lack of internal continuity . for example some of the zombies shuffle about with the pace of a snail while others can run very fast and posses self awareness which leads to a ridiculous end scene involving a dj . likewise some can be killed by a kick to the face while others remain alive even if they've had their head chopped off , wait till you see the fridge scene , you might just die laughing . even the serious characters suffer from this type of contrived sloppy scripting where a character suddenly reveals he's a helicopter pilot which leads me to ask why the army have been employing him to drive jeeps for a career <br /><br />obviously you're reminded of the earlier film the crazies which also reminded me of the later 28 films . bunch of terrorists break in to scientific base leading to all sorts of disaster with the military being the bad guys trying to kill both the infected and the survivors and long before the ending you'll have worked out that basically everyone dies . the problem with this is you'll instantly be reminded of how the british franchise did it so much better on a bigger budget . not just that but the 28 franchise will appeal to a thinking audience who may have little interest in the average horror movie . zombi 3 will appeal to no one but a hardcore splatter audience
