do not waste your time watching this! unless you want to study it for all the wrong things you shouldn't do to make a good film. i am not one to usually review a movie, but this one is personal. i wasted precious time which they cannot give back. i feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste their time watching this crap. if this was a student project, i would have to say not bad, but only for the first 15 min... after that it gets annoying. the screaming, the bad audio, the bad video (a good camera man could have made it much better). and yes, whats with the blair-witch effect? no budget? i was hoping it was going to get better, but it doesn't. now how the hell did it deserves a 4? 2 is more fair but 1 for wasting my time! i have said my peace.
