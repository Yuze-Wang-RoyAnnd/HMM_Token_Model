don't get me wrong, i love action and revenge flicks, i've seen many of them since i was a kid, including dolph lundgren's latest "the mechanik" which is quite good. and tony scott certainly know how to use a camera and even might be a genius shooting and editing films.<br /><br />but with "man on fire" (and even more then with "domino"), scott shows that rather than using his film-making "genius" skills intelligently, he uses it puposelessly to show off and compensate a lack of substance that his material doesn't offer him. "man of fire" is close to 2 hours and half when it really should have been at least an hour less.<br /><br />the way scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you (the audience) to sit through his film because his constant camera moves and flashes really are a torture for the eye and makes you wanna leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes into it.<br /><br />at times where the mpaa and studios have questionable attitudes regarding ratings, violence and making pg-13 movies, i find also suspicious that a $70 million movie is made of a b-movie script with a character who cuts fingers, puts a bomb in a man's ass and blows a guy's hand with a shotgun, all this to avenge the death of a little girl who isn't even dead! go figure then why a studio will pass a better script because of the language or violence... thus said...
