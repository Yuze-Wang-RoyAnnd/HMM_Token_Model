watching floored by love one thought comes almost immediately to mind, "my god this looks like a really bad sitcom." sure enough, it turns out that fbl is a pilot for a series that may start this fall in canada, poor poor canada.<br /><br />cara (shirley ng) and janet (natalie sky) are a lesbian couple living in vancouver. janet has come out to her mother already but cara's parents are still in the dark about their daughter's homosexuality. the pressure is on to out herself though when the parents come from malaysia for her younger brother's wedding. that same week british columbia legalizes gay marriage. with janet wanting to wed, cara has to decide whether or not to tell her conservative chinese parents that's she's gay. will she? would she? could she? cara's situation is contrasted with that of jesse (trent millar). jesse has just declared his homosexuality to the world at the age of fourteen. his biological father daniel (andrew mcilroy) is coming for a visit soon. his stepfather norman (michael robinson) fears that his chances of finally being fully accepted by jesse are harmed by the fact that daniel is gay and he is not. will dialing 1-800-makeover help?<br /><br />the dialogue and delivery come straight out of a lesser 1950's program along with the overdone physical emoting. the full house-style melodrama is enough to make you wince from time to time and the attempts at comedy largely fail. mcilroy, millar & sky are the only performers that approach competency in this miscalculation but given the material they have to work with, it's no surprise that none impress. it's possible that the campiness was purposeful. it often seems like there is no way the performers are really that bad, that they must be trying to mimic the inferior sitcoms of days yore. if this is indeed the case than this review should probably be rewritten. the rewrite would focus on floored by love being a poor and ineffective send-up of old sitcoms.<br /><br />writer/director desiree lim has put together a by-the-numbers bland-fest that's entirely forgettable. there was a time when merely having an openly homosexual protagonist was enough to make a mark on the screen. that time is gone. in this day we need quality as well.
