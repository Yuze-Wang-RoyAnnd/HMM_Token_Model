it's hard to praise this film much. the cgi for the dragon was well done, but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow. also, the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious.<br /><br />i was amazed to see "marcus aurelius" in the acting credits, wondering what an ex-emperor of the roman empire was doing acting in this film! like "whoopie goldberg" it must be an alias, and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker.<br /><br />the story might been interesting, but the acting is flat, and direction is tedious. if you must watch this film, go around to your friend's house and get drunk while doing so - then it'll be enjoyable.
