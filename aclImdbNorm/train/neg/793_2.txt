i wasn't sure how to rate this movie, since it was so bad it was actually very funny. i'm not a gackt fan by any means, though he is talented, despite the weird pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball. i always thought hyde was talented though, faith is an interesting album.<br /><br />but on topic here folks. this movie is ridiculous. it's so over the top and nonsensical it's almost like a parody of supernatural action films.<br /><br />the movie has almost no plot here, except it's just about vampires with gangster friends. in a way, this film almost reminded me of spider-man 3, with how there were too many ideas, which resulted in not enough time to pay attention on one of them.<br /><br />the action scenes were laughable. quickly edited, almost hard to understand, with choreography that's so laughably bad. though hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes, but that's this film's only such redemption. i'm a sucker for good action movies, but the action was horribly done. though the final shootout was ok and the highlight of this otherwise depressing movie.<br /><br />it keeps jumping between genres, not a good thing. it wants to be a drama, or an action flick, or a horror, or a romance... what the hell.<br /><br />if this review is making you mad, why? is it because gackt and hyde are your love? don't fool yourself, this movie is bad.
