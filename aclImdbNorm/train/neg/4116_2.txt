my one line summary should explain it all, but i'll have a go at it.<br /><br />from the get-go, this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera, and that's about all i can comment on. there were a few interesting scenes, such as the "big one" that hit during the middle of the movie, but, wait, what's that? the earthquake *gasp*, wait a minute! that's dante's peak! well, parts of it butchered and slapped in. i can't believe how poorly this movie was done, "borrowing" scenes from other, much better films. one wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrops exist in downtown la, ala dante's peak.<br /><br />my advise, forget the bond wanna-be, nash, in this film and go for the real thing (again, someone from dante's peak coincidentally.)<br /><br />
