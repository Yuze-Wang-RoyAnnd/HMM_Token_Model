if i had never read the book, i would have said it was a good movie. but i did read the book. who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline. there is so many changes, that it wasn't really worthy of the title. character changes, plot changes, time line changes...<br /><br />first off who was henry and the investigator? they weren't in the story. henry had mitch's persona somewhat, but mitch wasn't a cop. no you made it so roz, helped 'sink ' his body and used that as zenia's blackmail against roz. the real so called blackmail was roz thought zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him. her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being gay from his mother. her son wasn't even really mentioned in the story. neither i don't believe was his lover, roz's secretary.<br /><br />tony and west were not together in the beginning. he was actually with zenia first while in college. the black painted apartment was their idea, tony just went to visit. this is where zenia and tony meet, become fast friends. tony hides her love for west. then zenia left west, with cash from tony, then west and tony get together. eventually marry, at some point west leaves tony for zenia again for a short time. only to be heart broken again. then go back to tony. zenia's blackmail for tony was that tony had written a test paper for zenia. now being a professor at college she didn't want to let it get out. i will say the character who played tony did it wonderfully.<br /><br />charis character was a blond, not that it really matters. zenia didn't trick her about having cancer while augusta was alive. no she was there when charis had a lover named billy. augusta's father, he was a draft dodger in the vietnam war. eventually after charis takes care of zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal. zenia and billy have an affair right under charis's nose while taking care of them both. then zenia turns in billy to the government, and leaves on the ferry with him. not with augusta, charis was pregnant with her tho. charis also had a split personality, karen was her real name.<br /><br />zenia did not die from being cut up into piece's.... she fell or was possibly pushed (we never really knew) off the balcony and landed in a fountain. she had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she od'd. she was also really dieing of cancer this time around.<br /><br />it didn't show any of the childhood memories or anything that endeared the characters to the reader. the book was striped down to its bare bones. then re made in someone else's vision. why couldn't you just write your own story along the lines of what you made the movie. it was different enough, and i'm sure could have been made more so.
