"scary movie 2" is a let down to the scary movie franchise. scary movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny. luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great scary movies.<br /><br />this film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night. things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape.<br /><br />this movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things. it is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the scary movie franchise then give this a watch - but i don't think you will like it nearly as much.
