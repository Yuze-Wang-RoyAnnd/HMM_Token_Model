while the original titillates the intellect, this cheap remake is designed purely to shock the sensibilities. instead of intricate plot-twists, this so-called thriller just features sudden and seemingly random story changes that serve only to debase it further with each bizarre development. worst of all, replacing the original spicy dialog is an overturned saltshaker full of unnecessary four-letter words, leaving behind a stark, but uninteresting taste.<br /><br />there was promise--unfulfilled promise. the prospect of michael caine pulling off a patty duke-like keller-to-sullivan graduation is admittedly intriguing. unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor only tarnished his reputation, first by accepting the role in this horribly re-scripted nonsense and then by turning in a performance that only looks competent when compared to jude law's amateurish overacting.<br /><br />if you haven't seen the classic original, overlook its dated visuals and gimmicks. hunt it down, watch it, and just enjoy a story-and-a-half. as for the remake, pass on this insult to the original.
