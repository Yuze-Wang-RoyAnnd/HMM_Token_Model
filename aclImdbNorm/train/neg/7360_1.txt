this is one of the worst action films i have ever seen. this is particularly due to much of the factual implausibility (like an obvious agent posing as a bank loan officer while making obvious that he is speaking to someone through a wire or the scene where the scientists assume it is safe to enter a room in which a virus has been released even though 'it has not found a viable host' does not mean that it will never find one), the cheap sets (the bank looks like it was poorly constructed to resemble a dungeon), and the bad acting. it is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the lethal virus. however, the head honcho who decides to remove it from a bank security deposit box, does so at the same time a bank heist is going down, at the same fbi agents have been informed of this, and at the same time a terrible earthquake erupts. needless to say, the aftermath of the quake is messy in more ways than one. however, the results do not make for an enticing action film, but instead, one that has been obviously z-grade junk from the beginning of the film. (perhaps this is why some of the screen captures on the packaging look to be created with computer graphics rather than being actual screen captures from various sequences of the film). what the hell ron perlman was doing in this, i have no idea. i wonder if he was as embarrassed to be in it as i was to have watched it.
