i found this to be an utter waste of time, effort and money. i know disney always displays lack of creativity when making "straight-to-video" films - but rehashing the plot of the original film with a "new perspective" is an all-time low...soon they'll just be re-releasing the original films with new animation and new songs and be calling it a "new version of the movie we all love." nathan lane surprisingly returns to his role of timon yet again. timon and pumbaa the animated animals from the world of the original "lion king" embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story the way it really happened...as they see it.<br /><br />of course timon is now the hero of the story, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah...<br /><br />the musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap. the vocal talents are impressive for a video feature, but then again, when was the last time you remember matthew broderick, whoopi goldberg or nathan lane being in anything of real commercial substance? overall if you liked the original you'll hate this. it's insulting because it's unfair to children and adults alike. and that about sums it up.
