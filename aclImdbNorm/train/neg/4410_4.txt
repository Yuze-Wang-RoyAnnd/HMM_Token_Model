typical formula action film: a good cop gets entangled in a mess of crooked cops and japanese gangsters.<br /><br />the okay result has decent performances, a few fleeting snicker-inducing moments, and some fair action sequences--plus a chance to check out the gorgeous danielle harris--who makes the most of her perpetual typecasting as a rebellious teen daughter.<br /><br />** out of ****.
