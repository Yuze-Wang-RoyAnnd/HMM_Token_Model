not a very good movie but according to the info it's pretty accurate in depicting torture techniques. the purpose of the film was to show the brutality of the nk pow camps and that's done effectively enough, with surprising frankness for the time. whatever technical flaws exist (and there are plenty) by watching this you'll see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some pretty nasty stuff - again, nasty because it's being done north of the dmz and not in guantanamo bay.<br /><br />i don't think any of the korean veterans brought up his torture when running for office, and if you watch the movies like this one and pork chop hill in comparison to the vietnam films. i don't know if it was the people in '54 being trapped in the wwii concepts (the boys tend to wisecrack a lot) or the war or what, but it's interesting to see this from the same system that 16 years later would be making movies like "go tell the spartans".
