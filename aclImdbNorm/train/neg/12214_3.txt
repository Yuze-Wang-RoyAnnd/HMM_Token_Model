well what i can say about this movie is that it's great to see so many asian faces. what i didn't like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role. the asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead, the white guy infatuated with asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the "keeping it real" black cab driver. plus all the coke, shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious. the story plot itself was fun but pretty much how i thought the story would unravel. then again when watching romantic comedies you can't expect much but then again i would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once. the parents are the best part of the flick.
