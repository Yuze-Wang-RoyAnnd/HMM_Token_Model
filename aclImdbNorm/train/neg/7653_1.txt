first off i'd like to say that if i had to honestly rate this movie from a 1 to a 10, then i'd give it a -4. it's not that i'm a tough critic, it's just that this movie is that bad. everything from the story, to the directing, to the editing is awful. the story is not even halfway decent to begin with (you can't expect much since it is based on a video game, something i was not aware of going into the movie) but the directing and editing made it even worse. the movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones; some, like a quick sex scene in the middle, don't even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the characters don't show any feelings toward each other. you could go into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you'd still be disappointed. honestly, if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money, and if you don't pay anything then you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life. so do yourself a favor and don't watch it.
