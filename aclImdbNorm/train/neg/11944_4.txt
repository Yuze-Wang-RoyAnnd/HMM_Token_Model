i rented this film thinking it was the sobbingly sad 1959 version i saw as a kid. it was not. i was therefore very disappointed with what i felt was marginal acting, poor character development, and most of all, failure to highlight the relationship between the boy and his dog. in this version... the "dog of flanders" is just a cute "aside" to the movie. get the 1959 version!
