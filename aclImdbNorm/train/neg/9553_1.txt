no wonder this was released straight to dvd here in australia, no redeeming features what so ever. the dialog was hokey, the acting, awful and the script sucked!! whoever thought it would be a good idea to do a sequel or follow up to the far superior john badham film, wargames from the 80s, well they must of been on something cause it was a bad idea!! amanda walsh was good in it as the eye candy/love interest, while matt lanter was good as the other main lead- that is about it. i would not recommend wargames: the dead code to anyone, check out hackers or the original wargames film- both are better than this piece of crap!!
