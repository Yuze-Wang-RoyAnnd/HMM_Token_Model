watching this was like getting a large mackerel slapped in your face over and over again. even when you thought, "that mackerel surely can't be coming around again," *slap* there it was. i'm not sure what they were thinking. this is the sort of pilot i watched and wondered, "did the actors know they were on a doomed ship destined to never be made into a series?" not only black stereotypes but swedish and indian ones as well. and while "blazing saddles" made these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and uncomfortableness, these stereotypes were just downright offensive. there was no plot line, the ending was slapped on, and the jokes aren't. still, if you are a student of comedy, watch this pilot to see what you shouldn't do.
