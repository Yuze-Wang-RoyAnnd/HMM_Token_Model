"diary of sex addict" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsiveness. probably a movie marketing scam, this flick is a stylish shoot with a good cast and little else going for it. bottom line, "diary..." would have us believe that our sex addict character has the dumbest wife in the world, a stable of babes on the side who have nothing better to do than drop their panties for him at his whim, and no job in spite of being a restaurateur. at the best, this flick could have been good drama. at the worst, cheap softcore. "diary..." isn't either and nowhere in between. this one's for the dumpster. (d-)
