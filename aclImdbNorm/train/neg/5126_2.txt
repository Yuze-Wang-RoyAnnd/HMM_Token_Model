i rented this movie because i hoped it would be one the whole family would enjoy. although the movie is family friendly, my family did not enjoy it because it gives a false view of god. if you obey god and follow him, you are not guaranteed success. your football team won't always win. you won't magically get better grades. infertility isn't always cured. you won't always get a raise. sometimes, you'll be stuck with the old car.<br /><br />god does not exist to meet our every whim. rather, we were created to glorify him. sometimes we glorify him most when things seem to be going bad for us. to live is christ; to die is gain.
