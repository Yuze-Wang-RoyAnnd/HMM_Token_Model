judging by some of the comments in imdb, i was expecting an action movie - perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid one or a simple one or a comicy one, but essentially an action movie.<br /><br />whatever it is that i watched, it certainly didn't feel like a movie. the story is simple and straightforward (even though the prologue tries to make it seem complicated). take three interest groups: 1) the government 2) the rebels 3) a group of assassins.<br /><br />now subtract the first (they never appear in the movie). then simply let one of the assassins, the princess, become a rogue on a revenge trip. add in a rebel love-interest with a guilty conscience. and you've got the ingredients.<br /><br />but they still did not manage to turn it into a story or a movie. between some random action sequences and some odd visuals trying to be sci-fi on a low budget, what you're left with is a feeling of emptiness. the movie just does not feel like a movie, but a weird, incoherent, boring dream.<br /><br />avoid.<br /><br />2/10
