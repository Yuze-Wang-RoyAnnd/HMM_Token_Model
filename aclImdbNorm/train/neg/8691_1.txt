if there was a zero rating, i would give it to this movie. today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldn't make it through from beginning to end. i can't believe the multiple stars given by others & can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise! the acting is atrocious all around, the script is blah, the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when she's being threatened. the "southern" accent from the actress playing amber's mom is laughable - i'm from georgia and have friends from texas - believe me nobody talks like that! none of her emotions seemed real in any scene. the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment.
