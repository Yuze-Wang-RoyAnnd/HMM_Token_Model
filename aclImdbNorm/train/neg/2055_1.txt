there is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this "film". the original said it all and still holds up. either read the book or do some research about the story, and you'll realize this remake is ludicrous. eric roberts as perry smith? his sister could have done a better job! having been to holcomb & edgerton, ks where the story takes place, the sets and locations looked nothing like kansas. the original is riveting, from the location filming to the use of the actual participants, weapons and victims belongings. unforgettable performances by scott wilson and robert blake. soundtrack by quincy jones and cinematography by conrad hall...the original is available on dvd in widescreen now. let this turkey die a quick death.
