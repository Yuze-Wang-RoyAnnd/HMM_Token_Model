ok, first the good: cher's performance and the cinematography. although i'm no cher fan, she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written. the cinematography was well done and captures a sense of romance.<br /><br />the rest: a thin plotline, nicholas cage's performance, and a totally unhumorous and weak attempt to portray an italian-american family from new york. firstly, everytime time cage opened his mouth i cringed. i don't know what kind of accent he was trying use. i honestly don't, it sure wasnt any new york or italian accent i've ever heard. it was quite surreal. and it wasn't because i'm some stickler for accuracy, his voice just cloyed in my ears. and i like nicholas cage in other performances. secondly, and this is purely anecdotal, but i have many italian relations, friends and acquaintances in new york city, and frankly i've gotten more laughs and felt more joy in the appreciation of the italian ethnic family by far than this movie provided. and that would be on a boring night at the house. what a let down.
