this movie, no correction, this thing, this abysmal abomination from the burning pits of hell should have been killed before it even left the writer's head. i could not possibly come up with enough adjectives to describe this movie. but let's try anyway. horrible, bad, nauseating, tasteless, crap, vomit inducing, gut wrenchingly bad, hideous, nasty, putrid, there just aren't enough words in the english language! the "plot" involves a serial killer who becomes a snow man. don't ask how, not important. the killer snowman runs about killing people. how, you may ask, can a snowman kill someone? in tasteless ways that make you want to remove your eyes if only so you don't have to endure that styrofoam snowman anymore. in ways that make you want to fill your ears with hot wax so you do not have to endure his snow puns anymore. don't watch this movie! destroy it on sight! for the sake of your very soul don't watch it!
