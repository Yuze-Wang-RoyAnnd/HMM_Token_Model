i watched mask in the 80's and it's currently showing on fox kids in the uk (very late at night). i remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had a couple of the toys too but watching it now bores me to tears. i never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was. it's just plain awful! it is no where near in the same league as the transformers, he-man or thundercats and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made. i only watch it on fox kids because ulysses 31 comes on straight after it (that's if mask doesn't put me to sleep first). one of the lesser 80's cartoons that i hope to completely forget about again once it finishes airing on fox kids!
