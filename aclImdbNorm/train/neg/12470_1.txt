syriana swept the critics upon release and everything seemed to be raving about it. i suppose it's one of those films that is intensely intelligent...so intelligent that i think you need to be well versed in the oil industry and a politically brilliant mind. i don't consider myself unintelligent, i've been studying politics since my early teens and i enjoy an intelligent film but for the most part unless it's a documentary films are meant to be primarily entertaining as well as have a message. syriana tried to be strictly intelligent and it does turn some people away. i would even go so far as to say that those who rave about it and insist it's a 10/10 are lying because they think they look better. this film was the most confusing, senseless, mindless dribble i have seen in awhile...especially considering the critical acclaim, the oscar nods, and the cast. screenplay writer stephen gaghan has disappointed me yet again. his horribly written havoc preceded this film and i think he's just trying way too hard. i can't believe he was offered the opportunity to write the da vinci code screenplay. on top of that gaghan directed the film which made it an absolute mess. i had no idea who anyone was, why things were happening, who was who and what was what. it was a disaster.<br /><br />because i don't really know who anyone was i can only mention the actors and what i thought of their performances because despite the horrendously complicated script the actors did alright. george clooney plays c.i.a. field agent and assassin i think?? bob barnes. clooney has never been a favorite of mine but lately he's managed to churn out some decent performances and this seemed to be a pretty good performance on his part. barnes was a complex character with a sordid history and if i knew what was going on with him i would have really enjoyed his character. matt damon plays bryan woodman and he is rather bland and always looks like a deer in the headlights which i can understand his confusion after reading this script and then trying to perform it. amanda peet plays his wife and she does well in the few scenes she is given. christopher plummer makes a cameo appearance as someone doing something. i like plummer and love seeing him show up even if he doesn't get top billing anymore.<br /><br />the cast is intense if only the story made sense. i'd like to exact quote the description of plot on imdb. "a missile disappears in iran, but the cia has other problems: the heir to an emirate gives an oil contract to china, cutting out a us company that promptly fires its immigrant workers and merges with a small firm that has landed a kazakhstani oil contract. the department of justice suspects bribery, and the oil company's law firm finds a scapegoat. the cia also needs one when its plot to kill the emir-apparent fails. agent bob barnes, the fall guy, sorts out the double cross. an american economist parlays the death of his son into a contract to advise the sheik the cia wants dead. the jobless pakistanis join a fundamentalist group. all roads start and end in the oil fields." what!?!? say who now?? syriana might be the thinking man's movie but it bored me to tears and no matter how hard i tried to stay with it i eventually surrendered and turned it off after an hour and a half and you couldn't have bribed me enough to get me to finish it. i suppose if you want to form an opinion than by all means watch it but i promise you someone looking for entertainment or an enjoyable film will be asleep in the first half hour. 1/10
