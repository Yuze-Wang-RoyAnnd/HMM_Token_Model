"a young woman suffers from the delusion that she is a werewolf, based upon a family legend of an ancestor accused of and killed for allegedly being one. due to her past treatment by men, she travels the countryside seducing and killing the men she meets. falling in love with a kind man, her life appears to take a turn for the better when she is raped and her lover is killed by a band of thugs. traumatized again by these latest events, the woman returns to her violent ways and seeks revenge on the thugs," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />rino di silvestro's "la lupa mannara" begins with full frontal, writhing, moaning dance by shapely blonde annik borel, who (as daniella neseri) mistakenly believes she is a werewolf. the hottest part is when the camera catches background fire between her legs. the opening "flashback" reveals her hairy ancestor was (probably) a lycanthropic creature. ms. borel is, unfortunately, not a werewolf; she is merely a very strong lunatic.<br /><br />as a film, "werewolf woman" (in english) would have been better if borel's character really was a female werewolf; with her sexual victimization a great bit of characterization. but, as far as 1970s skin and blood flicks go, this one is hard to beat. bouncy borel is either nude or sexily clad throughout the film, which features a fair amount of gratuitous gore. dazzling dagmar lassander (as elena) and hunky howard ross (as luca) are good supporting players.
