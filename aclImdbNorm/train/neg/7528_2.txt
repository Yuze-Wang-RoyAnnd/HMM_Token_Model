this is even worse than the original game of death. a jumbled, incoherent storyline leads to "billy lo" falling from a helicopter to the ground below, killing him, as we're left to follow his younger brother, bobby lo. so not only do we start out following some bruce lee clone, the film kills that one off and has us follow another one thirty minutes into the story. the main reason to watch this one is when bobby lo fights a lion, which is quite obviously a guy in a lion costume. jang lee hwang is also the villain, who is usually pretty awesome but his screen time is significantly small. mainly watched this and the original game of death because they're a part of the bruce lee boxed set. it's no wonder they're included with lee's finished works. no one would buy them otherwise.
