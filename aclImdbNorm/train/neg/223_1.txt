not a `woman film' but film for the gang. one of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman. director andy mckay simply doesn't know woman. peaks of bad taste, american pie's humor style, crude story, no sense, groundless story, refuted characters. vulgar fantasies came to life on screen. insulting and definitely not funny. i wonder how three good actresses accepted to take part in it.
