i've been largely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons:<br /><br />1) this is, without doubt, the worst film i've ever seen 2) unless it gets more reviews it will not be listed in the all time worst films list - which it deserves to be 3) i was kinda lucky - i paid five pound for it. i've seen it in shops for 15 pound. don not pay that much for this film! you will be very angry 4) there are a lot of films out there in the horror genre that are not given a fair rating (in my opinion) and giving this film a higher rating than them is criminal<br /><br />the plot summary: a guy with no friends meets a tramp who promises the world - well, the magic ability to appear to everybody else like somebody else. our hero cunningly turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang - sitting on swings, baby-sitting. he kills them one by one until he is tracked and found by the police.<br /><br />why is it so bad? to begin with the acting is very very bad. someone else compared it to a school production. no, this is worse than any acting i've seen on a school stage.<br /><br />i've bought a number of these previously banned films from the dvd company vipco and not been as disappointed as i was at this. okay, the acting is bad but the film fails to deliver in every other sense. what was the point in making this film when there isn't even any gore! okay, no gore. what else can a film like this offer? breats? no, not even any titillation!<br /><br />it's true this film may have a certain charm in its unique naffness but any potential buyer/watcher of this film should be fairly advised that this film is, at best, worth only one out of ten.
