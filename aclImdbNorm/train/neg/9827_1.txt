first of all, this movie reminded me of the old movies i used to have to watch in religion class in school. that's not a good thing. basically, it's just a preachy and pretentious piece of filth, just like the terrible "left behind" series. i'm not offended by religious movies... but i am offended when these religious movies just happen to be extremely awful. i would just like to be able to say nice things about a christian movie but it doesn't look like that will happen any time soon. i bet if you gave the bible thumpers a decent budget, they still wouldn't be able to come up with anything good. just avoid this one. also, the fact that the "american family association" (basically, reverend wildmon's lackies) beam about this film on their website is another reason to make me hate it. in fact, after i viewed this, i went home and watched my copy of david cronenberg's nc-17 rated "crash". forgive me father for i have sinned. hahahahaha!
