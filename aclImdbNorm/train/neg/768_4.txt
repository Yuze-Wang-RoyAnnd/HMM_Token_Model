i agree with most of the columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format. columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods. this movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past. and that is the disturbing point, because columbo is no ordinary detective.<br /><br />there are two parts in this film that left me intriguing. first, i can't figure out the title of this movie. it is misleading. maybe a better title would've been "the vanishing bride" or something similar. second, columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason (to the viewers at least) why he does it.<br /><br />i don't feel betrayed, just disappointed. i'm glad peter falk went back to the usual columbo.<br /><br />
