i watched this because i thought there were going to be a lot of car chases and cool cars to gawk at. guess i was lied to. this movie is very boring.<br /><br />the movie starts out kip raines(giovanni ribisi) sitting outside a porsche dealership checking to see if they have the right car. when they confirm it's the right one, kip gets a brick out of the trunk and chucks it at the window, shattering it. he gets the porsche while his friend gets the keys. they start up the car and take off into the night. they deliver it to a warehouse only to have been followed by the police. so, the whole crew ditches all the cars and go their separate ways. then, we get a glimpse of memphis raines. he is giving a little speech to a bunch of kids at a go-kart track. then, he is confronted by atlee jackson(will patton). atlee tells memphis that his brother kip is in deep *bleep*. memphis is known as one of the most notorious car thieves in los angeles. memphis heads to a junkyard and meets raymond calitri(christopher ecclesten). this guy threatens to kill kip if memphis doesn't deliver 50 cars within 72 hours.<br /><br />there are a few problems with this film: <br /><br />1.story: the first 48 in-movie hours take place when cage and duvall are looking for a crew and planning everything out. the last 12 in-movie hours are a waste! <br /><br />2. the cars: you see maybe 10 cars out of the 50 as the movie advertises. so, where are the other 40 cars? why don't we get to see them? <br /><br />3. the chase: the chase at the end of the movie was a joke. it was not suspenseful at all.<br /><br />4. the dog: somewhere in the movie, the dog eats the burgers and swallows three keys as well. this is impossible. the keys were flipped open. the keys would have severely damaged the dog's esophagus, stomach, and large intestines. the guys suggest giving the dog laxatives to help him poop it out. this won't work. the dog will get a lot of diarrhea but no keys. it was stated in jackass after ryan dunne stuck a toy car up his rectum. take laxatives, lots of diarrhea, but no car. same case with the dog.<br /><br />5. the cop during the chase: when eleanor breaks down for a few minutes, nicholas cage tries desperately to start up the car. you see a police cruiser behind him who isn't looking at his car at all. but, right when nicholas cage starts the engine up again, the police officer jerks his head to the right, sees the car, and immediately begins to chase after him. it is stupid. so, right when he heard the engine start, and saw the car, he knew that was the car he was looking for. how does he know it's the right car? he only sees the back of it.<br /><br />overall, the movie is boring. there is no action. there are very few cars. the movie is stupid. i have never seen the original but i plan to.<br /><br />i give this movie 1 star out of 10. get the fast and furious instead.
