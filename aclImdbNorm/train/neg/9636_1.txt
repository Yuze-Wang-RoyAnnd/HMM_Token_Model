this astonishing waste of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians. from a (silly) play by tennessee williams and directed (with a dead hand) by joseph losey and starring taylor and burton and noel coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff-top mountain island mansion in the mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to universal in 1967. the result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief. visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set. the shrill antics of a screeching taylor, burton's half asleep wanderings, the loony dialog, noel coward laughing at himself, the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer. boom is a disgrace, a waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet's plebs. not even fun. just terrible and mad shocking waste.
