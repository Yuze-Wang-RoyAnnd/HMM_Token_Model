this movie was seriously awful. the acting was the worst! it was worse than a student film. super cheesy, and i think the worst actor was the old lady. at first i thought to myself, well it's an old movie. then i remembered that that is no excuse! i've seen older movies with way better acting and such.<br /><br />the music was terrible to. it was really choppy. the editing was poor (most of the dialog was out of sync.)<br /><br />overall, this movie doesn't even deserve a 1. i only watched it because i was so bored, and the movie hardly entertained me. it was just laughable. my dead grandmother's left pinkie toe could make a better movie than this.
