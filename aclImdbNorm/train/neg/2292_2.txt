first of all i must admit batman: the animated series is the best batman series by far. we watched it when it used to be on tv. i didn't realize that there was a season four. actually there wasn't. btas ends with season 3, and it should have stopped there.<br /><br />why did they have to mess with a good thing. catwoman and poison ivy now have terrible grey faces. the joker looks beyond scary, it seems that each time they revise his appearance he looks more and more creepier. he doesn't seem to have pupils anymore, and now he doesn't even look remotely human (although he is).<br /><br />bruce wayne is voiced by kevin conroy who does the best batman. although he now looks like superman. there is nothing that sets him apart because they both look the same, bruce wayne now has blue eyes.<br /><br />night wing really needs a haircut, please! alfred just has pupils from eyes, looks more like a character from the 80's.<br /><br />i have watched three episodes from disc 1 in the series and i already find that this version is more violent and graphic (there is blood in every episode).<br /><br />if you are a fan of batman: the animated series, there is no batman season 4. they just included this series as season 4 for marketability. if they just released it as the new batman adventures i don't think as many people would have bought it.<br /><br />save yourself the disappointment and stick to seasons 1-3.
