all you need to know about this film happens in the first five minutes: it looks cool, it has a solid original soundtrack reflective of the late-60s period, and all but a couple of its characters are unlikeable. once you get that message, you may as well switch to another film.<br /><br />davies's protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in his life who cares about him. then by the time he takes her advice to join her in the real world--instead of living a fantasy film of which he's the imagined director--he does so by pushing her aside and pairing up with an actress he's idealized beyond reason. a couple laughs and some thoughtful art direction are the only things worth watching here.<br /><br />the film is also interesting as documentation of jason schwartzman's fall from mount rushmore. in rushmore, schwartzman's annoying brattiness was something to be overcome, but here it's his character's only quality. schwartzman's family connection clearly landed him in this role; here's hoping his choices improve.
