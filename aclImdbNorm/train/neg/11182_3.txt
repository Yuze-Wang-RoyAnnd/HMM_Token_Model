very silly movie, filled with stupid one liners and jewish references thru out. it was a serious movie but could not be taken seriously. a familiar movie plot...being at the wrong place at the wrong time. an atrocious subplot, involving kim bassinger. very robotic and too regimented. i have noticed that al pacinos acting abilities seem to be going downhill. a troubleshooter with troubles , but nothing more troubling than pacinos horrible atlanta accent. damage control needs to fix this damage of a film. ok my one liners are bad, but not as bad as the ones in this film. this movie manages to not only be boring but revolting as well. usually a revolting film is watchable for the wrong reasons. this movie is unwatchable. i did manage to sit through this. the plot ,if written a tad bit better, with , perhaps a little better acting and eliminating the horrendous subplot,and even dumber jokes, could have pulled this thriller out of the doldrums. what we are left with is a dull, silly movie that made sure it was drilled into our heads that eli wurman was jewish. an embarrassment to all the good jewish folk everywhere.
