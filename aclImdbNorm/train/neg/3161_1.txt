much of "over her dead body" is so painfully unfunny that i was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors.<br /><br />eva longoria proves that she can't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy, and further, that she doesn't really even have any comedic timing. she's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fianc'e. the fianc'e is played by paul rudd, drippy and charmless, while the psychic is played by lake bell, bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has. i felt most sorry for bell, as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work. unfortunately, she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features jason biggs tolerable, and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like leo dicaprio at the end of "titanic." <br /><br />"over her dead body" actually pi**ed me off, because of its laziness and utter lack of effort. i started to think of all the interesting projects that can't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this. seriously, does hollywood think movies like this are good enough? how stupid do they really think the movie-going public is? <br /><br />grade: f
