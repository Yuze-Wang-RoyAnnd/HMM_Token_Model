the movie had a lot of potential, unfortunately, it came apart because of a weak/implausible story line, miscasting, and general lack of content/substance. one of the very obvious flaws was that sean connery, who played an arab man, didn't know how to pronounce his own arab name! this may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details. the quality of acting was uniformly well below average. <br /><br />movie's solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end; and a french song (i don't recall the title). overall, it was a pretty bad movie where sean connery was visibly miscast.
