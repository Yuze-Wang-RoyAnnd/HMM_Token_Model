i watched free money last night & it was the longest 90+ minutes of my life. with such an intriguing cast, i really thought that i was in for a treat - especially since i'm a brando fan. wrong! what a waste of talent. it's almost embarrassing to watch at times (like the cattle prod scene), & there were so many missed opportunities for humorous setups (why didn't they show charlie sheen's character going back to tow brando's truck?) ugh. it tries to be a slapstick comedy, but i just wasn't buying into it. skip this one. only for die-hard brando fans.<br /><br />i'm giving it 2 out of 10 because i still think the worse movie ever made was skidoo.
