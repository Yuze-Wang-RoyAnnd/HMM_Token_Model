we expected something great when we went to see this bomb. it is basically a broadway play put on film. the music is plain terrible. there isn't one memorable song in the movie -- heard any hits from this movie? you won't because there aren't any. some of the musical numbers go on so long that i got up to go to the restroom and get some pop corn and it was still going when i got back! if they were good songs well -- but they suck. the pace is slow, terrible character development. the lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song -- it was almost impossible to stand. this movie has nothing to offer anyone but die-hard broadway enthusiasts. this is without a doubt the most over rated movie i've seen in my entire life. a complete waist of time and money. there is nothing memorable about this movie except danny glover -- who wasn't on screen enough and whose character wasn't developed enough. rent the video and you'll agree -- this movie was an expensive, over produced, polished dog do.
