i've seen my share of woody allen's movies, and while they're not always great, you can usually be sure you're going to be entertained. probably the last really good ones were bullets over broadway ('94) and mighty aphrodite ('95) - since then the ones i've seen have been patchy but watchable. and so when i was invited to see the new woody allen movie melinda and melinda, which i wasn't even aware had been released yet, i went along happily. i hadn't really heard much about it so i hoped i would be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />what i got was definitely the worst woody allen movie i've seen. the premise is over-explained, the cast is terrible, the script is slow and lifeless. too many scenes said nothing and yet were stretched out, i assume to fill out what would have otherwise become a 15 minute short film.<br /><br />i don't mind the concept behind this film - two directors discuss how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and obviously the film proceeds to show us that, by playing out both scenarios. the problem is neither of these 'two films' are any good at all. the comedy isn't funny and the tragedy isn't very tragic. it seems like allen came up with a good idea but then ran out of steam, or time, to actually complete the film.<br /><br />the general level of acting is notably bad also - will ferrell is the only one who brings anything to the table, and it's basically a woody allen impression. previously good actors like chloe sevigny just come off as annoying, and the worst of the bunch is radha mitchell as melinda (which is a shame, because her character is in nearly every scene!).<br /><br />to be fair to the actors, the script they are working with is lacking if not non-existent. definitely a long way from the allen we know and love from classics like manhattan or annie hall.
