this is my first movie review on imdb. i was forced to register after watching this movie. i cannot in good conscience allow this movie to be unreviewed by me. the people must be warned!<br /><br />first of all, my rating is: 0 (as in "zero")<br /><br />i love jack black, ben stiller, rachel weis, and christopher walken, and yet, i hated this movie. there is a plot, but who cares when there's no script. the dialogue is unreal and plain boring, the situations are contrived, the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary, the characters are unsympathetic and uninteresting, and the story, although based on a good premise, is stupid. this movie is a piece of poo.<br /><br />never mind wasting money on this movie, it's not even worth your time spent watching it. please do not see it... i beg of you!
