i have a 5 minute rule (sometimes i'll leave leway for 10). if a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes it's probably not going to ever get better. i have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory. dan in real life is definitely no exception. i was watching this turkey and thought; wow, this is not funny, not touching, not sad, and i don't like any of the characters at all.<br /><br />the story of an advice columnist/widower raising three young daughters, who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend. i suppose the tagline would be "advice columnist who could use advice"? i don't know. dans character in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice. i guess that's the irony? i don't know. he goes to see his parents, brothers, sisters and their kids at some sort of anual family retreat, which seems very sweet, and potential fodder for good comedy, story lines...none which ever emerge. the central story is basically how he loves this woman, but can't have her. anyone with a pulse will realise that eventually he will get her, but you have to suffer through painfully unfunny, trite, lifetime movie network dialogue "murderer of love" to get to the inevitable happy ending.<br /><br />this is truly one of the worst movies i've ever seen.
