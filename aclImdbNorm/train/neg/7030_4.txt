one of the cornerstones of low-budget cinema is taking a well-known, classic storyline and making a complete bastardization out of it. phantom of the mall is no exception to this rule. the screenwriter takes the enduring phantom of the opera storyline and moves it into a late '80s shopping mall. however, the "phantom's" goal now is simply to get revenge upon those responsible for disfiguring his face and murdering his family. the special effects do provide a good chuckle, especially when body parts begin appearing in dishes from the yogurt stand. pauly shore has a small role which does not allow him to be as fully obnoxious as one would expect, mostly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of mtv fame had not yet arrived. if you're looking for a few good laughs at the expense of the actors and special effects crew, check this flick out. otherwise, keep on looking for something else.
