such is the dilemma(above) that debbie must face at the close of this sam sherman production naughty stewardesses. debbie has just hit town, become a stewardess, slept with an elderly rich man(who she describes is in his 50's but obviously hit that mark a decade or two ago), shoots nude scenes for a photographer she just met, and then is the central element to a kidnapping/extortion plot. through it all and amidst all that emotional upheaval and soul-searching, what in heaven's name will debbie do? well, i cannot give it away completely but don't expect any real epiphany here. let's face it. naughty stewardesses is just what it wants to be(at least two-thirds through): a soft core porn film with lots of topless women and a funny in that kitchy 70's way film. there is no grand art here. the movie was designed to make money and exploit a growing trend at the time to put nymphomaniacal stewardesses in films so that the audience could live out vicariously their voyeuristic tastes. by todays standards, the film is pretty tame. what this film does do wrong is try to be some kind of statement film at the end. c'mon, anyone here believing that little diatribe by debbie while on the beach contemplating life. she would spend more time picking out which halter top she will wear that day then do that. and what about the ridiculous plot to steal 50 grand? it didn't make sense to me so how on earth did these characters "dig" it? anyone buying cal as a member of the plo(something like that) or even as a director for hardcore pornography? he would be luck to get work at seven eleven! this is, as another reviewer noted, more of a sam sherman piece then and al adamson piece. you can tell when al is in complete charge. there is virtually no budget and the film doesn't look nearly as polished as this. adamson does a decent job directing this time and i have to give sherman credit to a degree. while this film is bad just for what it was meant to be, it has a certain style to it. i liked the opening credits with the animation and photographs. i even liked the music of sparrow. "silver heels" was a somewhat catchy tune. the movie doesn't look cheap really at all. compare that to any of al's horror films. as for the cast, yes, bob livingston is a bit old for the lead, but some examination went into his character and the obvious thread that young women are attracted to men with money was explored as well. i had major problems with robert smedley who was just plain awful in his role. the girls have all got great sets, so what else was required of them huh? naughty stewardesses is relatively harmless exploitation film from the 70's and will serve as a living time capsule for certain aspects of life during that decade. by the way, did i mention it is a pretty bad picture?
