this film, originally released at christmas, 1940, was long thought lost. a very poor copy has resurfaced and made into a cd, now for sale. don't buy it! the film is unspeakably terrible. the casting is poor, the script is awful, and the directing is dreadful.<br /><br />picture roland young singing and dancing. and that was the highlight.<br /><br />perhaps this movie was lost deliberately.
