this movie is a waste of film stock. do you believe that the map of a plan of a military mission would be placed on an easel on a patio in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see? it happened in this film. do you believe that a deaf person would actually be enlisted in the active duty army in europe during wwii to serve in a "negro" unit...cooking, supply services, burial detail, etc.? it happened in this film. do you believe that a black (and supposedly intelligent) officer would select this same deaf k.p. to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the germans before the allies arrived? it happened in this film. would you be surprised that the deaf soldier didn't realize that a german plane was approaching from behind and would strafe and kill him? it happened in this film. would you be surprised that a group of american soldiers hold-up in a barn at a farmhouse that the germans happened upon would shout out their emotions at the sight of the german soldiers who were just 50' away? they did it in this film, and left any possible entrances to the barn the germans might check totally unprotected. would you believe that, over the airwaves and in clear english, the captain mentioned the general's rank, if not his name, as the person he was speaking with and that the general, in plain english over open airwaves, said that the dam had to be protected the next day? maybe they should have just sent in an emissary to tell which direction the american attack would be coming from just to make it a little easier on the germans. this so-called movie should be placed on a list of the top 50 worst films. if it were, i'm sure it would do well. watch it at your own risk.
