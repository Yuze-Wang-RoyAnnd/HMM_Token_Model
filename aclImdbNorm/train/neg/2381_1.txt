i'm not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is anything to go by. i expected something better from uma thurman, which was the reason i suffered my way through this experience in the first place. an awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality. it's just a shame that we are incapable of giving 0 out of 10 in these reviews. this movie deserves it.
