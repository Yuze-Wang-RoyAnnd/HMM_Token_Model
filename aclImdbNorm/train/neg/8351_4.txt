quite average even by monogram standards, this mystery (a remake of the sphinx) has an oddball plot which is not unraveled to much effect -- you'll see through it after about ten minutes. the two leads have some nice breezy dialog at the outset, but john hamilton is hopelessly dull as the villain (perfectly cast lionel atwill originated the role) and warren hymer's nitwit shtick is pretty annoying. however, it's worth sitting through for a five-minute appearance by the incomparable mantan moreland as nicodemus the janitor, who gets the better of the defense attorney during a hilarious courtroom appearance. you've got to hand it to bill "one-take" beaudine; he wasn't much of a director, but he would always punch up a routine programmer with some goofy vaudeville.
