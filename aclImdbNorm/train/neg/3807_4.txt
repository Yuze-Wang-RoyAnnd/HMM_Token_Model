don't get me wrong, i'm a huge fan of many of woody's movies, obviously his late 70's masterpieces (annie hall,interiors, manhattan)and most of his late 80's/early 90's dramas (hannah, crimes and misdemeaners,husbands and wives) in fact i even liked some of his more recent efforts (melinda, anything else, small time crooks) but this was abysmal, i though it couldn't possibly be any worse than last years match point but how wrong i was.<br /><br />it was lazily plotted - basically a cross between match point, manhattan murder mystery and small time crooks,with all the jokes taken out - woody seems to be on the way out as well, slurring most of his lines and delivering 'hilarious' catchphrases 'i mean that with all due respect...' over and over until the blandness of it all becomes to much to bare.<br /><br />i know that most actors are queuing up to work with him but they should at least read the script first - scarlett johansson and hugh jackman are so much better than this - and woody should really take a more behind the camera role in future, if he has any sense about 20 miles behind it.<br /><br />it wouldn't be so tragic if we didn't have so many great woody films to compare this to - but it is clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort, woody should call it a day before he becomes an industry joke.<br /><br />embarrassingly bad
