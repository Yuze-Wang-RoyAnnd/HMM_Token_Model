this worldwide was the cheap man's version of what the nwa under jim crockett junior and jim crockett promotions made back in the 1980s on the localized "big 3" stations during the saturday morning/afternoon wrestling craze. when ted turner got his hands on crockett's failed version of nwa he turned it into world championship wrestling and proceeded to drop all nwa references all together. nwa world wide and nwa pro wrestling were relabeled with the wcw logo and moved off the road to disney/mgm studios in orlando, florida and eventually became nothing more than recap shows for wcw's nitro, thunder, and saturday night. worldwide was officially the last wcw program under turner to air the weekend of the wcw buyout from vince mcmahon and wwf. today the entire nwa world wide/wcw worldwide video tape archive along with the entire nwa/wcw video tape library in general lay in the vaults of wwe headquarters in stamford,connecticut.
