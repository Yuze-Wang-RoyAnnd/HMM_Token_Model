fantastic mr. fox is a comedy based on the classic roald dahl book. wes anderson directs, and respectably takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film. while i respect what anderson, an incredibly talented man did, the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit. anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man, and if this happened to be a bad film, it would be his first bad film. just like when you go to school and have your first bad day, this is anderson's first bad day in film making, so i am going to let him off easy. i will admit it did have a cleverness and nice spirit to it, and the animation is nice, but the film gets progressively harder to get into, leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening. the characters are good, also. jason schwartzman voices mr. fox (george clooney)'s smart ass son, ash, and especially engaging. the film does not quite make it up to a level of terribleness, but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along. i'm sure wes anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film, but for now, i'm sorry, wes anderson, this film of yours was a big disappointment.
