this film is deeply disappointing. not only that wenders only displays a very limited musical spectrum of blues, it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring. the only highlight of the movie is the interview of a swedish couple who were befriended with j.b. lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories. wenders's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly - alluding to world's culture (or actually, american culture) traveling in space, but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid. yawn. i had expected more of him.
