this was the worst christmas movie i ever saw. i took my two small children to see this. it was the darkest, most dismal plot- family has no money, mom loses her job, father gets killed in the bank, bank robber steals family car with both kids in the back and after high speed chase, drives off the bridge and drowns them in the river. mom is left all alone. no wonder her christmas spririt is gone. christmas angels do not rescue children that have drowned, and santa does not bring back dead fathers! i thought this was the worst message to send children. better to tell them that there is no santa than show them a movie like this!!
