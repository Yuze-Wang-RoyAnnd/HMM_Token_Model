i don't know what this movie is about, really. it's like a student's art school project. they never say why the world is dark, but it is always darkness except for seconds a day. there are long, interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason. what little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images. a black woman enters the main character's apartment. somehow she becomes pregnant overnight, then gets shot in the head. the main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges. i have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be. honestly, i would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it's about. but i wouldn't wish this level of hell on anybody else.
