i am amazed with some of the reviews of this film. the only place that seems to tell the truth is rottentomatoes.com. this film is awful. the plot is extremely lazy. it is not scary either. people out there who think that because it stars sarah michelle geller it is somehow like the grudge should forget about it. this film is more like dark water, except it is even more predictable and slow moving than it. i was extremely disappointed with this film. it didn't scare me nor interest me either. let's face it , this type of plot has been flogged to death at this stage e.g. the dead trying to contact the living - dragonfly, what lies beneath, ghost story, dark water, darkness, the changeling etc.etc. it seems to me that the only ones writing original horror films nowadays are the japanese and the koreans. the films that are coming out of hollywood, like this, are cynical exercises in money making without a shred of respect for the viewer. they're just being churned out
