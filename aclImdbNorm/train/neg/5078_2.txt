if 1977's "exorcist ii: the heretic" did him no favors, it's hard to imagine what thespian extraordinaire richard burton saw in this drab exercise in non-thrills. you've seen it all before: burton plays a writer who discovered at an early age he possesses the power to move inanimate objects through force of his mind (and you thought "carrie" had no impact on hollywood!). though adapted from a novel by peter van greenaway, "medusa" plays like recycled goods, though the special effects in the cathedral finale are solid (if typical). lee remick is somewhat present as a doctor, but otherwise the supporting cast is extremely weak. burton is hammy but weary...not even telekinesis could save him at this point. *1/2 from ****
