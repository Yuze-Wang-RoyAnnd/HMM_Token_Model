after life is a miracle, i did not expect much. it's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as do you remember dolly bell, for instance. zavet is two hours of silly antics with no story. the wild and unbridled humor of underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here. it appears that kusturica has been going steadily downhill since he started making life-affirming comedies, beginning with black cat, white cat, which i think was great, but already had some disturbing signs of dementia. i liked his early films so much, and this is why it's especially disappointing to see something like this. let's hope his next one will be great.
