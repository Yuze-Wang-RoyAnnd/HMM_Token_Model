put a dvd of this flick in a time capsule, and it will definitely illustrate for future generations a perfect example of one which warrants the minimal rating on a 1-to-10-star scale.<br /><br />bill cosby and ray romano have been at the top - in ratings and with tens of millions in earnings annually - with their television series'. yet each has had no success in big-screen offerings. this has also been true for other tv personalities - perhaps because many of the stories which are presented for two hours or so seem more suited to either a 10-minute skit, or at most, the 22 or 23 minutes of drama during a half-hour program.<br /><br />this film, however, doesn't have one single element which would warrant two or three minutes of time on mad tv, snl, or anywhere else on a screen or stage.<br /><br />its origination date is listed as 2002, but release date - to dvd only - is shown as 2004. it also was filmed not long before rodney dangerfield's death, so its one redeeming value is that it probably provided at lease a few hundred thousand more dollars for his heirs.<br /><br />i'd never heard of it, but found it when turning-on my set, and frankly became fascinated by it. some movies are so truly awful that they rate a sort of top rating in reverse - so bad that you can move the dial backwards to a 9 or 10. "plan 9 from outer space" is the best example - and the bruce jenner/village people opus, "can't stop the music," is another.<br /><br />unfortunately this flick falls short even there. even if rodney's earlier work (as well as some of his fellow cast-members') fell short of "citizen kane" or "casablanca," there were many moments of humor and a story providing at least a modicum of interest.<br /><br />unfortunately, this presentation doesn't seem to possess even a minute or two's worth of such material.
