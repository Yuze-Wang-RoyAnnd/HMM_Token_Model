evidently when you offer a actor enough money they will do anything. i am not sure how much john rys-daves got, but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a rotten movie. the special effects were worse then effects from the 1950's b movies and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse. as to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion. the english was terribly accented and i think no one could really even speak english they just memorized how the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character both "life-like" and real.
