in general i like dinosaur movies but this one is pure crap. no script, no dialogues, no acting. and the brave colonel rance trying to show he is tough and so curving his mouth resembles as a twin brother the stupid proctor from the police academy. so this was a complete waste of time (fortunately not waste of money as i saw the film on tv). and i really cannot understand 7 people who graded this sh*t 10. they must've joked. my advice, if you see this title run from it!
