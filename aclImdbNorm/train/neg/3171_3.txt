was this the greatest movie that i have ever seen? no. was it the worst? no.<br /><br />as a mother of four kids, it is nice to watch something that was light and amusing. it was great, but it was cute.<br /><br />i think that it definitely had some room to improve, but it tried.<br /><br />i am not sure if this movie deserves the extreme level of abuse from the other reviewer. they obviously do not care for eva longoria. i think that she was better in this than in the sentinel. i think that movies are a matter of opinion. the actors play a huge role in whether it is a hit or a flop.<br /><br />maybe the cast did not work out. maybe there were too many things going on.<br /><br />i just wanted to speak up for an average movie, not a terrible one. it could just be a chick flick. kind of like the movie the split-up or french kiss. my husband still talks about those. :)
