this video contains an outsmart way to confuse and manipulate americans about islam. it's a pity that the people who did it really believe that american people is so dumb to believe in it, perhaps, as an american citizen, every person must protest against this kind of crap. if you want to know the truth about islam, don't let nobody tell you... the quran is public! you can read it by yourself and decide if what they say it's true or false...<br /><br />the video uses a lot of audiovisual strategies directed to manipulate and associate things that are not even related. the music used at some points prepare the public to hate what they see, even if they don't really understand what's going on in there. they use images that are misplaced from their original content.<br /><br />to end the comment i would like to make a reflexion... don't you think you can do the same exact movie with every religion in the world?
