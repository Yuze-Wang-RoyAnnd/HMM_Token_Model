for some reason, various young couples hiking through the italian alps split up to see who can reach their campsite designation first. james (gregory lee kenyon) enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of "tyranus" when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse. he then spends the rest of the film running around in the woods hunting down his friends and hacking off their limbs to add to some stew to bring the undead "demonicus" back to life. this shot-on-digital full moon release is stupid, senseless, has terrible acting and sound and the (los) angeles national forest is a poor substitute for italy. however, it's pretty high on the unintentional laugh scale thanks mainly to the overwrought lead performance. whether bug-eyed running around in cheap-looking armor brandishing a sword or spouting neurotic latin gibberish about demons and resurrection, kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery must be seen to be believed. oh well, at least he's not boring like most of the rest of the cast.
