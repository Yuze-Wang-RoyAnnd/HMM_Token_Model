this is not so much film as big budget children's television. as far as i can tell, the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans. this theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as 'insomnia'. when it's first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia, i thought "wow! a nihilistic martial arts film!" but no such luck. although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old man's long, white eyebrows. zu warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off. that's not a good sign. i found the special effects to be somewhere between ray harryhausen and xena: warrior princess. primitive.
