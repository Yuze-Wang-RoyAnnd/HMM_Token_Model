i read john everingham's story years ago in reader's digest, and i remember thinking what a great movie it would make. and it probably would have been had michael landon never got his hands on it. as far as i'm concerned, landon was one of the worst actors on earth, and his artistic license went way over the top, similar to his massacre of the "little house" book series is proof. the acting, for lack of a better word, is atrocious, the screenplay sloppy, and there are more close-ups of landon's puss than should be allowed.<br /><br />this movie reflects everingham's story as much as "little house on the prairie" reflects the books is was "based" on. it's just another vehicle to show off landons horrendous hair.
