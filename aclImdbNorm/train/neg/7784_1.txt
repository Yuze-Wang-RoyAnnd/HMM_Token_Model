this is a wonderfully goofy example of a self produced, written and directed vanity project ...while i was working as a crew member john carradine commented to me (before the burning at the stake sequence): "this is the worst piece of sh*t i've ever worked on ...and i've worked on a lot of pieces of sh*t." also an interesting moment earlier when jim mitchum was having trouble with his lines and started cursing in the courtyard location of the santuario (a religious shrine in chimay'o) - at which point one of the local "vato loco" low-rider onlookers growled "...show some respect man", which apparently caused jim to remember where he was, as he then made a very profound and heartfelt apology for his inappropriate behavior. in any case the crew did the job on deferment and were never fully paid - but came away with plenty of particularly bizarre stories - like the night we caught the producer/director's 10 year old son entertaining himself by constructing miniature burmese tiger traps for us to break our legs in. like they say: "ya gotta' love the biz..."
