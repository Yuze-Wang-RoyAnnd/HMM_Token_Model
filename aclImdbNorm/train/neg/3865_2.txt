this is so incredibly bad. poor actors. you can tell they're trying really hard to polish a turd, but we all know you can't. the writing is so obvious and facile, it's sad watching them try to sell it. the humor and pacing are so labored, it's hard to believe any of these good actors signed on for this.<br /><br />that said, it's so awful that we're having a hard time looking away from the screen. we just have to know where this trainwreck goes. but that's only because we caught it on tv. if we had actually paid for this, we'd be disgusted. <br /><br />so it gets 2 stars for being at least amusingly/fascinatingly bad. and the incidental music (as opposed to the trying-too-hard indie soundtrack) is laughably reminiscent of an episode of scooby-doo... but not as good.
