an uninspired and undistinguished "new" columbo which sees the man-in-the-mac attend his nephew's wedding, only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night. columbo investigates...<br /><br />and that it is about it: indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script, given that it is written by robert van scoyk, who penned the highly enjoyable columbo story "murder under glass" in the detective's heyday; there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to columbo by the script-writer is the narrowing down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding, which include everybody who was there!<br /><br />devoid of every columbo trait possible, i thought i was watching an episode of hill street blues. an insult to the history of the series, with appropriately soap-opera style acting. very avoidable stuff.
