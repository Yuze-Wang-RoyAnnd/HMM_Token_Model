eddie murphy's "delirious" is completely and totally rude, crude, crass and lude. this is indeed the only way to describe this appalling, trashy piece of stand-up. eddie murphy goes for shock value rather than laughs to try and win his following over. he does manage to be funny occasionally, but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and distasteful sex jokes.<br /><br />forget it! unless you happen to enjoy eddie's foul style. i don't think i will bother with "eddie murphy raw". i much prefer eddie in the confines of a movie script.<br /><br />saturday, january 17, 1998 - video
