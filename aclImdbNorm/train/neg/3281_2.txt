i had suspicions the movie was going to be bad. i'm a duke's fan from way back. have three years of the tv series on dvd. well i was right. took the family to see it. i really wanted to see the general jump again and some of the chase jump scenes were good. but to sum it up, the movie was a dumbed down tarted up version of the tv show.<br /><br />jessica simpson was pathetic. while i can honestly say that the original daisy's outfits were just as revealing, jessica simpson's interpretation of daisy was simply awful. sorrel booke and denver pyle must be rolling in their graves as well.<br /><br />don't waste your money. if you are an old tried and true dukes fan like me and my three kids are you will be very disappointed.
