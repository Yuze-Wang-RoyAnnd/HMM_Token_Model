having seen versus previously i had high hopes for alive. the description of the movie on the back of the dvd jacket sounded promising. alive did not deliver. very slow development. loads of potential with the cast and the cool visuals. the premise was intriguing but the payoff did not offset the build up. could have done so much more at the end. most of the movie is just " sitting around ". to put it plainly, three of us were amped to sit down and watch this movie and by the 50 minute mark we were struggling to make it thru to the end. it really needed more shock elements. if you are looking for ichi the killer or versus type fights then save yourself some $ and loads of disappointment.
