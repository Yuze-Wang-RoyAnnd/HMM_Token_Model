what exactly was going on during world war 11 in new zealand when american forces were there?<br /><br />this awful story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to view. can you imagine casting joan fontaine as the older sister to sandra dee? fontaine looked more like her mother. even funnier was that fontaine becomes pregnant in the film.<br /><br />piper laurie and paul newman who showed such great on screen chemistry 4 years later in "the hustler," have no scenes together in this film. laurie plays another sister who goes off to wellington to tramp around there, despite the fact that she is married. woe to her when her husband comes back from the war.<br /><br />jean simmons is widowed and finds romance with a much subdued paul newman. there is even romance for the young miss dee here.<br /><br />the picture has little to no meaning. are they trying to say that all is fair in love and war? if they are, they did a poor job in selling this.<br /><br />the conflict of interest with newman and simmons is quickly disposed of. that is what should have been quickly done to this terribly disappointing film of 1957.
