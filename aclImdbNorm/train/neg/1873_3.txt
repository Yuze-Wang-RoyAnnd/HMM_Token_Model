you must be kidding!!!! let's entertain the possibility that parker posey is really an actress, and not just some entry in the "quirk of the month club" of actors. really, unless this is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek satire on david mamet-- terse, confusing dialog delivered alternately in machine gun rapidity or monotone (think ben stein) blandness--or a flat out dry comedy; this film has got to be in the running for a rotten tomato award---or worse.<br /><br />as if the stiff and uncomfortable posey weren't enough, we've got the stiffer and even more uncomfortable jeff goldblum. there's more wood in this film than a toothpick factory.<br /><br />adding to this already bizarre casting, are several other roles, all populated by forgettable actors, who look or sound like escapees from america's next top model, don pardo, or even the kid, who pronounces the word "been" like "bean", which just brings our attention to the fact that there is so little to like about this film, we are analyzing his accent to guess if he's canadian or not!! i think i laughed heartily in places that are supposed to be serious, and took seriously sections that are meant to be humorous. even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of alarik jans music for mamet's "the house of games". if taken as a spoof, the film is almost droll; if taken seriously, just a self-conscious piece of drek.
