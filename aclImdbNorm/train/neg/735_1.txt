five-year-old michael sees his mother getting axed to death by his serial killer father "the highwayman," who later commits suicide. "20 years later" grown mike (gordon currie, from puppet master 4 and 5) invites seven of his friends to his secluded grandparents home to "master their own fears" at a halloween night costume party. morty, a life-size wooden doll kept in the attic by the indian handyman, becomes possessed by the dead father's spirit and kills them off using their phobias. characters are thrown out a window, drowned in a toilet, eaten by rats, blown up, etc. morty morphs into the dad and a tree, walks around and makes stupid wisecracks. after finding a girl chopped up and stuffed in a cardboard box, the characters remain in the house, act cheerful, crack jokes and have sex.<br /><br />the morty design is good and betsy palmer (mrs. voorhees from the original friday the 13th) is surprisingly delightful as the grandmother, but this thing is even more senseless and confusing than the original and is full of false scares, bad acting, brain-dead characters, repeat flashback footage and annoying distorted camera-work. plus the only two minority characters (the indian and a half-black girl) are the first to die. blah!
