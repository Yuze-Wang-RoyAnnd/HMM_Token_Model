i read the comment of chris_m_grant from united states.<br /><br />he wrote : " a fantastic documentary of 1924. this early 20th century geography of today's iraq was powerful."<br /><br />i would like to thank chris and people who are interested in bakhtiari nomads of iran, the zagros mountains and landscapes and have watched the movie grass, a nation's battle for life. these traditions you saw in the movie have endured for centuries and will go on as long as life endures. i am from this region of iran myself. i am a bakhtiari. <br /><br />chris, i am sorry to bother you but bakhtiari region of zardkuh is in iran not in irak as you mentioned in your comment. iran and irak are two different and distinct countries. taking an iranian for an irankian is almost like taking an american for an mexican. thanks,<br /><br />ziba
