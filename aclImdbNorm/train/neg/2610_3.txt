102 dalmatians [walt disney]: i wasn't a fan of the previous installment and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first, a silly padded storyline, terrible over acting by glenn close, who hams up every scene as though she's playing for her own amusement, and incredibly borring and uninteresting lead actors. once more the dogs are the only "actors" that seem "real" and thats a stretch. another wasted effort here. grade: d
