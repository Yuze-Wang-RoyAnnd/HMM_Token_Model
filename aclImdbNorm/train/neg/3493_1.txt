i rarely write reviews for imdb.com, but i feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible. just terrible. i like shaw bros. movies (i'm not a hater.), and i had high expectations for this one since i found it listed on many "10 best kung fu/martial arts movies" websites. (i'm now convinced that those 10 best lists are all cut-and-paste jobs.) first of all, there's barely any action in the film. most of the movie consists of talking about the plot, which is an amazing feat because it's thin at best. and the action itself may have been impressive back in 1978, but it's routine by today's standards. a special warning to netflix users: the dvd they ship is terrible; the picture is horrendous and it's not even 16:9 enhanced.
