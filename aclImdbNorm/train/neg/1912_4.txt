there's nothing new here. all the standard romantic-comedy scenes, even down to the taxi sprinting to the airport to stop the woman flying away. the only thing that saves this is the acting of alison eastwood & some of the minor characters (blink and you'll miss gabrielle anwar), who obviously had some fun.<br /><br />turn it off when the pair are in bliss, and you won't have to go through the inevitable plot pain.
