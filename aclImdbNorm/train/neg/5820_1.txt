this film is probably the worst film that i have ever seen. i'm studying french at college and thus understood all the dialog, so the language barrier wasn't an issue. i must say it is really hard to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the movie. there is only one professional actor in the cast and i'm guessing no professional directors or writers.<br /><br />although i have rated it 1 out of 10 it probably doesn't merit such a poor rating. this is merely a futile effort of lowering its current overall rating of 7.3 to something more realistic. perhaps 4.3 would be a more accurate rating because the film is a true non-event 100 minutes or so in length that you will never get back.<br /><br />the real shame is that i am sure some college student is busting his nut making a film twice as good and half the length. however if you want to join the bandwagon which seems to be rolling around imdb you might as well go ahead give "lost in translation" a 10 as well.
