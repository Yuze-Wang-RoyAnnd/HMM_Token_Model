gods, i haven't watched a movie this awful in a long while. maybe not since 'the new guy' or various freddie prinze jr. movies. yes, it is that astoundingly awful. mira sorvino's blank and wooden acting surely must've been inspired by freddie. the movie staging was awkward (like a play, rather, and that feeling of confinement does not work well on film). the actors had no idea what they were doing, especially sorvino. her accent was awful and her sex appeal non-existent here so it was painful to see her 'seducing' other characters and they 'falling' for it. and what was with the occaisional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs? nonsensical! i had to turn the dvd player off, it would have been self-inflicted pain to finish this film.
