i'm grateful for one thing and one thing only - that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on an entirely different continent!!! yay!!! this programme summed up perfectly just how obsessed victoria beckham has become with whoring herself and her family out to the media in the name of self promotion and 'brand f*cking beckham'.<br /><br />a few years ago i used to really like 'posh and becks', i still very much admire david's talent, but i have no respect for him anymore. how can you respect someone who has his wife's hand shoved up his backside working him like a puppet.<br /><br />it was clear the hand of victoria was all over beckham's premature departure from manchester united and now the same thing has happened at real madrid. i hope beckham can live with the fact that although he may be earning squillions of pounds - he's sold his soul for the american buck and will end his days playing for a team who would struggle to gain promotion from division one in england (no offence america - but at baseball and basketball you rule - football you don't!) <br /><br />anyway - i digress. it's been years since i've seen such an over-the-top, entirely false performance from 'posh' - this being topped only during her cringe worthy red carpet performances following the rebecca loos 'debacle', when instead of throwing all the cr*p at david he deserved, she desperately clung onto his arm trying to save the million pound money-spinner her marriage has become.<br /><br />this whole pr stunt was pathetic. why can't she just go over there quietly, support her husband through the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep her head down? when did she become so full of self importance that she feels the move to america should be shrouded by this huge fan fare? <br /><br />incidentally, i saw the david beckham documentary last night. at least he has retained a sliver of grace and humility. two things his wife could do with learning.<br /><br />one more thing victoria - you complain about constantly being hounded by the paps. little hint - stop tipping them off about your whereabouts you stupid woman.<br /><br />good luck america!!
