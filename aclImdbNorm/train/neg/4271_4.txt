typical thriller, has been done many times before. simple plot outline; cop liotta becomes obsessed with russell's wife, and he tries to bump off good ol' kurt so he can have her. this is beyond predictable, it doesn't even try to make you guess, the plot is the plot and there's no thinking outside the box here. i guess then the only reason to watch it is to see how it develops, but nothing is done originally or interestingly. there's not really anything to say about this film, it's not particularly bad, but there's no good points either. russell plays russell and you know what you're gonna get when you see him in a film. ditto liotta. stowe has an annoying cher-esque voice. i read the plot outline and i could see the film in my head, it was so obvious and basic. i watched it and it rolled out in front of my eyes exactly as i had imagined. i felt not a drop of emotion throughout. i have no feeling towards this film, it's as if i never even watched it. considering this, it's a pretty pointless film isn't it? still, i'll give it 3/10 for some reason.
