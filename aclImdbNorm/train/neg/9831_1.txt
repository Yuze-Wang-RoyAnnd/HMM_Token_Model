i attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it, for while it is suppose to have a "good" message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture. an interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead a lot of people. in addition, i am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable. never before had i wished for a negative score to rate a movie. so, if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority, then by all means, get this film. this comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi, because the title will deceive a lot of people as well. this was an unfortunate film, because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered. the film's only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the "time machine" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future.
