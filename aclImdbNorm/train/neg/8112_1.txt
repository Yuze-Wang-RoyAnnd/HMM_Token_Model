hanna-barbera sucks the life out of another famous property. the violence is watered down, the stories are formulaic, the animation is bad, the music is obnoxious and repetitive, and frankly, the show just isn't funny.<br /><br />at the time, h-b put every one of its series through the same clich'ed situations, regardless if it fit the world of the cartoon or not. thus, popeye and bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen ("hey! popeye is popular, and the flinstones are popular. put 'em together, and you can't miss!"). also, in an apparent ripoff of "private benjamin," olive oyl and the goon have a regular segment that features them as new army recruits. seriously! why? <br /><br />adding to the annoyance factor are the public service announcements in every episode (standard practice at the time for cartoons, but still annoying). popeye lectures his nephews on crossing the street safely, recycling, and - are you ready for this? - the dangers of smoking! (i swear i'm not making that up.)<br /><br />the only charm remaining from the original cartoons is that jack mercer, the voice of popeye from the early days, continues the role here.<br /><br />worth checking out once just to get a new appreciation for the old fleischer shorts. otherwise, avoid at all costs.
