i was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on imdb after seeing it. this really is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i have seen many bad movies. it looks like a good movie in the beginning, but when he comes into surgery i couldn't believe how bad it got. this voice-over destroys everything! just imagine you are being cut open like that and then listen to what he says. i saw the movie in german so i don't really know what he said in english, but ironic stuff like "yeah right, it doesn't hurt.."?...what is this? telling yourself "think about something else" and then forgetting your pain by just thinking about your girlfriend is just...stupid. and his mother...how the hell does she figure something like that out? someone comes to tell her, her son died in surgery (what she kind of had to expect). plus she found some letters in jessica albas bag. plus that "she knows the hospital" stuff... and then it takes her "one second" to figure it out? what the hell?^^ and the ending...why does the police bust them? the patient died in surgery, thats all that happened. that drunk doctor doesn't know anything else either...and then they bust them all, even the girlfriend??? why??? despite all that i think christensen did a bad job, but that doesn't really count for me...those mistakes and stupid things i wrote about above are the problem. i watched this movie with some friends and we all were very disappointed... as i said, one of the worst movies i have ever seen... just don't watch it ;)
