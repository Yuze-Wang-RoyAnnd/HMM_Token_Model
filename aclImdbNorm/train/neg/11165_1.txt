i mean, really... either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie. it's stupid, ridiculous and just not funny at all.<br /><br />since i saw the preview i knew it wasn't going to be a great movie, i just didn't think it was gonna be that bad...<br /><br />what happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie? when the actors didn't have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny?. now we find ourselves with movies like this one, borat, little men, scary movie 4 where i could not find the funny parts!!<br /><br />just skip this piece of garbage<br /><br />p.s. (sorry for my english)
