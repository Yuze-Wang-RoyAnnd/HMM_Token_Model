considering the original film version of 'the haunting" is in my top ten films of all time' i approached this adaption with trepidation. i was right to be cautious as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old tosh, all those involved should be ashamed. the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason! you see nothing. robert wise used innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work's. the shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from a to b, sadder still is that the ingredients were there (actors such as liam neeson, catherine zeta jones) to do something different. this film should only watched as an example of studio butchery!
