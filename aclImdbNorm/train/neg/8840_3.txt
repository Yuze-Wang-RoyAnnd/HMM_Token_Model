here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea. that is the problem isn't? the concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance. it should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions, get you interested and invested in the characters. this movie doesn't have what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. first you don't really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to, i mean this is not superman or mission impossible here, it's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. they are not believable in the way they act and interact. example : jeffrey combs as a cop over chewing is gum, frowning and looking intense all the time isn't the way to go here. i mean what is that?, he looks like he's on the toilet or something. i loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intense/neurotic, unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. but not for this, he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner, it's not natural, i'm surprised he didn't dislocate his jaw during filming. the movie is basically on life support, it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come.
