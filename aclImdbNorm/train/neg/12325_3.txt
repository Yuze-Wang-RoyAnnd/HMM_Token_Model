i remember that show. i still remember that kick ass fun song "america's funniest people." frankly it should've been titled american's lame or unfunny or downright disgusting people. dave couldn't save this show and neither could bob saget or the replacement hosts for afv that came later. the jackalope segments were hilarious and yes dave could make some good voice overs that were better than bob's. but this show went to hell because of the lame crappy videos people submitted. also it developed as somewhat of a variety show with lame guest stars including the olson twins. plus afv was in it's prime before they started picking the drooling ugly as sin babies as the winner. did i mentioned the videos were disgusting and lame? but still the theme song rocks!
