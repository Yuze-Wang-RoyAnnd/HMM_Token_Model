...because 99 out of 100 times, the producers lied through their teeth (or someone else's) to get you to rent or buy their *mercifully censored*.<br /><br />shock-o-rama cinema proves the truth of this yet one more time with the release of "feeding the masses," a possibly well-intentioned but utterly inept and dismal entry into the zombie genre. folks, this is not only low-budget film-making, this is very low-budget film-making by a bunch of people who--i'm sorry, i know they have families who love them--will never, ever be in variety in any significant fashion. this is one baaaaaaaaaad mooin' pitcher, folks, and not just because it's cheap.<br /><br />the acting is mediocre, but i don't blame the actors; they had no direction. they had no direction because the script was a half-baked zombie fantasy with no sense of real cinematic storytelling. characterization is thin at best, no thanks to weak dialogue and soporific direction. have i mentioned yet that the script and the direction are pretty lame? they are. there's no drama, no tension, no great character moments, nothing. the whole premise of government suppression of the media is squandered on sophomoric "commercial breaks" and an undramatic storyline that defies rational analysis and awkwardly shambles to its ridiculous finish. syd fields would not be pleased.<br /><br />how could the government suppress the truth of a virulent zombie epidemic when the reality of it would be apparent everywhere? why would they give it more than a cursory try? in this day and age of cellphone cameras with wireless access, what could they possibly hope to accomplish for more than a day or so at best? now, if they were covering something up, like their own culpability....but "feeding the masses" never explores such possibilities. instead, it dwells on absurdity and poorly staged events to dig for laughs and/or significance, praying its audience won't notice the near total lack of production value beyond basic film-making equipment. did anyone in this film get paid? i hope the actors did, if only for their time wasted on career blind alleys like this one; at least the techies got to rack up some legitimate work experience.<br /><br />even zombie fans will find little to gain from "feeding the masses." the gore is remarkably tame for no-budgeters of its rank, and there are no distinctive set pieces or memorable effects. they're all eminently forgettable, in fact. knb has nothing to fear.<br /><br />even junk like the aussie stillbirth "undead" was miles ahead of "feeding the masses." sorry, guys, back to the drawing boards, and take your deceptive marketing with you.
