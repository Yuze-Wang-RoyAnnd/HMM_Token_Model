this movie kind of reminds me of a mary-kate and ashley movie-only worse. just the rich sisters kind of thing i think even though alysons more the actress, in this movie amanda michalka was okay sometimes but alysons acting stunk. i think that after high-school musical they needed to come up with somethihng better and this definitely wasn't it. the story line wasn't that great and i think they should have gotten two other people to play taylor and courtney. i'm not a big alyson michalka fan and this movie didn't make me like her any better. i think they should definitely sick to singing and only watch this movie if you have nothing better to do (which sadly i didn't)
