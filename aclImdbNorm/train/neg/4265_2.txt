i am a huge fan of warrior movies. some of my favorites are braveheart, troy, the last samurai and gladiator. and after watching mongol, which is absolutely awesome, and which i strongly recommend, i had high expectations from a sergei bodrov movie. but it was terrible, awful, even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. the whole movie i was waiting for something exciting to happen, but it didn't, then i was at least expecting a big epic battle at the end, but even that was a huge disappointment, just some random running around, waving with the swords... there are so many good warrior movies, this one is not one of them.
