if there was some weird inversed oscar academy awards festival this flick would win it all. it has all the gods, excellent plot, extreme special effects coupled with extremely good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity superstar. well, this could be the scenario if the world was inversed, but it's not. instead it's the worst horror flick ever made, not only bad actors that seem to read the scripts from a teleprinter with bad dyslexia, but also extremely low on special effects. for example the devil costume (which by the way is a must-see), is something of the most hilarious i've ever seen. whenever i saw that red-black so called monster on screen i couldn't hold my laugh back. and to top of things it looked like the funny creature was transported by a conveyor-belt.<br /><br />do not do the same mistake as i did. checking imdb seeing that the movie was released in 2003, had less than five votes and thinking: -"well, it's worth a shot, can't be that bad".<br /><br />yes it could.<br /><br />i'm not even going to waste more words on this movie.
