the french film "extension du domaine de la lutte" directed by iconoclast film maker philippe harel is based on the book of the same name written by a controversial writer michel houellebecq.he has also worked on this film's scenario.according to british cinema magazine sight and sound,it is also known as "whatever".this film has been hailed as a breath of fresh air for french cinema due to its not so common theme of sexual politics and its implications on two stupid information technology workers.the film is marred by its much too evident voice over which introduces us to the main character.this makes us viewers feel as if we are watching a book that is bring read. the basic premise of problems related to loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is fine but the film goes out of hand once the hero starts recounting the misery faced by him and his friend.instead of sticking to its main topic the film veers in other directions leading to its downfall.beware:some women viewers might find not only the film but even its two heroes as moronic misogynists.
