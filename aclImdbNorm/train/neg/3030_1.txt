repetitive music, annoying narration, terrible cinematography effects. half of the plot seemed centered around shock value and the other half seemed to be focused on appeasing the type of crowd that would nag at people to start a fight.<br /><br />one of the best scenes was in the "deleted scenes" section, the one where she's in the principle's office with her mom. i don't understand why they'd cut that. the movie seemed desperate to make a point about anything it could and domino talking about sororities would have been a highlight of the movie.<br /><br />ridiculous camera work is reminiscent of mtv, and completely not needed or helpful to a movie. speeding the film up just to jump past a lot of things and rotating the camera around something repeatedly got old the first time it was used. it's like the directors are wanting to use up all this extra footage they didn't want to throw away.<br /><br />another movie with jerry springer in it? that should've told me not to watch it from the preview.<br /><br />a popular movie for the "in" crowd.
