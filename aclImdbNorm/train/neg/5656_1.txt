ziab la ta'kol al lahem is an awful movie.this is only a superposition of scenes without a clear link.acting is also very bad, despite the presence of a good actor like ezzat el allayli. but something is really astonishing in this movie, talking about sexuality, emancipation of women, nude scenes are very rare in arab cinema,even in this days. i really congratulate the director and the actors for their courage. we want to see more of this style in egyptian movies, but with better quality. the reasons that led me to vote this film as an awful one are not only scenario and acting, but also the lack of prfessionalism. this movie look like an amateur one.we can see a lot of errors in the screen. if you want a good arab movie ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not the one recommended.but if you wish to encourage the uncensored movies in all the arab world watch it and make your friends and your family do the same.
