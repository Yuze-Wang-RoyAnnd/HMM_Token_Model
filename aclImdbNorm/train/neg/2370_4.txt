freddy's dead: the final nightmare starts as dream demon freddy krueger (robert englund) leaves a teenager (shon greenblatt) on the outskirt's of springwood with no memory of himself, who he is or why he is there. the local police pick him up & take him to a youth centre where child psychiatrist maggie burroughs (lisa zane) interviews him, she finds a newspaper cutting in his pocket which leads the two to elm street in springwood where they discover that no children live there & therefore no victims for freddy kill anyone. it all turns out that it's an elaborate plan by freddy to find his daughter & use her to escape springwood. when maggie realises what freddy is up to her & some kids decide they have to kill freddy once & for all...<br /><br />directed by rachel talalay this was made with the intention of being the final a nightmare on elm street film which by this time had reached five, of course as any horror film fan know's if there's still money to be made from a franchise or a character then there's no way in hell freddy's dead: the final nightmare was going to be the last one which, of course, it wasn't. the a nightmare on elm street series has been a franchise of diminishing returns as the films dropped in quality as the series progressed until we got here & freddy's dead: the final nightmare which for my money is probably the worst out of the lot of them. the film moves at a reasonable pace & it's rarely boring but it's so silly, childish & feels like some sort of live-action cartoon with some awful set-piece horror scenes that seem a million miles from wes craven's suspenseful & effective early 80's original. the sequence where stoner spencer is trapped inside a video game being played by freddy is terrible on it's own but then we are treated to shots of his body back in reality bouncing around the house from wall to wall & floor to ceiling which is quite the most ridiculous thing i've seen in a while, or maybe the early scenes when the john doe kid falls from a plane down to the ground just like the coyote cartoon character in the road runner cartoons or the absurd sight of freddy threatening the deaf carlos with pins that he intends to drop to the floor to make a loud noise or when he eventually kills him by scraping his knives across a blackboard. you can't take this seriously & i was just sitting there not quite believing what i was seeing. when they do finally try to kill freddy the hero is given a secret powerful special weapon, yeah that's right a pair of cardboard 3-d glasses! the character's are poor, the dialogue is poor & the plot is confusing, it doesn't really stick to the elm street continuity & overall the film is a bit of a mess, the best thing i can say about it is that it has quite a bit of unintentional humour & you can certainly laugh at it.<br /><br />the film has major tonal problems as it tries to be dark, scary & sinister yet it's so silly & simply looks ridiculous at times that any attempt at being serious falls completely flat. there's not much gore in this one, there's some cut off fingers, some stabbings, someone falls on a bed of nails & that's about it. the body count is extremely low here with only three death's. the final twenty or so minutes of freddy's dead: the final nightmare was in fact shot in 3-d although the version i saw presented this part as normal so i can't comment on how well this does or doesn't work but you can definitely see shots which are meant to be seen in 3-d which take advantage of the process. the special effects vary, some are quite good actually while other's are terrible & freddy's burnt make-up this time looks quite poor.<br /><br />this apparently had a budget of about $5,000,000 (it had an opening weekend box-office take of $12,000,000) & the film has a few nice visual touches & gags which makes the thing feel even more cartoony than it already is. the acting is really poor from the main leads although there are a few odd cameos including tom arnold & roseanne, johnny depp & rocker alice cooper.<br /><br />freddy's dead: the final nightmare is probably the worst of the entire series & apart from some unintentional laugh value there's not much here to recommend or enjoy. fans of the series will probably like it & defend it but for me this is about as far from wes craven's original classic shocker as it gets. followed by new nightmare (1994) which tried to take freddy krueger & the series in a new & different direction.
