straight to the point: "the groove tube" is one of the most unfunny, unclever and downright horrible films ever made. this "comedy" is so void of anything remotely resembling a trace of wit that it's almost incomprehensible that it was even made. i said almost because there are fans of everything after all.<br /><br />this film isn't even "good" bad or "enjoyable" bad. to put this movie on the same level of entertainment as "plan 9" or "robot monster" would be a crime to those films. films like that you can actually watch and get a kick out of. but this film is so bad, so poorly made, acted and scripted and so incredible stale, that there just isn't even a trace of "camp" or "schlock" to be found.<br /><br />even though this was made before saturday night live premiered, comparisons were probably inevitable. i'm not a big fan of snl, but this film is worse than the worst snl skit you can find. and man, that's bad. just to keep the men viewers from leaving, shapiro throws in a pair of breasts every so often, but poorly-filmed breasts from 1974 aren't going to excite anyone these days. truthfully this film is so poorly made and is such a sleep-inducing excursion, i doubt if they excited anyone in 1974 either.<br /><br />a man named ken shapiro made this film. i swear to god, any ten-year old with a video camera could have made something funnier and more clever. it's just downright unreal - this is truly an unbelievable film. the "jokes" and "gags" are so infantile that even little boys who like to sneak dad's porno mags out at night won't laugh.<br /><br />i will give this film one thing - the very last sequence, the "dancing man" sequence, where a guy (shapiro) on the streets of nyc dances to a tune, is easily the best thing in this horrible film. not that the "dancing man" sequence is that great either - it definitely has its moments of not being clever as shapiro desperately tries to fill in the time for the entire song - but it actually was somewhat watchable. the part of this sequence where the cop starts dancing with the man is the one sole trace of cleverness in the entire film. no wonder shapiro put this sequence last - again, while not so great itself, it easily beats anything else in this "film."<br /><br />otherwise, this film is such a complete piece of crap, it's unfathomable as to how an actual human being can be so downright cleverless. the name of this film should have been "ken shapiro's craparama." it's amazing that this was made, but many truly talented filmmakers can't get in. however, i will say that i bet the geniuses at nyu would love this movie. total garbage.
