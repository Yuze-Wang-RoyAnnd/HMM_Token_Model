this is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80's hit . it's set in the modern day as we see a base in afghanistan get destroyed by a uav right at the start.<br /><br />and that's exactly where the movie jumps the shark. uav's aren't armed. they could be but i don't think it's ever been tried for real. we get to see the computer that has masterminded this operation, called r.i.p.l.e.y. we are introduced to "hacker" will farmer (he's good at chemistry & electronics which doesn't make him a computer hacker) & his love interest, annie) & will's 1st attempt at hacking is not only a complete failure his ip address is also logged and annie guessed who it was. we also meet wills mom who works for a chemical company.<br /><br />wills taking money from his neighbours bank account (mr massude) isn't a hack (he helped him set up the account), we then get a nod back to the original movie where they decide against playing global thermonuclear war & they play the dead code. the trace the ripley office are running is not on will but on massude's pc so all the evidence they were gathering was useless against will.<br /><br />exactly why ripley shut will's machine down isn't explained (he's only playing an online game?) & also why it felt the need to have to shut down all the electricity in the entire block he lived in as well. why a counter terrorism agency would see this as a viable target is extremely questionable. as for ripley activating his mobile phone? i think not, it wasn't connected to the pc and the message wouldn't play unless he actually answered the phone so there's more bad "hacking" science there too.<br /><br />ripley agents arrive at massude's home, take him away & will is given a envelope which turns out to contain a lot of money. will searching for the licence plate of the car that took massude isn't a "hack" as you never see him break into the dmv computer. the ripley agents who grab dennis in the airport as he's looking for will have no authority to arrest or detain him. will's mother hadn't "been stealing chemicals & bio agents" either. and even if she did they had no right to arrest or detain dennis. patriot act or not.<br /><br />i don't know why will was worried about being arrested for any crime in canada as its a totally different country with different laws to the us.<br /><br />the computer has gone rogue and all the action its taken against will, his mother & dennis wasn't sanctioned by a government agency. the phone phreak we see will do is the 1st show of any hacking skill in the movie, we also get a hack into ripley which seemed too easy for such a powerful system.<br /><br />the "guy" who ran into annie at the airport & was also watching them in the street was nothing to do with ripley & the laughable notion that ripley could track a cellphone whilst underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer reads lips.<br /><br />another reference to the original movie when they mention stephen falken as the designer of the system ripley replaced, the joshua project. we discover that the "guy" who ran into annie is falken (not played by the original actor sadly) who faked his own death.<br /><br />we also get to see wopr as "what's going to help" them beat ripley and they kept the same voice used back then. falken & wopr are destroyed too quickly after being hardly used at all (the same explosion should kill will, annie & the russian. it's also unlikely they'd create a self-contained computer system that has the ability to nuke or drop chemical weapons on the country it operates out of.<br /><br />the whole "decontamination" plot & idea are totally unbelievable. those kinds of orders would have to go through the president or joint chiefs of staff. so yet another laughable & unbelievable idea.<br /><br />the ip hacks against ripley aren't done by will, he just contacts one of his friends who suggests & implements the idea. it's excessively laughable that will would get a login just from increasing ripley's operating temperature. having joshua as a backdoor into ripley (especially after it had been blown to bits) is an incredible cop-out and screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas left and wanted to get this movie over and done with.<br /><br />there is an awful good where ripley is playing dead code and we see a countdown (saying 17 minutes) then ripley says "decontamination in 30 minutes", how crap is that when they can't even keep up with their own timer? ripley's attack mission against philadelphia is halted (far too easily in my opinion) and it decides to attack joshua in its internal circuits and reroutes the missile aimed a philly to washington where ripley is stationed. the idea of the nuclear exchange to make ripley realise what she's doing won't work (surely she'd already know if she had joshua insider her as he'd already learnt this lesson in the original movie?) is yet another nod back to the original movie.<br /><br />their cop-out at having ripley repeat joshua's exact same words form the end of the original movie just goes to show how many original ideas they were unable to come up with.<br /><br />if you want to point fingers for bad & stolen ideas the men to blame are randall badat & rob kerchner. this is an awful movie and is best avoided.
