a pretty obvious thriller-by-numbers, in which the only possible twist turns out to be a hiding to nothing. i was watching principally for the english-language performance by isabelle huppert. it wasn't great, but then it was a strange role. i wouldn't be surprised if half her contribution turned out to have been left on the cutting-room floor along with several last minute script re-writes.<br /><br />the acting is the least appealing thing about this film. steve guttenburg looks like he's trying to flesh out his role with the charm that everyone's told him he has. there's a sensationally stupid sequence in which it's suggested that his sexual prowess will be able to help treat ptsd. it's an uninteresting performance. elizabeth mcgovern is more of a draw with genuine charm and character but it's small consolation. 3/10
