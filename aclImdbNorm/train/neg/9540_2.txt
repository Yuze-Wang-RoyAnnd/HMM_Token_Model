the only reason to see this movie is for a brilliant performance by thom-adcox hernandez who is underused in the movie within the movie. as usual tom villard is good, too. otherwise it's c**p. the possesor doesn't even exist how does he magically change the letters on the theatre marquee to spell out "the possessor"? lame.
