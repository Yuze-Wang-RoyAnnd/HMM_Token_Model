i'm not going to criticize the movie. there isn't that much to talk about. it has good animal actions scenes which were probably pretty astonishing at the time. clyde beatty isn't exactly a matin'ee idol. he's a little slight and not particularly good looking. but that's ok. he's the man in that lion cage. we know that when he can't take the time away from his lions to tend to his girlfriend, he will end up on an island with her and have to save the day. someone said earlier that it is a history lesson. the scenes at the circus are of another day, especially the kids who hang around. i didn't realize that even back in the thirties, they sailed on three masted schooners. it looked like something out of 1860. i guess that's the stock footage they had. no wonder the thing got wrecked. they're always talking about fixing her up. there's even a dirigible. it tells us a little about male female relationships at the time, a kind of giggly silliness. but if you don't take it too seriously, you can have fun watching it.
