`in the tradition of 'carrie' and 'heathers'? try `a shameless ripoff of not only those two films, but 'the evil dead' and 'the shining' as well.' that said, they really don't make bad horror movies like this anymore, and that's a shame, 'cause it's a gas.<br /><br />rainbow harvest is the winona substitute here, and although she barely does more than mumble her lines (and occasionally scream, `you're ugly!!!' into her haunted mirror), she's goth way before it's fashionable, so you have to respect her. (and she's quite creative about it too, accessorizing with black leather scarves and a kind of black-spray-painted hawaiian-punch-guy hat. eat your heart out, cher.)<br /><br />karen black overacts a bit, but she's not totally without dignity, and you can't help but sympathize with her. (unless you're a certain friend of mine, who asked, `who is that, horse lips from 'm.a.s.h'?' the first time she came onscreen.)<br /><br />there are decent supporting performances by kristin dattilo (as the square chick who befriends rainbow), ricky paull goldin (in his trademarked wisecracking hunk role), and william `larry, darryl and darryl' sanderson (as some kind of pet undertaker, or something). but it's sad to see the once smokin' yvonne decarlo reduced to playing what can only be thought of as the charlotte rae part.<br /><br />the eighties were the heyday for hilarious, mindbogglingly dumb horror movies like this, and `mirror, mirror' was one of the last of its kind. definitely worth a look.
