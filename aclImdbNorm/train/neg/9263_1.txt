what was the deal with the clothes? they were all dressed like something out of the late 70's early 80s. the cars were even were outdated. the school was outdated. the nuns attire was outdated, and the hospital looked like something from the 40's, with its wards and wooden staircases and things. nothing in the whole movie implied it took place in 1991. my mother was laughing, saying "geeeee-od! when was this movie made?" when we pressed the "info button" on our remote, we were sure 1991 had to be typo! did anybody else notice this? my favorite part, though, was when the woman tells her uppity muck husband, on the telephone, about the inverted cross in the mirror, and he just says "well, look, i've got a congress meeting. i'll talk to you about it later." that line was just classic. just like a man! my mothers favorite part was when they gave the "spawn of the devil child" her very own rottweiler. my mother said "just what the spawn of the devil needs... a rottweiler" she also enjoyed all of the people collapsing in the churches, clutching their chests. her other favorite part was the guy at the school parking lot, driving 5 miles a hour, driving right into the garbage truck/dump truck/front end loader thingee. he had about 20 seconds to just stop the car...but he just kept going, with a real dumb vacant look on his face. i mean, how fast can you go in a school parking lot?!?! whatever!
