entertainment tonight has been going down hill for the last few years, but as of last night (aug 17th 2006) they reached a new low.<br /><br />in an effort to try to hype up their broadcast, they decided to post actual photos of jonbenet ramsey's body in their teasers last night ...saying "pictures from the case you have never seen before". the two photos were graphic and very disturbing. one was of the side of her face and head/neck and you could clearly see the cord that was used to strangle her around her neck, and bruising on her face. this was so hideously awful, i could not believe it. how has this got to do with anything remotely related to hollywood entertainment?? nothing!! they have dropped their level of dignity and values to a new low....and it shows. this used to be the premiere show to watch...and it's just garbage now.<br /><br />i will watch access hollywood from now on.
