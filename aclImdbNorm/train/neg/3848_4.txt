the film is almost laughable with debbie reynolds and shelley winters teaming up as the mothers of convicted murderers. with the horrible notoriety after the trial, the two women team up and leave n.y. for california in order to open and song and dance studio for shirley temple-like girls.<br /><br />from the beginning, it becomes apparent that reynolds has made a mistake in taking winters with her to california. winters plays a deeply religious woman who increasingly seems to be going off her rocker. <br /><br />to make matters worse, the women who live together, are receiving menacing phone calls. reynolds, who puts on a blond wig, is soon romanced by the wealthy father of one of her students, nicely played by dennis weaver.<br /><br />agnes moorehead, in one of her last films, briefly is seen as sister alma, who winters is a faithful listener of.<br /><br />the film really belongs to shelley winters. she is heavy here and heaviness seemed to make her acting even better. winters always did well in roles testing her nerves.<br /><br />the ending is of the macabre and who can forget winters at the piano banging away with that totally insane look?
