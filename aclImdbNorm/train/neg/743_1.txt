holy freaking god all-freaking-mighty. this movie was so bad, i thought i was on drugs. in a bad way... the character acting is the poorest thing i've seen in quite some time. this movie was more akin to lord of the g-strings, imho(it's a real movie). most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen. my favorite part was when they are in the carriage, and you can tell there's no horse. they're fleeing from alien monsters, and going about the same speed as a swift jog. then it switches to a far-shot with a ridiculous cg horse. and the cg in general seems to be sub-par to 1992's beyond the mind's eye. i mean, come on, really. it felt like a horrible episode of hercules, only without kevin sorbo there to save the day. worst. movie. ever.
