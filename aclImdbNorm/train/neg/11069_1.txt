i really felt cheated after seeing this picture. it felt like i sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing. i don't understand what they were thinking when they made this. it hardly gets into jeffrey dahmer murdering and it has no ending. it felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel. it was like watching a television episode of the sopranos. it ends suddenly, and you know there's going to be another episode next week. it also felt like i just watched part 1 to a two part movie. there are many possibilities for what went wrong here; they got lazy, they ran out of money, they didn't know the rest of the story, they wanted to make a dahmer 2. after seeing this movie they all sound very accurate. i was watching jeffrey dahmer walking through the woods. all of a sudden i hear this music playing, then writing comes on the screen and says how dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of 34. wow, he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail. how about showing how he got there. how about showing dahmer's trial. how about showing some more detail. i can't even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place. i actually found myself saying in disbelief, "that's it, that's the end?" i want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good dahmer movie yet to be made. to the filmmakers i'd like to say, if you're going to do it, do it right.
