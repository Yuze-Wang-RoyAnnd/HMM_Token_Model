seriously, i can easily stomach a lot of on screen blood, gore and repulsiveness, but what really makes this film disturbing & uncomfortable to watch is how the doctor character keeps on rambling about the physical damage done to raped women. he, john cassavetes of "rosemary's baby", talks about ruptured uterus, dry intercourse and massive loads of reddish (?) sperm like they are the most common little ailments in the world of medicine. that being said, "incubus" is an ultimately strange horror effort. it isn't necessarily awful
