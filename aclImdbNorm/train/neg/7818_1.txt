i usually don't walk out of a movie, but halfway thru i did. this movie promised something different, but i kept thinking haven't i seen that before? spoiler alert! back in 1, the spaceship crashes and lands on earth, well, all these years later, with a super adult on board no less, this thing still manages to burn up and crash! what, this advanced civilization can't seem to develop landing gear? for an industry that's so liberal, we get to see another woody allen movie, no blacks please! superman runs around saving people, making sure he sticks to europe and the us, don't go into darkie areas please. maybe i could stomach this about 30 years ago, but now now.
