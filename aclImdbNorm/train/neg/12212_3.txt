an offensively over-the-top action adventure,first blood part ii seemed to catch the mood of the us at the time of it's release in the mid-80's,with right-wing reaganism and virulent anti-red feelings still not finished yet,though the emergence of a certain mikhail gorbachev in the heart of the 'evil empire' in moscow would soon render these types of films redundant;even reagan himself eventually admitted this truism.<br /><br />in that sense,we can be most grateful to 'gorby',not for his disarmament treaties with the us,nor his policies of 'glasnost',or even his support of democracy being restored to the eastern european countries in the former soviet union's backyard.no,it's the final diminution of foolish,jingoistic,bloated cold-war adventures like this.the first rambo film was hardly perfect,though at least was a mildly literate and adequate action thriller with a not too bad storyline.in this sequel,any sense of even the remotest conviction is instantly jettisoned for silly,senseless plotting and incident in which rambo single-handedly takes on scores of brainlessly stereotyped vietnamese and russian troops to rescue american pow's ten years after the conflict ended,with the americans on the losing side.<br /><br />perhaps the reason why the film was a huge box-office success was to let many americans wallow in fantasy;they may have lost the war,but there was still unfinished business at hand,and ludicrous comic-strip heroics with a robot-like hero killing virtually every red on sight,with as much hardware as possible,fulfilled such whimsically far-fetched ideals.<br /><br />this could have been entertaining on a superman/spiderman level,but sadly everything is played absolutely straight.but that is not to say that there is no humour in the film;sadly it is virtually all of the unintentional kind.the action scenes,though technically adequate,never once carry the slightest bit of conviction or persuasiveness,because they are always placed in the most spectacularly unbelievable of contexts;namely,our hero rambo is always unscathed (aside from a few cuts and bruises here and there) despite the tons of explosives,grenades,gunshots,etc.going around him.<br /><br />in between the mayhem,what there is of a script consists of the dullest clich'es and banalities.stallone,who co-wrote the script with james cameron (a long way from the exciting terminator made the previous year),deliberately seems to have given the rambo character as little to say in understandable english,and merely comes out with moronic grunts,almost as though he has invented his own brand of patois only understandable to himself.maybe his colleague cameron was thinking of the terminator again with so little communication involved for the lead character! in this sense rambo seems even less of a human than the terminator did! the rest of the cast do little better with good actors like charles napier and richard crenna doing their admirable best with the hackneyed dialogue they are given,and steven berkoff hamming it up outrageously yet again with another of his russian kgb/red army villain roles.berkoff's overplaying is mildly enjoyable but not remotely menacing.how come that sly managed to survive berkoff's electric shock torture to kill yet more of those red commie scumbags? well,credibility is never this film's strong point.it is a work of fantasy comparable with the wizard of oz.at least that was meant to be a fantasy,and an immortal classic it turned out to be.this is only a classic of the most dismal,and indeed offensive,kind.and as for sly's climactic speech...,rather hypocritical after slaughtering all those people,eh? by the way,in the same year,he also made rocky iv..........<br /><br />rating:3 out of 10.
