i work at a blockbuster store and every week we have movies that come in with just a few copies, these are the kind of movies that the sci-fi channel shows. the kind of movie that nobody ever wants, and only that idiots rent, when they bring it back i ask them "was it any good?", they say "no we turned it off after 15 minutes!" movies with terrible computer generated, super imposed monsters and such like, very unappealing.<br /><br />this is the same type of movie that grendel is, and absolute waste of time, if you want a reasonably (and only reasonably) good beowulf based movie then try beowulf & grendel , starring gerard butler, who is also starring in the eagerly anticipated 300, as king leonidas of sparta.<br /><br />plus, later this year we have another beowulf movie, with a star studded cast ranging from anthony hopkins and brendan gleeson, to angelina jolie and john malkovich.<br /><br />but don't let that get your hopes up like we all did with eragon, or we are all in for another big disappointment.<br /><br />and regarding rentals, here is my rule of thumb: if there is only one or two copies, don't rent it because its a load of crap.( this is true 99.9% of the time, usually not true if the title is foreign, or a documentary.)
