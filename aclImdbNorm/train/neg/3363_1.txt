the original movie ( dated 19??)did not show any "monster" , it just suggested scary "things" , .<br /><br />this version however shows every aspect of a "sick minded ghost" , including unnecessary special effects . <br /><br />the "mystery " ,as presented in the original movie , was the most scary part : one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened. by showing the face of the "old man" , this mister has completely disappeared. even worse : the special effects ( crying wooden children faces) is ridiculous. this is a stupid remake , too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original
