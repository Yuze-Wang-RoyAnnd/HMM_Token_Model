this game has the(dis)honor of being the first game that i have stopped playing right in the middle of and felt like smashing into bits and then burning. congratulations. first and last tomb raider i will ever play i assure you.<br /><br />plot: just typing that word made me laugh. there isn't one. neither is there character development. we finally have a girl heroine who can take care of herself,who isn't a *beeping*mary-sue,but unfortunately she dresses like a slut and her breast are huge. they had to attract the sexist boy gamers you see. anyway all she does is go in tomb after tomb shooting things as she goes along. why she does this i have no idea. i had subtitles on and the t.v. as loud as i could and i still didn't understand a damn thing. the development(or lack there of) for her, her two friends and the*villains*were laughable. there also will be levels that you have to go through that do-not give you any hint on what you have to do next and you literally will be in most of the boring as hell tombs for hours trying to figure out what the hell you are supposed to be doing. there is one course(out of two) in particular with her on a motorbike(believe me it is not at all fun)that you will be on for atlease an hour with no save point in sight. that means you get hit by the other motorist and guys in vans shooting at you or you hit a tree you start the hour long trek over.<br /><br />boss stupid f*ck: you know lets makes the levels very long, have basically no save points, have no story, no character development, give no variety in game play, have most of the music on the longest levels ear-bleeding,and give no hints whatsoever to the player so they can stay even longer in a place instead of getting to the nonexistent plot.<br /><br />stupid f*ck one: those sound like bang up ideas.<br /><br />stupid f*ck two: i concur. who needs character development ,plot, or unboring game-play.<br /><br />todd: i'm sorry sir,but these ideas seem like they will extremely p*ss the player off.<br /><br />boss stupid f*ck: shut up todd. you're fired.<br /><br />game-play: all she does is shoot. of course she can flip while shooting, jump while shooting, or kick while again shooting.but flipping, jumping, and kicking does not erase the fact that all she is ultimately doing is shooting. boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! music: the intro music is extremely beautiful. i love listening to it. the in game music goes from tolerable to wanting to cut your ears off.<br /><br />visuals:considering this game was made in 2006, i was expecting the visuals to blow me away.well i was blown,but definitely not in a good way.<br /><br />bottom-line: this game is a plot-less, no character development mess with a barely dressed unmarysuish(thankfully)young women in the lead that goes through boring tombs for some boring reason(what that might be i couldn't tell you)with unimaginative shooting gameplay. stay far away from this b.s.!!!!!!!!it's gets two stars for having a women who isn't a damsel in distress(no matter how scantily clad she might be) and the beautiful into music.
