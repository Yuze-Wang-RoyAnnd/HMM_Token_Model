the first one was the best. the second one sucked because the dialog was terrible. although, the storyline wasn't so bad (in fact, all story lines are good and bad). throughout the movie, i dosed off a few times. i know that jackie chan is a great martial arts expertise, but not a good actor in rush hour 2. chris tucker, too, wasn't good. and zhang ziyi, what can i say, a few lines, terrible acting (but that's based on her script). all the characters there were not that good. but, some of the things i like in rush hour 2 is always the action and less sex scenes. i know that jackie chan doesn't do those things which is good for him.
