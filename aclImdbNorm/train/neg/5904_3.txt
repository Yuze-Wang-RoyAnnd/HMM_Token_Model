with the runaway success of "god's army", every mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now. in the case of the recent "the other side of heaven", this wasn't at all a bad thing. that film, while not great, was quite good. "the singles ward", however, is not.<br /><br />telling the story of a young, divorced mormon guy thrust back into single life, the writing and shooting style of "the singles ward" is, in many ways, very similar to the 80s comedy "ferris bueller's day off". however, the similarities end there. while "ferris bueller" was funny, original, and well-acted (as far as stupid comedies like this ever are), "the singles ward" is completely the opposite. it tries very hard to be funny. however, 90% of the gags either fall flat or are cliches and jokes you've probably heard a million times before. the other 10% seem to be thrown in to fill out the time. and the acting, while not awful, is amaturish at best.<br /><br />in addition, if you're not either a mormon yourself, or very, very familiar with mormon culture, you won't get hardly anything at all. whereas "god's army" and "the other side of heaven" were appealing to a broad range of viewers, both inside and outside of the mormon church, this film is most definitely one big inside joke, and even if you get it, it's just not that funny.
