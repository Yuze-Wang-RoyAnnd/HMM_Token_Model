good lord, whoever made this turkey needs to be buried alive. i'm sorry, but the other reviewer must not have seen this movie, he must be watching something else, or have never seen a movie before... 9 out of ten stars? he's saying what, this is as good as ben hur or gone with the wind? unintentionally funny, massively unbelievable characters, absurd situations, looks like it was shot in griffith park (which works out pretty well--mash was shot in griffith park), crappy script, just about everything that could possibly be wrong with a movie all rolled into one package. should be required viewing for all prospective film makers as an example of how a movie could be horribly wrong. it reminds me of something a usc student may make for a film class. <br /><br />give this one a pass unless you do drugs and are into high camp.
