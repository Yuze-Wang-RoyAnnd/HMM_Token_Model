susan seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top notch credits under her belt. i'm certainly glad she bounced back from this film which seems to have its admirers. i'm not one of them.<br /><br />i've seen better acting in high school plays than i did in smithereens. the plot such as it is involved young susan berman who is ambitious to make it in the world of music and is willing to do just about anything to get there. she even rejects the sincere advances of a young artist who is living out of his van off the east river played by brad rijn.<br /><br />young mr. rijn contributes the worst performance in the film, in fact one of the worst acting jobs i've seen in a long time. no wonder he's not gone anywhere.<br /><br />i will say that seidelman's eye for the camera is a good one in capturing the familiar east village locations where the film was mostly shot. but her work with her live performers didn't measure up. i'm not sure she had that much raw material to work with.<br /><br />look fast and you'll see a very young christopher noth before law and order and sex in the city as a street hustler.<br /><br />if you like punk rock, you might sit through this for the soundtrack. i'll stick to bing crosby.
