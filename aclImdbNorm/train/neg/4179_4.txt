#1 vampires vs. humans<br /><br />#2 military-reject roughneck squad as first responders to dangerous, unknown vampire incursions.<br /><br />#3 sexy female vampire on the side of the "good guys".<br /><br />#4 plenty of gore and action.<br /><br />there are four (4) major plot devices that may help you decide if you want to watch this movie. if you want all four, then the next plot device may not deter you...<br /><br />#5 in outer space.<br /><br />that last one almost got me too, but i'm glad i watched. in a pile of terrible direct-to-video horror that is the sci-fi channel halloween marathon... this movie is a breath of fresh air. it will stand-up against any of the other sci-fi channel offerings, and even against the other vampire movie natassia starred in (who keeps giving uwe boll money?).
