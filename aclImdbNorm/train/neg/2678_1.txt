nothing positive to say. meandering nonsense, huffing and puffing with a "message". new russian (post-soviet) films can be very good (cuckoo comes to mind), yet many have the bouquet of cardboard and the aftertaste of asbestos (nochnoi dozor would be a good example). this is a "dozor" type of emptiness. acting would be horrible if not for the saving grace of utterly unappealing direction and incompetent editing that sometimes is so awful that it distracts from the impotence of the actors. special award to the cameraman for making sure that every shot is shaky (would someone please realize that blair witch has had its 15 seconds of undeserved fame?) and takes are geared towards attention-deficit pre-teens who subside on counterstrike and masturbation. the female lead poses and tries to look seductive too often, male antihero need a diction coach (although genetics aren't bad: rather expressive eyes.) one (middle) finger for this irrelevant pile of non-art. anyone who reviews this positively better be a (distant) cousin of the "auteurs".
