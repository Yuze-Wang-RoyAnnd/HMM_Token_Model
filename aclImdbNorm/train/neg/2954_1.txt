i watch lots of bad films, lots!!!!!! it's kind of a hobby, really. almost every saturday nite a group of friends and i get together and watch trash from around the globe - anything. turkish super hero movies, vampire flicks from brazil, italian gorilla transplant movies, kevin costner films, anything (except maybe raising helen) but ihave never seen a worst film than theodore rex. never. and it's not even entertainingly bad in an ed wood kinda way - it just sucks. now this film was famous in hollywood at the time it was made because whoopi took off the gloves and made it clear to the press and anyone else who would listen that she hated this piece of crap = she tried to get out of her contract, she whined, she moaned but nonetheless they pour her fat butt into this leather skin tight futuristic cop uniform that is ghastly to see, yikes!!!! and you can just see her seething during takes - doing everything but looking off camera for her agent so she can scream at him. the dinosaur has about three facial expressions and the script is so horrible a third grade class could do a better job if promised cookies.
