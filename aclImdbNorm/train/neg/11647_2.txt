crime boss is directed by alberto de martino; an italian crime drama partially filmed in hamburg, germany. an easily forgotten movie. even in spite of a good car chase sequence, this flick seems to lumber on almost aimlessly. a new don takes over a powerful mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life. unwritten laws and ethics of the mafia code make it hard to trust in anyone especially when millions of dollars are at stake. brutality and violence breed the same in return. this can not be put on a shelf with the real gangster epics. just the look of the film brings back memories of american drive-in fare. even the popular american actor telly savalas can't boost the calibre of this crime drama. antonio sabato also stars with:paola tedesco, guido lollobrigida, serio tramonti and piero morgia.
