my score for this crap: 1 / 10 1 for the technical only. everything else is very bad. <br /><br />another film that makes no sense. clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost a impossible mission. <br /><br />while it's easy to understand why politicians never say the truth, they are among the biggest liars on the planet, it is difficult to understand how to make films so pathetic. <br /><br />we must believe that taking people for morons. perhaps it was reason to believe, since 99% of the films are crap. because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios. <br /><br />when you look at the price we give oscars, we understand better why we continue to make films any more ridiculous than others. <br /><br />and oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense. but it was not for education and health. <br /><br />if you still want to listen to this s**t, press super fast forward button (at least 20x).
