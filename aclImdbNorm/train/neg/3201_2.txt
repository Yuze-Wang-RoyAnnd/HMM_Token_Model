joe don baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there...he was alright in goldeneye and made a pretty good bond villan in the living daylights and has appeared in various other movies. one thing he can't do is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in malta. joe don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in malta and the killer gets away. the rest of the movie is seeing joe don chase the killer here and there, joe don getting taken into custody various times, joe don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on. the movie is quite bad and you won't find yourself exactly pulling for joe don's character. you will be amazed at how many times joe don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be. the crowning part of the movie comes when joe don chases the killer all over malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around malta. this movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever.
