i had high expectations for this indie having perused the many thumbs up reviews. then....<br /><br />here's my additional 'two cents' to the already posted, excellent 'lost in translation' review. premise: morgan is 'stuck' in a dusty small town where he meets lovely scarlet who is working in the local supermarket. can morgan help elevate the lovely scarlet from her trailer trash life?<br /><br />realistic dialog? not. how about that shopping in target. first, freeman looks at the target interior as if he's walked into harrods. then, he's bowled over at a t-shirt rack confirming he has never been in any store visited by lovely scarlet. morgan is detached from any and all aspects of scarlet's reality and is portrayed as gleeful in his ignorance of everyone and everything in scarlet's life.<br /><br />one reviewer enjoyed the scarlet and ex-hubby fight scene where her survival, a car in this instance, requires she physically attack her ex hubbie. does freeman run to her defense....naw...he's cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real, sorry lot in life. <br /><br />freeman's character believes a car wash and new very revealing, tight fitting blouse is the key to scarlet's job interview. another sign that freeman is clueless. freeman's endless 'stage talk' where all aspects of scarlet's reality are reduced to one or another stage related freeman experience was irritating. <br /><br />freeman is right to emphasize that scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces vis a vis: uneducated, no white collar skills or experience, very poor, no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem. scarlet learns such life lessons from freeman as: some people pay $100 for a t-shirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her lack of education and white collar job skills. in the end freeman offers scarlet little more than strange diversion with a 'star',not even paying for gas for scarlet's dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which freeman cares not to know.
