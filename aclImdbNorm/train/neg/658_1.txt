i wish i could give this movie a zero out of ten. before going to this movie the day after it came out, i came on imdb to check out the comments. a comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog. i never go by other people's opinions, so i wasted seven dollars for this crap movie. it had to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen.<br /><br />the person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff. since when do scary movies have sappy scenes? i swear, i'm amazed there weren't any group hug ^-^ moments.<br /><br />i think i jumped. once. and that's because i zoned out, thinking about my research paper for english. the clich'ed, birds/cat popping out of nowhere thing when you thought something was gonna happen.<br /><br />and the characters were stupid. my friend and i almost died laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said, "i have to get my mom's shawl!!!" you. idiot. screw the shawl! safety is just a few steps away, but no, my mom's shawl (that didn't match the dress by the way) is wayyyy more important than my health and safety. and to top it all off, they take her back to her house, knowing that the killer knew where she lived. god.<br /><br />my friend and i also predicted the entire movie. and not just the, i bet he's hiding under the bed, moments. it was the, "he stole the bellhop's clothes and sneaked out of the hotel" and "it's the detective coming down the hallway, not the killer!" moments. movies should never be this predictable. disney movies aren't even this predictable.<br /><br />i'm gonna complete my rant now by saying, this was a terrible movie. i'm glad i went to see it in theaters so i wouldn't buy it for $15.00 and then hate it. it was just bad. it would've been better if only one thing would've happened. if, after being shot by the detective, the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in. knife in hand, falling and stabbing the girl on his way down. oh, how lovely that would've been.<br /><br />don't waste your time or money. go see a good movie.
