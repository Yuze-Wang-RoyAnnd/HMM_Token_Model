the house of the dead was the worst movie i have ever seen, between the pathetic 'matrix' 360 camera angle attemps and the cheesy acting i fell asleep. i don't think that the director and set manager could decide whether it was raining or not, because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other. i would rate this movie a 1 out of 10, (10 being the best, 1 being the worst). also jumping scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying, it makes you wonder if they were just making up for lose time. i beg anyone who reads this, not to see it. it's not worth the time.
