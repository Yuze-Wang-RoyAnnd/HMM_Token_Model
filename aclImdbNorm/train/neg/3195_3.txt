two qualifiers right up front: i actually think joe don baker can be good or even great with the right material and the right director (the "cape fear" remake, a small role in "goldeneye", "walking tall"). and i even liked baker in "mitchell", because he was playing an anti-hero who was supposed to be unlikeable. yes, mst3k's coverage was hilarious, but they took a lot of cheap shots at baker - that he didn't deserve - to keep things lively and entertaining - he was appropriate to the level and tone of the movie, and he was the best part of the movie.<br /><br />"final justice" seems to be more of the same, but in spite of the exotic locations and the "cowboy frontier justice" theme, it is quite a bit weaker than "mitchell". and the main reason is that baker's character, as written, is an idiot. the movie has the conceit that because baker embodies old style frontier machismo, he challenges his opponents to old style mano-a-mano quick-draw contests. and because he's so tough and macho, he always wins, even when he's hurt, wounded, outnumbered, etc.<br /><br />that's a conceit with a lot of potential (it worked for gary cooper), even if it condemns the film to "b" movie status. but baker is so frigging stupid and obsessive that he needlessly challenges three of the bad guy's henchman to a showdown in a public market, with civilians all over the place. he could have simply shadowed them to the chief bad guy's headquarters (which was why he was following them in the first place) and they never would have noticed. or he could have gotten the drop on them and forced them to surrender, and gotten one of the henchmen to take him to headquarters at gun point. but no, he has to be a bush league hot dog and a macho blockhead, and so he gets a child taken as a hostage in the ensuing shootout! <br /><br />this is a guy we are supposed to admire? <br /><br />the whole movie is basically like this. most of the supporting actors are somewhere between ok (the henchmen) to pretty good (the chief bad guy and his father, who are two well known european actors - they just go through the motions, but they are pros and even hamming it up they are decent). but through it all, baker's character pulls silly , unproductive stunts and mistakes that get at least two relatively innocent people killed, plus a couple of bad guys who might have been taken alive without the use of deadly force.<br /><br />on the positive side, since 90% of the movie is set on malta or in the mediterranean, you get to see lots of pretty scenery and lots of nice and exotic looking extras. and really, baker himself may be on the heavy side and slightly dyspeptic, but he isn't that bad...certainly not the tub o' lard that this films critics (including mike and the bots in their hilarious coverage) seem to think.<br /><br />in short, this movie is good for video wallpaper, but the viewer should not pay any attention to it.
