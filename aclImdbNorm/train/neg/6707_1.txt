please make me forget. please. please. this is the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to watch. i consider the film an insult to my brain as well as my backside who both have suffered from me sitting and watching this film. i have yet to see what damage it has caused my sight and my ability to complete sentences. what a load of garbage!! and don't get me started about the acting... someone please help me forget!! "weird science" -- come back!! everything is forgiven...<br /><br />i am "proud" to give this film the first 1 here at imdb... and i've voted for hundreds of films... many of them c**p but this is so bad i can't even believe it. someone actually came up with the idea and thought it was worthy of becoming a film? someone actually read the script and decided to produce the film? someone read the script and auditioned for it? someone saw the film and decided *not* to put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity? *these* are the questions i want answers to. not the philosophical question about that tree in the woods and well, you know...
