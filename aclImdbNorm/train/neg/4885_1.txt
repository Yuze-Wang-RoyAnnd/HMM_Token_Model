i should have listened. i was warned, and still, i paid money for this, after reading all the reviews, after knowing the original is "so bad it's good", and that part 2 does not fit into that category at all, still, even then, i couldn't resist. exactly what happened here? part one was hilarious, it had so much politically incorrectness, and other crazy, fat entertainment, and this one, there just couldn't possibly be a worse sequel on god's green earth, not basket case 2, hell, not even troll 2. this is truly the worst sequel in history and that's really saying something considering the groundbreaking, bottom of the barrel qualities of the original. criminally insane part 2 was just a completely different brand of bad. shot on video, zero score, zero entertainment value, 1/3 consists of flashbacks of the original, and on top of all that, crazy, fat ethel has lost a portion of her girth. i mean, honestly, is this some kind of sick joke?!? thank's a lot, nick milliard. 1/1
