'chances are' a big mistake to see. you could know director emile ardolino from 'dirty dancing' and 'sister act' and should expect something amusing from him. but i guess i have to disillusion you. he made a really, really bad movie.<br /><br />according to the story christopher mcdonald dies to reburn as a baby. the baby grows up robert downey jr, and jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter, mary stuart masterson (complicated, huh?).<br /><br />they fall in love with each other. then appears jr former wife, cybill shepherd, and jr falls in love with her too. i guess i don't even have to mention that she loves ryan o'neil.<br /><br />in one of his first roles robert downey jr's on his worst. he copies michael j fox.<br /><br />after the 'moonlighting' shepherd proves that she's not suitable for acting in movies.<br /><br />anyway, there's one thing this unfunny comedy can be used: as antidote to insomnia.
