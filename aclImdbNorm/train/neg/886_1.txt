a few years back the same persons who created paris,j'taime., which was imperfect but very enjoyable ( my rating was a 7), created this piece of garbage about new york city.<br /><br />in paris, i love you (j'taime)created a feeling for paris & it was made in many parts of beautiful paris.<br /><br />in this current film, i did not recognize new york city, i did not feel that i was in the city of my birth.<br /><br />new york does have 5 boroughs,i saw no scenes in the bronx, or queens ,there is one scene in brooklyn,(brighton beach), i saw no scenes in times square or greenwich village/ no scenes of the beautiful hotels or theatres. it does have a large cast,most of the performers were not even stereotypes, they were caricatures of the lowest sort.<br /><br />the very few humorous moments are all of a course sexual nature or quite insulting to the many fine new yorkers that we all know & love.. <br /><br />a few of the films nominated for the 'razzie' awards were far better.<br /><br />ratings: * (out of 4) 20 points (out of 100) imdb 1 (out of 10)<br /><br />in my way of thinking i think the title should have been<br /><br />new york, i hate you.
