like most people i love "a christmas story". i had never even heard of this film and perhaps for good reason--it is awful. same locale, same narrator, same director but the warm fuzziness of the original was lacking. charles grodin was a poor choice to replace darrin mcgavin but i cannot imagine anyone being able to replace him. the story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original. the interaction with the neighbors, the bumpuses, is ridiculous. in "a christmas story" ralphie's obsession with the bb gun seems cute but his obsession in this movie is boring. scud farkus, the original neighborhood bully, is replaced in this film by yet another kid with braces and a weird hat but with little of the scud farkus menacing appeal. it would be pretty difficult to equal the original, even if this movie had been made with the original crew.
