i watched 3/4 of this movie and wondered why it got such horrible reviews here. it was fairly easy to watch (at 3am). it had good casting - kevin dillon's role of the sociopath serial killer was very believable - he was both charasmatic and chilling. the rest of the main characters weren't so bad either.<br /><br />this is your typical stalker/suspense movie. a married couple cannot conceive so they go to a fertility clinic for help. a sociopathic "genetic material" donor fixates on the recipients and, in typical stalker form, intrudes into their lives.<br /><br />as i said, most of the movie was fairly good.. we see "conan" grow more and more obsessed in raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother. of course things don't work out for him the way he planned. not a bad plot line.<br /><br />but, the last 15 minutes were just horrible. i am pretty tolerant with movies (especially at 3am!).. but, i was just amazed at how bad the ending was written. i actually scoffed outloud!<br /><br />all in all, not the worst movie i've seen, but i wouldn't be able to sit through it again (unless i skipped the ending). the only redeaming quality here was kevin dillon's role - - one of the best serial killers ever.<br /><br />try looking around at the other channels before watching this.. but, if nothing better is on, i'd give it a try.. =)
