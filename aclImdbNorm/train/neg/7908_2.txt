i didn't expect much when i saw this at the palm springs film fest this weekend. it was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out. still, i held out hope. it sounded a bit much like "bride and prejudice" (l.a. guy falls for an indian beauty, parental conflict, blah blah blah). b&p was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable characters.<br /><br />"my bollywood bride" had none of that. the acting seemed stilted and way to by-the-numbers. characters were so clich'e the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student. technically, the sound really bothered me. it seemed as if there was a lot of over-dubbing of dialogue. i mean a lot. i know sometimes it's necessary but it sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very distracting.<br /><br />two stars is being somewhat generous.
