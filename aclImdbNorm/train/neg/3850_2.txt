i saw this film at sxsw with the director in attendance. quite a few people walked out, and the audience could barely muster even polite applause at the end. of the 60 or 70 films i've seen at this festival, frownland is among the worst.<br /><br />at 106 minutes, it is at least 95 minutes too long. you get to watch the main character's failed and drawn out attempts to communicate, in extended real time. the same grimaces, hand over mouth motions, kinetic and frantically repeated words and syllables over and over and over again - we get the point.<br /><br />one site actually compares this work to early mike leigh. what drugs would you have to be on to make that statement? given that frownland is a captain beefheart song, maybe you'd have to be able to enjoy trout mask replica on heavy rotation to appreciate this film. unbelievably, this won a jury award at the festival. you can bet it did not win an audience award.
