this is an in-name-only sequel to "a christmas story," originally entitled "a summer story." ralphie narrates his family adventures during the summer when they moved to a small hick-town in the middle of nowhere. hilarity, unfortunately, does not ensue.<br /><br />the original worked because of its irreverent nature and honesty - everyone could relate to it. this one is simply stupid and not very funny at all. charles grodin's last movie - no wonder! it's one of his poorest roles. i felt sorry for him.<br /><br />mary steenburgen is given little to do, everything's formulaic, and you have to wonder why they even bothered.<br /><br />and i mean, come on - a competition with spinning tops?! sadly, it's the best part of the movie...
