i really must watch a good movie soon, because it seems every other entry or so is something that i despise. however my history speaks, i must not tell a lie. bobby deerfield and everything about it sucks big green banana peels. i never thought that i would see a film thud as thunderously as this one did. al pacino isn't acting in this film: he's posing. there are many, many scenes of his character, who is a race car driver, just staring at the camera. he's perfectly awful. marthe keller is just as bad. these two are supposed to be in a love affair, and there is simply no chemistry whatsoever. sydney pollack directed this film? there's no trace of the genius behind tootsie here. is this the same man i cheered for in eyes wide shut? i can hardly believe it. save yourself a horrible movie experience. run, don't walk, away from bobby deerfield.
