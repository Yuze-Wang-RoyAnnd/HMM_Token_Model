after the superb aankhen(2002) which was a remake of a gujarati play he comes with waqt which too looks like a stage play<br /><br />in stage plays, we have characters shouting, overacting here too the same<br /><br />the first half shows amitabh almost kidding the 40+ akshay kumar who acts too funny like a small nerd<br /><br />the film has a good message how not to spoil your son but sadly the way amitabh wants to make akki responsible is absolutely fake<br /><br />even his reason for hiding his sickness, his runnign from the hospital and the melodramatic speech by akki is a put off<br /><br />some emotions do touch you but most are too over the top<br /><br />rajpal's comedy is hilarious but too stretched in second half <br /><br />direction by vipul shah is too overdone though some scenes are good music is okay<br /><br />amongst actors amitabh overdoes it in the first half but is superb in emotional scenes akshay kumar too does his part well but looks umcomfortable in some too weepy scenes his chemistry with bachchan is matchless rajpal is a highlight, he makes you laugh without overacting and just his presence and his dumb behaviour and deadpan humour he is a riot boman is good in some comic parts but too loud at places priyanka is the heroine so nothing to do, this is her last film with akki so far shefali is awesome though she looks too young for bachchan
