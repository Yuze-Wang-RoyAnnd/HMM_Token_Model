the only enjoyable thing about this highly mockable movie is playing "guess" that location. what toronto landmark will stand in for what american/international location.<br /><br />who knew that the anti-christ would be russian? obviously he can't be american since we need the yanks to save the day - oh buck... you'll tell us all the truth... you'll show us the light... and the way outta the building should those nasty anti-christers get their way.<br /><br />five golden raspberries. faith is not enough to hope they don't make another of this ilk! we don't gotta prayer.
