for a good half hour or so, i remember myself thinking: "hey, this could very well be bill rebane's best achievement ever!". the opening sequences are atmospheric, there immediately are some scary moments to enjoy and our director even refers to his own notorious stinker "the giant spider invasion" in a playful way. the concept is shamelessly stolen from william castle's "house on haunted hill", with three old and extremely bored millionaires luring nine losers to an isolated mansion to win $1,000,000 in an elimination game. naturally, the participants start vanishing quickly and one by one, and it takes the remaining greedy boneheads too much time before they realize either the old folks are sadists...or there's another murderer amongst them. the film begins & ends with an odd narrator telling a lot of senseless stuff that isn't relevant or even interesting to the plot, but there's some nice t&a to admire in the first ten minutes and that dumb bimbo (shelly, i believe she's called) is really hilarious to observe. after the first half hour, naturally the inevitable happens and "the cold" turns into a textbook rebane-production with retarded plot twists, the dumbest dialogs ever and a total lack of excitement. there wasn't any budget for bloody murder sequences but our multi-talented director (?) tries to compensate this with endless footage of disco dancing girls and an amateur rock band. the film also has four or even five different climaxes and none of them are a slight bit satisfying. maybe it was an inspiration for lotr: return of the king? avoid this film, you'll live longer and happier.
