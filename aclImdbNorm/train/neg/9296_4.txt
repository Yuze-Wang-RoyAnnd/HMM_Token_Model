normally, i am a pretty generous critic, but in the case of this film i have to say it was incredibly bad. i am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be.<br /><br />there were some gorgeous shots, but it's too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie. it might have worked if "daggers" was purely an action flick and not a romance, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. there is no chemistry between either of the couples, whatever exists between mei and her men seems to be more lust than love, and for the most part the dialogue is just silly. this may be just a problem with translation, but the frequent usage of the word "flirt" in particular reminded me of 8th grade, not head-over-heels, together forever, worth-dying-for love; i also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor. the audience is given very little about the characters to really care about, and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole. i was wishing for a remote control to fast forward, i was slumped in my seat ready to snore, but mostly i just cringed a lot.<br /><br />*******spoiler*****<br /><br />now, the icing on the cake. or rather, adding insult to injury. the ending was truly one of the most horrible, laughable ones i have ever seen. the boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other. oh, and then it starts to snow. randomly. oh, and then mei (dagger embedded in heart) suddenly pops up out of the weeds. then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it's destination, even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet. wow, cool.<br /><br />well, then mei dies finally i guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death. jin sings, sobs, holds her body close, screen goes blank. i, and the people surrounding me, are chuckling. not a good sign.<br /><br />visually stunning, but ultimately a failure.
