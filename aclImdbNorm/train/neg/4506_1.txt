american film makers decided to make a film they think is japanese. the characters all badly represented, the actors are not even japanese and the set is cheap, unreal and definitely doesn't represent kyoto in early 20ties and 30ties. who ever read the book understand that the script writers didn't add any extra value to differentiate the movie from the script. worse, they even changed the original plot line with a few goofs. rob marshall is using for his two main characters two well known chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon. marshall probably saw one chinese movie and tho they represent japanese culture. seeing those two actors together again even makes the movies more ridiculous. quentine tarantino's last scene in kill bill #1 is ten times more japanese made than that of this movie.
