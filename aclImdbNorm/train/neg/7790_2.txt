like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film, i was also waxing nostalgic about it...before i had the misfortune to actually watch it again. alas, my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy, and the perils of pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal, racist, and plain boring film-making. even the presence of old pros edward everett horton and terry-thomas can't overcome a rancid screenplay, a horrible theme song, and some wretched 'special effects'. in addition, the stereotypical depictions of african and arab characters make for painful viewing, especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the civil rights movement. michael weldon's original psychotronic encyclopedia reports that the perils of pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release. judging from the results, that is a completely believable (and baffling) scenario.
