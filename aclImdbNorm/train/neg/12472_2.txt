imagine turning the american national anthem into a cartoon. throw in a couple of cute animals, some terrible puns and a pair of roller skates and you'd find yourself with almost an exact replica of this film.<br /><br />i remember seeing this when i was younger; i made my mother rent it from the video shop about 5 times. the story itself isn't too bad, it's just that any marxists watching would certainly have something to complain about.<br /><br />if you don't like america you won't like this film.
