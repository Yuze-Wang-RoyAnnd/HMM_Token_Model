oh it really really is. i've seen films that i disliked more, due to whatever reason, but never have i seen a film that just fails in every single aspect of film making. it even fails to fail at film making, in a way the hercules in new york could be said to do. it's not the film i like the least, but it is the very worst film i've ever seen.<br /><br />the acting is the first thing that strikes you. i've never seen a worse acted film outside of pornography. in fact i've plenty of pornographic films that are acted a damn site better than this. it really is awful.<br /><br />technically, it's terrible. the camera-work is amateurish. the editing is nonsensical. i presume they couldn't afford proper sound equipment, and this meant that every scene in a car (and there's a lot of them) has them driving at about three miles per hour and every scene set outside by the same patch of woods (and there's a lot of them too) is actually dubbed from a studio, again lending more to the bad porn vibe.<br /><br />the plot is nonsensical, as many have pointed out. i'll defend vampires walking in daylight by the fact that despite it being popularized by nosferatu, this was never originally an intrinsic part of the vampire mythos.<br /><br />speaking of vampire mythos, the writer had evidently read carmilla, or at very least seen the vampire lovers. i'm not sure how i feel about this, swaying from impressed that a movie this dire has at least some aspirations to a gothic novel i'm very fond of; or annoyed by its at best sledgehammer references and at worst total desecration of source material. at very least 'the general' is an insult to peter cushing though.<br /><br />it gets two stars however, merely because i can't bring myself to vote one star for a film that has, or at least purports to have, both vampires and zombies in it. incidentally i watched lifeforce (another film that tenuously has vampires and zombies in it) on the same day as this, and despite being a rather flawed film itself, really comes out a masterpiece compared to this.<br /><br />so in the end, this is not a film so bad it's good, or so bad it's in any way enjoyable, even drunk. it's just a mess, and worth no-one's time watching.
