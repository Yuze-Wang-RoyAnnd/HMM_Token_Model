nightmare weekend is proof positive that some people are so desperate to be 'in the movies' they are prepared to do almost anything.<br /><br />i'm not referring to the countless women who seem quite happy to appear completely starkers in this dreadful piece of trash (after all, the naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of). no...i'm talking about those who are more than willing to co-star with a badly made hand-puppet called george. now that is embarrassing!!!<br /><br />a bio-electronic being created by brilliant scientist edward brake (wellington meffert), george (who looks like a demented felt clown with green wool for hair) is the artificially intelligent interface for an advanced computer system that operates a revolutionary device (a silver sphere about the size of a golf ball) that, when ingested, can reverse character disorders.<br /><br />edward's personality altering experiments have been successful on lab animals, but the cautious scientist is reluctant to carry out tests on human subjects, fearing that there may still be side effects. his evil assistant julie (debbie laster), however, has no such qualms, and proceeds to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs. inevitably, they all turn into hideous killer mutants.<br /><br />with bargain basement special effects, a cast totally devoid of talent, and a plot that is almost impossible to follow (i took notes as i watched the film, and even then i am not entirely convinced that my synopsis is accurate), nightmare weekend is a complete and utter disaster that not even several soft-core sex scenes and a touch of gore can rescue.<br /><br />this film also features one of the most irritating characters i have ever seen in a horror movie: tony (bruce morton), a walkman wearing idiot who bops away to crap 80s music in a manner that makes me look like justin timberlake in comparison.
