this is a pretty bad movie. but not so bad as it's reputation suggests. the production values aren't too bad and there is the odd effective scene. and it does have an 80's cheezoid veneer that means that it is always kind of fun. watch out, too, for jimmy nail's brief appearance - his attempt at an american accent is so astoundingly rubbish it's fantastic. fantastic too are sybil danning's breasts - they make a brief appearance in the movie but the scene is repeated umpteen times in the end credits in what can only be described as the 12" remix of sybil danning's boobs. has to be seen to be believed. as a horror movie it isn't scary, the effects are silly and christopher lee turns up to sleepwalk through his performance. i guess he was buying a new house and needed some cash for the deposit. the two central characters - the man and the woman - were so negligible that i have forgotten almost everything about them and i just watched this movie earlier tonight. the werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original movie, in fact, bizarrely, they sometimes look more like badly burned apes. the eastern european setting is quite good and the music provided by the new wave band babel, while being pretty terrible, does at least give the film some added cheese.<br /><br />overall? good for a laugh. not good quality but did you seriously expect it to be? and, at the very least, you've always got sybil's knockers.
