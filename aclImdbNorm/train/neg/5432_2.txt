a battleship is sinking... its survivors, hanging onto a nearby liferaft, sit there doing nothing while we go into each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks.<br /><br />even though noel coward's name is the only one that you notice during the credits, everything that's cinematic in it is because of lean. and on technical terms, its very good. david lean just knew films from the get-go. there are many moments where coward's studied dialogue takes a second seat and lean's visual sense takes centre stage. try the soldiers getting off the ship near the end, and that whole scene; the tracking shot towards the hymn singing, the scene where we're inside a house that gets bombed.<br /><br />noel coward is one of the worst actors i've ever seen. he's totally wooden, not displaying emotion, character or humanity. you can see it in his eyes that he's not really listening to what the other performer is saying, he's just waiting for them to finish so he can rush out his own line.<br /><br />7/10.<br /><br />its episodic, a bit repetitive, and the flashbacks overwhelm the story: there's no central story that they advance, just give general insights into the characters. still, its an interesting film worth a watch - and a good debut for lean. its not a very deep or penetrating film, and its definitely a propaganda film, but its also a showcase for lean's editing skills - its all about how the pieces are put together.
