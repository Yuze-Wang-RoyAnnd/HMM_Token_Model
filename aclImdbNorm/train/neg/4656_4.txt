unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old, celebrated english film. although it may be overly maligned as a total disaster (which it is not), it never builds any tension and betrays its tv origins. richard burton sleepwalks through his role, and sophia loren's closed (in this movie) face doesn't display much passion, either.
