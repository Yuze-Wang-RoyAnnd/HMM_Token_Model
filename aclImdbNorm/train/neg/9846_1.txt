you might be tempted to rent this film because peter sellers appears in it. that would be a mistake. this is one of the most pointless films ever made. i kept waiting for something funny to happen, but nothing funny appears in this movie. even the film industry recognized this was a very weak film and didn't even try to promote it. its a wonder that it was ever put on video.<br /><br />i wonder what sort of contract caused sellers to be in this film. i also wonder why the people responsible for this film were allowed to go on to make other bad films. surely this film is a waste of the money used to create it, and a waste of anyone's time watching it. surely there are high school students who would be able to write/produce a film which as a plot.
