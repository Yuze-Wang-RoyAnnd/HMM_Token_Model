before i start...let me say that i fully believe in god. i believe in heaven and in hell. kay now that thats out of the way, i just wanna say that what in the world do these morons that call themselves "hosts" think they are doing?? the last time i checked a host doesn't discriminate, spew hatred filled rants on tv, or try to shove their own beliefs down every unfortunate soul that ventures onto the channel. all of these that crazy, idiotic, conservitive, bible thumping, fred phelps lover pat robertson does daily. i am all for free speech, but since when does that cover a guy who pretty much says that if you venture off his ideal way of life you are right away sent to hell? this is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of soooo many problems. one day in my class room we had a substitute teacher in so we decided to watch some tv since the teach didn't give us any work. and we (against many of us's will) watched 700's club, and of course that jerk pat was on ranting and raving about the bible, and he said simon along the lines of "god says homosexuality is a sin" and i actually heard a kid go "hmm i guess he's right." wtf??? seriously, if the host is trying to make people think that someone else's sexual orientation is a huge sin, then they seriously need to take that host, duct tape them, and throw them off of a cruise liner in the middle of the arctic.
