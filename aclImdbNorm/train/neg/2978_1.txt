i'm a big fan of horror flicks, and zombie films are a particular favorite of mine. that said, zombi 3 is one of the absolute worst films i have ever seen. so needless to say i really enjoyed it, it's the best bad movie i've seen in a long while. the story has some similarities with dan o'bannon's "return of the living dead", but whereas that film was intentionally funny, this one is the opposite. it has some of the most laughable acting i've ever witnessed, especially from the main scientist character. his scenes with the general were just hysterical. also, the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy, and the death scenes are often just downright stupid. this, of course, makes it all the more fun. possible spoiler - the worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head, which then opens its eyes and somehow flies out of the fridge (obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string), latching onto the guys neck, killing him. zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now? it defies every law of physics known to man, and it's one of the most absurd things ever filmed. that's just one of many really goofy moments in the idiotic mess. i can't believe it's gotten so high a rating here. if you are a fan of bad movies, do yourself a favor and rent this sucker.
