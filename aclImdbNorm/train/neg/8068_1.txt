i didn't have huge expectations for this film when renting it for $1 at the video store, but the box at least showed a little promise with its "killer cut" of "more gore! more sex!" can't go wrong there! well... needless to say, the box is a fraud. how in the hades did actors and actresses of this caliber sign on for a film this low?<br /><br />it all opens with a drunken college girl walking out of a frat house or some other building like that and saying some useless crap to her boyfriend (?) as a camera on a bad steadicam follows her. then she gets chased by some dude in a clear plastic mask and grabbed by another. they slit her wrists for no real reason and you can see when they "cut" her that someone drew the cuts with what looks like a crayon.<br /><br />from there, repeat the same theme of the girl getting chased/killed unbrutally by two guys for about 84 more minutes. add in one tit shot. that is soul survivors.<br /><br />i wouldn't have had a problem with this film had the box not frauded me into renting the flick. if i rent a bad film that claims to have more violence and sex.... i want more violence and sex! one full frontal shot in 85 minutes from a chick who is clearly androginous and gore that would not scare a child does not cut it. if this is the killer cut, what is the theatrical cut?! of course, i doubt this garbage was actually put into theaters in the first place. shame on the actors in this film. i could see them making their screen debuts in here because they have not done anything before, but they were all established before this was released. i don't know if it was filmed before they had all been established and the studio sat on the film until they were semi-big names or not. but what i want to know is.... they really spent $14 million on this film?!
