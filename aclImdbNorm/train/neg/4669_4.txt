it's interesting that a novel with no plot has become the basis for two films. while the heiress was a good, if not entirely accurate, adaptation, washington square is a heavy-handed and poorly acted, except for the part of dr sloper, film that could have been so much better.<br /><br />the director's attempts at making 'beautiful' scenes were so obvious that i actually cringed. it has none of the understated and simple beauty that a movie with no plot can have, such as onegin. i agree with other comments about leigh's portrayal of catherine as an idiot, instead of naive and shy; she made me despise her not feel for her.<br /><br />catherine's transition from childlike trusting to adult cynicism, the whole point of the story, was internalised, just as it was in the novel. but we don't have the benefit of a narrative voice to tell us that in a film! i think someone skipped adaptation class at filmschool.<br /><br />i appreciate the director's attempts to make a moving and beautiful film out of a difficult text but it just didn't work.
