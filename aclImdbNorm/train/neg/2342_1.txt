i don't know what would be so great about this movie. even worse, why should anyone bother seeing this one ? first of all there is no story. one could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling (laughter, cry, fear, ...), but in my opinion this movie does not do that either.<br /><br />you are just watching images for +/- 2 hrs. there are more useful things to do.<br /><br />i guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above. but is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 eur of your money ? for me the answer is: no.
