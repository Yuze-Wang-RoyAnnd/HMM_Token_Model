i have been learning about the zodiac for four years now. and i'm not saying i know much more than anyone else...in fact out of most of the people who know and read and learn about z, i am prolly the one with the least knowledge...but i do know or at least i think i know that most of the stuff in this wouldn't happen...from how he signed his name...to how he killed people...i thought that godfather was the worst film ever...<br /><br />the cinematography was that of a five year old...not saying that my films are any better but i am not someone who is making movies for the mass population...<br /><br />the acting i thought for the most part was pretty good really i did...the lead didn't talk that much on camera or at all i forget and don't know because i stopped watching...his voice overs where good...<br /><br />but really spend the four dollars and 70 cents on something else...like a large pizza or something...<br /><br />until i learn how to write a review, psycho phil
