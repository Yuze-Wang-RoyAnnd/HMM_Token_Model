four eyed monsters follows the relationship of a shy, reclusive videographer and an equally estranged struggling artist, who, both living in the big apple, develop an unlikely romance with the help of an internet dating site. this in itself is not so unusual, but what is, is their method of communication. foregoing the verbal, they take to writing notes and later communicating through video.<br /><br />the film is based upon the creator's (arin crumley & susan buice) own relationship, who besides writing and directing, take to acting as the lead characters as well. with elements of avant-garde, anti-plot, and docudrama, the film scatters itself to the wind with an undecided structure nestled neatly between narcissism and self-indulgence.<br /><br />as the movie wears on, a brief separation and deterioration of their once intriguing form of communication grow old as the couple face the hardship of reality. focusing solely on inner conflict, or the woes of relationship, the film struggles through a stagnant narrative that is neither original, nor poignant. this could have been easily circumvented with the addition of subplot and external conflict, and a third act, to which there is none - just a montage of melodrama that leads nowhere.<br /><br />what is even more aggravating is the film's descent from story into reality that abruptly concludes with an open ended and unsatisfying finish. this would have been all fine and dandy, but there is no question asked and no meaning to be discovered or pondered.<br /><br />(on a side note, the film contains beautiful animation and a vivid and moving soundtrack, one of the more interesting aspects of the production.)<br /><br />but as always, watch the film and decide for yourself.
