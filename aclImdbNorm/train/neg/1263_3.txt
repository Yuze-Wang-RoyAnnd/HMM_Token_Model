there's nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland, and robot wars does deliver. sure, the acting is lousy, the dialogue is sub-par, and the characters are one-dimensional, but it has giant robots! the special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period. they are certainly not as polished as today's standards, but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures, so it has aged fairly well. its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime, and it does have a certain tongue-in-cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable. i would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci-fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction.
