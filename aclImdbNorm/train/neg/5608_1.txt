i was curious to watch this movie. a lot of people seem to be excited. i also have my beliefs. i believe in jesus christ but i'm opened for any kind of views or opinions. it doesn't matter for me, if jesus existed in the way it's written in the bible. if maria was a virgin or not, or all the other similar pagan coincidences. what matters for me is the idea of salvation, the idea of love as the only way to find peace in this world.<br /><br />what made me angry is when somebody takes a sentence, present it as a fact but without showing the context it was written. for example, they showed in this movie following sentence big: "those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them - bring them here and kill them in front of me" jesus (lukas 19:27) what they didn't tell you is the context. jesus told a story about an evil king. there is no passage in the bible where jesus supports killing. he is love! after quoting the bible wrong they present us yelling people (pseudo-christians) filled with hate. the majority of viewers don't check the informations presented so they start thinking jesus=hate=not good for me or for anybody else. this is pure manipulation people. please use your brain. don't take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie. we destroy our own basis, our civilization if we start dismantling jesus in this way and the message he brought to us. you saw off the branch you're sitting on.
