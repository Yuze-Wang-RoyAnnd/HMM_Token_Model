stewart moss stars as a scientist who is on a working trip with his wife, and one gets the feeling that he was picked for this role for his ability to roll his eyes back in his head...imagine the auditions for this.."can you...no, that's not quite it, thank you, next!". anyway, he's bitten by a bat, and then, he's either changing into some kind of bat creature and killing people or....he's not. for no one else sees his strange transformations, but he himself seems to think that he's changing because his wedding ring pops off when his hands turn into claws, etc. to its credit the movie does kind of hold back on whether he's just nuts or whether he's actually transforming into something until almost the very end. this has some good locations & sort of a decent atmosphere at times but unfortunately none of that can make up for the somewhat lame story and the wonderfully bad acting. kind of fun in a "so bad it's good" way, but leans more towards just plain bad. 4 out of 10.
