absolutely one of the worst movies of all time.<br /><br />low production values, terrible story idea, bad script, lackluster acting... and i can't even come up with an adjective suitably descriptive for how poor joan river's directing is. i know that there's a special place in hell for the people who financed this film; prolly right below the level reserved for child-raping genocidal maniacs.<br /><br />this movie is a trainwreck.<br /><br />(terrible) x (infinity) = rabbit test.<br /><br />avoid this at all costs.<br /><br />it's so bad, it isn't even funny how bad it is.
