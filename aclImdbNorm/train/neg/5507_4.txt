this was yet another big screen outing for a us tv show from the sixties it is amusing enough but was very much to formula. intelligent martian lands on earth and meets the not too bright humans, in his view.<br /><br />the usual wackiness ensues with the human, bridges, eventually bonds with him and helps him to get home. along the way he also gets the girl, hannah.<br /><br />this is a nice outing for some pleasant hollywood stars who i had not seen for a while.<br /><br />pleasant enough to pass some spare time if you have not got anything better to view.
