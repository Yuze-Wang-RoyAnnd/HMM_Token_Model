ladies and gentlemen,please don't get fooled by "a stanley kubrick" film tag.this is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made.horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film.in shining,there is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naive,foolish attempt made to create chilling horror.everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality.all that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley. the hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too.a word about the actors jack nicholson looks like a lost,lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do.there is not much to be said of a bald,colored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor.no need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy.it cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor kubrick is not alive to make any changes.
