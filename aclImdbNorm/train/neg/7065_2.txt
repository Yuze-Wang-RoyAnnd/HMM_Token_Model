ok well i found this movie in my dads old pile of movies and it looked pretty good from the cover but the movie actually sucked!! ok the first story with the swimmer was pretty good but it took a while to get into, then the one with the boy was completely retarded! it wasn't even scary! his dream sounds like a little kid's bedtime story. then the news girls one was completely retarded too. i'm sure someones going to call up the news guy and ask him to go out with you. but that one ended cool where she stabbed him and she was in the hospital and she saw him on t.v and he said all that junk to her. next was that pretty gay story about the guy who brought back the dead people..omg its so stupid i'm not even going to say any more about it.the last one was the best. it wasn't that scary but the idea of the story was pretty cool..uh yeah the girl gets possessed and she kills all her classmates or something. then when they're all done telling their dreams to each other the losers get on the bus (to hell ahahahah) and they see all the people from their dreams on the bus(ha). the end.
