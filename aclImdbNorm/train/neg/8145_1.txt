this film is so bad i can't believe it was actually shot. people who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7, are you insane? did we really watch the same movie? or the same sh** should i say. everything is bad in this film. the story (is there a story?) is going nowhere, completely incoherent, the acting (some dialogs are simply just ridiculous), the music score (what the **** is that?), the editing, and especially the artistic direction, a pure disaster. reminds me the old macist movies... to give you an example of the amateurism of the production, the mermaid's costume is a sleeping bag with spangles sticked on it. i'm not joking, that's exactly what it is.<br /><br />another example of the enormous mistakes we find here: you see in a scene an extra, a fat woman of about 200 pounds, who's talking on her cell phone. the next shot, which is in a complete different location, you can see this same woman, still talking on her cell phone (!) yes, it goes that far. <br /><br />a big, huge, waste of money. useless.
