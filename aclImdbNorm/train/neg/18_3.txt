this is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the national film preservation foundation says 1969 and imdb says 1972). regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s.<br /><br />the film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort. this was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome. the film, to put it even more bluntly, is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and "with it" to be understood by us mortals.
