special effects? good.<br /><br />script? terrible. no plot. no depth. no meaning. this film rendered superman as a meaningless hero, a hero with no archetype. in the original film, he represented america in the cold war. here, he represented nothing but a hulk.<br /><br />sure, the actors were fine. kevin spacey was a fine choice, among others.<br /><br />this still does not resolve the problem that this film had no depth whatsoever. i cannot see how anyone can come away with anything meaningful from this film, when superman was, and is, daily created to be a meaningful hero in not only comics but also in people's minds. this was a real waste of money considering how many directions this film could have taken.<br /><br />just a few instances: lex luthor could have been a villain of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism, and on and on and on. he was just another goofball hackman incarnation.<br /><br />and superman? for what did he stand in this film? nothing but another hack "savior" figure.<br /><br />wait until it comes to the dollar theater if you see it at all.
