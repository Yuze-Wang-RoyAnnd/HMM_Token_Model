dull, predictable and uninteresting story of a man contaminated by a chemical substance (weller) who goes on across the country just to find his ex-wife and children; meanwhile, he kills everyone in his way only by a single touch of his hands. in his dangerous track, a doctor (hurt) and a young reporter (natasha) try to stop the man. the movie has a not original premise but even though could be much better. the final result is just a movie without suspense or gritting moments. even the good cast is completely waste. i give this a 4 (four).
