when i go to see movies i would stay up and watch it or if i did not like it, i would go sleep, but this was pure crap, i actually got up and walked out!....this was poorly script and put together, i hated it. also, they should not have taken brendan frasier off, he was much better. this was not as good as i had expected, considering that i really liked george of the jungle 1, and the graphics weren't as good as the first one, for instance, the bird, and when ever he crashed in a tree. i hope that the director of this takes heed, and next movies he make, he needs to reconsider...horrible! i really would like to give ursla a job well done, as she made the movie worthwhile (until i walked out)...overall i give this movie a 2 out of 10
