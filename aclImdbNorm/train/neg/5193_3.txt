another turgid action/adventure flick from the quinn martin productions factory. roy thinnes plays undercover agent diamond head (mr. head, to you), working for his g-man handler "aunt mary", looking for "tree", who's on a mission to...well, just watch the movie. <br /><br />this one deserved and got the full mst3k sendup. as the boys and various reviewers have pointed out, the movie "fargo" had more hawaiian locations than this film. apparently shot on a puny budget, this movie highlights hawaii's broken-down dive shops, gas stations, and cheapo hotels. zulu -- later to star as kono in hawaii-five-o -- appears as thinnes' lumpy, inept sidekick, while france nguyen models the jenny craig diet gone horribly wrong. others sharing the flickering screen include a drunken richard harris knockoff, a george takai imitator, a not-so-smart hit-man with sprayed-on sansabelt slacks, and the villain "tree", sporting a veddy british accent. you can pretty much figure out the plot halfway through the opening credits, but relax--just enjoy the giddy mediocrity of this 70's movie-of-the-week.<br /><br />whenever i think of this movie (and i think of this movie often), i catch myself humming the theme, written for flute and tuba...no one knows why. <br /><br />trivia note--diamond head was directed by jeannot szwarc, one of three contract directors at universal who would go on to make much bigger films, in his case jaws 2. the others were john badham (war games), and a young fellow named steven spielberg...
