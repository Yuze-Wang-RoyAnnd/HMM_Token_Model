i get it the diehl character is s'posed to be a microcosm of america itself - seeing arab terrorists under every rock, only to find out at the end that it's his own actions all along that got him into that siege state and truly if he practices good-will to all men everything will be rainbows and lollipops. sorry wim you have made amazing movies in the past that stay neutral of the politics and for good reason, polemics are your weak point and they weaken this a well-made, amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters, dialog and plotting. better luck on your next flick. another thing that yanked my crank was the belabored point of the homeless section of la being there for reasons of hunger, these people don't get enough to eat. truly these folks aren't eating regally but the real hunger these folks is a spiritual hunger, an emotional hunger, a mental hunger. they need self-respect, self-worth, dignity which you can't give a man. yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available. less the center for hunger in america, i would say it's more the center for alcoholism, drug-abuse, mental suffering and economic devastation. dealing with hunger although a noble endeavor is band-aiding a more profoundly systematic societal and age-old human problem of homelessness. bill diehl was good though and michelle williams was cute as the young yet (cliched) old soul.
