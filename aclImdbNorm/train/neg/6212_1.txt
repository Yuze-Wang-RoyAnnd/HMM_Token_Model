it used to be my thinking that movies required plots, or some other means of making you care at all about the story line or anything that is going on. this movie has showed me that you don't actually have to have anything like that.<br /><br />i could sum it up simply as that. but, imdb wants me to have more lines. it was kind of pretty. not compelling in the slightest. the way the characters talk in the movie makes you think it should have taken place over a matter of days, but there is no passage of time and i'm pretty sure it all happens in an hour.<br /><br />if you are looking to entertain yourself, then buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before throwing up. it would be a far better use of your time. time that you will never get back. jurassic park 3 was pulled off better than this movie.
