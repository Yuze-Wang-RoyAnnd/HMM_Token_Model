a young couple mandy pullman (mitch martin) and roy seeley (matt birman) are relaxing on a beach in the small town of galen. they decide to start playing practical jokes on each other. mandy hides in an old run down cabin, she is attacked and raped by an unknown assailant. roy tries to help her after hearing her screams but is killed. dr. sam cordell (john cassavetes) and his daughter jenny (erin flannery) are both new to galen after the death of sam's wife. sam is called into action by police chief hank walden (john ireland) when mandy and roy are found. he performs the autopsy on roy and treats mandy for her horrific injuries. soon after a curator at the local museum named carolyn davis (denise furgusson) is also attacked and raped. a local journalist named laura kincaid (kerrie keane) reports the events and suggests to sam that a similar string of rapes and murders occurred in the town 30 years earlier. more rapes and murders occur. meanwhile jenny's boyfriend tim galen (duncan macintosh) has been having strange dreams and nightmares and is convinced that he has something to do with the horrific acts. tim's story and digging into the towns past makes sam become convinced of the existence of a creature known as an incubus - a shape-shifting demonic entity that exists only to reproduce! directed by john hough this is one seriously dull horror film. the script by george franklin based on the novel by ray russell is slow to say the least. nothing interesting or exciting happens and it finishes with one of the most boring none event of a twist ending i've ever seen and frustratingly it just finishes suddenly. as the story plods along at a snails pace there are a few rapes, but none are shown on screen. there is only one gore scene in the entire film too. the monster itself is only shown at the very end and has all of three short scenes. everything about this film production-wise is very static and flat, the film has no energy or pace. the acting is dull and you don't feel or care for anyone. check out the scene in the autopsy room where you can clearly see the boom mike at the top of the screen on several occasions. the type of rubbish horror film making that you'll forget within a day. a real waste of time, don't bother.
