i can't believe that the city of muncie is so hard up for attention that they would embarrass themselves by allowing this show to be done there. this show is like a slap in the face to real hard working law-enforcement officers. i have never before in my life seen anything so stupid in my life. if they had billed it as a comedy that would be one thing but to say it is reality is nothing short of a lie. i only saw it once and was appalled at what i saw. i wanted to see the little guy get into a foot-chase with a bad guy. what a joke that would have been. nothing on the show was even close to the real world. the city of muncie, the police chief, and all the officers should be hanging their heads in shame and should never want o admit they come from that city. no wonder it didn't stay around on tv
