this movie was made for people who found gremlins too serious and critters to hardcore. like many of the critters/trolls/gremlins movies of the 80's this movie is bad. the sad part is that there's no punchline to that comment. it's just bad and not in a funny way.<br /><br />the problem with this miniature monster movie is that it actually tries to be funny and ends up being as successful in doing that as howie mandell was in walk like a man. what made the other 80's horror movies into classics was that they were genuinely trying to be scary, but were hilarious because they failed so miserably. someone must have told bettina hirsch (yes the bettina hirsch)she had a knack for comedy before she started directing this movie. unfortunately they were wrong.<br /><br />sure seeing a weird little mutated cross between a ferret and a tumor wearing a brown trenchcoat and throwing pool balls at an outcast from the lost boys is amusing, but not enough to save the movie.<br /><br />by far the most annoying part of the movie is the paul character. his paul reiser wannabe schtick is enough to make you start fast forwarding from the time of his first scene until the ending credits only stopping once to see a scene where a munchie throws pool balls at a guy...not that i did that.<br /><br />so the bottom line is run, don't walk, to your nearest blockbuster and shake hands with the manager and thank him for not having the grapes to stock this pile of garbage on the shelves.
