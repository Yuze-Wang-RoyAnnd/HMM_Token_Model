i am at a distinct disadvantage here. i have not seen the first two movies in this series, although i have seen a lot of larry cohen films. fans of the series seem to think this is a good film. judging it on it's own, it was pretty boring.<br /><br />you never get a real good look at the maniac cop's (robert z'dar) face, but what i did see was pretty grim. the death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film, not to give any thrills. maybe if i saw the nc-17 director's cut, i may be more impressed.<br /><br />the ending with the car chase with z'dar, caitlin dulany, and robert davi was pretty intense. best part of the movie.
