i would have liked to write about the story, but there wasn't any. i would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but "hinglish" is only funny for like 5 minutes, after that its overkill. i would have liked to swoon over the 'keep-u-guessing suspense' but it was as predictable as... um mm, a yash raj movie (?). i would have liked to talk of the edge-of-the-seat action, but i don't like cartoons much. <br /><br />*sigh*<br /><br />all in all, this movie is perfect for: 1. people attempting suicide - i promise it'll push you over the edge 2. sado-masochists- this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that silas guy in the da-vinci code wore. 3. people researching alternative ways to spread terrorism - i swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4. movie piraters: more power to them. if any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch - this is it. 5.barnacles, most types of plankton & green algae - because almost all other living things would require an iq factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers. afterthought: the director of the movie, obviously, is a species of his own. ( and i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind..one is enough)<br /><br />things that could have made this a better movie: 1. a story 2. a choreographer 3. a screenplay writer 4. a stunt coordinator 5. a story (did i already say that?) 6. a director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged (although even one who was challenged could have done a better job) 7. anil kapoor=bubonic plague - avoid at all costs 8. a statutory warning - "watching yash raj movies is injurious to your mental health" ?<br /><br />things i liked about the movie: 1. kareena kapoor - for obvious reasons 2. the english sub-titles - "mera dil kho gaya" becomes - "my heart is in a void" , "chaliya chaliya chaliya" turns into "im a flirt, im a lover, im a vagabond" ..priceless.<br /><br />in short, tashan to me, is like the opposite of a rubrics cube - the cube is supposed to increase the iq of the player, tashan promises to lower your iq, and that.. in a mere 2.5 hours! woot!<br /><br />*sigh*..but thats just me. i could be wrong you've been warned anyways.
