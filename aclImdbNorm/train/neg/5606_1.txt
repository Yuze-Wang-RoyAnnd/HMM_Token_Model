i believe shakespeare explained what i just read beautifully. me thinks he (the lady) doth protest too much. the whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself! he sites profane literature (writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible) a number of times however i can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible. anyone can skew data & prove anything they like but it doesn't make it true. customs change, word definitions change over time (look at english & german where it is very obviously a common root) nothing stays the same, it's always growing and changing. the bible has many different translations but the king james version is the one i've found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research. in the king james version you will notice there are certain words written in italics. these words have been added by the translators and can be dropped & the mean of the entire verse changes. writings from around the time of christ were written without spaces, without punctuation, without paragraphs & without numeric verses. these writings look like one long word & the translators added all of the above. for example how would you read this: godisnowhere do you read it as god is nowhere or do you read it as god is now here? same string of letters two entirely different meanings. this is why many biblical researchers use a 'lexicon' to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original arabic, greek or hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written. it's also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove god exists but you can not prove he doesn't exist! in the end i just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty. talk about ego! putting soapbox away, god bless maegi
