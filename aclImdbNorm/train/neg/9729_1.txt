seriously, what is this? hooper has made such classic films like texas chainsaw massacre, then he made this god awful film, what happened? did he dip into the crack a little too much? this film is about some dude named sam who has the ability to set things on fire,(firestarter, anyone?) the acting was godawful, the plot was rubbish, and the special effects were extremely rubbish, they looked like something from the 70's. van damme should be pleased that derailed is no longer the worst film ever, and what was with the ending? he started glowing blue, turned into a glowing blue blob, sucked out his girlfriends fire, and the film ended. what was that? huh? when the film ended i hoped the dvd would spontaniously combust to save me from my pain.<br /><br />stay away from this film.<br /><br />don't think, obey, you'll thank me later.
