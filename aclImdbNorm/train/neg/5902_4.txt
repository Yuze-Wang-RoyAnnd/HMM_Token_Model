i went in expecting the movie to be completely dumb. with such a low expectation, any form of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise. the soundtrack was the best part of the movie, but poking fun at the nonsense that goes on in singles wards was also amusing.<br /><br />this said, there were many things about the singles ward that were completely annoying. the entire film was poorly dubbed and made watching mouths while listening to their voices very irritating. this lack of professionalism was surpassed only by the cameos of mormon celebrities who have no business acting.<br /><br />this film will do well among mormondom, especially in college communities where singles ward exist. however the conclusion will offer no hope for the poor losers who find themselves unmarried. (only the pretty girls in the singles ward get married, the fat, ugly ones don't, but all the ugly men do) ultimately we realize that the whole film was an advertisement for ldssingles.com
