so this was an hbo "made for tv movie" eh? is that an excuse for such a pathetic plot and terrible acting? such a shame to see jim belushi reduced to a role so repetitive (shot at, survived, lies, beaten up, survives, shot at, lies and so ad infinitum. call that a script? as for the brits, embarrassing to see timothy dalton's pathetic (or was he just taking the p***, depends how much he was paid i guess?) attempt at a southern sheriff). as for that other brit, the bleached blond one, what a w***er! there is a trend towards glorifying these "english speaking" (sic) super-violent thugs lately, perhaps thanks to mr. madonna's two movies succeed in entertaining and justify the violence by skillful use of irony and humour, like pulp fiction does. however, this movie discredits and devalues the genre. definately one to miss.
