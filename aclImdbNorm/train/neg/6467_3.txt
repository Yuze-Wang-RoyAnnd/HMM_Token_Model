i still can't believe this movie. they got so much unbelievable things in it, that it's hard to believe anyone wanted to make it.<br /><br />the story is a joke, but in the sense of being funny, but more like no story at all. how can you mix a slapstick comedy with a train robbery, a prison movie, town conspiracies, sex-jokes and a fbi-agent? you can't.<br /><br />beside the terrifying directing the most noticeable thing are the actors. i watched this film and thought: 'is this really marlon brando? no, it can't be. (5 minutes later) is this charlie sheen? wow, maybe brando is true. (5 minutes later) this can't be donald sutherland. (5 minutes later) no, not mira sorvino. this movie is too bad for all of them. (at the end). no, no, no, this can't absolutely not be martin sheen!!! not for 10 seconds of such a movie.' then it was over and i down with my nerves. so many good, oscar-winning, usually convincing actors in such a stupid, dumb, awful movie. i rarely wanted to know so much how they came to act in this one. they couldn't got so much money.<br /><br />only just an unbelievable silly idiotic movie.<br /><br />3/10 \ 1/4 \ 5 (1+ - 6-)
