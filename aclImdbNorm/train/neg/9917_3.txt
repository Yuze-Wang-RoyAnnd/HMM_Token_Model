when stanwyck's husband-to-be is murdered on the eve of their wedding, she retreats to a mountain lodge, where she slips (sort of) off a cliff and is rescued by wealthy attorney morgan. morgan falls in love with her, leading to a definitely one-sided marriage, spent on a huge estate in chicago (which appears to be surrounded by mountains!). stanwyck is tempted by dashing cortez, but eventually returns to morgan, in a very subdued and unconvincing story resolution.<br /><br />this film has a great cast (morgan in particular is one of my favorites) and a great director, but the script is meandering and seems pointless at times. i was so ready to enjoy this movie but i was ultimately disappointed. still worth watching for the cast, and it's good for anyone who likes 1930s films.
