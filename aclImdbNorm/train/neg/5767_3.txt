as said before, the visual effects are stunning. they're breathtaking. i personally use blender and graphics like that are not easy at all. but that's all this movie is. not only is the plot confusing, but the overall conflict is not clear. for example, in the first scene, proog and emo are trying to run away from who knows what. the conflict seems to be between man and nature here. later, when they enter the room of the bottomless pit, proog explains that "one step out of place and (you're dead)". here, there's a more precise conflict between the careless man and nature. as the movie progresses, it's clear that a conflict exists between man and nature. but suddenly, a conflict exists between man and man when proog, out of nowhere, murders emo. proog immediately changes from being a caring guardian looking after a lost child to being a "sick man". he betrays us. not only is this depressing, but we don't care because the conflict between the character's thoughts and actions is not developed. it's not a story about someone, through struggle, emerging stronger. it's depressing and has not point because there's no great truth about the human soul or about the world brought to light like a great drama does. in my opinion, the movie is severely underdeveloped in all aspects. however, the graphics are stunning, but a movie is so much more than mere eye candy. there's no truth, no struggle and a bad surprise ending. in conclusion, an underdeveloped movie without a point. ...but the graphics are good.
