american pie: beta house is sort of in limbo between genres. on the one hand, it's a comedy with no plot and few genuinely clever jokes. on the other hand, it's porno that's a tad too soft-core to actually turn on any viewers. essentially beta house is a collage of sex scenes - some humiliating, others just lame attempts at humor - with a couple thin plot points thrown in an effort at cohesiveness. the characters are barely even two-dimensional, most development relies on knowledge of naked mile, and the "important" plot scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the writers even felt the need for a story.<br /><br />in all fairness, i did not go into this movie without expectations. i liked the original three american pie movies, and thought band camp and naked mile were solid rentals. i thought naked mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters, and so when i saw that some of the same characters were returning for beta house, i was excited to see this installment. i was aware that there would be numerous scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple forms. and i was fine with it, because in the past, these scenes were backed by the story and were well integrated into the plot. in beta house, however, it's almost as if the writers forgot why the formula in the other ap movies worked. they spent too much energy working in the nudity that they forgot to actually write a story.<br /><br />this movie is a disappointment and not even worth a one-dollar rental. the jokes are lame, the story is non-existent, and the porno-aspect is too tame if that's all you really care about seeing.
