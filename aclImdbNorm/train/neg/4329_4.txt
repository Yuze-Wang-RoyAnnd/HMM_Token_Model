i will never forget the wit and great comedy of the original vacation movie! the lines, pacing, and timing of events in that film are outstanding! however, this european vacation sequel is a major let down.<br /><br />in this sequel, the griswalds win a european vacation on a game show. the problem is that many of the jokes in the film are little more than mild, "ha-ha" laughs. for example, a flight attendant on an airplane asks clark, "do you want your coke in the can?" clark answers back, "no, i'll have it right here." that's really about the only line that is funny in this film.<br /><br />european vacation's humor is strained. as if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first movie, tried to re-hash a script that had been done before, and relied on a ridiculous slap-stick chase scene sequence toward the end of the picture just to kill time.<br /><br />worse, the natural comic standouts like randy quaid as cousin eddie and the original kids who played rusty and audrey from the first movie so well are nowhere to be found. their replacements are not funny, can't act, and just look like they are going through the motions most of the time. there are also a few crude sex jokes and comments that are not only not funny, they are in bad taste.<br /><br />the griswald's should have stayed in wally world. the place that made them legends! don't join them on this european dreadful adventure. viewers should re-watch the original vacation movie in place of this! you'll be glad you did.
