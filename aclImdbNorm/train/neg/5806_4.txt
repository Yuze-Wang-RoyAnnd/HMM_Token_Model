nowhere near the original. it's quite accurate copy bringing nothing new to the story. but the directing is very poor. basinger is weak - without good directing. baldwin is simply just a second league compared to mcqueen. i watched it just out of curiosity, being a huge fan of peckinpah's masterpiece, and i got what i thought. almost a b movie with second rate acting and directing. i wasn't even disappointed, i just don't know what they were trying to do. this remake doesn't try to play with the original material, it's not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actor of its era.<br /><br />it reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photograph.<br /><br />this is a complete waste of your time. save yourself 2 hours or watch the original (again:)))
