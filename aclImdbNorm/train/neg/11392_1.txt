for years i remember reading about this show "trouble with tracy" in the tv guide. cfto-tv toronto every saturday morning at 6 am! i lived about a two-hour drive north of toronto and we couldn't get cfto, but you know how it is - we always want what we can't have.<br /><br />well, i knew what i wanted and what i wanted was to see what this "trouble with tracy" was all about. did it have a beautiful girl in the starring role? was there nudity? was there suspense? was it a comedy? it would've been fine if there was some promotion of the show. at least i could've known what i was missing. but, no! the mystery drove me bonkers, until ctv affiliate ckco built a re-transmitter in wiarton, ontario and began to broadcast "trouble with tracy" at the same time as cfto....saturday mornings at 6 am!! one saturday morning i got up and turned the tv on at 5:59 and at last i got to see what "the trouble with tracy" was. yes, the "trouble with tracy" was that it was canadian content and stuck in the harmless 6 am spot so no one would ever see how awful it was.<br /><br />talented canadian actor steve weston died a few years afterward, but many would argue he effectively "died" the first time he appeared on this show. when i saw it for the first time that cold saturday morning and fell despondent back into my bed, part of me died, too.
