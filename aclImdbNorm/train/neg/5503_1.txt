i grew up watching the original tv series in the sixties and one thing that i can tell you right away, there is no comparison. this film was totally ridiculous with a flying suit that was alive. a martian that took different shapes. special effects that looked like something that a little child would create. in contrast, in the original, characters were developed and the viewers developed a feeling for tim and uncle martin. the only highlight in this film, yes, actually there was one, occurred when ray walston finally made an appearance at the end. he wore dark glasses and made references to living on this planet for 30 years as a sort of homage to the tv series. but even the real uncle martin could not save this turkey.
