"mistress of the craft" celeste works as an agent for the london branch of interpol's bureau 17, which specializes in (i think) occult criminals. she possesses the eye of destiny, good in her hands, dangerous if anyone else got it.<br /><br />bureau 17 has caught a satanist from california, hyde (no relation to dr. jekyll). detective lucy lutz of lapd flies to england to bring him back to the us. lutz is the connection to the earlier witchcraft movies, having been played by stephanie beaton before in witchcraft 9. in part 7, lutz was played by another woman; in 6, lutz was a man!<br /><br />lutz's part in 9 was not terribly big, but she's one of the main stars in this one. though she's left behind her high heels and short skirts, she still has revealing tops in this one. and this time around she has nude and sex scenes. beaton is pretty appealing in the role.<br /><br />as usual, there are a number of sex scenes. an anonymous clubgoer has a fatal threesome with two vampires, the satanist and head vampire get it on with some kink, lutz finds an english pal, and celeste and her boyfriend make love.<br /><br />the main recurring character of the witchcraft series, will spanner, does not appear in this one, although lutz mentions him to bureau 17 agent dixon in a conversation about vampires. she also phones her partner detective garner (parts 6, 7, and 9), though we don't hear his end of the conversation.<br /><br />hyde is sprung from jail by a group of vampires led by raven, for a walpurgis ritual having something to do with a god named morsheba (i think). hyde delivers all of his lines in a very flat manner, while raven overacts to a campy degree. the fight scenes are terribly choreographed.<br /><br />the audio in the movie was pretty poorly recorded, and poorly edited. additionally, some dialogue gets lost under blaring music or sirens. cinematography isn't great either. having the movie set in and actually shot in the uk was a bit of a novelty though, at least for this series.<br /><br />wendy cooper is very good as celeste; attractive, certainly, but more importantly she's easily the best actor in the movie (bad fight scenes notwithstanding). i'm quite surprised her filmography is so small. if there's ever a witchcraft xiv, and i would bet there will be, they should bring her back, even if it means flying her to california!<br /><br />witchcraft x is available on its own, or in the dvd collection hotter than hell along with witchcraft xi and two unrelated movies.
