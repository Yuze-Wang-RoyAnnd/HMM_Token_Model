i have nothing to comment on this movie it is so bad that i had to put my first comment on imdb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting, instead of watching this "movie" ... anything will do, even stare at the walls is better.<br /><br />and because i have to write minimum 10 lines of text, i tell you also is a low budget movie, bad acting, no name actors, a stupid mutt as the wolf, and so on... also the story brings nothing new, the special effects are made in the 80's style.<br /><br />the movie is almost as bad as the movie "megalodon".<br /><br />so have fun! ;) (not watching this movie)
