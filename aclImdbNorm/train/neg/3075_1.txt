yep.. this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the mstifyed movies, but i have definately seen worse. think gremlins rated r. well anyway, i met rick sloane at some sci-fi convention, that amazingly, he was lecturing at! it was one of those really low budget conventions, where everything goes, an everyone brought in something (if you want to see crap, you should have of seen what some friends and i brought in).<br /><br />he seemed like a very nice guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments on hobgoblins, and he even told me not to take it seriously, and said he loved the mst3k version!<br /><br />all in all, rick sloane knew what he was doing. and i think was meant to bad like mars attacks. so i guess i'm standing up for this movie and giving it a 5, and betraying all my fellow msties. sorry guys.
