can anybody do good cgi films besides pixar? i mean really, animation looked antiquated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 toy story standards. or maybe they spent all their budget on hugh jackman. whatever their reasoning, the story truly did suck.<br /><br />somehow, hugh jackman is a rat - a rat that is flushed down a toilet. yeah i know, seems stereotypical. but then the sewer mimicked the ways of london - to an extent. throw in a promise of jewels (????) and an evil(??) frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment.<br /><br />i would like to say something entertained me. maybe the hookup in the movie? or maybe the happily-ever-after rat relationship. but nothing did. it had the talent, but it blew up. d-
