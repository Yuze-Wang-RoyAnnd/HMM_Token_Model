this movie is simply not worth the time or money spent. full of clich'es and a plot that makes absolutely no sense ! i cant believe that so many people have given this awful movie a 10. my guess is they are stooges of the movie maker. <br /><br />if i could give this movie a zero, i would. too bad imdb doesn't allow that. <br /><br />the only reason i watched it because i went with a friend who really wanted to see it. whats sad is that i never had great expectations from this movie to begin with and yet i felt short changed. take my word, don't waste your $8 on this piece of trash. the only entertainment i got out of the movie was making fun of the directors name. in all, highly not recommended !
