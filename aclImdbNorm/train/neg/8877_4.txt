'major payne' is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines. this film does not really have a lot to offer, but it provides several hilarious moments that are well-worth a watch. don't expect it to be a memorable film, however. just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people. the confrontation between major payne and the chubby boy were hilarious, and that's really all i remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on major payne. again, it is not a great film, and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter.
