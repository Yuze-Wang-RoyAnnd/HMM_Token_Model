i caught this on showtime tonight and was amazed by how a movie with such a interesting premise could wind up being so unbelievably awful. who's your daddy? stars brandon davis as an adopted high school senior chris hughes, a geek who inherits the heir to a porn empire left to him by his biological parents. though the premise sounds like the movie could be a lot of fun, it is ruined by inept directing from first-time director andy fickman, a clich'ed and predictable screenplay, and acting that is even bad by direct-to-video standards. even the normally funny charlie talbert turns in a surprisingly dismal performance as the best friend. ali landry is the only good part of this lame and unfunny dud. 1/10
