i was excited to hear that someone had made a documentary on what it was like to be puerto rican. when i heard it was rosie perez, i wondered..could she possibly know what it is really like to be puerto rican. as far as i knew....she was a nuyorican. well anyway, i anxiously sat with my popcorn to watch. i realized 10 min into it that my initial apprehension was right. rosie perez has little knowledge about what it is like to be puerto rican. this "documentary" is more a 1st hand, very very personal account on what it is like to be a nuyorican..and all of what that entails. she (like most of the nuyoricans i know) have a watered down, partial and sometimes twisted sense of history. (how could they not..they live here.) yes, all of them are proud. as they should be! but a lot don't know the ins and outs of the real culture, history and political background or language for the most part. it all became very very apparent with her participation in the vieques issue. regardless of my personal take is on this issue..at least i know what the hell the fight is for. there is she is getting arrested for something she knew little about.. and only participated in because it was a "puerto rican cause" i really don't understand how she is not embarrassed to admit to it. for those of you that are not puerto rican, please view this as a partial account of a woman's journey of self discovery and acceptance. do not take this as gospel...a lot of it isn't even true. please consider the source. rosie is an actress; not a historian. this movie is not and should never be, for other nuyoricans, the base for their information. instead, just a step towards finding more info, learning and debating what the reality is. not just the one coming from this woman's eyes.
