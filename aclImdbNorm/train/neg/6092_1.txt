someone must have been seriously joking when they made this film.<br /><br />firstly, it is an absolute impossibility that this movie was made in 1993. the fashions and music dictate that this is seriously 80's. my guess is that this has sat on the shelf for a long while before some crazed distributer picked it up and released it to a disbelieving world.<br /><br />there is a plot. kind of. a strange loner meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favourite song he will be able to turn into whomever he chooses. at this point i feel obliged to point out that the loner's favourite song is london bridge is falling down. why is this his favourite song? because he's an idiot. we are only a minute into the film and already the film has reached a monumental level of stupidity. it gets even stupider.<br /><br />the loner is the nostril picker. i can only assume this as there are two scenes in the film where he is seen picking his nose. that clears up the title. he decides to change into a girl so that he can get close to other girls. and kill them. that's more or less it.<br /><br />the acting is universally appalling. every single performance in this movie sucks. in fact, i would go so far as to say that the acting is of the standard of a pornographic movie. it really is that terrible. the nostril picker appears to the audience as the nostril picker. the characters in the movie see him as the girl he has become through singing london bridge is falling down. man, i feel like an idiot even typing this. anyway, it is kind of strange seeing a middle aged weirdo hanging out with school girls. and not in a good way. there is even an extended montage of scenes where the nostril picker is at school with the girls and a song plays over the top. it is very possibly the worst song ever recorded. i'm not even going to describe it. you'll know it when you hear it. and you'll agree with me.<br /><br />there are some scenes of violence, sure. and there is a benny hill style chase sequence involving a transsexual. there is even an immortal bit of dialogue, that may or may not have been taken from shakespeare or john milton, where the nostril picker says to a prostitute, 'i've got the cash if you've got the gash'. lovely, i'm sure you'll agree.<br /><br />utter nonsense.
