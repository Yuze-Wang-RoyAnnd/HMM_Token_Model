seriously, i absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity but i just watched this for the first time last night and it easily slotted itself into my bottom five of all time. was this supposed to be about the love story or the zombies??? this movie was so bad that after it mercifully ended all i could do is laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was. thankfully i'm too anal to turn a movie off without seeing the entire thing or i wouldn't be able to brag about watching this all the way through in one sitting! i like to think something positive can be said about anything in life so in keeping with that theory i will acknowledge this film's most positive asset, it was very short for a full length film.
