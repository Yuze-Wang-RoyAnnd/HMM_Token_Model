as far as spaghetti westerns go, i'd put this man can't die on the dull side of the genre. it's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other sws i've seen. guy madison does his best in the lead role, but lacks the on-screen charisma necessary to pull it off. with one notable exception, the rest of the cast isn't particularly good. the direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that i haven't seen before. there's just not much to get very excited about.<br /><br />the cast exception i mentioned is rosalba neri. she's the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film. unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (note: the imdb page for this man can't die is wrong. rosalba neri does not play jenny benson. instead, she is the character melin. i'm not sure how anyone could mistake rosalba neri for some guy named john bartha as listed in imdb's credits for the movie.)
