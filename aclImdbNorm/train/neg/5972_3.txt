what a disappointment! piper perabo is adorable, tyra banks is beautiful but pitiful as an actor and the talented and beautiful maria bello is wasted! bello must have been embarrassed by some of the lines! the plot, script and premise is a joke!<br /><br />i'm not against silly movies, i think that something about mary is a masterpiece, but coyote ugly is a waste of 90 minutes........
