this film is really unbelievable. i've seen so much cheap trash-movies, especially a lot 'full moon'-pictures, but 'dollman' is really hard. so much comes together: the laughable story, the actors always at the edge of parody and the special effects! how long i could talk about them! it is a really bad movie, but also one of the funniest ones. if you're a fan of bad movies to laugh about, you have to see it. and don't miss 'dollman vs. demonic toys'. it really funnier and worse.
