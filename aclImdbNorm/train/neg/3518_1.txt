i saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor, and we found the entire thing so ridiculous as to be beyond pity. (for one, if stallone is out free-climbing by himself, there's no need to carry any gear, but i guess those dangling carabiners look sorta "mountain climby," so let's throw them in). for those lobotomized folks who think that colorado looks anything like the dolomites in italy (where the movie was filmed), well the hollywood moguls have got a lot more ridiculous & foul-smelling stuff for you to swallow.
