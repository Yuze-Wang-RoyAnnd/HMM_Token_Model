i consider this film one of the worst in the nightmare series. it was so boring that i couldn't remember a thing 20 minutes after the film was over, it even tires me to write a review on it.<br /><br />okay, #4 was a joke and freddy was the joker. #5 tried to return to the roots of the series. it was darker and more atmospheric than nightmare 4, which is a good thing, basically. they tried to shoot a horror film instead of a comedy. unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and scares. because of that nightmare 5: the dream child is neither funny nor is it scary. what we actually get is a boring film with the usual bad actors (maybe with the exception of lisa wilcox).<br /><br />the plot (freddy killing lisa's friends by using the dreams of lisa's unborn child) has a good base but it just isn't enough for 90 minutes of film. sometimes the story gets very confusing (maybe because there isn't any) and you can't stop wondering what the filmmakers were aiming at. the screenplay must have had more holes than swiss cheese and the film therefore was very cheesy itself (let me say that i don't like cheese though, even if i am from switzerland). not even the special effects were as good as for example in part 4.<br /><br />don't bother to rent/buy this film if not for completeness, it's quite a mess.<br /><br />my rating: 4/10 (get used to it, #6 is also a messy one...)
