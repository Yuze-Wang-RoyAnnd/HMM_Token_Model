just because someone is under the age of 10 does not mean they are stupid. if your child likes this film you'd better have him/her tested. i am continually amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that turns out so bad. this "film" is a showcase for digital wizardry and nothing else. the writing is horrid. i can't remember when i've heard such bad dialogue. the songs are beyond wretched. the acting is sub-par but then the actors were not given much. who decided to employ joey fatone? he cannot sing and he is ugly as sin.<br /><br />the worst thing is the obviousness of it all. it is as if the writers went out of their way to make it all as stupid as possible. great children's movies are wicked, smart and full of wit - films like shrek and toy story in recent years, willie wonka and the witches to mention two of the past. but in the continual dumbing-down of american more are flocking to dreck like finding nemo (yes, that's right), the recent charlie & the chocolate factory and eye-crossing trash like red riding hood.
