about the only thing i liked about this film is that there was just enough in it to keep me in my seat to the end... i kept thinking that maybe in the next scene things would gel... alas...<br /><br />those who like gus van sant's films - especially his later ones - will probably like this. personally, i find van sant's films to be dull, pretentious and facile. well, he was an executive producer for this film, so it is no surprise that the film could almost have been made by him - although personally i actually liked this better than van sant's latest efforts (e.g. elephant).<br /><br />contrary to many here, i did not think the film was difficult to understand or disjointed, i thought that above all it is a film that wishes to portray a certain mood - the mood of an adolescent moving slowly into the adult world - but so slowly that the changes are barely visible if at all. but i feel that the problem with the film is that "mood" is not enough... and not only that, but that the mood painted here is, to my mind, incorrectly chosen for the story that is supposedly happening. the dream-like quality, so closely linked to nature, is beautifully captured here, but it is a mood which belongs much more to a much younger child, one who really still does get totally caught up in watching nature unfold (waves on a beach, grasses and flowers, spiders etc). the rhythm of the film reminds me of my summers when i was about eight or nine. there is a languor to the film that is in opposition to what should be a very tense time in an adolescent life. when you are caught up in a crush on someone - or being the object of bullying at school - you are anything but languorous! there are only two moments that truly worked for me in the film...spoilers here - first when logan drops the groceries and his mother throws a bit of a fit. the frustrations of an adult dealing with a klutzy kid - especially with no father present - seemed real to me.<br /><br />the second, and only part of the film with any tension to it, were the scenes where "leah" (logan's re-creation of himself) phones rodeo and tries to seduce him into phone-sex. the first reason i liked it is because the person who did the voice-over of "leah" was the most convincing actor in the entire film. (it made me think of claire danes from my so-called life ...the voice even sounded like claire.) she and rodeo had the only scenes that seemed totally believable between the kids. and what i especially liked was the fact that rodeo only pretended to play along... it was perhaps the best moment in the film as - finally! - we got some character development.<br /><br />all in all, a somewhat misplaced effort... we will have to see what he does in his next film before we can really say much about the director's possible talents. in the meantime, if he can get away from van sant's influence, it might do him a world of good. who is this director anyhow - one of van sant's boy toys?
