i have a high tolerance for the weird, but frankly some movies go way, way beyond weird--so far that they make your brain hurt. this is such a film. trying to understand it or even explain it is impossible and i think the film is best understood while taking drugs--it's that incomprehensible.<br /><br />the film begins with some very cute japanese animation involving a cat. however, out of the blue, tons of twisted and occasionally disturbing things occur--making me wonder if i am losing something in the translation. however, even if this is so, why did we need to be treated to images of a magic trick involving dismembering a lady with a clever, defecation, puking, lighting animals on fire, etc.. all this really seemed random and pretty awful. oddly, and i don't know why, some see this as a work of genius. i just don't get that.
