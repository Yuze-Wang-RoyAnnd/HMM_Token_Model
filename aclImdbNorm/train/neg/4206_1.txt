i was at this film's premiere at the toronto film festival in 1997. after the screening, when the writer/director and some cast members offered to answer questions, no one could even be bothered to ask any. rarely has a film been so poorly directed (why on earth were random frames snipped out of some scenes?), wretchedly acted (david arquette, to paraphrase dorothy parker, does not run the emotional gamut from a to b. he parks at a and brings a lunch) and utterly pointless. characters behave completely out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions. at long last, the film comes to a completely random and pointless end that's supposed to "really make you think." unfortunately, what it makes you think is, "well, there's 90 minutes of my life i'm never getting back."
