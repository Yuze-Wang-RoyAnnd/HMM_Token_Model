did anyone stop to realise what sort of movie they were producing here ? now let`s a former marine officer becomes assinged to a group of kids at a cadet school so this should be a family comedy right ? wrong . this is just a gross comedy aimed at teenagers with many bad taste moments .it might have been watchable in an extremely dumb way at this point but i found damon wayans voice to be irritating beyond belief . does he speak like that in real life ? if he does then he has my sympathy but he won`t be getting any of my money from watching his movies
