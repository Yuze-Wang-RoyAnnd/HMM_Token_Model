first: i bought it at the video store. second: i watched it. third: it was boring. fourth: it was not funny. fifth: most of the antics were lame. and last, but not least: it's not only a bad movie, it's a total fiasco.<br /><br />i am a huge adam sandler fan despite this disappointing and forgotten film. i pity it because it was his first movie. even if you are a huge adam sandler fan, don't bother watching this movie. instead, just take the video, board a yacht, and throw it overboard.
