the "confidential" part was meant to piggy-back on the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name, while the labor racketeering theme tied in with headline congressional investigations of the day. however, despite the a-grade b-movie cast and some good script ideas, the movie plods along for some 73 minutes. it's a cheap-jack production all the way. what's needed to off-set the poor production values is some imagination, especially from uninspired director sidney salkow. a few daylight location shots, for example, would have helped relieve the succession of dreary studio sets. a stylish helmsman like anthony mann might have done something with the thick-ear material, but salkow treats it as just another pay-day exercise. too bad that brian keith's typical low-key style doesn't work here, coming across as merely wooden and lethargic, at the same time cult figure elisha cook jr. goes over the top as a wild-eyed drunk. clearly, salkow is no actor's director. but, you've got to hand it to that saucy little number beverly garland who treats her role with characteristic verve and dedication. too bad, she wasn't in charge. my advice-- skip it, unless you're into ridiculous bar-girls who do nothing else but knock back whiskeys in typical strait-jacketed 50's fashion.
