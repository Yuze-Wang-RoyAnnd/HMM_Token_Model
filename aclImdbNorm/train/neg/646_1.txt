i saw this film by accident and this movie was an accident...well it must of been. blonde women being stalked,the villain appearing then disappearing getting from one place to another in minute's then disappearing and reappearing,hiding.he was'nt even a super hero so i don't know how he did it.he could'nt frighten a cat and that's not hard to do.<br /><br />the old "mirror in the bathroom"is just not scary anymore in fact it stopped being scary years ago. you had the cop on the trail of the villain,another clich'e(played by idris elba with a very convincing american accent,he's from london) the director did'nt have a clue and has made a film full of clich'e's and make's "scary move"which was a comedy look scary. pathetic!
