what a weekend. two days ago i watched the first half of "war games 2: dead code", now "while she was out". i am trying to come to a decision which one was worse in terms of pain in my mind while watching. i guess, "while she was out" was worse.<br /><br />it has all been said before in other comments: unrealistic, illogical etc. - the only thing i really have to add is that at some point i started feeling more for the evil guys than for the woman because i would have recommended her for a darwin award if she actually died (only watched first half, so i don't know). soon i was at two darwin awards (if that's even possible) for her immense stupidity.<br /><br />and, hey: produced by kim basinger? so she did not only know the script but was also responsible for bringing this waste of money to us, the people? i consider humans who waste considerable amounts of money to be evil because the money could have used to feed and clothe quite a few people instead of hurting 80 percent of those who saw it in the cinema and giving 20 percent, which are idiots, a good opportunity to show just how much of an idiot they are.
