"sir" john gielgud must have become senile to star in a mess of a movie like this one.;<br /><br />this is one of those films, i suppose, that is considered "art," but don't be fooled.....it's garbage. stick to the "art" you can admire in a frame because the films that are labeled as such are usually unintelligible forgeries like this.<br /><br />in this masterpiece, giegud recites shakespeare's "the tempest" while the camera pans away to nude people. one of them a little kid urinating in a swimming pool. wow, this is heady stuff and real "art," ain't it?? that's just one example. most of the story makes no sense, is impossible to follow and, hence, is one that liberal critics are afraid to say they didn't "understand" so they give it high marks to save their phony egos. you want shakespeare? read his books.
