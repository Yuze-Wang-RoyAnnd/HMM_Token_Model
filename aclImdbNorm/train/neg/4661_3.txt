this movie has richard pryor, rosey grier and others. it's a curious ww2 movie, and serves as a statement about racism. it is worth watching to understand the fact that movies reflect how we feel about the issues when they are produced and not about the period of time they portray. meaning this is a 70's movie not a 40's movie (ww2). still, there is some good action scenes of 7 seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a dam. the story centers on the captain learning that these men are soldiers and not just a service company. there is a scene that could be from a civil war movie and not a ww2 movie that reflects what the movie is all about. the black lt. gives a german women a innocent peck on the cheek, and the white capt becomes upset. i enjoyed the movie from a curiosity stand point since the stars and the genre were interesting to me.
