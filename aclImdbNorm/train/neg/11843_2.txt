just because an event really happened doesn't mean that it will make a good screenplay/ movie. the cat's meow, by peter bogdanovich claims to be based on actual events which happened on a cruise hosted by william randolph hurst. the writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit. the key moments of the story seem implausible; for example, when hurst accidentally shoots the producer, believing him to be chaplin. basing a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is trite and contrived. the story attempts to be a dark comedy, but the cat's meow misses an important piece of this equation, comedy. there is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters. it hardly matters who is shot, who is killed, who is guilty and who is innocent. there is not a strong character to cheer for. as a result the conflicts are difficult to care about and the eventual outcome is incidental.
