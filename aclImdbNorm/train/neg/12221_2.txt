with the exception of the sound none of the above are really criticisms for this type of no budget, (truly) independent horror film. make up effects and gore are very good and the lead actor was effective, the lead actress although attractive needs some coaching as she was particularly poor.<br /><br />the major problem with frightworld is it's length, at 108 minutes its half an hour too long to be effective as a slasher movie, plot wise only about ten minute of the first fifty are relevant.<br /><br />in places it is visually engaging and sometimes the lack of lighting works in the films favour. however when this is combined with the poor sound as is the case with most of the film large sections are difficult to watch.<br /><br />this could certainly be an entertaining if unoriginal "serial killer back from the dead" movie with some judicious and ruthless editing, in its current form it plays like an unfinished rough cut.
