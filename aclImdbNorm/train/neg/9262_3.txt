on the surface the idea of omen 4 was good. it's nice to see that the devil child could be a girl. in fact, sometimes, as in the exorcist, when girls are possessed or are devilry it's very effective. but in omen 4, it stunk.<br /><br />delia does not make me think that she could be a devil child, rather she is a child with issues. issues that maybe only a therapist, rather then a priest could help. she does not look scary or devilish. rather, she looks sulky and moody.<br /><br />this film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked. but it's rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies, as a made for tv movie special.<br /><br />on so many levels it lets down. it's cheap looking, the acting is hammish and the effects are typical of a tv drama. the characters do not bring any sympathy, and you do not route for them. i recently re-watched it after someone brought it for me for christmas, and it has dated appalling.<br /><br />if your thinking of watching this, then i would suggest that you don't. watch one of the others, or watch the exorcist, or watch the good son. just don't waste your time on this drivel!
