spoilers throughout!!!!<br /><br />i had read the book "1st to die" and wanted to see if the movie followed the book so i watched it. for the most part it did. there were some minor differences(location of the last violent scene for instance) but not many and for the most part the movie stayed true to the book more so then most movies.<br /><br />this may have been a mistake-although the movie was perfectly cast-with pollen and bellows especially-i was not that impressed with the book. or let me take that back. i started off very impressed, gradually became more disillusioned and by the end was left completely unsatisfied and felt almost gypped. no difference with the movie. here is why.<br /><br />there is no "payoff" in the book, or the movie. rarely have i read a who done it thriller that has created such a letdown with it's final resolution and i had hoped the movie would vary a little.<br /><br />the whole-(he did it, no she did it, no they both did it)-was not interesting, not fascinating and more confusing, annoying and depressing then anything else. add to that, that the love of lindsay's life dies at the end(after her disease cleares and she cries at his grave).. and then cut to where she's contemplating suicide....then all of a sudden she's in a fight for her life with the real villain who was cleared after being arrested.. but it turns out he and the wife were in it together....hello!!! this whole thing has now become "general hospital" instead of a good old fashioned thriller. i felt cheated and ripped off by the book and watching the movie(i must admit it held my attention nicely -the acting was very good for a tv movie)was hoping it wouldn't follow the book which it wound up doing.<br /><br />i still think the movie is watchable and for some reason does not leave as bad a taste in your mouth as the book(or maybe it's just that i knew what would happen)but i have to say the way this story unraveled was not well done at all.
