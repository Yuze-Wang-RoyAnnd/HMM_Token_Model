this effort was like a glitzy tv movie...i don't recall this ever being released in theaters...if so, it must've died a quick death. watching the dvd, in the comfort of our bedroom, it was obvious this film was meant for not much more...ed lauter an art critic with a greed streak? what a fun turn that must've been...i haven't seen ed since "the longest yard"...everyone else pretty much acted by the numbers, led by baldwin, except for pompeo...she had zero charisma and seemed to be sleepwalking thru most of the picture...pompeo's daughter had one dimension...she played every scene like a lovable little puppy...slowest line delivery of any 3 year old i've seen yet...<br /><br />the chase scenes gave my wife and i headaches...too much quick-cutting and angle-bashing...if you 're going to shoot a chase scene in barcelona, you might want a few wide shots to exploit the beauty of your backdrop, right? the whole story was pretty implausible and far-fetched, but hey, we liked it better than "the life aquatic..."
