when i saw previews of this movie i thought that it may be dumb, but it will at least be funny. well i was wrong. even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re-evaluating their life, the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible. the first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny. but by the end, i could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next.<br /><br />throughout the movie i like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre, which is still more than i can say for the movie itself.
