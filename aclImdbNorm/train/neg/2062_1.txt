i read all the reviews here after watching this piece of cinematic garbage and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that somebody else didn't think that this appallingly unfunny montage wasn't the acme of humour in the 70s or indeed in any other era! if this isn't the least funny set of sketch *comedy* i've ever seen it'll do till it comes along. half of the skits had already been done (and infinitely better) by acts such as monty python and woody allen... if i was to say that a nice piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this film it would still not get close to summing up just how mindless and drivel-ridden this waste of 75 minutes is. seminal comedy? only in the world where seminal really does mean semen. scatological humour? only in a world where scat is actually feces. precursor jokes? only if by that we mean that this is a handbook of how not to do comedy. tits and bums and the odd beaver. nice...if you are a pubescent boy with at least one hand free and haven't found out that playboy exists. give it a break because it was the early 70s? no way. there had been sketch comedy going back at least ten years prior. the only way i could even forgive this film even being made is if it was at gunpoint. retro? hardly. sketches about clowns subtly perverting children may be cutting edge in some circles (and it could actually have been funny) but it just comes off as really quite sad. what kept me going throughout the entire 75 minutes? sheer belief that they may have saved a genuinely funny skit for the end. i gave the film a 1 because there was no lower score...and i can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patients...or perhaps people suffering from lockjaw...their jaws would finally drop open in disbelief.
