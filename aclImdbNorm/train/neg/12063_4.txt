the husband-and-wife team of bennie fields and blossom seeley were huge stars in vaudeville, yet they made very few films. as is the case for some other performers of their era (george m. cohan, fanny brice, gertrude lawrence) the most accessible piece of film footage for fields and seeley is the biopic about them, in which they're portrayed by other actors: 'somebody loves me', starring betty hutton and that inimitable song-and-dance man ralph meeker.<br /><br />in their heyday, fields and seeley were so hugely popular that another husband-and-wife vaudeville act -- jesse block and eve sully -- achieved nearly as much stardom performing an almost identical act, effectively becoming the "second-team" fields and seeley. offstage, though, there was a major difference in the couples' living arrangements. fields and seeley lived in hotel suites, paying room-service rates for every meal they ate, and eventually running out of money. block and sully lived modestly and invested their earnings wisely, ending in comfortable retirement.<br /><br />the first 30 seconds of this vitaphone short are occupied by two spats-wearing pianists. apparently these two men had some slight name value of their own in 1930, although i've never heard of them. finally, fields and seely rush in and start performing. they both have plenty of pep, and she's fairly attractive.<br /><br />i was annoyed that both performers keep making movements as if they're about to break into a dance, but they never quite do so until the third of the three songs they perform in this short. when they finally start hoofing, the results are not impressive.<br /><br />i was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major performers doing their vaude act. now that i've seen it, i understand why they never became stars in movie musicals. my rating for this one: just 4 out of 10, and i'll stick with block and sully.
