- when the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes over until and is determined to clean-up the town. not everyone in town, however, is happy with what she's doing. when the sheriff orders a curfew in town, the local saloon owner (also a woman) hires a killer to take care of the sheriff. there's no way the saloon owner could know that the sheriff and the killer would fall in love.<br /><br />- gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combine it with poor execution. there's a good movie here somewhere trying to get out. in more capable hands or with a larger budget, gunslinger might have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the old west. as it is, gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie.<br /><br />- there are just so many things wrong with the movie: a supporting cast with no acting ability, stilted and unnatural dialogue, and sets that look like sets. but the biggest offender is the editing. i was amazed at how many times a scene would begin with the actors (and horses for that matter) obviously waiting for corman to yell "action". the best is the scene of two riders on horseback just standing beside a building. all of a sudden, they take off and come racing around the corner like they had been riding hard for several miles. or, take the example of people who can seemingly transport themselves across town. we see a man enter a building and a second later emerge across town to mount his horse.<br /><br />- it's not as if corman didn't have a few decent actors to work with. while none were great stars, beverly garland, john ireland, and allison hayes were all capable of turning in a good performance. but, in gunslinger, they're not given much to work with.<br /><br />- i have now seen both the mst3k and non-mst3k versions of the movie. i would strongly recommend going the mst3k route.
