i did not expect a lot from this movie, after the terrible "life is a miracle". it turns out that this movie is ten times worse than "life ...". i have impression that director/writer is just joking with the audience: " let me see how much emptiness can you (audience) sustain". dialogues are empty, ... scenario is minimalistic. in few moments, photography is really nice. few sarcastic lines are semi-funny, but it is hard to genuinely laugh during this "comedy". i've laughed to myself for being able to watch the movie until the end. if you can lift yourself above this director's fiasco, ... you will find good acting of few legends (miki manojlovic, aleksandar bercek), and very good performance of emir's son stribor kusturica.<br /><br />in short: too bad for such a great director ! emir kusturica is still young and should be making top-rated movies. instead, he chooses to do this low-budget just-for-my-private theater movie, with arrogant attitude toward the world trends and negligence toward his old fans.
