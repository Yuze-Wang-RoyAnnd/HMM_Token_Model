how the grinch stole christmas was a wonderful little christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy, i never did see the reason for a remake. not to mention a remake that was made with humans, the cartoon was just perfect enough, what's the purpose of this film? but it also seemed a little odd for jim carrey to be the grinch. i mean he's a great comedic actor, but him as the grinch? it just didn't make any sense to me. his performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments. not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable. the whole story of the grinch and cindy lou-who was over done and wasn't needed. they actually just destroyed the story, period.<br /><br />all the who's in whoville are getting ready for their best christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly. but cindy lou-who is curious and worried about the grinch that lives above them and that he's not going to get as good of a christmas as the other who's. he kicks her out and decides that he doesn't want christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal christmas all together to show the who's what his version of christmas is all about. but soon he realizes that the who's may know that it's a little bit more than what is the materialized version of christmas.<br /><br />how the grinch stole christmas wasn't needed and was a bit over the top. i really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version, at least in my opinion. the make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done, not to mention that how the grinch stole christmas! was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring jim carry. but at least this version makes you grateful for the boris karloff version that is played every christmas.<br /><br />1/10
