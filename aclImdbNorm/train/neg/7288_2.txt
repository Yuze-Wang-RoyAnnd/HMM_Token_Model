note to all directors: long is not necessarily good. this movie is incredibly long. however not good. the scenes were drawn out way, way, way, way, way too long. the sex scenes were unnecessary, and often too long. the movie edited down to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional, but alas it became so boringly long that i can only give it a 2 of 10. it is way below average.<br /><br />some other problems also exist in this marathon. <br /><br />1) ralph fiennes plays a whole family tree. the guy who played the great-grandfather looks nothing like him, but the grandfather, father and the son (who gives us constant unneeded voice over) are all ralph fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bull-headed personality. no one seems to notice that each of these children look like a clone of the last, even though photos of them are being snapped at every turn. this one is minor, but if the movie hadn't been 3 weeks long it wouldn't have been so annoying.<br /><br />2) the fact that no news from germany was even whispered for the longest time about jews being rounded up and sent off is ridiculous. some word would have gotten to them and the thought of trying to run off would probably have been discussed. the uncle in france would surely have sent warning to try and get them to leave.<br /><br />3) the love stories in this movie are totally wrong. you are spending forever telling us this thing and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short. suddenly... people are in love and almost instantly... married. then having children. then we draw things out for 6 centuries and forget about developing relationships. this again would not have stuck out so much in a 2 hour movie, but with time spent nothing was given to us.<br /><br />4) the ending was just bad. i don't want to spoil it for anyone, but you won't like it either...unless you are sadistic.<br /><br />the director/writer should be tortured with having to watch this bloated garbage on a weekly basis, i mean endless loop, oops they are the same thing. <br /><br />i wonder if robert redford did anything for this movie, i mean i think istvan szabo must be modeling his directing career after him. long drawn out movie which totally ruins any substance in the movie. a short description of 'the horse whisperer', and sunshine.<br /><br />sunshine, perfect title. if you start watching while the sun is shining it will quite possibly be well after dark when you leave.
