in spite of sterling work by the supporting actors, and an intelligent script by alan plater, this film suffers from a fatal flaw - the lack of charm of the central character/actor. one of the characters describes richard e grant's character as "a whining little turd" and unfortunately this sums him up perfectly. there is nothing about him or his performance to make it credible that his girlfriend and upper-class publisher/friend would spend so much time and emotional effort on him. he is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and thoroughly annoying. the part called for an actor who can make you love him even when he is being a prate - a ewan mcgregor, for example.<br /><br />all of the witty satire on the class system etc was wasted, thanks to this irritating and thoroughly unlikeable performance. all i wanted to do was shake him and tell him to get over himself.
