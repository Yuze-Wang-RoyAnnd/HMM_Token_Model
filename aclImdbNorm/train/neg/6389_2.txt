i waited almost 25 years to see this movie, thinking it might be an underrated work, from a period animation was no longer of the quality it had once been. it starred one of the best film villains of all time, was based on a beloved series of children's books, and was a disney studios production. what could possibly be wrong with it? as it turns outs, almost everything.<br /><br />well, not everything. vincent price as rattigan and henry mancini's swanky score are the movie's two saving graces. price is wickedly enjoyable, and mancini more professional than the material deserves. they bring class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity. <br /><br />meanwhile the rest of the movie, while filled with inappropriately adult situations, still suffers from a completely dull script, blandly generic voice work, terrible songs, and lazy animation that wouldn't have been out of place on any of disney's mid-1980s saturday morning tv shows.<br /><br />this was a complete disappointment to me. it's amazing that this movie was nearly contemporary with the secret of nimh. costing a fraction of this, an independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than gmd has in its endless running time.<br /><br />the extra star that keeps this from being "awful" goes to price and mancini.
