i saw this movie when i was much younger and i thought it was funny. i saw it again last week, and you can guess the result. some funny parts in it, very few and too long. the beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask me.<br /><br />if you want a total b-movie this is a good pick, but don't expect too much from aliens dwarf size
