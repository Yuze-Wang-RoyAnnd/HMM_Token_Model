from the first moment, this "thing" is just an awful sequence of extremely short cuts of blurry camera work. while the overall plot has every potential for a thriller, the story is so badly told that i'm unable to buy it. from the middle of the film, the actions of characters don't make sense to me. stop reading now to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />for instance, ed's idea to have edna make coffee for them after having shot off her son's arm is way below his alleged experience; it's just an extremely stupid idea. domino not questioning the fragmentary orders she receives from claremont williams over a breaking-up phone connection just eludes me; shouldn't she be long suspicious that williams is turning them in? those fbi agents seem out of their minds showing up with just one single helicopter to something they have every reason to consider a capital mafia shoot-out. besides, what they do by withholding and leaking information towards cigliutti is pretty much incitement to murder; it seems to me like farewell to justice if that's they way the fbi does investigations. in reality, they'd have a case messed up beyond repair if they acted like this. we get to see a car accident which normally would have at least seriously injured if not killed most of the passengers but miraculously leaves all of them with just a few bruises. quite the contrary, the accident is immediately followed by domino making love to choco, which is from domino's viewpoint in no way founded by previous events but just by being drugged to the eyeballs.<br /><br />the whole sequence of scenes starting from the phone call of claremont williams appears to me just as want-to-be dramatic razzle-dazzle. this combined with the awful, uneasy camera work just makes a piece i hesitate to call a movie. i'm sorry for the wasted effort of the main actors, whose talent is out of question.
