it is only robert de niro film which i really hates. it is stupid film with horrible acting (of course not de niro). for me, brian de palma must do his mafia films as always like scarface (1983) or the untouchables (1987). i also loved de palma's mission: impossible (1996). de niro worked with palma two different times too, greetings and the wedding party. i though that the wedding party was ok too (i didn't watch greetings). <br /><br />screenplay is really bad and unfunny. there are no any scene where i can smile for even one time. film lost a chance to be a funny style even a little bit in a "be black baby" scene and also i don't like the scene where a guy's sexual organ appeared. so, it is one of the worst film i have ever seen! just worst. i hate that.
