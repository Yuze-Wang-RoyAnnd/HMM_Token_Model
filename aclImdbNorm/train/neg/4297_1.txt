i awake suddenly, aware that i'm drooling onto the plastic couch cover, and realize it's a warm saturday afternoon. why was i sleeping? did i hit my head? or accidentally swallow all of my grandma's muscle relaxers? could it be adult onset narcolepsy? <br /><br />no, i momentarily paused on cheap seats while channel surfing, and the stunning lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that i blacked out.<br /><br />it's that head-shaking, mouth-agape, shoulder-shrugging bad. but i have to give these moronic and boring twins credit for selling this idea through. perhaps they had the same effect on the espn programming executive that they had on me, and when he/she woke up, a few horrendous episodes were already in the can and he/she hoped that since all the viewers will be asleep, no one will now how awful it is and he/she can keep the $425,000 annual salary.<br /><br />you've been warned.
