this is not a good movie. too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par. the 3d was ok, but not superb. i almost fell asleep in this movie.<br /><br />the story is about 3 young flies that want to have adventure and follow up on it. the characters are lacking, i truly do not care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested. pixar this is not.<br /><br />i would have liked to see more special 3d effects. also i wold like to see more fly jokes than the mom constantly saying "lord of the flies" pretty sexist in showing the women as house wives and fainting.
