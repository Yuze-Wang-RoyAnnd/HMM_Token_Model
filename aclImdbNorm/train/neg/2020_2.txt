this seems like two films: one a dreary, pretentious lengthy saga about an ac-tor who is taken over by the parts he plays; the other a brilliant social comment about a middle aged divorce who is picked up by a waitress. shelley winters is wonderful as a waitress with another business on the side. she drops heavy hints about the need for connections, her certificate in massage and her desire to get into the modelling game. i love the glimpse of her seedy flat with a kitchenette behind a curtain, and her terrible seducing outfit of navel-revealing, puff-sleeved crochet top.<br /><br />do actors get oscars for shakespeare? we know they oscars for impersonating disabled people, wearing a lot of prosthetics, or pretending to be mad. the shakespearean scenes (which go on and on) are embarrassing and dated. and so are the 'going mad' scenes where tony looks distracted while listening to his own voice-over.<br /><br />by the way, anthony john is not aristocratic. he makes it quite clear in an early scene that he used to be a chorus boy. when he quotes his father's advice, he slips into a cockney accent.
