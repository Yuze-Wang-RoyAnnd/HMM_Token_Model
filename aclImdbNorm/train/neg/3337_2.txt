casting aside many of the favorable comments that have obviously come from friends and/or relatives that pepper this and many other low budget independents listed on imdb, one is lost when it comes to using these reviews as an accurate gauge. so eventually you have to go out and rent the flick just to see for yourself. one of the first things you must understand are the catch phrases that camouflage the reality of the movie. in this case the term "dark psychological thriller." read: "hack writer/director who thinks he's an auteur, who replaces plot, story, and action, with what he believes is a deep insight into the human soul. his great insight? festering and repressed childhood traumas emerge to wreck havoc when we become adults. wow, i bet freud would be really impressed! too many would be film makers like kallio, who were raised on low budget horror flicks of the last few decades, fail to dig their own fresh grave. instead, they fall into the pre-dug graves of the many other directors that came before them. they are content with rehashing old and tired horror clich'es that they borrowed from a dozen or more films. the result is an unoriginal, uninspired, unbelievable waste of film stock.
