what we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money & revenge can corrupt your soul... or something like that. guy ritchie, a director known for his reworking of the gangster genre, bites off more than he can chew with this one.<br /><br />his use of modern film noir to tackle the theme of a man setting himself free by swallowing his pride, being nice to his enemy & giving away all his money falls flat on it's face. when jason statham's character no longer fears ray liotta, it apparently drives liotta crazy enough to blow his head off in the final scene. why? basically you cannot set up a mafiosi like the liotta character, who has presumably got to his station in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behaviour evident throughout the film, only then to have him driven to suicide by nothing more than a pitying smile on the face of statham's character.<br /><br />before anyone starts to say i'm missing the point... i'm not. i get it ok? opt out of the quest for riches & you'll find true happiness and inner peace. be nice to your enemy and this will confuse him into self-destruction. this seems to be the gist of the movie and in itself this is not a bad premise for a story, although hardly original. the problem is that ritchie simply doesn't have the skill as a movie maker to carry it off. at the moment when even guy ritchie realises this, he appears to get bored with the story and begins to insert red-herrings: the scene when statham gets knocked over by a car - why? the shooting of some scenes as marvel comic animations... again, why?<br /><br />there are so many loose threads & unanswered questions left at the end of the movie you could get all 2001-ish about it and try figuring them out, or simply accept that there are no answers & each viewer will interpret things in their own way. myself? i was so bored with the pompous tone of the film that i simply didn't care. frankly the ending couldn't come too soon so that i didn't have to sit through any more of this pretentious psychobabble.<br /><br />a waste of two hours of my life.
