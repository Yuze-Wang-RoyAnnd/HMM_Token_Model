bought this movie in the bargain bin at rogers video store for $2. i enjoy a good b movie now and then and figured this looked like a good one.<br /><br />the movie is quite cliche "1970's" and is quite groovy for that. unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie. in fact, i turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and figured a week later that i should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was.<br /><br />the movie has good spots in it, but you have to wait and wait and wait.......for them.<br /><br />if you are into b movies, this might just be for you, just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens, and did i mention not much story line either...<br /><br />
