this reminds me of when i was a born-again believer who was going to be a minister. i never actually thought i would be a minister or even graduate from high school because i was almost positive i would be raptured to heaven before that would ever happen. that was before i discovered that christianity was a bunch rubbish. i am now an atheist, and that just proves that the "once saved always saved" doctorine that christians tell us is no more real than elves. if it were true then why did i leave after many years of being a devout born again believer? yes, i really was saved. i prayed that silly sinners prayer with all my heart.<br /><br />if christians were to read their bible they would discover that their god thinks like rape, genocide, abortion, and many other atrocities are alright according to him. they might be surprised to learn that no where is the word "rapture" mentioned.
