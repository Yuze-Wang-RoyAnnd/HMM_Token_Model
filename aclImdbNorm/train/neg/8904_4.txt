i personally liked "the prophecy" of 1995 a lot. christopher walken was, as always, great, and even though the film wasn't flawless, it was a creepy and highly original horror/fantasy film that entertained immensely. this inferior 1998 sequel is still worth watching, but mainly due to walken. walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen archangel gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. once again, the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth. gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel danyael (russel wong) and the human woman valerie (jennifer beals). this child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war... as i said above, christopher walken is once again excellent as gabriel. besides gabriel, however, "the prophecy ii" sadly also includes a bunch of terribly annoying characters. the character of valerie was annoying enough, and danayel annoyed me even more. the biggest pain in the ass, however was the character of izzy (played by brittany murphy), a suicidal girl who wouldn't shut up. still, walken's performance isn't the only redeeming quality of the film. the entire film is quite dreary, and well-shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. gabriel's resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the "prophecy" films. "the prophecy ii" is nevertheless the weakest of the three "prophecy" films with walken. definitely a christopher walken one-man-show, entertaining, but nothing beyond that.
