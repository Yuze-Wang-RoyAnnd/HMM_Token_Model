i first started watching this show probably around the year of 2003 or 2004 with my friends. of course, at the time i was younger and enjoyed some of the jokes on this show. i was 11 in 2003, and i am 14 now (2007). though my age probably plays a major role in how i judge this show, after reading other's reviews, i have come to see that after the third season, this show went down the tubes. i agree. this show is obnoxious, repetitive and usually focuses on the same plot.<br /><br />the show revolves around timmy turner, who was granted two fairy godparents because basically his life was horrible - his parents were never around, and he had a nasty baby-sitter. the plot of the entire show is that this kid (timmy) and his godparents always wish up some destruction that cannot be prevented by making another wish, because something in "da rules" says they can't. the show has a lot of lines that keep being repeated, like "magic cannot break true love, super toilet" or even just some scummy jokes lines that nickelodeon probably thought was funny and decided to put in the episode various times.<br /><br />the show is aimed at kids younger than 10, because it involves gross situations and "kid humor" that most kids of my age wouldn't care for. the character voice selection could've been better too. timmy has an extremely loud, shrill, feminine voice as does cosmo. wanda sounds like an old lady. timmy's dad sounds like some announcer or game show host, timmy's mom's voice is too exaggerated to sound feminine. attitudes in this show are: in some episodes, timmy talks back and acts spoiled and snobbish. wanda apparently is smart and wise. cosmo is stupid, dumb and incapable of thinking as is timmy's dad. timmy's mom seems to end up doing whatever timmy's dad does.<br /><br />the show is too far flung from reality to get my likings anymore. maybe as a younger kid, i could see more of the humor in this show, but as i grow up, it really grows old. and not to sound conceded or "trashing" but the show does have that mentality that makes you want to commit homicidal activity towards the characters. a show like this just has to be your attitude, if you know what i mean. if not, it basically disgusts you.
