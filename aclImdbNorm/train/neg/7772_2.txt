this is one lowly film. it has no real plot. we never are made privy to motivations, other than wealth. the characters are some of the worst actors ever to be put on film. the threat seems to be supernatural, but then it's being controlled by these three older people. why are they doing what they are doing; in order to strike fear into other members of the group? i don't know. there is some mist from a fog machine that rolls around in the halls and everyone seems to be scared of it. does it do something? i don't know. there's some nudity for its own sake. i'm always surprised to see this in films this old. things have actually settled down in this regard these days. anyway, the people run around like chickens, ready for the ax. they have no plan; no resources; no nothing. there are about five silly climaxes in the film. who are these people and "is" there a ghost or demon. what happened to the other people? i challenge anyone to tell me this with any confidence. what a mess.
