when i had first heard of "solar crisis" then got a load of the cast, i wondered why i had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before. then i saw it.<br /><br />now i know.<br /><br />for a movie that encompasses outer space, the sun, vast deserts and sprawling metropolises, this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature; it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera won't have to pull too far back.<br /><br />and the effects, while good, are pretty underwhelming; we're talking about the imminent destruction of the planet earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare. but other than shouting, sweating and a red glow about everything, there's no real feel of emergency.<br /><br />don't get me started about the cast. what heston, palance, matheson, boyle, et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is anyone's guess. makes you wonder who else's condos aren't paid for in hollywood....<br /><br />and as far as the end goes.... well, let's just say it's tense and intriguing but it's too little too late in an effort like this. if it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film, maybe i would have heard of "solar crisis" sooner.<br /><br />two stars. mostly for lost opportunities and bad career moves. <br /><br />i wonder how alan smithee keeps his job doing junk like this?
