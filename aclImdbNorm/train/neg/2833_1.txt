with a bo derek movie, the audience get just what they expect. a paper thin plot and a few shots of mrs. derek in no clothes. 'ghosts can't do it' is just that. the first fifteen minutes is ordinary tv drama, as long as scott [anthony quinn] is still alive. he is a very good actor with long experience in a lot of different roles, but it seems as even a famous actor need to work just for money sometimes. bo derek is the opposite, always playing a strikingly handsome young woman with or without clothes. the movie is a complete waste of time. if you want to see quinn, rent lawrence of arabia or la strada. if you want to see nude women or bad acting, rent any porno movie.
