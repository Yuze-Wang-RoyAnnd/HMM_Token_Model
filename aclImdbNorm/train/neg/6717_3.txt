this was god awful. the story was all over the place and more often than not i was confused because of horrible editing. i felt no sympathy for anyone because their characters were not developed enough. they were extremely superficial people with no dimension. cheesy, cheesy stereotypes with subplots that went nowhere. the stripper chick was just a distraction, even if she was decent looking. i don't know what this was attempting to be, but how shocked was i when they showed this trash on sundance? i almost cancelled my subscription. you'd think a channel like that would show more quality films. there are much, much better gay and lesbian themed films out there. "the celluloid closet" is an excellent documentary. i thoroughly enjoyed "wigstock: the movie". i'm sure there are others that have slipped my mind at the moment, but what i'm trying to say is that this just wasn't worth it. if you catch it on tv, ok, but otherwise don't bother.<br /><br />there were maybe three or four shots that looked really nice (sad i can count them on one hand), otherwise the cinematography was pretty crappy as well. the lighting was way off in a lot of places. i think some of the effects were used to try and add to something that just had practically nothing going for it.<br /><br />i can't deny johnny rebel is pretty hot (without the blond hair of course). too bad his acting did nothing for me. stick with real porn, buddy.<br /><br />3/10.
