the twilight zone has achieved a certain mythology about it--much like star trek. that's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner. they are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show. because of this, a while back i reviewed all the original star trek episodes (the good and the bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. now, it's time to do the same for the twilight zone.<br /><br />while i have scored many episodes 10, this one gets a 3 simply because it was bad. the writing was in fact embarrassingly bad. two people from opposing sides in a great war are seen wandering about through the entire episode. after a while, it's apparent that they are the only two people left on earth--as you learn in the really stupid and totally unconvincing conclusion. usually the twist at the end makes the episode great--this one killed it!
