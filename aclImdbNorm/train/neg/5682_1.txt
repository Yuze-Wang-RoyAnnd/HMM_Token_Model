this movie is unbelievably ridiculous. i love horror movies, but this is the worst one i've ever seen. i am a huge fan of gore, but most of the deaths in this movie aren't shown. it just shows us the already dead bodies, and the only death scenes that they actually show in this movie are terrible. the graphics look so obviously fake. the actors are awful as well. there is no real emotion from any of them. not only did i waste my time watching this piece of sh*t movie, but i had to subject myself to actual footage of animals being beaten during the beginning of it. if i could rate this a -10, i would. f*ck this movie. it's crap. <br /><br />don't watch it.
