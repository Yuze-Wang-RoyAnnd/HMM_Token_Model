battlestar gallactica was so great because it had tight writing, a great look, excellent actors, and interesting stories... and yeah, had hot men and women running around in and out of uniform.<br /><br />caprica was just lazy. lazy writing. actors smoking up a storm to give them "character." outdoor sequences that ruin the feeling of being somewhere else (yes, that is a ford focus sitting in the background). lots and lots of teenage angst. lots of gyrating naked women (but in the background. which i'm sure will be cut for the series) and a token view of some men in towels. none of the actors except polly walker took my attention at all. at an hour and a half, i was still wondering when it was going to be over.<br /><br />so what exactly is it that's supposed to bring me back? the science fiction? it's awfully light on that. the actors? besides polly walker's fine turn, there isn't much interesting being done here. there aren't even any "hotties" in the cast, except for maybe esai, although for the younger set he's pretty old, since he's over 25.<br /><br />i loved bsg. i was skeptical when i heard about caprica, and unfortunately, i think i'm right. i predict a very short run for it as a series unless they really sharpen their pencils over at scifi and get to work making this more than the oc on another planet.
