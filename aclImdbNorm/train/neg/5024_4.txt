there's not much to say about this one. gammera is some kind of fire breathing turtle. he is loosed by a nuclear explosion. he heads for land and begins to destroy building and tanks and other junk (oh yeah, power lines. i almost forgot). at one time, early in the film, he befriends a little boy, and instead of just throwing him away, or squashing him, he places him down on the ground. safe. from then on we have to watch this chubby faced little twerp show up and run away, show up and run away, show up and run away. for some reason, gammera is able to hear this kid from 20,000 feet away. oh, well, the plot is to try to get gammera to get to a place where he can be put on board a rocket and shot into space. as usual, the monster is lumbering and uncoordinated (a guy in a gammera suit). the japanese army (with the help of americans), uses up enough ammunition and fire power to solve the national debt, and, of course, it does no good. they should know this anyway. we've seen a lot of monsters stomp on tokyo. not to put these down because they can be fun, but it's really not very good.
