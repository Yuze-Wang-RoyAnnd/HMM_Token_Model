i went to see this film yesterday and although i didn't have high hopes for this film, i was still bitterly disappointed! i actually cant believe i spent 96 minutes of my life watching this film...it was that bad!!! the storyline was disgraceful and the acting was terrible (even though it had big names such as uma thurman in it). this film heavily relied on its special effects...but they personally had no effect on me. i honestly wished id never watched it and i strongly warn everyone against seeing this film. it is a total waste of money and you'll only end up being disappointed afterwards. my advice is to save your money, go shopping, treat yourself, just don't go and see this film... you'll live to regret it lol!
