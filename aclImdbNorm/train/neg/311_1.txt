i just finished watching going overboard. i have to say that we should send every copy of this film to iraq and make them watch. i even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min. adam sandler could not find a better project than this? as for the writing, if thats what you want to call it, those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell!! i believe that somewhere i read that the budget for this film was $10,000 and they were way under. did wallmart get a good deal on this? every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor. the only good thing about this movie is you can use the dvd as a coaster, or trade it to a friend, but then they might not be your friend anymore!!
