mmm, doesn't a big stack of pancakes sound good? maple syrup and fruit preserves on top. take a bite. mmmmmmm. take another bite. another. another. eat. eat it, you!!! keep shoveling it down your throat until your face turns green with nausea. you have just had the ally mcbeal experience.<br /><br />i stumbled on this show in the winter of '98 and was instantly hooked. like that stack of pancakes, i gorged myself on it. but the enjoyment soon wore off, because the ally mcbeal character (whom we see to be cute & endearing at first sight) soon becomes the most annoying, insecure, whining complainer you've ever met. (call me a feminist, but i prefer my female leads to have a spine.) the gags & gimmicks of the show also become hackneyed, the music of vonda shepherd (which is really shoved in your face) becomes grating, and the incessant character changes & rewrites make the show into a damn soap opera.<br /><br />my advice to you is to take this show in small doses, and quit as soon as it becomes bothersome (and it will). i made it through 2.5 seasons before my enjoyment had totally soured. it was good while it lasted, but like a crazy, neurotic ex-girlfriend it just turned ugly after it had overstayed its welcome.<br /><br />and next time you go to ihop, skip the pancakes. order something healthy like the fruit cup. it'll sit with you much better.
