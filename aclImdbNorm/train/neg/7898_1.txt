when i saw this movie, i couldn't believe my eyes. where these hilarious creatures, dustbin muppets with big pointy teeth, really meant to be scary? or where they designed to have a good laugh (i sincerely hope so). if you watch carefully you can even see the strings operating them (better; dragging them across the screen). the whole was rather funny than scary and i had a good time watching the movie because i was amazed by its overall incapacity to have only one good part. it is one big joke from beginning to end and i believe this movie belongs into a new category: so unbelievable crappy you'll be laughing from beginning to end. (i'm not even gonna try to comment on the acting or all the other things)
