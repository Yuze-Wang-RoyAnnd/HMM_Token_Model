i was babysitting a family of three small children for a night and their mother gave me this to show for them having just grabbed it at wal-mart earlier in the week. all three children actually got physically ill while watching it. i'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate, or something they all had picked up from school, but really it could have been this film. absolutely disgusting. how any one can produce this caliber of trash is beyond me. fortunately, i turned off the film when i noticed the children were not responding and acting strangely. for any parents out there, i strongly advise you to refrain from letting young children view this movie.
