i've never been impressed by jd anyway, and final justice (which i hadn't seen prior to its mst3k airing) proves to be no exception. it's not that the character is any less likeable than mitchell: it's just that there's less that geronimo ("call me 'heronimo') to dislike.<br /><br />in fact, one suspects that mitchell and final justice were all schemes of a revenge-seeking agent of joe don's trying to get the "star" killed by inducing a heart attack.<br /><br />joe don must have found a new agent, since he's now graduated to "comic relief" in james bond movies. the problem is, it's hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters there, and his "serious" characters in his action-movies like this one.<br /><br />as for the plot...umm, what plot? they repeat the same set pieces so repeatedly you'll think you were watching groundhog's day 2. presumably, the fact they keep using the same scene of geronimo getting out of jail is supposed to be comic relief of some sort. ummm, yeah, whatever.<br /><br />on the plus side, the malta scenery is pretty gorgeous, so that kicked it up to a 2 for me. one suspects this flick set maltese tourism back a couple of decades, though.
