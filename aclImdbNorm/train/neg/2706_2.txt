yes, people are racist. people are even racist in college. that's a good point, and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times before in countless films. what sets higher learning apart from the pack is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most ham-fisted and predictable way possible, oh yeah it's in college too.<br /><br />this film deals with this problem of racism the way frankenstein deals with most problems, it bashes you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner. most of the characters are cartoonish, one-dimensional, caricatures (lesbian feminist, angry black man), that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible. instead of defying stereotypes this film is overpopulated with them. the angry black men feel cheated, feminists hate men, etc. (one feminist even holds a sign that reads "dead men don't rape." see what i mean?) i don't want to give anything away, but in this movie if someone seems like a shifty loner or a date rapist they'll probably behave exactly how you expect them to. the changes the characters go through seems obvious to everyone but the people in the movie. the big twist in the plot hinges on whether or not the violent neo-nazis will act like violent neo-nazis. i'll guess you'll just have to watch to find out what happens.<br /><br />another problem i have with this movie is that it's supposed to be "gritty" and "hard-hitting," but they make nazis the bad guys. i agree nazis are evil, but that's my point. everybody thinks nazis are bad; we're not breaking any new ground here. nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930's. the film doesn't challenge any viewpoints or make bold statements. it just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy, after-school-special like, manner. being anti-rape, anti-racist, and anti-nazi isn't exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issue.<br /><br />higher learning is predictable, cartoonish, and in a word stupid. avoid at all costs.
