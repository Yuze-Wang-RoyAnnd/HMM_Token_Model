this is the only film i've seen that is made by uwe boll, i knew that he is probably the worst director ever who always makes films based on video games also that "house of the dead" is one of imdb bottom 100. but i still wanted to watch it because i'm a huge fan of the game and i wanted to see what doe's the film have that makes it so bad. after watching it i do agree that it is crap, the movie had no story. in the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about (for a moment there i was wondering are the zombies brain-dead? or the girls are?) then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere & started attacking people later a woman started shooting them i mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes. is it supposed to be a comedy?, or horror? or both? before i knew it i fell asleep at the second half & woke up during the end credits so i did not manage to watch all of it, which is a good thing! the film is a true insult to the classic game, uwe boll please do not make any more films. thank you!
