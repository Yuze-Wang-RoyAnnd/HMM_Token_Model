i couldn't give this film a bad rating or bad review for two reasons: robin williams and toni collete. the film has the potential of being a thriller and there are some slight disturbing elements that lean to the psychological which was something the film could have focused a little on. robin williams plays gabriel noon, a storytelling night time deejay who is going through personal issues: his lover moves out and gabriel is having what seems to be a case of storyteller's block. one day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14-year old boy named pete boland (rory culkin). pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents. he lives with his adopted mother and social worker, donna boland (toni collette). gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with pete, but things seem strange when gabriel attempts to meet him and discovers the possibility that pete boland may not even exist. i won't go into detail because i don't want to spoil the film, but i will tell you this: it is quite predictable. fascinating atmosphere for telling a story and good performances from robin williams and toni collette, who i thought was the film's key character. collette is without question one of the most talented and loveliest actresses. her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very uncanny and i hope to see her win an oscar (hell, i think she might pull off getting a best supporting actress nod for this one if the script were a little better). the film starts off as a psychological thriller, but a predictable one at that. if your curious to know the film's ending and twists, then see the film otherwise i would rent another predictable thriller called "hide and seek".
