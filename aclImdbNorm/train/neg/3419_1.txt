ok, so, chuck norris somehow found a way to get this sequel produced. i have one question-why? who read this script and said, "sound's great! original!" this movie is regurgitated crap that i wouldn't tarnish my toilet bowel with. of course it is another story, following in the tradition of mia, invasion usa, walker, texas ranger, delta force and so on in which chuck norris, of course, is the one man who can same america from some bad guys. he doesn't even need a gun most times. it's stupid patriotic jargon that stales the mind. big surprise that the only one who will direct these norris film's is chuck's son eric. eric norris has primarily worked on all his father's films and tv shows. doesn't this strike anyone as a sign that he has no directing talent? afterall, he's directing the same people as before in the same stories as before...only difference is the characters' names. if this is supposed to make me patriotic and cheer for the usa, than our country is in much worse shape than i ever imagined. hopefully, this will be the nail in chuck norris's acting coffin.
