this movie shows us nothing original. every idea or (action) scene can be found in many previously released movies. fabulous nick is completely plain here. even will patton is calm and evil nor good. mr. duvall is ok, but has a very small part. so does angelina, so how can we determine her newly acclaimed stardom? overall, there are too many characters, so that nobody and nothing is especially detailed. this makes the movie easy to forget. too bad, don't you think?
