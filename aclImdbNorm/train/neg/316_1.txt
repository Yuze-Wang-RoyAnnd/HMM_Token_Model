this movie is by far the worst movie ever made. if you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays lars in heavyweights than don't make the damn film. i have to say that i could watch leprechaun in space 6 times before i could watch the trailer for this pos of a movie. adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace. watching this movie is like a mix of listening to cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender. anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime. if i had an extra dollar and had to spend it, i'd give it to the support lorraina bobbitt foundation before buying this movie.
