this film's kind of like conan the barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. there is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers don't do a good job showing it, which is a shame because it 'could' be a decent story. richard hill gives a solid performance in the lead role, as does the villain - who sadly didn't appear in anything else of note. the fight scenes aren't too bad either - i love the way deathstalker lets his sword 'drink' the blood of his victims - and there's plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout. <br /><br />all in all, not good - but not necessarily that bad either...
