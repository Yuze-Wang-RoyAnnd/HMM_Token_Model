you could say that the actors will make a movie, but this clearly proves that statement wrong. most of the characters in this film lack anything to hold on to. they play the part of cardboard cut outs being moved about in predictable and uninteresting ways. the story is very simple. it could be summed up in a few words, but i'll hold back in case anyone reading does want to see this film.<br /><br />i had to fast forward the parts where jack showed us how to be an obnoxious eater. i'd have to say that 70% of this film revolved around cooking, eating, or getting ready to eat. quite frankly, i'd rather not spend my time watching jack chew noisily with an open mouth. personally, i could have done without the footwear references and jokes that pepper the first half of the film too.<br /><br />outside of my own personal dementia, the film really lacked anything worth it's time. there were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like it was dragging. when something happens, the reactions of the characters are vague and dry.<br /><br />best not to look this one up.
