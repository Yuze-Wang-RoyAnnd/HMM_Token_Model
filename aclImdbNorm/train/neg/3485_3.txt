this movie was pretty absurd. there was a few funny parts. its goes right in to the bin of movies in my memory where i think, "hmm.....that movie had a few funny parts, but overall, pretty ridiculous plot (or lack of)."<br /><br />i thought it seemed like ben was trying a little too hard to be a cooky funny guy. and i didn't understand how he was a self made multi-millionaire and still such an idiot. anyways, i like ben affleck. he makes some crap, but hey, i can forgive him. i mean, i liked jersey girl, i didn't think gigli was all his fault, i like him overall. i guess he's kinda like the kid you feel sorry for cuz he just can't seem to get it right.<br /><br />my advice would be to avoid this flick. it didn't really develop in to a workable plot and catherine o'hara and jimmy g. weren't used as well as they could have been. they deserved better. overall, this movie is not home alone, it's not a christmas story, its not christmas vacation or any of the other classics. forever forgettable.
