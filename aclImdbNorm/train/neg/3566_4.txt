now, i haven't read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here, so i'm not going to go down that path here.<br /><br />but i have some time ago learnt that stephen king movies simply -are not- horror films, with perhaps a couple of exceptions. this was not one of them. it started well enough, and for once i'm not going to complain about the acting, although fred gwynne was as usual wonderful.. also i will forgive the total lack of parenting skills, as they were necessary to make the story here move forward...<br /><br />but there was one consistent point that i couldn't help but get annoyed with. and that came pretty close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters partook in the activity of dumb stupidity. the moments i refer to are thus: there is a tiny zombie running around the house. you suspect it is under the bed. do you <br /><br />(a) get as close to the bed as you can before blindly raising the duvet cover up, exposing pretty much your whole body to whatever damage such a teeny undead cannibal might inflict on you, or <br /><br />(b) move a little away from the bed so you can peer under the completely open end from a position of slightly increased safety, or at least see the mini terror coming at you, giving you a little reaction time.<br /><br />i know, let's go with (a). i feel like offering myself up for the slaughter today. bleh<br /><br />fun enough film though... just not very scary.
