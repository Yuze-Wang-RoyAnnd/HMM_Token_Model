just so that you fellow movie fans get the point about this film, i decided to write another review. i missed a few things out last time...<br /><br />first, the script. second, the acting. third, jesus christ what were they thinking making a piece of garbage like this and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redeeming features whatsoever from beginning to end except when joseph fiennes finally gets blown away in a very unexciting climax!!!<br /><br />i can't believe i wasted my money on this when i could have given it to a homeless person or a busker or something!<br /><br />are you getting the picture?
