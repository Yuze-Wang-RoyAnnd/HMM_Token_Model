i looked forward to watching this film and then realised that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was swamped by the unnecessary swearing. now i am not a prude in any way, but to shout obscenities at each other does not a good film make. ewan bremner is arguably one of the worst actors in the world at this time (witness his performance in the god awful life of stuff) & his "cockney" accent is almost as bad as his edinburgh accent. avoid. how many more of these films "kiss kiss bang bang", "beautiful creatures" do we have to suffer before the film makers realise that the f-word, the c- word etc does not replace proper dialogue.
