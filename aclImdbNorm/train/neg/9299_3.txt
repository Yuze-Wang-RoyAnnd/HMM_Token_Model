while i watched this movie, i tried to figure out why they bothered making it. though the main plot of the movie is potentially good, there are all sorts of unrelated/unnecessary subplots. the marketing people in hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys, perpetual double-crosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex. it's odd that we see more of them having sex than we did of the president and his mistress. the many plots and subplots make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed - i really didn't feel like i knew any character, except that everyone is corrupt and evil. the ending is totally incomplete - it left me more than just wanting what might have been, but what was supposed to be. in the end, there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do, except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double-cross. i'm surprised that so many established (and good) actors agreed to make such a hollow movie. this seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project.<br /><br />don't waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie.
