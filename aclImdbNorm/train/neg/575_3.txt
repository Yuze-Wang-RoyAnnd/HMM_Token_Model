this movie isn't very good. it's boring, and not much blood for a horror film. the plot just trods along with not much happening. and i think the female vampire was so stupid. she had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes. but, whenever she has one of them pinned, she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them. no wonder this went straight to cable.<br /><br />final verdict: not anywhere near as good as the first vampire movie. you're a sucker if you waste your time on this.
