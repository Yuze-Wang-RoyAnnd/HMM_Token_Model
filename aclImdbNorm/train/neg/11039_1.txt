all the funny things happening in this sitcom is based on the main character jim being either a bad father, a bad husband or generally just enormously selfish. how can that be funny? of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed, but jim's character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic manner.<br /><br />and why it that? my guess is that it's because "he should now better". jim's not a stupid guy, he can take care of things and he's got the opportunities to do so. but he chooses not to. it's a conscious choice he makes, when he chooses to not play with his kids, not go shopping because he doesn't want to buy "lady products" and it's a choice he makes, when he puts down his relatives.<br /><br />the other characters seems to only be in the series so jim can have someone to be a jerk to. if the cheryl character was a real person, she would have left him years ago, and not stay with the deadbeat for 8 years. but alas, she's just a catalyst for jim's quirky middle-class extreme selfishness.
