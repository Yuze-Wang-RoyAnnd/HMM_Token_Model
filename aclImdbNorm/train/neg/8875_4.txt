if this is someone's "favorite" movie, they need some serious help. there is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest. i haven't seen the original movie this is the remake of (some 1950s film), but it simply has to be better than this newer bastardization.<br /><br />a major gets kicked out of the military for being a fringe element, and winds up teaching children at an rotc school. unfortunately, the major is daman wayans... so the children are in for a world of annoying, humorless asininity. can wayans whip these losers into shape? can they get him to become a little more human? the film bombs as most wayans films do, with only a few sparkling moments. william hickey gets about one minute of screen time, fair too little. this charming old man (known best to me as a "tales from the crypt" actor, known best to you as uncle louis from "christmas vacation") shines every moment he's on screen, which isn't much here.<br /><br />bam bam bigelow also makes an appearance as a biker, which fits him perfectly. i wouldn't mind slightly more bam bam, but i think he carried the role of "biker" about as far as it could be carried for a military film.<br /><br />and then there's the attractive teacher, who someone falls for major payne even though he treats the kids poorly, has no social skills and is simply impossible to convert into someone you would want to spend time with. she must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. i'm not sure which (though it would seem "stupid" since the movie makes it clear she gets out of the house often enough).<br /><br />wayans had one shining moment: a dance sequence where he performs a series of moves (including a very nice "robot"), and with the help of music from 2 live crew. this scene was enjoyable but hardly made up for anything else that made this film dog spittle.<br /><br />seriously, avoid this film. if you want to see a film a bout a loser who helps loser kids become heroes, rent or buy "ernest goes to camp". at least he's a lovable loser, and actually funny. maybe if major payne had fought a badger i'd feel better, but he didn't. forget payne, forget wayans... you can do so much better.
