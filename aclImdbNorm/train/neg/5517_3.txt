i'm only rating this film as a 3 out of pity because it attempts to be worthwhile. i love to praise a great movie and i'm not biased toward "male" movies. legally blonde was an excellent film. georgia rule on the other hand, was a disorganized, weak, poorly written, unrealistic example of movie making at its worst. by the end of the film i didn't care who was lying or if anything was resolved. <br /><br />the most important thing in a film is a good story. this story is weak and never develops (just because the subject matter is deep, doesn't mean the story is good). a good story has dynamic characters. a dynamic character is one that experiences a major character change, and is primed for that change over the course of the movie. in georgia rule, the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped. secondly, there were too many attempted dynamic characters. pulling off a really good dynamic character is a tough job and takes time (you've only got a couple hours in a movie). that means that too many attempted dynamic characters will get too little attention to their personal change. even if i ignore the poorly written story, and the litter of weak dynamic characters, i can't even say i liked anyone. every character was a mess. that's fine if your're writing american beauty but not when you're attempting a dramatic comedy. georgia was a horrible mother, her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter, and lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being (no i'm not cutting her any slack because she was molested, crap happens to everyone and we're all responsible for our own actions). the "dudley do right" mormon kid should have had the guts not to compromise his religion and commitments...and simon, i mean seriously, what kind of guy lets a 17 year old girl who's been molested just stay over occasionally (unless he's an actor or a politician). this movie is worth watching if you want to remind yourself what good movie making is not!
