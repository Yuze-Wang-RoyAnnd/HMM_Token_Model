this is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the united states. (we are still working on it too.) however despite the fact this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. i realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. the only one even mediocre is the excellent ossie davis. but even he couldn't make up for all the actors (including the one playing him as a young man) absolutely atrocious acting. granted the script was terribly clich'e, but even then you have got to get some decent actors! i wouldn't recommend this to anybody because it is so poorly done in every category. read some books about the true story of the u.s.s mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.
