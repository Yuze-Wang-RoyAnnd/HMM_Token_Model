i watched this movie as a preview of a matthew barney art exhibit. it certainly prepared me. i almost skipped the exhibit and, in retrospect, probably should have.<br /><br />aside from the score being great (bjork) and the photography rich and colorful, the content was mostly tedious and predictable. gee, i really needed to see someone wearing pearls to figure out what the pearl-divers were up to. the film was mostly a silly mixture of japanese cultural references and industrial shots of modern whaling technology being used in a mock-hunt/harvest. the film "peaks" with enough gratuitous shock-art to turn your stomach.<br /><br />what was the point of the movie? while others might argue that it is an anti-whaling piece, one could equally argue that it somehow also justifies whaling. personally i think it was barney's attempt at "flashing" the audience with his anal, fecal, self-mutilation, and cannibalistic fetishes.<br /><br />bottom line: unless you really get off on barney's sense of art, don't bother seeing this movie. the message is obscure, the pace slow, and the cultural references pretentious. if you're after shock-art, you'll do better at one of the many "undead" movies or hunting down an old copy of hustler and taking in a fecal-cartoon.
