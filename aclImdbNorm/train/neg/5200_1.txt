this movie is very very very poor. i have seen better movies. <br /><br />there was a bit of tension but not much to make you jump out of your chair. it begins slowly with the building of tension. which is not a success. at least if you ask me. though at some points or moments i must say it was a bit funny when people got shot and how they went down.<br /><br />they should had made it something like scary movie, then it might be a better movie. because i watched only pieces of the movie by skipping scenes and it got to boring through out the movie. i must say that i felt sleepy watching this movie so i sure can say it is not worth it.<br /><br />don't waste time on even thinking to do something with this movie besides leaving it where it already is. somewhere very dusty..
