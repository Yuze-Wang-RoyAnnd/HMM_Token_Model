"it's like hard to like describe just how like exciting it is like to make a relationship like drama like with all the like pornographic scenes thrown like in for like good measure like, and to stir up like contro- like -versy and make us more like money and like stuff." - ellen, the lost quote.<br /><br />"kissing, like, on the, like, mouth and stuff" is like the best like artistic endeavor like ever made. watching like ellen's hairy arms and like chris masturbating was like the height of my years-long movie-viewing experience and stuff. but before i like begin like breaking new u.s.-20-something-airhead records with the my "likes", let me like just briefly list like the high- like -lights of this visual like feast: <br /><br />1. chris doing the deed with his genitals. and not just that: the way the camera (guided so elegantly by ellen and patrick) rewards the viewer with a full-screen shot of chris's fat white-trash stomach after he finishes the un-catholic deed - that was truly thrilling. i can in all honesty say that i've never seen such grace. chris, you should do more such scenes in your next movies, because that is exactly what we needed as a continuation of what that brilliant, brilliant man, lars von trier and his "idiots 95", started. a quick w*** and then a hairy, fat, white belly: what more can any movie-goer ask for?! needless to say, i can sit all day and watch chris ejaculate (in spite of the fact that i'm straight)... such poetry in motion. such elegance, such style. no less than total, divine inspiration went into filming that sequence - plus a solid amount of zen philosophy. even barbra streisand could not get any more spiritual than this.<br /><br />2. ellen's hairy, thick arms. the wobbly-camera close-ups, so skillfully photographed by our two directors of photography (i can't emphasize this enough), ellen and patrick, often caused confusion regarding the proper identification of the sex in question. there were several scenes when we would see a part of a body (a leg, arm or foot), yet it was often a guessing game: does that body-part belong to a man or a woman? naturally, chris and his fellow artists, ellen, patrick and whatsername, cast themselves on purpose, because their bodies were ideal for creating this gender-based confusion. it was at times hard to guess whether one is seeing a female or male leg. patrick is so very thin and effeminate in his movements, so hairless and pristine, whereas ellen and the other girl are so very butch, what with their thick legs and arms. brilliant. <br /><br />3. brilliant - especially the way that neatly ties in with the theme of role reversal between the sexes: so utterly original and mind-blowing. ellen behaves like a man, wants sex all the time, while her ex patrick wants to talk - like a girl. spiffing.<br /><br />4. ellen's search for a leftist mate. "he must love 'the simpsons', which is quite leftist." i am glad that the makers of this movie decided to break the long tradition of offering us intelligent leftists. ellen is such a refreshing - and realistic - change. the number of "likes" that she and her liberal friends manage to utter in less than 80 minutes is truly phenomenal (3,849, to be exact). they have managed to realistically transfer their real-life ineptness onto the big screen with a minimum of effort, and i applaud them for that.<br /><br />5. the close-ups of toes. plenty of stuff here for foot-fetishists, which i think is a very liberal, highly commendable way of reaching out to sexual minorities. after all, shoe- and foot- fetishists are offered so little in modern cinema, so it's nice to see that someone out there cares.<br /><br />kotm, or rather, klotlmas, offers more than meets the eye. it is not just a modest little film about shallow people engaging in hollow relationships while indulging in meaningless conversations. no, it's much more than that. it's about the light that guides all silly creatures; the guiding light that dominates the futile lives of various pseudo-artistic wannabes who just dropped out of film school, and plan to assault our senses with dim-witted drivel that will hopefully play well at pretentious festivals like sundance and cannes, enabling them to gain the necessary exposure hence some real cash for a change, with which they will later hire the likes of sean penn and george clooney in promoting the saving of this planet and the resolving of all political problems this world faces. what better way to do that than by making porn at the very start? <br /><br />if chris and ellen did the camera here, as is clearly stated in the end-credits, then who held the camera while the two of them were in front of it? they probably hired some passers-by and shoved the camera into their hands...<br /><br />go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~fedor8, and check out my "tv & cinema: 150 worst cases of nepotism" list.
