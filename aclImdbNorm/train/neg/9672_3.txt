while most of the movie is very amateurish, the kosher slaughter scene is played up, but not untrue. kosher law says that an animal must be conscious when the blade touches it's skin. the kosher slaughter scene is accurate as anyone knows who has seen one, or has seen the peta film showing a kosher slaughter, in which the animals throat is cut, and the esophagus cut out while it is still alive, conscious, and obviously suffering. we must remember that history is written by the victors. is one even allowed to even think that maybe the nazis were right??<br /><br />doesn't it say anything that the nazis had outlawed this vicious religious slaughter, and the jews are still practicing it even today?
