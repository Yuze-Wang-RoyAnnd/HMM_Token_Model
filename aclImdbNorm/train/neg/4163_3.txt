i see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their side of the story, and i thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it. the fact that they basically came up with excuses -- rewrites, budget constraints, production formats etc -- simply underlines how bad this movie is. and my criticisms in panning it are not personally directed but simply a warning that this one doesn't make the cut.<br /><br />it's watchable, but barely so. there are plot holes in every corner, the dialogue borders on the ridiculous, and the ending is telegraphed a mile away. the modestly interesting feature of a hologram interacting with a recon team get drowned in silly dialogue like who makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. would ya wrassle us up some hamburger helper sally, between us getting killed by these automated carpet sweepers? apparently this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tubed wonder armor has no access to mres. once they get into the last rooms they treat the place more like a four star motel than a deadly encounter zone.<br /><br />the rationale for the encounter with the fearsome rook is that it can't be killed single handedly. yet only one scene ago, the hero making that case abandoned king to do exactly that. huh? vivian woo was attractive and hands down the best acted character in the movie. but that's not saying much.
