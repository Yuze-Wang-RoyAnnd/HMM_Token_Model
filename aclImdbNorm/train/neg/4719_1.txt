i just want to say that this production is very one sided, breaks the impartiality needed if you want to be taken seriously. <br /><br />there are no credits of the persons they interviewed, so you cant have an idea if they are worthy of being heard.<br /><br />tells the story from just one point of view. to do this is very dangerous, because the next generations learns the bad idea, and thats why wars keep coming. i know this is not the only reason about wars, but doesn't help either.<br /><br />you can watch this documentary, but read in the internet a lot, before. balcans are complex as human history is.
