i just finished reading a book on anita loos' work and the photo in tcm magazine of macdonald in her angel costume looked great (impressive wings), so i thought i'd watch this movie. i'd never heard of the film before, so i had no preconceived notions about it whatsoever. thought it got off to a cute start with eddy as the playboy and macdonald as the secretary he doesn't know exists. the scene where she shows up at the costume party in her simple angel outfit with an uncooperative halo and wings that won't stay on was really endearing. i was even with the film when eddy goes to sleep and imagines her as a real angel. but after a while it just started to fall apart for me. eddy stays "asleep" for the entire rest of movie, so it's all a dream. whatever happens from there on doesn't really matter, because he's just dreaming. the rest of it was pretty much plot less and pointless. i had to force myself to stick with it. and the final number where macdonald goes from musical number to musical number in some mad hallucination was just plain freaky.<br /><br />had eddy "woken" a sooner and the original story continued, or had he really married an angel, i think it would have been a lot more interesting. i wanted to see more of her real character.<br /><br />there weren't really enough musical numbers to call it a musical. the first few songs were good, but the jitterbug number that macdonald performs was like nails on a chalkboard. completely wrong for her operatic voice. even so, eddy and macdonald still manage to shine, showing what true stars they were.
