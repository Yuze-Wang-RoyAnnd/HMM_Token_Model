what can you say about this movie? it was not terrible, but it was not good! two days earlier i had watched lillies and that was one of the best gay films i have ever seen. so this was not the best time to watch a mediocre gay flick.<br /><br />the story was silly and the acting was ok. it was not bad enough to turn off, but it had some bad moments and some terrible stereotyping. it was not very well cast either.<br /><br />would i recommend this movie? no you would be wasting your time and money. i don't understand why movies like these are made and who is funding them. spend your time watching noah's arc on logo instead. i think this is where this movie was trying to go but never got there.
