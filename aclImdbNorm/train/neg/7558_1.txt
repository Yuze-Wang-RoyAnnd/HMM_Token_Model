what ever you do do not waste your time on this pointless. movie. a remake that did not need to be retold. everyone coming out of the theater had the same comments. worst movie i ever saw. save your time and money!!!<br /><br />nicgolas cage was biking down hills, swimming in murky water and rolling down hills while being attacked by bees but yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and shirt crisp white until the very last scene.<br /><br />although a good cast with ellen bernstein and cage the acting was just as unbelievable as the movie itself. it is amazing how good actors can do such bad movies. don't they get a copy of the script first. if you still have any interest at all in seeing the movie at the very least wait for it to come out on dvd.
