it felt like i watched this movie thousand times before.it was absolutely predictable.every time the story tried to get a bit twisted,every time i awaited something interesting to happen, i saw nothing but what i expected. like "the bread factory opened up another facility,because there was not enough bread". in two words:flat story,that has become a clich'e,bad acting,bad special effects...only the dumb russian cop,vlad, was a bit funny while punishing around the bad guys.the pile of muscles was so incredibly stupid,that it made me laugh at him for a moment. i wonder why i waste my time spitting on that shame-of-a-movie... it won't get worse (because it is not possible) :d
