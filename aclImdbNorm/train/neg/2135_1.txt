just utter trash. i'm a huge fan of the cusacks, this being the sole reason i watched this movie, but the only reason i can see for their presence was the reprise, in complete and depth less quality, their exact roles from grosse point blanc. apart from that, the films' role as a political satire fails miserably as being too obvious for even the most moronic out there to serve any purpose. and to bill it as a satirical satire would be just plain insulting even to chimps. imitation is, apparently the highest form of flattery, but seeing as though this is nothing near grosse point blanc and in the same league as meet the (watch if your a moron) spartans in terms of political satire, lets leave well enough alone and let this one fade into the obscurity it absolutely deserves.
