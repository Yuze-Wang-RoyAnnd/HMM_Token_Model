first of all this movie starts out on a really dumb note: a 10-year-old girl, playing around in a moving vehicle, decides it would be funny to cover up her mom's eyes with her hands, and then causes a horrific accident which kills the mom....duh....i am sorry, there is positively no 10-year-old that dumb. the rest of the movie does not get much better. after the death of the mother by the apparent dumbest 10-year-old on the planet, the dad moves the family to genova, italy, where he is to teach at a local university, but here is the clincher: he does not speak a word of italian! then the little girl has "visions" of mommy (who she killed), and often subsequent night terrors which always, always end by the father holding and coddling her. then we are forced to watch this family continually get lost and then found and then hug and then cry and lost and then found (followed by of course more hugging and crying) to the point that i was actually wishing for some sort of natural disaster to just wipe all of these vapid, ignorant people off the planet. do not get me wrong, because i love indies, but an indie about dumb people (and i mean really dumb) is simply ridiculous and pointless. it is really a shame that this movie was based on such insipid characters wallowing in such retarded scenarios, because the locale was interesting.
