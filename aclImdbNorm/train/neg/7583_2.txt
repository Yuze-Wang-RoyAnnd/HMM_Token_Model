david lean's worst film. even 'in which we serve' was'nt as bad as this. usually a film with a really good reputation like this one, has at least some redeeming qualities, which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic. but after watching this i just could not get why this piece of crap was liked so much even back in 1945! i disliked the acting, stiff upper lip british mannerisms, story, script (which may be quite witty at times but totally unfunny) and soundtrack. the elvira character is meant to be alluring and attractive, but was in actual fact ugly and had a weird and annoying voice. just another film that has convinced me not to trust a films reputation. another very overrated 'british classic'.
