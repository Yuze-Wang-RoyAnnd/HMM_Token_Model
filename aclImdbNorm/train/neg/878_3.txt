i can only believe that garson kanin must have been two people. the one who wrote the brilliant "a double life" and the funny "born yesterday" and co-wrote such excellent screenplays as "adam's rib" and "pat and mike" with his wife ruth gordon and then the one who wrote and/or directed such tiresome, sad drivel as "bachelor mother", "some kind of a nut", and this. the cast tries, but the script is so tired and clich'ed that even the efforts of the always wonderful brenda vaccaro are defeated. the script sinks to it's nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which janssen's character tests drivas's character to make sure he's not gay. an ugly sequence, but sadly one which could easily play in a film today. "ethnic" jokes are now totally verboten, but "fag" jokes are still "good, clean, family fun".
