not long enough to be feature length and not abrupt enough to a short, this thing exists for one reason, to have a lesbian three-way. there are worse reasons to exist. one sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature length movie. misty fits snuggly into her outfit and is a very cocky girl and when people are so infatuated with a game character, like lara croft, that they make nude calenders of her, you know that a soft-core flick is set to explode. unfortunately, this is pretty pathetic. especially the painfully fake sex scene between darian and misty, where you can see her hand is fingering air. watch this if you just can't get enough of misty or ruby, who makes a nice blonde and has zee verst jerman akcent ever.
