i agree with those reviews i have read here, and i have no words to define such a turkey like this, but despite everything, i still can find a reason for movies like this to exist. do you remenber those happy days in which video was a prosperous business, and a lot of movies were made with the only reason of filling the shelves of the video stores? this movie comes from that period and i can imagine that was the only reason for which it was produced and the same happened with many, many, many other stinkers. do you remember "rambo" imitations? and so many slashers of z grade?, i still feel nostalgia for that period.about this movie i can say i didn't waste my time watching it because i pressed the fast forward button after the first fifteen minutes, just to find a very funny scene in which a guy was pushing an axe against heads which exploded because, as you perfectly notice, they were made of plastic. and about the end, well, it was so badly filmed i could not understand what happened. that's the same, i had not followed the non-existing plot at all. but boy, video-age was a great age despite movies like this.
