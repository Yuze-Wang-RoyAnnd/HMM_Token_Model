if you appreciate the renaissance in asian horror, don't bother with gawi. the film scarcely deserves mention alongside a-list work such as ringu, a tale of two sisters, cure, and ju-on (or even such good material as the eye or inner senses). those films brim with subtleties, unexpected imagery, rich characters, and a decidedly non-western take on what's frightening. gawi is strung together with the leftover limbs and organs of everything that has made american horror lousy for the past twenty-five years.<br /><br />the film tries to blend asian ghost story and hollywood slasher flick, but it's a bad fit. one aesthetic is bound to smother the other; guess which? having no story of their own to tell the filmmakers loot ringu for an evil-child subplot, but the situation is hopeless. clich'es, crap characters, witless plotting, a dull ghost, ho hum.
