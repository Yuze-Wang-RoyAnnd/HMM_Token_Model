we have a lake. we have an animated meteor crashing. we have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with flippers. okay, so let's call this movie the crater lake monster. what else can we add? hmm, two idiots called arnie & mitch to define the ultimate definition of "comic relief". we also got to have a sheriff who doesn't really do a damn thing in this film and whom nobody listens to. aw crap, we're over halfway through the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy! no worries, let's introduce some guy with a moustache, have him rob a store to indicate he's a bad guy, then have him pop up somewhere near the lake, have him chased through the woods and all this for the sole purpose of him ending up as dinosaur snack food. that should work.<br /><br />a complete, clumsy mess, this film. its logic will twist your mind to force laughter out of you. the first film to feature dave allen as a "stop motion supervisor". after this one, he joined forces with charles band for several years until the the mid-nineties, when band ran out of money to pay him, i guess. the dinosaur effects are charming and the whole film is pretty damn unintentionally funny. unfortunately, that's about the only good thing that can be said for it.<br /><br />good badness? yes. the mind-bending logic in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list. if not, arnie & mitch will do the trick. 3/10 and 8/10
