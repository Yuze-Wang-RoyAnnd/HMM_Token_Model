i simply cant understand why all these relics from the ceausescu era refuse to let go. one can see clearly how frustrated they were during the commie censorship that forbade them so many things to show in their movies, and now they imagine its dunno what big deal of artsy-fartsy freedom so fill the screen with people defecating, urinating, vomiting, swearing, and any other kinds of hideousness imaginable. this is not cinema, friends and neighbors! this is simply visual perversion. forget about bunuels chien andalou, about david lynch, about forman and neorealism and other movie makers who were able to work with an aesthetics of ugliness. those people were mastering their jobs - well, you don't! do us a favor, all you daneliucs and nicolaescus and saizescus and muresans and marinescus and margineanus and other obsolete old-timers, and leave us alone! its bit time to see some romanian movies on screen, enough with your immature terribilisms! you are not directors, you are illiterate!!!
