to be brutally honest... i loved watching severed. that's why i<br /><br />gave it a 1/10 stars because of its starkly unimaginative<br /><br />story/filming/acting/everything. this film was a riot to watch. if<br /><br />you enjoy watching bad films in order to poke fun at them, you will<br /><br />really get a kick out of severed.<br /><br />the story really doesn't matter, it involves some guy who's bald<br /><br />and has a sword and goes around beheading random people. <br /><br />but he has a supernatural twist... nobody ever sees him do it. <br /><br />even when, in one very memorable scene, he walks into a<br /><br />jampacked night club and whacks off some girl's noodle and<br /><br />nobody sees it. <br /><br />severed doesn't merely look like it was filmed on video- it was<br /><br />filmed on someone's home camcorder. the filmmakers had<br /><br />knowledge of lighting (very thin knowledge) and composition<br /><br />actually holds together in some scenes. but mostly you can't hear<br /><br />the actors... you can't understand what they're doing, and you laugh<br /><br />when the next vicitm gets his pumpkin detatched from his body.<br /><br />go and rent this movie. support films like this- they are a hoot and<br /><br />a hollar!
