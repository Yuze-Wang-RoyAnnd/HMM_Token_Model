...through the similarly minded antics of eric stanze. a not-particularly talented director has helmed a not-particularly good movie, yet i still found myself sitting through it to the closing credits, if for nothing more than to see what happens next.<br /><br />a rapist escapes from prison and calls up his old flame. after capturing her (even though she came willingly) and threatening her into having sex (another event she was also willing to do) he reveals that he has kidnapped three guys who wronged her in the past. he then decides to kill her (huh?) but is foiled and dies instead. the girl's mind snaps (or something like that) and she takes out her rage on the unlucky chaps in the basement.<br /><br />alright, the writing sucks: it's long winded, loaded with ten-cent words and there is way too much of it.<br /><br />the acting sucks: what a minute, what acting? <br /><br />the filming sucks: home video is bad enough, but 20 minutes of graveyard footage is just a damn insult.<br /><br />and the budget is a joke: get it...'budget', that was the punchline.<br /><br />and yet there was a charm to the thing. back in the 70's these kind of movies came out in theatres with actual budgets and talent attached to them, not in this day and age though. if you want to watch this kind of violent, sexually exploitive trash (don't lie, some of us do) then this is all your gonna get nowadays.<br /><br />some brief hardcore shots in a sex scene, torture with fecal material, fun with axes, anal rape by broom stick and a lengthy shot of the crazy chick masturbating with the same broom stick are some of the better items on the menu.<br /><br />it's not good and it won't be remembered, but not since the heyday of joe d'amato have people made movies like this.<br /><br />4/10
