despite some occasionally original touches, like the "virtual sets" that provide the background for the victorian interiors featuring ada lovelace and her circle, this film falls short and ultimately disappoints. newcomer francesca faridany seems talented, but is wasted as emmy, a character who by mid-film is reduced to nothing more than staring at a monitor watching lady ada narrate an autobiography. 'conceiving ada' takes off briefly when lady ada (tilda swinton) appears; the camera lingers on her facial expressions, mannerisms, even making her appear to be translucent or momentarily invisible, apporting into scenes to dramatize emmy's "virtual" rendering of her.<br /><br />a straightforward biopic of ada lovelace would have been worthwhile, but this film unfortunately makes a hash of both lady ada's life, and that of a modern-day computer scientist (and her broadly-drawn, doltish boyfriend).
