this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen. the dvd was given to me free with an order i placed online for non dvd related items.<br /><br />no wonder they were given away, surely no one could part with money for this drivel.<br /><br />how some reviewers can say they found it hilarious beggars belief, the person who includes it in the worst five films ever has got it spot on.<br /><br />how on earth a talented actor like philip seymour hoffman could get involved in this rubbish is unbelievable. mostly toilet humour and badly done at that.<br /><br />anyone wanting to be entertained should avoid this at all costs.
