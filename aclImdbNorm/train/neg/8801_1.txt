pieced (edited) together from dead body parts (deleted scenes) from corpses (anchorman), the frankenstein monster (wake up, ron burgundy) is definitely not a sight for sore eyes (something you'd ever want to watch twice.....maybe even once for that matter.)<br /><br />more often than not -the relativity of the scenes in wurb are made relevant by a third person narrator. even more troubling is that the characters in wurb are inconsistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of anchorman (in opening narration we're told wurb takes place shortly after the original.) at the end of anchorman, burgundy had grown since the start of the film and embraced having a hybrid co-anchorwoman/lover. in this film, he's back to his immature antics with prank phone calls to veronica (quite clearly these are the more of the same scenes from the original anchorman spliced in to wurb.) <br /><br />the part that makes this a movie, a continually evolving story, involves a bank-robbing clan without a cause called the alarm clock. these scenes are almost painful to sit through. this part was scrapped from the original scripts for anchorman.<br /><br />the majority of other scenes involving our channel 4 news team are clearly alternate/deleted takes on scenes from anchorman. they go to the same party as in the original, the same original "group bitching about having a woman on the team" scene, and the same cat fashion show segment that veronica had objections to reporting.<br /><br />burgundy re-creates their first date with the drive-in spot overlooking san diego and dinner at his favorite club, tinos. neither character make mention that they've been to the drive-in spot before and when burgundy walks into tinos with veronica, he introduces it to her as though they've never been before. oh, and they're wearing the same clothes as on their original date.<br /><br />still, i have to give some credit to the filmmakers - even if wurb is nothing more than a clever way of presenting deleted scenes tied together with narration. between the two ron burgundy stories - this is the weaker one. looking back on it, it's quite a feat for anchorman to have risen from the ashes of wurb. you stay classy, imdb. thanks for stopping by.
