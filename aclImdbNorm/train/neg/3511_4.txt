'i'm working for a sinister corporation doing industrial espionage in the future and i'm starting to get confused about who i really am, sh*#t! i've got a headache and things are going wobbly, oh no here comes another near subliminal fast-cut noisy montage of significant yet cryptic images...'<br /><br />i rented this movie because the few reviews out there have all been favourable. why? cypher is a cheap, derivative, dull movie, set in a poorly realised bland futureworld, with wooden leads, and a laughable ending.<br /><br />an eerie sense that something interesting might be about to happen keeps you watching a series of increasingly silly and unconvincing events, before the film makers slap you in the face with an ending that combines the worst of bond with a duran duran video.<br /><br />it's painfully obvious they have eked out the production using dr who style improvised special effects in order to include a few good (if a little babylon 5) cgi set pieces. this sub fight club, sub philip k dick future noir thriller strives for a much broader scope than its modest budget will allow.<br /><br />cool blue moodiness served up with po-faced seriousness - disappointingly dumb. this is not intelligent sci-fi, this is the plot of a computer game.
