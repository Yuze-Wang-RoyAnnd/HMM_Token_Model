can a-pix ever, ever, ever do anything right? this movie was meant to be seen on tv in a letterbox format. since a-pix doesn't even believe in pan and scan, we see whole scenes where a shoulder on the left side of the screen talks to a shoulder on the right side. of course, not that you are missing much. this movie is incredibly bad. it's very hard to enjoy a film where characters are screaming at the top of their lungs during 80% of the movie for no reason.
