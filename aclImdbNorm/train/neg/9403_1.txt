this movie should not classify as cinema. although it is over 10 years old now, it should never, ever have gotten funding, and is a blight on the australian film industry, which is now producing such brilliant films as "the dish"<br /><br />the actors cannot act, the music is.. to be blunt, not music, the storyline is completely nonexistent and is a struggle to sit through.<br /><br />do not watch this film. it is a complete waste of your time.
