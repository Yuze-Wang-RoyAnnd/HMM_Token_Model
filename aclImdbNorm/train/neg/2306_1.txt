i find myself wondering what the people who gave this a 10 saw in it that i didn't. this movie has a very hard time following and/or staying to a plot. if someone tells you it's a comedy, don't be fooled, it's about 98% percent odd-drama and 2% comedy. all actors turn in a great performance, that cannot be denied, however it seems like it really lost something somewhere. don't know if the original script was good and it had to be edited down or what. this had potential, and instead it was really a flop. i would really like the hour and a half i invested in this movie back, but the video rental place doesn't do returns on time. save your money and see something else.
