this is just a butchering of a wonderful story by edwin torres. this movie doesn't follow the storyline in the book. and, there are so many inconsistencies with the original movie that you have to wonder if the screenwriter had even seen the first movie.<br /><br />al pacino (the original and still the best carlito) gets out of prison at the start of the original one. here, carlito retires with his woman in paradise. <br /><br />what happened to gail from lorain, ohio? in this installment, she isn't mentioned, and carlito retires with and presumably will marry some other girl.<br /><br />also, where is kleinfeld? i think he was in the first book.<br /><br />i also like how mr. guzman plays a totally different character in this film. he was pachanga back in the pacino days. now, he is nacho reyes, a killer from cuba. i remember that nacho reyes had a much bigger role in the book. <br /><br />it's been a while since i read the book, but where did sean comb's character come from? also, i think this movie really glosses over the racial tensions in harlem that torres was writing about. and, the mob doesn't get the treatment that they did in the book. they are also wiped out in this movie. but, magically the pleasant avenue bunch is around for the second movie.<br /><br />the book told a great story. this movie could have told a great story. this is just a huge disappointment. read the book. it's a better use of your time.
