this show is dull, lame, and basically rips off all sorts of various things in order to make it "original." first off: the animation is so ugly... johnny's hideous... and everyone's annoying. the twins look like teen female dexters from "dexter's lab," and johnny is almost like a more intelligent male dee dee (also from "dexter's lab.") secondly: the plots... are painfully lame, making them hard to follow. the gags are corny, and nothing really makes me feel compelled to laugh a little bit... especially when it tries to be funny. i only saw two episodes, but those alone turned me off.<br /><br />third off: the whole theme song starts off by ripping off the tune to green day's "american idiot." and, while i am not a big fan of that band, i find it really dumb that they would take the same opening melody, and then subtly change it, in order to make it their own.<br /><br />case in point... it's a big fat ugly bore. 1/10
