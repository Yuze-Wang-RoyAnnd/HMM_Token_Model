i am a catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns, taught by jesuit priests in high school & college. i am still a practicing catholic but would not be considered a "good catholic" in the church's eyes because i don't believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me to.<br /><br />so back to the movie...its bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead. there is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of diane keaton. i never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be good.<br /><br />at first i thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate sister mary's emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith. but it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedy...the tragedy of loss of life (besides the two former students...the lives of the aborted babies, the life of the student's mom), the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people, the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in god. this is what is wrong with today's islam, and yesterday's judaism and christianity.
