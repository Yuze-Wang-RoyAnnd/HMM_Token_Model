turkish cinema has a big problem. directors aren't interested in global cinema. they are local and folkloric, but want to be international. this brings kitsch results such this movie.<br /><br />film has jokes translated to spanish from turkish and they don't have any meaning for non-turkish audiences. even for turkish audiences after 10 years.<br /><br />players, even ferhan sensoy have a worse acting than average. they act like puppets.<br /><br />movie was shot in cuba, but nothing includes about cuba. so cuba is thought like a banana republic.<br /><br />waste of money, waste of time.
