from everything i'd read about the movie, i was excited to support a film with a christian theme. everything about the movie was very unprofessionally done. especially the writing! without good writing a movie doesn't have a chance. the writer/director said in an interview that he didn't want to give away how the title relates to the story. believe me, it was no big surprise. i kept waiting for the teenage/young adult back-story to unfold, but it never did. as someone who has gone through a divorce, i was very disappointed. this movie would have been no comfort to me when i first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a christian!
