in the third entry of the phantasm series, mike and reggie continue chasing the tall man, assisted by a trigger-happy 9 year old, a black g.i. jane and the spirit of mike's deceased brother (he died in the original phantasm). number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel, since the gore and black comedy is a lot less inspired and exciting as it was in phantasm ii. i got the feeling the stress was merely laid on reggie's incompetence as a lover and his talent as stand-up comedian. the humor in the previous film was a lot more dry and oppressed, which fits a story like this better. also, the settings aren't as macabre here, plus the constant presence of the tall man (agnus schrim) isn't as obvious
