antitrust could have been a great vehicle for rachael leigh cook, but the director cut out her best scenes. in the scenes that she are in, she is just a zombie. she is involved in a sub-plot that is simular to a sub-plot in "get carter", but she handles the sub-plot better in "get carter".(i blame the director) the director's homage to hitchcock was corny. (it's the scene were ryan philippe's charactor realizes he may not be able to trust tim robbin's charactor, at least i think it's a homage to hitchcock. the dvd shows the scenes that were cut out. i think the director should have trust his instincts and not listen to the test audiences.
