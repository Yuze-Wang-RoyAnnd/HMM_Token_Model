this is the last time i rent a video without checking in at the imdb reviews. the limey is directed by steven soderbergh who also wrote wrote the truly awful nightwatch with ewan macgregor and directed such trash as out of sight with the anti-talented jennifer lopez. terence stamp is a fine actor and it is a shame he involved himself in such a bad film. there is frequent confusing editing that seems like it was a last minute decision in order to make up for the lack or story, filming and just plain common sense. this film does everything wrong. what were they thinking?
