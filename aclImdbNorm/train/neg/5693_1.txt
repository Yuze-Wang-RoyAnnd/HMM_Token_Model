i can't believe the positive reviews of this movie - i thought it was one of the worst, most poorly executed and poorly acted movies i have ever seen. and the plot was completely ludicrous (sp?). she starts making out with him while he's tied to the chair? puh-lease. the worst part was that it wasn't even bad in a good, laughable way. just plain terrible - i couldn't figure out why they even bothered to show it on hbo. i thought belushi was ridiculously silly - very unbelievable as an "eccentric" hit man. idk, i could go on - again, i am shocked by the positive reviews. the only thing that kept me watching it is that it's fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad. and the ending didn't disappoint in its silliness either! "live by the sword, die by the sword..." ridiculous.
