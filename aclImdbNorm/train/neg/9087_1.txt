canadians are too polite to boo but the audience at the toronto film festival left the theater muttering that they would rate this film 0 or 1 on their voting sheets. the premise is that a modern filmmaker is interpreting a 17th century fable about the loves of shepherds and shepherdesses set in the distant past when druids were the spiritual leaders. working in three epochs presents many opportunities to introduce anachronisms including silly and impractical clothing and peculiar spiritual rites that involve really bad poetry. lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct from which cross-dressing and assorted farcical situations arise. the film could have been hilarious as a monty python piece, which it too closely resembles, but rohmer's effort falls very flat. the audience laughed at the sight jokes but otherwise bemoaned the slow pace. the ending comes all in a rush and is truly awful. this is a trivial film and a waste of your movie going time.
