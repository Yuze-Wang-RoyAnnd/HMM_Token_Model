my wife and i are semi amused by howie mandel's show.. i also like shatner - even when he's at his most pathetic..<br /><br />but this is absolutely the worst show on television.<br /><br />please cancel this show. it sucks a**.<br /><br />the only positive thing i can say is that the girls are hotter on this show and seem to wear less clothing than deal or no deal...<br /><br />the questions are a mixture of way too easy and incredibly obscure. and watching shatner or the contestant say "show me the money" makes me want to vomit..<br /><br />this one will not last.
