men, do i love police movies filled with action, shooting, chases etcetera.<br /><br />boy, was i let down after watching this short and unsatisfying movie. we've seen it all before, the hostages, the bank, the surrounding... yet, 2 bad guys that shoot down multiple officers and innocent people who simply stay in the line of fire - without getting hit due to some kevlar.<br /><br />not just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. going back into the bank, where the dumb hostages didn't lock the safe or doors when the bad guys went out. how stupid did the director think we'd be.<br /><br />okay, the shots in between that fake a documentary were good, but after seeing the film i only got the thought: why didn't the police get a decent shooting course? and why where there so many cops and was swat on a real long break. truly bad.
