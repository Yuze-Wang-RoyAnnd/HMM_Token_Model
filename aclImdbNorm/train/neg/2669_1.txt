i'm rarely moved to make a comment online about a film. but i can't understand how this one got made. who made it? how could they have possibly thought they were capable of making a feature film? did they do a weekend course at some film school, get a nice big cheque from daddy and kidnap david badiel's family one by one until he agreed to be in it? or was he by any chance a longtime family friend/distant relation doing this out of sheer, misplaced kindness? i don't care, don't want to know. even he looks utterly embarrassed to be in it, mumbling his lines and hiding his face from the camera. meanwhile the dop must have been the gaffer from neighbours, there seemed to be absolutely no sound design, the script, the direction and editing were all abysmal, and quite frankly the apathy that overwhelms me right now means that i can't be bothered to spend any more of my life thinking about this film.
