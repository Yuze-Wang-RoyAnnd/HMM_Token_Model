it's difficult to put into words the almost seething hatred i have of this film. but i'll try:<br /><br />every other word was an expletive, the sex scenes were uncomfortable, drugs were rampant and stereotyping was beyond the norm, if not offensive to italian-americans.<br /><br />i'm not saying the acting was terrible, because leguizamo, sorvino, brody, espisito et. al, performed well. but...almost every character in the film i despised. not since the bonfire of the vanities have i disliked every character on screen.
