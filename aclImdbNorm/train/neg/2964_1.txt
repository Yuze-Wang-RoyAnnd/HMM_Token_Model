laughed a lot - because it is so incredibly bad - sorry folks, but definitely one of the worst movies i have ever seen... i know it is low budget, but anyway: the actors behave like playing in a soap, the dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time i have seen such odd pictures was at a trash nite at some youth video festival ten years ago. i really appreciate that people gather together and shoot cheap movies, but at least a certain amount of quality should be accomplished. but at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the movie were quiet interesting and looked okay - and the score was really worth listening to. the dvd cover promised a lot, but that is by far the best this film has to offer...
