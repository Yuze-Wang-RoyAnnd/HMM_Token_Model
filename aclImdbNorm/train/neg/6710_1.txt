i have seen over 1000 movies and this one stands out as one of the worst movies that i have ever seen. it is a shame that they had to associate this garbage to the angels 1963 song "my boyfriend's back." if you have to make a choice between watching this movie and painful dental work, i would suggest the dental work.
