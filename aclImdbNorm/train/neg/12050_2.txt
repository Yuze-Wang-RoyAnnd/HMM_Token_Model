i had read a few positive reviews of this film, and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was. positioned as some cross between an aids-related story and some kind of "ghost"/"blithe spirit" tale, this film can't always make it's mind up what it wants to be. <br /><br />simon and mark are a gay couple who have an "open" relationship - simon is able to have anonymous (though safe) sex on the side when he wants. mark is hiv+ and he and simon don't seem to have a sex life anymore. when mark dies, simon - who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father - tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor. not that his behavior before mark's death was much different. but mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts, while getting simon to open up and admit his true feelings.<br /><br />unfortunately, simon is such a selfish sob, it's impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film. by the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic, it's too late to care. mark, on the other hand, follows in demi moore's footsteps from "ghost," by crying profusely throughout the movie. <br /><br />there is a bizarre switch in tone after mark returns. suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor, a la the tv show "bewitched." but that doesn't last long. once simon's emotional health is at stake, the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish, with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings. the finale, with a gold-plated muscle-boy angel guiding a tearful mark to heaven while a chastened, grief-stricken simon waves goodbye is just stupefying, chiefly because it isn't intentionally funny.
