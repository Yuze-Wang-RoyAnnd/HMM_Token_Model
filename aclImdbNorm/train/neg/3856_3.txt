"a guy thing" tries to capture the feeling of "there's something about mary" or "meet the parents" but comes off more like it was edited up out of cutting-room rejects of those two films. thankfully i rented it on a 5-day rental because i couldn't sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time.<br /><br />the premise is decent and i liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover up for paul's missteps (the checker at the save-mart was great) but the script-writing is absolutely horrible. the dialog falls flat most of the time and just when you think that things are finally going to get on track some needless sight-gag is stuck in for no good reason. plus how many toilet jokes does one movie really need?<br /><br />don't get me wrong, slapstick humor is great when it's smartly done as in the other films i mentioned, but this movie simply misses the mark. too bad as i love julia stiles (ten things i hate about you was great) but even that couldn't help me sit through this terrible movie. save your dollars and go rent "there's something about mary" one more time.
