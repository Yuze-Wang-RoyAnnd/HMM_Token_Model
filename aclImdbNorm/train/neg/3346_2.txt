cheezy action movie starring dolph lungren. lungren is a one time military man who has retreated into a teaching job. but the changes in the neighborhood and the student body have left him frustrated and he decides that he?s going to hang it up. things get dicey when while watching over a bunch of students in detention some robbers take over the school as a base of operation for an armored car robbery. its dolph versus the baddies in a fight to the death. jaw dropping throw back to the exploitation films of the late grindhouse era where bad guys dressed as punks and some of the bad women had day glow hair. what a stupid movie. watchable in a i can?t believe people made this sort of way, this is an action film that was probably doomed from the get go before the low budget, fake breakaway sets and poor action direction were even a twinkle in a producers eye. watch how late in the film as cars drive through the school (don?t ask) they crash into the security turret (don?t ask since it looks more like a prison then a high school) and smash its barely constructed form apart(it doesn't look like it did in earlier shots). what hath the gods of bad movies wrought? actually i?m perplexed since this was directed (?) by sydney j furie, a really good director who made films like the boys in company c. has his ability failed him, or was this hopeless from the get go and he didn't even bother? it?s a turkey. a watchable one but a turkey none the less.
