sorry - this movie is just a cheap tv-production. i saw very much promotion material and expect a professionell movie like "stormriders" - what i was presented was a low-budget-movie like "xena" or "hercules" on tv. no atmosphere, very boring, more then worse fight-scenes. some good ideas - not more. i hope i will get the chance to make a movie like this and then i show how to do such a movie!!!<br /><br />my asian-tips: "musa - the warrior", "stormriders", "shaolin soccer", "battle royal", "versus", etc.<br /><br />sorry for my bad english!
