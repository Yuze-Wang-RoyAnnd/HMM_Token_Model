this film is just plain horrible. john ritter doing pratt falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. i didn't think i'd ever say this, but dorothy stratten is not the worst actress in this film. there are at least 3 others that suck more. patti hansen delivers her lines with the passion of ben stein. i started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. even bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). this movie is seriously horrible. there's a reason bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. please don't watch it. if you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. if a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. if your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. i'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. if i could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: suckotrocity
