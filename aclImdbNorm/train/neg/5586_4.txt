man to man tries hard to be a good movie: it has its heart at the right place, it aspires to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate. but there lies also some of the problems of this picture. it strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged. so it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic - man to man doesn't let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head. joseph fiennes exemplifies this in his role: he does his best to look concerned, genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer. add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that man to man is not worth watching. but there are enough points to defend it: it is entertaining, has some humorous scenes and the show-stealing kristin scott thomas. of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like the elephant man (david lynch) but you'll be leaving the theatre satisfied. it tries to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious) and succeeds most of the time.
