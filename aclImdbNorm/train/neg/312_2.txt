if you've ever seen this movie, you'd know that it! if you haven't, and want to see a classic bad movie, i suggest you see this movie, because it ranks right down with the worst. so, if you're really bored, go rent it. if you want to know what it's like, here's my little summary: adam sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some ms universe models and five other people. adam doesn't like how one passenger is getting all the babes, and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes. but wait! it only gets worse! you'll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is.
