this really should have been a one star, but there was so many, clich'es, predictable twists, seen it all before slasher flick parallels that i actually give it an extra star for the fact it made me laugh...although this was never the directors intention im sure.<br /><br />i don't often write comments about films, they have to be either sensational, or in this ones case really bad.<br /><br />to be honest, as soon as i saw jeff fahey in it i knew it was going to be poor as he has a unique nose for picking out the worst films.<br /><br />somehow the farce of it all made me watch it all the way through, possibly for the hilarious voice of mr t, (not relay mr t, but you'll know what i mean if you bother to watch this), if you do watch it, make sure you don't pay to see it. this may have worked had they actually put intended comedy into it, but im sure you'll find the odd laugh here and there at the farce of it all...
