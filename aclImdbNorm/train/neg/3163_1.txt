well this is the first post am ever commenting on imdb., do you get it, this movie has made me come and warn all the good souls who will stop ever experimenting with movies.<br /><br />as most of them have given their comments i thought of watching this movie because it seemed to have some decent actors(though having read worst critics against this movie) i thought of experimenting it assuming it to be some comedy flick., well it all started well with some ahem., comedies.... then it all started going pathetic... man you can believe your self, you wud feel like going and banging your head each and every time the pathetic looking woman called the heroine of the movie is made helpless...huh~~ well how much can a person digest a sick all possessive witch kinda ghost trying to do all she can to irritate you and stop you from what you are doing.<br /><br />the next worst thing about the movie is, the "zombie" hero, yes as he looses his fianc'e he roams around like a goat, with black marks under his eyes., and with the hero's "terribly stupid" sister.. you wud be bleeding from head to toe if you attempted and succeeded by completely watching this movie~!
