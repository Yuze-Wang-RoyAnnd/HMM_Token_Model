where do i begin? i wanted to enjoy this movie, and i did. still, i wanted to be able to enjoy it for being another zombie film that was worth my loot, and it wasnt. this was a different kind of enjoyment. this was unhealthy, a perverse glee that i partook in watching one of the most ridiculous films id seen yet. and i dont much care for whatever fulci's excuses were, there was no excuse for this film going how it went. this was a bad film all the way around, yet i still cant give it below a 4 out of ten, which is what i gave it, because well...at least i was able to laugh at this misfit of a movie.<br /><br />i had to imagine these zombies, that were all over the ceilings of these buildings everywhere...had to imagine that they were either bored as hell so they crawled up on the beems, and perched themselves high on stone erections, or they saw the fleshy living motley band of jerk-offs coming around, so they took it upon themselves to stage numerous aerial ambushes. hell, what else is there to do when youre dead?<br /><br />i had to laugh at some zombies performing what looked to be martial arts swings, kicks, and jumps, and some shambling about like traditional meatlovers. i feasted my eyes on a floating head that was never explained. i watched in pure horrific delight as the land they were in, the phillipenes, was absolutely engulfed in fog, heavy doses of fog, and that the ponds were as they were boiling castle moats. i had to even cringe when i saw that the design for a cure for this plague was sketched on a chalkboard as an octagon with lines stretching from each angle, with "dead one" written in the middle. i had to ask myself...if the science of curing zombies is that easy, then i wonder if i could come up with a little something to start a zombie outbreak here!<br /><br />all in all the effects were overboard, the dubbing horrid, im sure the original acting as poor, the story absurd, the zombies inconsistent, even in a bad way they couldve all been similar, and the women ugly, but i found myself enjoying this thing. it was a fun watch. it turned out to be a very very bad film, and i would not recommend this thing unless one is into bad directorial exploitation films, but still, again i say...it was worth a good laugh. i crave zombie films no matter what, but when this had fulci's name attached to it, it shouldve been much better. let me dare say, zombie holocaust was better.
