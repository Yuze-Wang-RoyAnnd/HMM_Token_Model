i can't believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue such as homelessness. of course, brooks has not made a comedy about _real_ homeless people. no mention of drugs, prostitution or violence on these streets. the people we meet in this movie are homeless in fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they don't eat quite as often. brooks' movies have become worse and worse over the years. this is just another nail in the coffin .
