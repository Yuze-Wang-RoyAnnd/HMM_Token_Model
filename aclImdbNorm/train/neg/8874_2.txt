but there are not too many of them. probably the worst "major release" film i have seen in my life. definitely the worst for this year. there is no point in commenting on the plot, the cast or the acting. the problem is beyond all that. it lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind (not the funny kind) of everything that takes place on the screen. i don't know why i gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10. probably, because of steven martini. he really did try. bottom line - 95 minutes washed down the toilet along with a few brain cells. avoid at any cost.
