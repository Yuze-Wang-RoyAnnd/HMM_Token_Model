i don't have much to say about this movie. it could have been a wonderful tour-de-force for peter sellers, but it is one of the most tragic misfires in movie history. that it was sellers final movie makes it all the more painful.<br /><br />the terrible screenplay, direction and shockingly wooden performances all come dreadfully together to make this one of the most unwatchably awful movies ever made.<br /><br />i wish so much that i could find even a snicker or a chuckle buried somewhere in this pile of putrid blubber, but it's a lifeless, humorless disaster. the truth hurts.<br /><br />peter, why couldn't you have stopped at being there?
