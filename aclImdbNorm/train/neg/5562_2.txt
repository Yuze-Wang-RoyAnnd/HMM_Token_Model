this unpleasant film has little to recommend it. dolph lundgren gives a performance that is better than either this script or his other action films have allowed. and there are occasional snippets of dialog that suggest the film might have been able to provide some insight into a bizarre subculture.<br /><br />but no. motivations are either murky or trite. most of the acting is sub-par. the script creates needless confusion. and the director's needless fascination with focusing on gore is distracting.<br /><br />it's hard to imagine who the audience is for this film.
