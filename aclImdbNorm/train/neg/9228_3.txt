cq is incredibly slow, and i'm a david mamet fan. the movie follows around a young filmmaker who is making a very barbarella-esque film. after that the movie started to lose me. deep and profound? not really. the movie "dragonfly" being made in cq has the problem of having no ending. this greatly parallels cq, which also lacks an ending (in my opinion).<br /><br />i was lucky enough to catch this movie at the sxsw film festival. i had fairly high expectations having just watched y tu mama tambien and several other great movies. i was also looking forward to jason schwartzman's performance. but it was not an easy film to get into. if you're not into 60's sci-fi or slow movies that go no where, skip it.<br /><br />cq feels like a student film. if you want a recent sci-fi-esque indie film rent donnie darko, it won't put you to sleep.
