schizophreniac: the whore mangler is another example of what happens when you get a bunch of untalented people together to make an "extreme" horror film. any sort of acting, production, storyline, fx, etc...go out the window in an effort to create "shock-value". now don't get me wrong - i consider myself a connoisseur of "shock" films, and the sleazier/gorier/nastier the better - but it's still nice to see some sort of talent from someone involved in the film.<br /><br />schizophreniac chronicles the life of harry russo - a drug-addicted freak-show who takes orders to kill from his ventriloquist's dummy, rubberneck. he goes on a few sprees killing hookers and other random people, and screaming about how much he hates "hoo-uhs" (that's "whores" for those of you that don't speak new york-ese...) and how he wants to rape them in the ass. there are a few weak necrophilia scenes, very little gore, and some nudity to mix things up a bit - but nothing that you haven't seen in a better film...<br /><br />the only redeeming thing that i can find in this retarded film are the often (unintentionally?) hilarious screaming-fits from our main man, harry. he goes on-and-on-and-on about wanting to kill everyone and do them in the ass, and it really becomes quite comical after a while. in fact, i'm almost tempted to believe that there's supposed to be some sort of homo-erotic undertone to this film, with all the ass talk and constant shots of harry running around with his dong hangin' out. in all honesty, that joker is nekkid more in this film then the few chicks that show some t-and-a (and some full-frontal, for good measure). schizophreniac is mildly amusing as a 1-time watch, but i can really only recommend this to those that want to be able to say that they watched a film called schizophreniac: the whore mangler. to be honest - the title, by far - is the best thing about this trash...a generous 3.5/10
