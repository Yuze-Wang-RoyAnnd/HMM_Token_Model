this movie is bad. i don't just mean 'bad' as in; "oh the script was bad", or; "the acting in that scene was bad".....i mean bad as in someone should be held criminally accountable for foisting this unmitigated pile of steaming crud onto an unsuspecting public. i won't even dignify it with an explanation of the (plot??) if i can refer to it as that.i can think of only one other occasion in some 40-odd years of movie watching that i have found need to vent my spleen on a movie. i mean, after all, no one goes out to intentionally make a bad movie, do they? well, yes. apparently they do...and the guilty man is writer/director ulli lommel. but the worst of it is that blockbusters is actually renting this to their customers! be advised. leave this crap where it belongs. stuck on the shelf, gathering dust.
