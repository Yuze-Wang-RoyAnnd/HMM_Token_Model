if i had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease-inducing dogme 95 style, i would never have rented it. nevertheless, i took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot. i lasted a very, very, very long forty minutes before giving up. it's just boring, pretentious twaddle.<br /><br />the last french movie i saw was "romance" and it too was pretty dismal, but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time. i am baffled at the continuing popularity of dogme 95 overseas -- it'll catch on in america about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy. (it's called dogme 95 because that's the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera.)<br /><br />
