ed wood is eclipsed and becomes orson welles. this film is fantastic. vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographed scenes and dialog that could have breaking ribs with laughter. plan 9 from outerspace dons't stand a chance against this. described by the writer and psychic stephen armourae on the vampire forum as a masterpiece- he's from england and thoroughly sarcastic.<br /><br />it has stephanie beaton and the producers know whats going to save them from bankcrupcy by repeatedly using her. though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil raisers. and eileen daly is just a lower rate elvira. the whole thing is badly done.<br /><br />watch it for the script though
