first of all, i was expecting "caged heat" to be along the same lines as "ilsa, the wicked warden". boy, was i wrong! in no way is this film 70s exploitation, "chix in chains", or "women in prison". sure, the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison, who wear street clothes btw (quite comical), but nothing happens.<br /><br />there aren't strong rivalries, no one tries to seduce the warden or doctor in order to try and escape, and no inmates make out. there are 2 shower scenes, that i suspect is just recycled footage, but no fights breaks out / no one is seduced here - or anywhere for that matter! aside from the lack of plot, unconvincing, unsympathetic, and flat characters, a couple of inmates that do manage to escape actually return to the prison in order to "free" their fellow inmates??!!<br /><br />puh-lease, the movie should have just ended off with the escapees riding off into the sunset...as opposed to letting this mess continue!<br /><br />i feel scammed.
