the most embarrassing moment in this film is when brady corbet says 'you've blossomed', near the end the film. i practically died. i'm still not really sure why the screenwriters put that line in there. was it supposed to create romance? because it nearly made me sick. <br /><br />the rest of the script was almost as bad.<br /><br />i've never liked the original thunderbirds, but a thunderbirds movie had the potential to do so much. this movie doesn't. if it didn't have the big draw card of the thunderbirds brand, it would have been shafted straight to tv, or canned in the post-production. maybe even before. <br /><br />like i said, the best thing about the movie is when the credits roll up and they play busted's song 'thunderbirds are go'. i can't believe i wasted $7 watching this through pay-per-view.
