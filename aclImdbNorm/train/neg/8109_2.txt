*** contains spoilers ***<br /><br />i did not like this movie at all.<br /><br />i found it amazingly boring and rather superficially made, irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed themes: given that eventually we have to die, how should we approach life? in a "light" way, like tomas; in a "heavy" way like tereza; or should we find ways not to face that question, like sabina? how much is fidelity important in a relationship? how much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones? how much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our country?<br /><br />unfortunately, i haven't read kundera's novel but after having being let down by the movie i certainly will: i want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation (which is my guess) or if it was dull from the beginning.<br /><br />i disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece. i simply don't see the reasons why. what i see are many flaws, and a sample of them follows.<br /><br />1) the three main characters are thrown at you and it's very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices.<br /><br />2) the "secondary" characters are there just to fill the gaps but they don't add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary.<br /><br />3) i did not like how tomas was impersonated. nothing is good for him. he is so self-centered and selfish. he is not human, in some sense. but when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone, i did not find the interpretation credible.<br /><br />4) it's very unlikely that an artist like sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. on top of that, the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions, which sounds strange to me. a) how can tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer? b) how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed?<br /><br />5) the fake accents of the english spoken by the actors are laughable. and i am not even mother tongue. moreover, the letter that sabina receives while in the us is written in czech, which i found very inconsistent.<br /><br />6) many comments praised the movie saying that prague was beautifully rendered: i guess that most of the movie was shot on location, so it's not difficult to give the movie a eastern european feeling, and given the intrinsic beauty of prague is not even difficult to make it look good.<br /><br />7) i found the ending sort of trivial. tereza and tomas, finally happy in the countryside, far away from the temptations of the "metropoly", distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living, detached from their professional lives, die in a car accident. but they die after having realized that they are happy, indeed. so what? had they died unhappy, would the message of the movie have been different? i don't think so. i considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience.<br /><br />8) the only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters. you see them for almost three hours, but in the end you are left with nothing. you don't feel empathy, you don't relate to them, you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say.<br /><br />9) i hated the "stop the music in the restaurant" scene (which some comments praised a lot). why sabina has got such a strong reaction? why franz agrees with her? i really don't see the point. the only thing you learn is that sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality. that's it. what's so special and unique about it?<br /><br />after all these negative comments, let me point tout that there are two scenes that i liked a lot (that's why i gave it a two).<br /><br />the "naked women photoshoot", where the envy, the jealousy, and the insecurities of sabina and tereza are beautifully presented.<br /><br />the other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of prague by the russians. tereza pictures, taken to let the world know about what is going on in prague, are used to identify the people taking part to the riots. i found it quite original and tereza's sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed.<br /><br />finally, there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally "designed" in such a way that "tomas types" are going to like it and "tereza ones" are going to hate it. if this is the case (i strongly doubt it, though) then my comment should be revised drastically.
