well ok, i watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now i pulled it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and i must say, i actually think this movie is good. this movie caught a buzz as the bootleg i know what you did last summer 3, much like final stab was to scream 4, and well this movie isn't that bad. i mean it had flaws and of course it would be laughable to release this in the theaters but still for a midnight popcorn flick, this movie is not half bad. it has some scares, and some really hot women i might add. plus it shows off joey lawrence's new beefy look though obviously even that hasn't won him any big hollywood roles either......i feel bad for the man, he had such a career in the early and mid 90's with blossom, some disney movies and the everlasting lawrence brothers show.....joey lawrence was a bit player in the sitcom scene, but then like in a 360 degree turn, his career went south only doing low budget movies like this one.<br /><br />the movie also throws you off guard in, it makes you think between the crew, there really is a secret that someone knows, to only be disappointed in the end to find out the secret. it also throws you off on who the killer is, i had an idea but still woulnd't think the killer was who he was, but his motives combined with the secret was a huge letdown. now, had there been a secret that was let out? this movie could've been one of the better b rated movies. but also i am a sucker for college themes and i also in college went on spring break in a mansion sized beach house similar to the one in here so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie.<br /><br />a so-so slasher flick. good for a midnight movie.
