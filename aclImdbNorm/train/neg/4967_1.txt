scifi has been having some extremely bad luck making quality movies lately (such as minotaur or dog soldiers). grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic beowulf, however, it deviates so much (and offers so little in comparison) that the advertisements on television might as well have titled it 'some shitty christopher lambert movie'. i wasn't expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown hollywood production, but i did however expect the 'artistic integrity' to not interfere with the actual story (even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slots).<br /><br />did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing (did any research go into this?). obviously not, as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that beowulf and his crew (save for mullet boy) are wearing. one major problem i have though was with the very look of grendel
