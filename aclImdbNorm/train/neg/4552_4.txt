the film gives a rather condensed version of what is contained in the book, which as far as i can tell by doing some research and investigative fact checking is largely a work of fiction. in reality, there are no ancient scrolls and if the author was hard pressed i'm sure he'd have to admit he's never laid eyes on any scrolls in ancient aramaic found in peru. these "valuable" texts written as usual by anonymous, were destroyed by the evil "truth haters" in the church and in the local government. that's rather strange, as all kinds of new age crap comes out each year---hundreds of books, dozens of movies--and the roman catholic church doesn't seem to me to be hell bent on destroying the movement which it probably views as i do, a total crock of doody. i'm no fan of the church, mind you, but at least the ancient texts which they base their faith on are real.<br /><br />it's a typical pattern of scam artists and religious hucksters to claim to have seen or translated ancient documents which unfortunately got destroyed by "evil" men or in joseph smith's case, got taken back to heaven once translated. therefore, the actual texts cannot be found in any museums like the smithsonian, nor the translations checked by specialists in ancient languages like coptic or aramaic. it's a scam. in one sense, i admire anybody smart enough to come up with a great idea and make millions off it, but i couldn't do it myself, as i've no desire to mislead the public with more new agey hokum.<br /><br />occasionally, a genuine ancient text does get found hidden away and lost for years. the gospel of judas, a gnostic text, was discovered and after carbon dating and diligent study of the text, deemed authentic by experts. the gospel of judas was referenced as heretical around 300 c.e.. no church documents from that time mention any celestine prophecies as authentic, heretical or anything else.<br /><br />we are evolving towards something--that much is true---but the optimism in the celestine prophecy is based on nothing but fiction and lies, and a philosophy built on a foundation of lies, like a castle built on sand will collapse. the harsh, ugly, overpopulated, cruel world of blade runner is more likely what it'll be like over the horizon, than some utopian hippie commune where all is love and peace! i tell people the truth and they hate me, but tell them what they want to hear, even if pure piffle, and one can make millions. the celestine prophecy is what the world wants to hear. too bad it is a castle built on sand. don't get me wrong. i wish to god, the celestine vision was reality, only it's not. no ancient philosophy at any time expressed ideas given in the insights with the modern concept of spiritual evolution going hand in hand with biological evolution. these new agey ideas did not exist in the ancient world and did not exist until darwininan evolution became well-known. that means the ideas in the celestine prophecies cannot be older than the 1800s c.e, and do not go back to the early b.c.e period or near the time of jesus of nazareth. this type of claim by new agers is not at all unusual. wiccans claim their brand of magic and witchcraft -- the "old religion" goes back to the stone age, when in reality no book of shadows has ever been known to exist prior to gerald gardner who lived in the 1900s and was the buddy of aleister crowley.<br /><br />new age gurus tell lies and claim their ideas are based on ancient teachings, when the ancients would thumb their noses at such absurdities that are preached by gurus today. why do they do what they do, perpetrate such fraud? simple: there are millions of dollars to be made, and the modern guru acquires power over his or her followers. they compete fiercely and have a strong hatred for their competition despite their claims of love for all things. each new age group bitter opposes the others. it's a struggle for your minds and your wallets.<br /><br />but learn one thing from me, that is actually similar to one of the insights, learn to follow your own instincts and look for guidance from within. that i can agree with wholeheartedly.
