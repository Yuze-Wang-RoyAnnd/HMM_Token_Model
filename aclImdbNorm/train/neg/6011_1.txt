i didn't expect much from this film, but oh brother, what a stinker.<br /><br />i found this gem in a giant crate of awful $5 dvd's at walmart (where else)? as cheap as this disc was, i feel ripped off. the special effects had a high school look to them, the camera work marred by wobbly tripods and sketchy lighting and the acting was a perfect example of the 'christian school'. one can imagine the long and exhausting 'prayer meetings' by the production company after seeing the rushes come back - the people who bankrolled this thing must have had seriously anti-biblical feelings towards the inept production company that cranked this thing out. think of their anguish as they saw their $914.86 investment go up in smoke.<br /><br />someone asked why christian movies are so bad - perhaps the xian film-makers need to look at good movies and attempt to copy some of the things that make them so good. believable stories and characters, less hysterical arm-waving and fanaticism, oh, and a story that appeals to -everyone-, not just true believers. i.e. stop the sermon, save it for church. take the omen or prophesy series, for example. excellent films with compelling story lines, great cinematography and intense music. no hysterical arm-waving. no preaching.<br /><br />if this film had a laugh track it would have been much better.
