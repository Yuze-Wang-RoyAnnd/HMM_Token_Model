if you ever watched the dukes of hazard you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children. if you've seen the movie you know that is no longer the case! this movie was horrible! main characters doing drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what i call entertainment. they took a wonderful show and just turned it into trash. daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show now looks and acts like she belongs on the street corner getting paid for her services. i was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out, 15 minutes into the movie i was ready to leave. i stayed thinking it had to get better but instead it got worse by the minute. i wish i had never seen this movie. it trashed a good show and left nothing but horrible taste in my mouth when i left. do yourself a favor, go see something worth your money, cause it's not only a waste of money but a waste of 2 hours of your life you will never get back!
