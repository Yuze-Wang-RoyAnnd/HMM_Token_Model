the crimson rivers is one of the most over-directed, over-the-top, over-everything mess i've ever seen come out of france. there's nothing worse than a french production trying to out-do films made in hollywood and cr is a perfect example of such a wannabe horror/action/buddy flick. i almost stopped it halfway through because i knew it wouldn't amount to anything but french guys trying to show-off.<br /><br />the film starts off promisingly, like some sort of expansive horror film, but it quickly shifts genres, from horror to action to x-files type to buddy flick, that in the end, cr is all of it and also none of it. it's so full of clich'es that at one point i thought the whole thing was a comedy. the painful dialogue and those silent pauses, with fades outs and fades ins just at the right expositionary moments, made me groan. i thought only films made in hollywood used this hackneyed technique.<br /><br />the chase scene, with vincent cassel running after the killer, is so over-directed and over-done that it's almost a thing of beauty. the climax on top of the mountain, with the stupid revelation about the killer(s) with cassel and reno playing "buddies" like nolte and murphy in 48 hrs, completely derailed what little credibility the film had by then.<br /><br />it's difficult to believe that the director of the crimson rivers also directed gothika, which though had its share of problems, doesn't even come close to the awfulness of this overbaked, confused film.
