probably somebody heard of alberto tomba. a former policeman, a former sky champion, and, now, a terrible actor. "alex l'ariete" was planned to be a tv "mini serial", but the italian television itself refused to show the movie on its channels. now it's a, believe me, ridiculous movie. the script it's simply hilarious (it's supposed to be a dramatic movie), something like a 5 years old kid work. but what really blows you away it's the amateurish acting: alberto tomba, who actually was not believable as a policeman himself, plays terribly a totally silly character: a special operations italian policeman specialized in smashing doors open! ("ariete" is "ram"). this super-guy will try to save a young nice girl life (an actual italian "little" tv showgirl, married to the singer eros ramazzotti): nice but absolutely inept in the acting. lose this one and make yourself a favour. a movie that is a shame to italian cinema industry: only john travolta in earth attack got close..
