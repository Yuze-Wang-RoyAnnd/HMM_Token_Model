<br /><br />attack of the killer tomatoes is a "parody" of bad monster movies which ends up being worse than the movies it spoofs. the (very meager) story tells of tomatoes who revolt against those who treat them badly. basically,they spin and growl (yes,they growl) and the next thing you know the person is covered in ketchup. the actors are no-names who never made movies after this,so there would be no point to name them. there's a guy who's hired by the governement to try and stop the menace of tomatoes. he's accompanied by a black guy who's master of disguise and a girl and a guy who dives. anyway, there's another woman who spies on the first guy that works for the government. if this isn't making much sense to you, you understand. this movie never would have been very good in the first place, but it even lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes. the movie is horribly cheezy, which although being the whole point,really really hurts what could've been a (reasonably) entertaining movie. at one point, a giant wax tomato "slides" on an unconcealed plank of wood with wheels on it! maybe i would've recommended the movie if it would have enjoyable camp value, but even this is lacking from this terrible movie. 2/10
