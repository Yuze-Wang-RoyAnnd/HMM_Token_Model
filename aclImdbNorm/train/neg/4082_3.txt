this film was just painful to watch... not in the good dramatic way that makes you cringe with emotions for well developed characters in dramatic situations (yeah, i pretty much made that last sentence up as i went along), but in just an absolute dull way for over two hours. now, you all may think i'm just some ignorant reviewer who has no respect for shakespeare or "artistic film-making"... well, you'd be wrong on both counts. i love the works of shakespeare, especially the tragedies of romeo and juliet, julius caesar, macbeth, and hamlet, and i've watched plenty of "arthouse" films such as the surreal and well-made eraserhead and fellini's 8 1/2... but this was just over two hours of lost-in-translation shakespeare, way too much nudity (i can understand artistic nudity in some scenes... but not in every other shot of a movie!!! it was pointless and served nothing for the story!!!), and basically just overzealous film-making. i had high expectations for this film in that it was said to be "very artistic" and was an adaptation of shakespeare's the tempest... but this was just an extreme letdown. i gave this film a three only because of sir john gielgud's acting presence (which far surpassed all of the no-names in this film) and the cinematography/set design combination as it made a lot of scenes look like paintings in motion... however, a lot of this film would've been better off as just a painting with a scroll of text below it. a true disappointment... maybe if zeffirelli had been given the director's chair, this would've been much better. but this is one audience member's opinion, many others may enjoy this far more than me. that being said, if you can't find this at any nearby video stores (it's currently not on dvd), don't try to go too far out of your way to find it... it's not really worth it.
