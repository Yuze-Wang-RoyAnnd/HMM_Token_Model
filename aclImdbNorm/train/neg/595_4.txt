creep - "your journey terminates here." some very graphic scenes and...well, yeah, that's about all for this film.<br /><br />no real plot, no storyline. no likable characters, well, 'characters' isn't correct considering you don't have a clue who anyone really is. i mean, they are being chased by some weird looking 'thing' in the sewers (who is this thing? why is he there?), that's quite scary i guess, but do i really care? no, i don't. why don't i? because i don't have a clue who these people are and i don't know if i should want them to live or die. it's one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you, which it rarely does.<br /><br />this film lacks any meaning, any purpose. it feels like i fell asleep and missed out the 45mins of build up. it jumps right into the action. basically, some women and her friends get locked in the london underground, get chased by a weird creature, then they eventually escape from it.<br /><br />creep has its moments which make you jump, the art is good, the location is excellent and the sounds are ok, but that isn't what makes a decent horror film, so unfortunately all that goes to waste.<br /><br />it's nothing new. another predictable modern 'horror', where kate (the lead 'character') consistently does the stupid "hey, i know you lot sitting at home think i should do the sensible thing in this situation, but, oooh no! i'm going to do the total opposite because i'm a dumb blond" thing. i wish they wouldn't do that, it's done so many times, it's boring and gets predictable. in fact, i'm pretty annoyed the silly woman didn't get stabbed by the, erm, grey alien-looking creature.<br /><br />"your journey terminates here" is the films tag line. well, creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film. if you've had a few beers, got a couple of mates back at yours,then sure, watch it by all means. but if you want something original and clever, avoid.
