if it wasn't for the bad dialogues and script. i mean, the direction was really in touch with it's subject. the actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life. but in the end, the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together. i would highly suggest not to watch this. unless you're a al pacino enthusiast like i am and will watch everything he is playing in. even if the result lately are rather poor. this is, after s1m0ne, a second very bad movie for this actor that once knew how to choose roles.
