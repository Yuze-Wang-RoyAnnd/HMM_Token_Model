no matter how well meaning his "message" is - this film is a terribly made trainwreck - awful acting, lame camera work - i do not know why carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he is lousy at it. you watch the extras on the dvd and the way he has a camera follow him around - he just soaks it up - he loves being the center of attention. he is a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - eric schaffer. some how carr has had this film shown at city youth centers and new age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is choppy, predictable and sappy.
