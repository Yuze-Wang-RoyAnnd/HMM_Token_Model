not being familiar with us television stations, when i flicked onto this on my in-laws' cable, first i thought it was just a low-budget sci-fi film, then after a couple of minutes i started thinking it might be a clever satire on the worst excesses of christian fundamentalist, and then it dawned on me - good grief, these people are serious! it's been a while since i saw anything so unintentionally hilarious. i hesitated about writing a review of this for fear of offending believers, but then i saw other reviews and thought, hey, they can take it. tough philosophical conundrum: how do you make a movie criticizing movies without actually showing what it is you're criticizing? answer: make it in such a way that the only people who'll appreciate it are people who hate the kind of movies you're criticizing. i suppose some liberals (ugh! spit when you say that!) might be offended at the filmmakers' contempt for those in the audience who aren't obsessed with the j**** c***** myth, but i didn't mind - it was so darn funny!
