spirit of a murdered high school geek animates a scarecrow which then takes revenge on everyone.<br /><br />this movie really annoyed me. it has a great looking monster, has some good low budget effects, some atmosphere but manages to short circuit the good stuff with bad. half way in i started to fast forward and then step through the chapters on the dvd.<br /><br />the problems with this movie are many. first off the cast looks about thirty and yet they are suppose to be in high school. you don't believe anything from the get go as a result. the scarecrow, while looking great isn't much beyond that. he says stupid one liners and moves in a manner more designed to be funny then scary. is this a comedy or a horror movie? its a problem that goes beyond the one liners to much of the dialog and set up. it seems more send up of every clich'e than heartfelt horror film. i some how expect that the film was made for a very narrow audience in mind, horror fans who want to mock the genre rather than embrace it.<br /><br />despite the good looking monster this is a film to avoid. even if you pick it up in the bargain bin for under five bucks, you're paying too much.<br /><br />avoid.
