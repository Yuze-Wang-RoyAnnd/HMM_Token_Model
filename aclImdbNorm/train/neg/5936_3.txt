this film was a disaster from start to finish. interspersed with performances from "the next generation of beautiful losers" are interviews with bono and the edge as well as the performers themselves. this leaves little time for the clips of leonard cohen himself, who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet gentle presence, wisdom and humor. the rest are too busy trying to canonize him as st. leonard or as some old testament prophet. many of the performances are forgettable over-interpretations (especially rufus & martha wainright's) or bland under-achievements. only beth orton and anthony got within striking distance of leonard's own versions by using a little restraint. annoying little pseudo-avant-garde gestures are sprinkled throughout the film- like out of focus superimpositions of red spheres over many of the concert and interview shots, shaky blurred camera work, use of digital delay on some of leonard cohen's comments (making it harder to hear what's being said) and a spooky, pretentious low drone under a lot of the interview segments (an attempt at added gravitas?). for the real thing, see the songs from the life of documentary produced by the bbc in 1988.
