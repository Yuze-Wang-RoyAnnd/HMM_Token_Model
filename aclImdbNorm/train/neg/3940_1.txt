this film is a joke and quinton should be ashamed of himself, trying to pass this off as a modesty blaise film. if you are having trouble sleeping then all means rent this film. the stick figure they call a actress who is suppose to be modesty blaise has got to be the most boring person on this planet. maybe she could be used as a hat stand in the back ground of a real film.seventy-five minutes of nothing thank you who ever invented the fast forward button. if you see this film if you can call it that coming your way run. i can't help but think what 3rd world country could of used the money wasted of this crap. this film is boring the actors are boring waste of colour a waste air they breath if you would like to see mostey blaise film then watch the one they made in the 60's maybe that what the director should of done.
