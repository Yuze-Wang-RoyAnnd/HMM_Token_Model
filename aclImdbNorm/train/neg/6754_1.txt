the only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money.<br /><br />i bought it ex-rental for lb3.00, it looked interesting, so i took a chance.<br /><br />within minutes of turning it on i realised i'd made a mistake. the entire cast should be stored away until winter and then thrown on the nearest log fire, where they could meet more of their kind.<br /><br />as for the devin hamilton (writer and director), he should just be shot, sadly this should have been done before he made this rubbish.<br /><br />avoid this film, if you see it in the shops run away.<br /><br />1/10
