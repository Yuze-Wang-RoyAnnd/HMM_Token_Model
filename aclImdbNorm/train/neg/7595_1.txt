"ask the dust" looked intriguing from the trailer, and we especially like all of the actors. unfortunately, the movie was not compelling enough to be considered drama, and it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy. it practically seemed to satirize itself, and to no entertaining effect. after seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to get better, my wife and i walked out, valuing not having wasted any more time on such nonsense. it simply was not interesting, moving, funny nor artistic. it appears as though it were written, produced and directed by a high school kid; worse yet, it was such a shameful waste of otherwise extraordinarily talented actors, not to mention our time and money.
