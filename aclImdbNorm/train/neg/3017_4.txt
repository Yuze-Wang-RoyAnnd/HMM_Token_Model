now i had the best intentions when watching this one. i like some of tony scott's work, also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie, even though i heard otherwise from other people. but this was simply hopeless. <br /><br />in my humble opinion, tony scott was trying too hard. it was all just too much. allow me to elaborate. <br /><br />miss knightley was overacting, and not in a good way. the people who did perform well, were mickey rourke, edgar ramirez, and christopher walken, but their screen time just wasn't able to save the movie. <br /><br />there were a few scenes that jumped out in their originality, yet somehow it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer. a certain tune was used around 4 times, which really started to bug after the second time. i'm a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once. <br /><br />also, the editing really went out on this one, as the cutting rate is rather high. oh, and the repetitive echoing of some of keira's lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second, third, fourth time, and so on. <br /><br />basically, my opinion is that if you want to see an action-flick that is high-paced and "somewhat" funny, and you don't care about everything i mentioned above, you might like it. <br /><br />(on a side note: i'm not a keira knightley fan.)
