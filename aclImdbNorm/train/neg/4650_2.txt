with a cast of stalwart british character actors and pleasing photography of 1950s britain, i had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this film. unfortunately i found myself glued to it for the wrong reasons - i couldn't quite believe how awful it was. i must have watched thousands of old films and am always ready to make allowances for them being products of their time, but this was really hard going.<br /><br />as others have noted, a major problem is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: a gentle romantic comedy, a slapstick comedy or a musical. i was a bit gobsmacked when jeannie carson suddenly broke into song about 15 minutes in! it's not believable on any level, either the storyline itself or the fact that daisy never appears to have an ounce of menace in her at any time. other aspects which defied credibility included the casting of suave donald sinden as a songwriter (a songwriter for god's sake!), the fact he has diana dors for a fianc'ee and doesn't appear to have the slightest interest in her (i mean, diana dors! come on!) and a ludicrous scene in a song publisher's office. the whole thing's silly in the worst possible way.<br /><br />if i had to pick a favourite scene it would be the one at the very beginning with that wonderful actor wilfred lawson - after that everything went downhill in a big way.
