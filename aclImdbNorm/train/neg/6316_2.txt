a film like amazing grace and chuck is a perfect example of how the left in this country just doesn't get it. they never did. and liberalism continues to slip further and further into political oblivion.<br /><br />this film deals with a little league baseball star who decides to stop playing ball as a protest to the existence of nuclear weapons. the boy is understandably ridiculed until a bevy of professional athletes, led by former nba star alex english, join his cause. not just a few of them join the cause. by the time his movement reaches its zenith, entire leagues of professional and college sports have to cancel their seasons since nobody will play any more. just to move this review along, i'm prepared to grant them this premise. even though it would never happen in a million years, i'll just imagine it could, then go from there.<br /><br />i don't quite remember how, but some type of agreement is reached, and the boy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly sappy and ridiculous scene.<br /><br />before criticizing the message of this film, let me just say that this film is poorly written, acted and directed. even if one does agree with the boy's stance, it would be impossible to overcome how badly the film was constructed. and that's a shame since there are plenty of good actors that go to waste. (peck, curtis, petersen). alex english does as well as he could have with his character however, and i wish he would try to act in more films. alas, it's likely much easier to find work in the coaching world of the nba. one wishes mr. english would teach more of these thuggish nba types of today how to shoot the rock a little better. alex certainly knew how to put the ball through the hoop.<br /><br />as far as the film's message in concerned, it's just wrong-headed. plain and simple. all of those nuclear warheads tucked away in those missile silos out west prevented war!!!!! it would be one thing for this boy and his flock to protest an actual war or the use of nuclear weapons. these weapons were in fact never used, and that was the genius behind their existence. neither side during the cold war was crazy enough to fire a single missile. without these weapons, who knows what might have happened between the usa and ussr.<br /><br />the makers of this film obviously intended for kids in america to take up their cause and follow in chuck's footsteps. kids in america however are more intelligent than the left wing kooks who created this dreck. <br /><br />the film is worth only 2 of 10 stars.<br /><br />if you want to see a great film about the dangers of nuclear war, stick with dr. strangelove, instead.<br /><br />mr. newell, you are no frank capra!
