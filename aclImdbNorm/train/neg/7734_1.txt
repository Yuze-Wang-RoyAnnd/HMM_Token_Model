this film is the worst film i have ever seen. the story line is weak - i couldn't even follow it. the acting is high-schoolish. the sound track is irritating. the attempts at humor are not. the editing is horrible. the credits are even slow - i would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film. don't waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting.
