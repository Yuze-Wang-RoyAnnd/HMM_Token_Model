this film should have been fun. a young lea thompson, a young joaquin phoenix... and terry o'quinn. in space. but it dragged on, had unlovable characters and had no target audience.<br /><br />some kids go to a space camp and are accidentally launched into space by a robot friend of theirs (named, appropriately, jinx). the space scenes are then long, repetitive (the same accident happens twice) and either cheesy or frightening depending on your point of view. adults will be bored and cheesed out, kids might be scared as the way this was filmed really leaves an eerie sense about it.<br /><br />there is a budding romance, but unlike the shuttle -- this never takes off. why it is included in the first place is unclear, except maybe to add extra tension between the characters - but it failed if that was the idea.<br /><br />a young lea thompson should be quirky and attractive, right? i mean, "back to the future" is great. but no, she was irritating and average-looking. not someone you'd want to date, have as a friend or even consider as a role model. joaquin phoenix? he's really lucky he ever appeared in movies again this performance. maybe he can act like mikey in the life cereal commercials, but he doesn't seem to know how to be a normal boy. he doesn't fit in on screen and i don't think we can identify with him at home. i actually would have been happier if he had never returned to earth.<br /><br />i don't recommend this film to anyone.
