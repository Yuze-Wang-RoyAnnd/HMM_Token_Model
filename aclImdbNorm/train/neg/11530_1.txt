in the last 10 years i have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling organizations, managed many pro wrestlers (including 2 backyard wrestling stars), worked on 2 different wrestling tv programs and did voice-overs and commentary for many wrestling dvd's. i have never witnessed the level of outright amateurish stupidity, lack of talent and skill, and shoddy production quality found in splatter rampage wrestling. to even list this as a wrestling video of any kind is an outright misuse of the term. shot with low-dollar video cameras, it's essentially home videos of kids play-fighting in back yards. the sound quality is bad, the video quality is bad, and the acting is horrendous. the "wrestlers" wear makeshift costumes with hand-drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hit each other with a variety of items and halfway imitate wrestling moves. sometimes the "matches" are on the grass. sometimes on a back yard trampoline. all are poorly acted and executed with a shameless lack of any wrestling skill. in short, don't bother with this stinker. whether your interest in this dvd is entertainment or academic (both in my case), you will be terribly disappointed.
