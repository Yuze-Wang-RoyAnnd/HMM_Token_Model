absence of a good plot, absence of decent acting, absence of good cinematography, absence of decent looking special effects...need i go on? review may contain spoilers. the actors appear to be reading their lines, and not very well at that. most of the "actors" were acting like they were in a second grade play. the story appeared to have been written by one of the aforementioned second graders...it's not really all that convoluted...it's just so simple and dumb, that a person thinks they must be missing something so they think it is convoluted. nope it's not, it's exactly as simple as you think it is. i understood the "film", that's how i know that it stunk! most of the film just had people sitting around talking(reading their lines), trying to look sinister. the narrator was annoying. the "special effects" were laughable. i love low budget movies. i also like carolyn munro, tom savini, jack scarry, and michael berrymore...just not in this movie...you can tell they weren't getting paid, or weren't getting paid much, because neither their hearts nor their talents were in it. i love tony todd...however, he was only adequate in this movie. in fact, tony todd's performance is the only reason i gave it 3 stars instead of 1...and tony was only in it for a whole two minutes (seriously)! i would suggest to fast forward the dvd to the two minute tony todd segment. if i had gone to the theater, and paid more than a dollar to see this "film" i would have been p.o.'d and demanded my money back. hopefully the people who made this will do better next time.
