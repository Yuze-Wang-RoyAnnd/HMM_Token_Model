yes, the first "howling" was a classic. a rather good werewolf movie that i admit started slowly, but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a cute werewolf only to be gunned down on camera. yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure...well forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film. oh sure, they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did, but they go from the little cozy retreat from the first movie to transylvania or somewhere here where they must battle evil magician werewolves or something. i often wonder what in the world christopher lee was doing in this movie, however i read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before, but still read the script before you take a role. maybe you could have gotten into "an american werewolf in london" hell that could have been possible. it was set in london after all. heck, werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene. in fact, the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the one gal started talking loudly and this one dude's ear's started bleeding.
