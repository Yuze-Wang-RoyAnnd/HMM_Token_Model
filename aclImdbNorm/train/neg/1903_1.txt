this movie should be shown to film school students as an example of what not to do. the original kicked some major tire squealing butt, this horrible disaster breaks the cardinal rule of bruckheimer films, which is: we all know they suck, but they have great action. this film has no action. this film is boring. where are the cars? where are the chases? where's the tension? where's the suspense? where's the rush? where!!?? this isn't really a movie at all, it's a bad commercial. 50 cars in 24 hours? that is wrong. they have 3 days to steal them, the ad is wrong. how bad is that? the leads acting is stiff, wooden and forced. the villain, the cop, the others...who cares. they utter their pointless lines, they serve the illogical plot. they slog through it the best they can as the music video director says "don't worry we'll make a lot of fast cuts and no one will notice how bad the film is" or "we'll fix it with lots of loud music" the "script" isn't really a script at all, it's more like a list of cliches with an ending that is a total ripoff of: -------warning - possible spoiler------ 5------4-----3-----2-----1------ the fugitive. the biggest crime of all is the underuse of vinnie jones, man....this is the baddest, coolest mofo since jules in pulp fiction. and what do they do!? they make him a mute who's hardly in the film! make vinnie the main villain and he could have saved the film. how could they have been so dumb? how? how? why? the original film is very entertaining with a cool trick at the end that gets the driver away. the original has a great 40 minute chase that delivers! go find the original. or if you're craving some real car chase action go rent ronin. the chases in ronin raised the bar by which all other car chases will now be judged. bruckheimer and cage had all that money, all those resources, all that experience, and they can't even come close to matching a film made 25 years ago for $250,000? how can that be? you feel like you got ripped off after seeing this movie. where i was once excited to see coyote ugly, remember the titans and pearl harbor, now i say: god help us all. <br /><br />
