5 minutes into this movie i was hyperventilating, shaking, and writhing in pain. and not in the good way. the story is about a troupe of idiotic children making prank phone calls to a psycho which is always a good idea. turns out psychos don't like prank phone calls because in 2 minutes time he's at their door killing poor williams mom and dad. well skip ahead 15 years and guess what? still prank phone calling people. yep you would of thought that a horrible murder would of deterred them from doing that ever again but no. so after about two hours later and way too many scream ripoffs i realized that this movie gave me nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth and a severe urge to take my own life. this piece of crap isn't even worth laughing at the shoddy production, the "acting", or rutger haurs dwindling career. i love crappy horror movies but this is the most unsatisfying piece i've ever seen. just don't.
