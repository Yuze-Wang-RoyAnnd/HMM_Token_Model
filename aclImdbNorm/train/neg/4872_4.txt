production line collection of fart jokes that pretends 'babe' was never made; the writers clearly hoped that the gimmick of seeing animals talk would be enough to keep the movie going. it's not. eddie murphy sells out yet again as a doctor who rediscovers his forgotten childhood gift for understanding the incessant and witless chatter of guinea pigs, tigers, rats, dogs and pigeons. the voice cast is impressive (albert brooks, julie kavner, reni santoni, john leguizamo, garry shandling, ellen degeneres, paul reubens, brian doyle-murray) but the script is so unimaginative, charmless and depressingly unfunny that the whole thing rattles down the bin chute pretty quickly.
