i saw this movie at a 'sneak preview' and i must honestly confess that i do not like films with meryl streep that much. this picture was the worst. half the theatre did not return after the break halfway the film. i couldnt blame them, if this wasn't a true story there had been absolutely no need for the second half of the picture. just before the film goes forward in time about ten years i myself was expecting the credits to appear.
