if alien, jurassic park and countless other sci fi horror movies are your cup of tea, add a lot of sugar and you'll get this one down. the film begins in jolly old england around 1100ad and then jumps to present day california. our hero carver (dean cain) is the new security chief and military advisor for a science lab 400 feet underground. he arrives (carver is also a helicopter pilot) with the lead scientist and we soon find out it's a cloning lab and they have something newly found to clone. is it a dinosaur or what? as with the above movies, all hell breaks loose and our characters start getting picked off. the special effects on the monster are pretty good for a "direct to video" movie and dean cain does what he gets paid for. but forget the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before. again, don't go in with high expectations and you'll be ok.
