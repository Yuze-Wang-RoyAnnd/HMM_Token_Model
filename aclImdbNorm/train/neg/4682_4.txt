yep, lots of shouting, screaming, cheering, arguing, celebrating, fist clinching, high fiving & fighting. you have a general idea as to why, but can never be 100% certain. a naval knowledge would be an advantage for the finer points, but then you'd probably spot the many flaws. not an awful film & hackman & washington are their usual brilliant, but the plot was one you could peg pretty early on. i'm still waiting to see a submarine film where people get on with each other & don't argue, but then you probably wouldn't have a film.<br /><br />4/10
