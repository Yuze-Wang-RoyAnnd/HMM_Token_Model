an interesting concept vampirism having something to do with a virus.(but done several times by now) overall the movie is too long and drags a bit. the editing could have been tighter. i am sorry to hear about the problem with the credits. maybe the movie was rushed to market. the lighting was too dark in places. but the worst technical problem is the audio. the level was good enough to hear the dialog, but many of the interiors have a echo sound to them, which is very distracting. either they were not careful in the recording, or the sound mixing could have been better. also too much background noise got through. the should have gotten someone to do sound effects for the martial arts scenes. the tinny clank of swords hitting together was not the sound of an epic battle. especially in the combat scenes the editing needed to be tighter.<br /><br />also the acting was a bit flat. i am sorry, but when i see that the same person writes and stars in a movie, in my experience it is a red flag.<br /><br />but it was a good effort so i gave it a 4.
