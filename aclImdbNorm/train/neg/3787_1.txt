i must be that one guy in america that didn't like this movie. i guess this just wasn't my style or something, i just don't see what's so fascinating about it, this was *barely entertaining, let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. <br /><br />it's about a guy that came from nothing, and goes on to become a drug lord. pretty simple way to describe an entire movie, and that's exactly my feeling about the entire movie. contrary to what a lot of people think, just because a movie is about mafias/drug trade/criminal groups doesn't automatically make it a great movie, don't forget good storytelling.
