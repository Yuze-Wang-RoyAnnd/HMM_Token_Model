i go to a lot of movies, often i bring my 5 year old son, i am so glad i did not bring him to this one. there are many references to sex and a skinny dipping scene, however, that is not the primary reason i would not take him to it. the trailers lead you to believe it is a light-hearted comedy; nevertheless, virtually all of the funny moments are in the previews. i kept waiting for it to get interesting, funny, or anything but serious; however, i nearly fell asleep as the plot-less story dragged on. i understand that dogs can be great company, that being said, the entire story focused on a poorly behaving dog that the owners were not savvy enough to train. if a human caused this much damage and mayhem that person would be banned. the worst movie i've ever seen with jenifer aniston or owen wilson, a waste of their talent. the best way to sum up this movie is, couple gets unruly dog, couple falls in love with dog, dog dies, couple sad. the end.
