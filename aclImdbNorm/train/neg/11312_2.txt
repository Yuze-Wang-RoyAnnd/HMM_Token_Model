this movie deserves credit for its original approach. it combines elements of theater, film, and epic storytelling. unfortunately, it falls flat on all levels. the films biggest weakness is it's unwillingness to commit to anything; it has camp, moralistic, and epic elements without ever committing to any of them. as for the story itself, chretien de troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable, unbearably innocent percival into a most ungallant and rude churl.<br /><br />most likely two types of people will see this, francophiles or arthuriophiles. speaking as one of the latter, i found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby, disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story.
