from the decrepit ranks of the already over-saturated 'hillybilly horror' sub-genre comes this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks. sound familiar? well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre. there is absolutely new here. the film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clich'es (deformed hicks, a peaceful family turned gun-toting killers when push comes to show, the rebellious daughter, the one 'freak' who's good at heart, etcetera...), but does even that half-heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time. this is forgettable dreck, but humorously enough lead j.d. hart once starred in a movie called "films that suck" earlier in his career, quite an ironic omen indeed.<br /><br />my grade: d-
