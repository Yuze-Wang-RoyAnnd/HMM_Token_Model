in sum, overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes! the director and co-writer says he wanted to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. well, at least here, these two mix like vinegar and oil. to boot, the comedy is not very funny and juvenile. additionally, the film is not really realistic. liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in french hospitals. i watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on. eventually toward the end i fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex-lover's son. by that time i was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover, marriage of convenience and a nutty ex-lover. at times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them - either ismael or primarily nora. to the detriment of the audience, viewpoints keep changing from nora and ismael, her ex-lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital. there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed. the epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub-plots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball's chance in hell. the actors do their best and are appealing, but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing, editing and lack of focus.
