with this abc family attempt of the hit blockbuster "cheaper by the dozen" comes an obnoxious amount of corny dialogue, shallow plot lines, and cheesy comebacks. with about two good actors among many wanna-be's, this movie was a major disappointment. its a hollywood-wannabe ditto of an already bad plot. then, because they needed a lot of actors, that meant that they'd probably be more lenient. so the acting wasn't five-star. the plot moved fairly fast, and the twists were bad and had horrible timing. the junction of characters and the "end relationships" were also too mushy and clich'ed for me. spare yourself and rent something better.
