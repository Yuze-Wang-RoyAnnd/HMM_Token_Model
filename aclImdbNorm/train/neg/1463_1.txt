just imagine the real hitler, who was a master of propaganda and speech, would have been such a mumbling moron as carlyle portrayed him in this film.<br /><br />nobody would have followed him, not even a desperate, unemployed guy in the 1920s.<br /><br />this is just a hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda itself, disguised as "true history".<br /><br />i pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show. carlyle and the producers didn't get anything right with this.<br /><br />why was hitler able to win so many people, a whole county for his ideas if we was such a sausage? why did people follow him to death? by portraying him as such a loser they make their own film totally unbelievable. this film is a mixture of old ww2 propaganda and mtv urban myths about one of the most important persons of the last century. imagine a film about churchill where the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 mins. <br /><br />this film is a disgrace and i wonder how they could talk an actor like carlyle into this dreck.
