my grandmother took me and my sister out to see this movie when it came out in theaters back in 1998, and so we happily bought the tickets, the popcorn and soda, and walked right in to the theater and sat down to watch the movie. when it was over, the audience didn't applauded strongly, i remember that i heard a few people say that they didn't like it at all, i didn't like it, i thought that it was rather stupid, and not worth seeing. eddie murphy was hysterical in this, but apart from him, the whole movie was bad, i rarely laughed at the parts in this, i also remembered that the other people in the theater almost hardly even laughed. and what i really thought was bad was making the animals talk, because talking animals only exist in cartoons, in live action movies, they are totally a mutt! i said that apart from eddie murphy's hysterical twist he brings in, this movie is not worth watching, it is rather stupid.<br /><br />i have seen eddie murphy in several of movies and i thought that he was funny in those, i have just said that he was the only funny part of this movie, i also have not seen eddie murphy in the really "great" movie, the adventures of pluto nash. this movie is not a movie that i would really recommend that you see, because apart from eddie murphy, you probably are not going to like this, especially because of a lot the the talking animals in it! <br /><br />i'll give this movie a rating of 3 stars out of a possible 10 stars.
