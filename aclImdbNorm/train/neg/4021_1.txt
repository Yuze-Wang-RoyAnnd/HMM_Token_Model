this is probably the worst movie ever made it is just to bad the name of roger corman is associated with it. i could've understand it in his early years when he had lower budgets but nowadays there is no excuses for giving birth to this! i'm a "b" movie pervert and from certain people point of view all the flicks i love are put aside by "regular viewers" but take my word on this one, vampire club makes the top of my list of the best of worst.it's hard to imagine, vampires with no fangs, the music score is totally out of place,the sound effects are just not effective and finally mr.savage doesn't seem to know he is in a vampire movie at all witch is too bad 'cause he had a "not to bad" career over all. let me know i'f i'm to hard on this one cause when i don't like a movie i tend to forget about it's good side.
