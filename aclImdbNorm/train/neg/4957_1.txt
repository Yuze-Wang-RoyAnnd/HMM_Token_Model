i cant believe some people actually like this. yet still call themselves batman fans. even going as far as to say it's better than btas. which it's not. it should be plagiarism for them to use batman's name for this piece of crap. it's not batman.<br /><br />the whole premise of the show is ''if you cant defeat someone get a bigger weapon to help you'' batman isn't all about weapons. he uses his batarang and grappling hook and batmobile, thats it. he doesn't come up with some new ingenious tech every time he cant beat someone. i don't know where the hell they got the idea for a batbot. or whatever. they have ruined all the villains. mr. freeze has gone from a sympathetic scientist to a petty criminal who fell in some cryofreezing thing. catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman with a dumb costume. penguin is now a ninja with a 50 ft. tall top hat. the ventriloquist is now called scarface making the dummy the whole centerpiece for the character. they even got a dumb idea to make him a giant! wtf? and the two worst character changes are that of the joker and riddler. they have changed riddler to a gothic/retro teenage freak. and the joker to an acrobat with dreads. he looks like a bob marley wannabe. they have completely and utterly ruined batman even moreso than b&r did! i wish i could meet the creators and or writers and animators of this show so i could whack them in the head with a metal baseball bat.
