the rookie suffers from so much. there are the random musical songs interspersed through the movie, the long pointless script and enough grating slapstick to make jerry lewis blush. noonan and leavitt just don't know when to quit. it takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked. then the guys start playing japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day. it is a shame the funniest parts of the movie are when noonan and leavitt are playing the stupid, stereotyped japanese guys. but, it gets pretty tiring after switching back and forth between two sets of characters. then it just abruptly ends. even a naked julie newmar in a towel can't save this one.<br /><br />there is really little charm in the movie and it is over a half hour too long. the story just flounders along trying to set up funny situations and failing. stick to martin & lewis. at least deano had charm and jerry had that animated face.
