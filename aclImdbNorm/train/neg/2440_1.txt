koen wouters is a flemish singer and presenter. in the early ninety's he tried his hand on movies as well. but this unbelievable piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all. it also ended the acting career of dutch actress nada van nie who went on being a football-wife a tv presenter and program-maker. i actually did see this in an ( almost empty) theatre because i used to be a fan of the band of koen wouters, clouseau. i so regret spending money on it. it looks cheap, it is a terrible story and it is executed bad in every possible way. some people think it's so bad it's funny. i am not one of them. i just found it an incredible waste of time and money.
