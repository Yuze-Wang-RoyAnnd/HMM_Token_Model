what a terrible film.<br /><br />it starts well, with the title sequence, but that's about as good as it gets.<br /><br />the movie is something about rats turning into monsters and going on a killing spree. the acting isn't so much poor, but the script is pointless and the film isn't even scary despite the atmospheric music.<br /><br />it really is amazing that some group cobbled together this bag of rubbish and thought it would make a good film.<br /><br />it isn't a good film. it's trash, and i urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it! one out of ten.
