i thought this film would be a lot better then it was. it sounded like a spoof off of the spy gener, and the start of it reminded me of pleasantvil, but this film came up short.<br /><br />the plot is just to ridiculous. the kgb and soviet union in russia have started up a spy school to teach their spies' how to act like americans, but the town they set up in it for training is a bit dated, so they grab two yanks from the us to spice things up. i don't know, but this seems just to out there. it gets really odd when next to no one in this all russian town speaks in a russian accent. someone screwed up in the casting job.<br /><br />also, for a comedy this is painfully dry. there is one, two funny spots tops, and they are nothing to sing and dance about. the film in the end will likely put you to sleep.<br /><br />and, as a twisted punch in the face, this film is so pro the us it makes me sick. the movie keeps on saying again and again, the us is god and russia is the devil. this is the kind of smear campaign that was done against the japanese in world war 2. it's films like these that makes everyone think that the us is full of itself.<br /><br />this gets a 4 out of 10, and i'm being kind. it should really get a one, but the dance scene was funny, but then again it dragged far to long to be really funny.
