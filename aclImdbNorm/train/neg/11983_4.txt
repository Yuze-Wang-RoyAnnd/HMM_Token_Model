marie dressler carries this depression-era drama about a kindly bank owner, which recently aired on tcm during their april fools comedy month. if you come with the expectation of big laughs courtesy the dressler-polly moran team, you'll be disappointed, as this is really a very downbeat film. it's also very poorly made, surprisingly so considering it came from mgm. leonard smith's bare bones cinematography is strictly from the 'set up the camera and don't move it' school, frequently to the detriment of the cast, who find themselves delivering lines off screen (it's like a pan and scan print before such existed!) or having their heads cut off. the film doesn't even have a credited director, underlying the apparent fly by night nature of the production. overall, it's an unsatisfying mess, with dressler frequently over-emoting and only that bizarre, final reel dash to the bathroom to set it apart.
