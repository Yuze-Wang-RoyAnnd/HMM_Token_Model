dreadful horror sequel to "the howling". this picks off with karen white's funeral (she was killed at the end of the first film). stefan crosscoe (christopher lee sadly) arrives there and tells karen's brother ben (reb brown) that karen was a werewolf. he's going to transylvania to kill striba (sybil danning) the head werewolf. ben and a coworker of karens (annie mcenroe) join him.<br /><br />a terrible script, bad direction, inept editing and truly horrendous acting by brown and mcenroe single handedly sink this one. the werewolf effects are mostly kept in the dark--for good reason! they're terrible when you see them. subpar special effects also--although i did like the cartoon lightning that comes from danning's fingers. there's also a werewolf orgy which is particularly stupid and danning takes off her top at least eight times during the closing credits! <br /><br />there are a few good things--i found the village in transylvania amusing--it looks like it came from a universal horror flick from the 1930s! there are interesting camera tricks between transition scenes; brown and mcenroe have good bodies and lee and danning are good in this--but they can't save it. really--why did they do this? where that they hard up for money??? this is one of imdb's lowest rated movies. that alone should tell you something. supposedly danning was horrified when she saw the movie--i can understand why! a must-miss.
