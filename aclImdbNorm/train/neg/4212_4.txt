the beginning of this movie is excellent with tremendous sound and some nice humor, but once the film changes into animation it quickly loses its appeal.<br /><br />one of the reasons that was so, at least for me, was that the colors in much of the animation are too muted, with too little contrast. it doesn't look good, at least on vhs. once in a while it breaks out and looks great, but not often also, the characters come and go too quickly. for example, i would have liked to have seen more of "moby dick." when the film starts to drag, however, it picks up again with the entrance of the dragon and then the film finishes strong. <br /><br />overall, just not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated films of the last dozen years.
