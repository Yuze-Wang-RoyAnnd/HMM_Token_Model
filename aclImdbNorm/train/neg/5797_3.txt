i was at first disgusted with director sun-woo jang because i had felt that he cheated me. jang had the potential to create a strong, deeply emotional film about sex and its effects on people, but instead chose to focus his strength on the pornography element more than the actual human element. i couldn't see the characters at first and his sloppy introduction which blended both realism and cinema together was amateurish at best
