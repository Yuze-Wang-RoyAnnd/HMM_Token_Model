down to earth is about lance barton, a black comedian who gets hit by a truck. he goes to heaven and he gets to get another body. lance gets the body of charles wellington, a white guy. so lance does a few things in the body of charles. the movie has a few laughs, but it's nothing special. it's a good movie if you're a fan of chris rock. madagascar, the 2005 animated comedy, is better. this is a good movie, but chris rock has done way better things than this. it will only make you laugh about 4 times the whole movie. and it's not really laugh-out-loud funny. you'll laugh to yourself and you might giggle, but you definitely won't be rolling on the floor laughing.
