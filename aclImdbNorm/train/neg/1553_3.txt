this movie really deserves the mst3k treatment. a pseudo-ancient fantasy hack-n-slash tale featuring twin barbarian brothers with a collective iq of hot water, character names that seem to have been derived from a mad libs book, and such classic lines as "hold her down and uncover her belly!", the barbarians crosses over into the "so bad, it's good" territory.
