considering john doe apparently inspired kyle xy's creator i was expecting its pilot to be quite interesting. however i probably had too high expectations because i was quite disappointed by it. first they turned the protagonist into a freak who had the crazy idea of showing off his amazing knowledge in front of an audience, in a public area. so after that scene i began to worry that it was just entertainment. but the problem is that it got worse as none of the other characters were properly introduced. they focused too much on john doe which made the story far less intriguing. i was also slightly disappointed by dominic purcell's performance because i found he didn't make a believable john doe. an other problem was the police story. it really felt like d'ej`a vu and it wasn't a pleasant sensation. it leads us to the worst issue in the bunch, the episodic format. i could already see the fillers coming one after an other.<br /><br />so overall i was very disappointed by it and don't recommend it to anyone. considering how bad it was i better understand now why the show got canceled. in some way i have the impression that it missed its target, developing characters to help the protagonist find his own identity. it's sad because there was potential, like the people he met at the club. the production quality was also quite good and the casting correct. but i'll never know if it got better, probably not, because i don't plan to watch the next episode.
