i've been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet the story line wasn't good at all. the play of the actors weren't any better.<br /><br />of course shahrukh khan was there yet he wasn't enough to make this movie "credible" and interesting.<br /><br />i've read that this movie was based on the novel of flaubert "madame bovary" yet for me i didn't see it matching with the indian mentality.<br /><br />in general we buy movie to dream and have a good time, not to waste our time and change our mood into worse. i just can't understand how it could get such a "high" vote with an average of 6.8/10.<br /><br />so it's the kind of movie you should run away & ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it! you will just waste your time unless if you like "dark movie" with "strange and non sense story".
