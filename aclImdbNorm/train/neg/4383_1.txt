worst bob hope comedy ever(and that includes some heavy competition). hope, on an island with sailors, dreams aloud of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl "steering his ship". somebody certainly steered this hope-hackery over the cliff, as it features phyllis diller and gina lollobrigida and still can't work up any laughs or excitement. where's bing crosby when you really need him?
