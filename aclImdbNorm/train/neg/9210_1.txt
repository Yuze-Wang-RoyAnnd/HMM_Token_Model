i'd completely forgotten about this film until now. this was the most blatant and worst attempt to demonise a hobby that i have ever seen. it's message seemed to be : "don't teenagers use their imagination; they might take games seriously, go mad and hurt people." i can only guess that the unimaginative writers of this piece thought that d&d style games are form of evil ritual or arcane worship.
