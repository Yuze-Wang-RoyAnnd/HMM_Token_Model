in 1967, mine workers find the remnants of an ancient vanished civilization named abkani that believe there are the worlds of light and darkness. when they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something evil slipped through before the gate was closed. twenty-two years ago, the government paranormal research agency bureau 713 was directed by professor lionel hudgens (matthew walker), who performed experiments with orphan children. on the present days, one of these children is the paranormal investigator edward carnby (christian slater), who has just gotten an abkani artifact in south america, and is chased by a man with abilities. when an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night, he discloses that demons are coming back to earth. with the support of the anthropologist aline cedrac (tara reid) and the leader of the bureau 713, cmdr. richard burke (stephen dorff), and his squad, they battle against the evil creatures.<br /><br />in spite of having a charismatic good cast, leaded by christian slater, tara reid and stephen dorff, "alone in the dark" never works and is a complete mess, without development of characters or plot. the reason may be explained by the "brilliant" interview of director uwe boll in the extras of the dvd, where he says that "videogames are the bestsellers of the younger generations that are not driven by books anymore". further, his target audience would be people aged between twelve and twenty-five years old. sorry, but i find both assertions disrespectful with the younger generations. i have a daughter and a son, and i know many of their friends and they are not that type of stupid stereotype the director says. further, imdb provides excellent statistics to show that mr. uwe boll is absolutely wrong. my vote is three.<br /><br />title (brazil): "alone in the dark
