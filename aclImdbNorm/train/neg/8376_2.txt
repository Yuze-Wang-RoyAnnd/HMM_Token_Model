"little man", now on dvd, is a wayans brothers flop. it's the tale of a smaller than a midget criminal played by marlon wayans, who hides a diamond in a lady's purse after a heist. he and his partner tracy morgan cook up the genius plan to disguise marlon as a baby and plant him at the lady's home. he then goes through all sorts of "home alone" or "child's play" like mayhem to get the jewel back and be treated like a baby. i was surprised by how low the humor was in this film. the jokes have been done in other places so many times, that they aren't cute or funny. i almost think the movie might have been funnier if they didn't use cgi and used the small actor who marlon's face was pasted over. in watching the deleted scenes (minus cgi) this actor was funny in a mini-me like way, but they chose a different route. a few cameos and tracy morgan make some funny scenes..spend your rental fee $ on borat if you want some real laughs these days.<br /><br />http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
