i thought the movie was ok but very disappointed that they didn't capture the true image of his life. i was so anticipating to see his mother being an actual jamaican, that it's driving me crazy. just watching the beginning of the movie told me that the movie was not accurate. which i completely lost interest just a matter of seconds from the beginning of the movie. i'm very disappointed, that's like watching a biography story on mark anthony and having arnold play the part. i don't know what the writer was thinking missing a valuable piece of the movie which i'm sure his mother played a huge role in his life. i will say the movie was ok besides the major fla!!!!!!
