this film is not funny. it is not entertaining. it does not contain one single second of originality or intelligence, nor does it lead you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situation. added to that it's about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory. it's as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who had never actually met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult man would be like. this movie is boring, obnoxiously mind-numbing, and at times offensive and disgusting. at most, it contains one or two moments that make you laugh. also, it seems twice as long as its 85 minute running time.
