although properly warned i actually sat down to watch this movie. in part because i usually give every movie an even break, and because i thought that a single movie couldn't be that bad. i stand corrected. not even george kennedy, barry bostwick or ben stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks. only once during this humor forsaken travesty of a spoof did i laugh. namely during the simon says scene. the other jokes are either poorly carried out or simply plain unfunny. and some of them you actually see coming a mile away. this movie just hasn't got what it takes to be a good parody like airplane! (i+ii), naked gun (i+ii+iii), or scary movie. they all had a. funny gags, b. good dialog and most important of all c. unforgettable quotes. men in white has got d. none of the above. to call this movie bad would be a gross understatement. avoid this movie anyway you can! consider yourselves warned!
