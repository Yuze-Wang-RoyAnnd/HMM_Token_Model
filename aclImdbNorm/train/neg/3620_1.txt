i tried watching this abomination of the cinema when i was five years old; i have never been the same since. filled to the brim with drug-induced images that reek of the common ravings of your average asylum resident, this "movie", despite its colorful appearance, is not for humans, especially not children.<br /><br />it starts out innocently enough with a poor boy who ruins his classmate's drum by (wait for it) putting his head through it; yes, putting his head through it. but fear not, my friends! he is quickly consoled by his chirping flute, which is weird enough, i'll grant you, but still acceptable.<br /><br />then: the movie morphs into a combination of wizard of oz and where the wild things are, but loses all the "warm and fuzzy" aspects of either of these two books.<br /><br />so, this seven-foot yellow relative of barney, befriends this poor boy and plunges him even deeper into despair.<br /><br />and, to add the pleasant array of horrific themes, a carnivorous boat, formerly a friend of the motley crew of hobbling grandfather clocks and doped-up "dragons", is added to the mix of mayhem.<br /><br />the most comforting image in the midst of this chaos is the villain, aptly dubbed "witchiepoo" (?). of course, she has problems of her own: what with an obvious plastic mask constricting her facial expressions to having to deal with a broomstick whose gas level always seemed to be at its lowest at the most inopportune moments. as a result of this, one of her favorite pastimes was nose-diving into the body of water that separated the land of pufnstuf from her degenerate, decaying abode (i don't know where i would have preferred to live).<br /><br />in summary, this movie is terrifying...<br /><br />if you want to watch the movie that has similar effects on its audience as the exorcist, then this one is for you. enjoy.
