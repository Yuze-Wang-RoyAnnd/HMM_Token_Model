this early adam sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989. his character's constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from sandler than the script. the film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films, such as big daddy or even the corny billy maddison. unfortunately, sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny manner when this film was made, much like his character. the majority of the film's "jokes" come from sandler having conversations with himself, usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he's too ugly and can't get women. the film is hard to watch too because it doesn't treat itself like a real film. sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film, often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content. the film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch. i immediately wanted to forget i even saw this film after it was over, for fear that if more found out about it, it would ruin sandler's career. pass this one up at the video store, i rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.
