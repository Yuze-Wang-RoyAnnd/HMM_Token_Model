the movie had a cute opening, i truly believed i was in for one of the best romantic comedies i've seen in a while... there was something particular "foreign" about the way the movie was set up, realistic yet somewhat abstract and mystical. but then the story line started becoming more and more unrealistic. to say that the ending was corny and predictable would almost be an understatement... the most typical romantic ending where everything goes great for every 'likable' character. a scene where the main character realises that he has made a mistake and chases the "woman of his dreams" only to confess his love for her in front of a sympathetic crowd of on- lookers. come on. in the end, the 'good guys' win, 'bad guys' loose... you get the picture. a waste of a potentially interesting movie.
