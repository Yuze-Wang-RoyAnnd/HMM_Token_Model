the 1980s tv show, updated with fresh female flesh, and raunchy language. "the dukes of hazzard" passed me by; it was not repeated whenever i was in front of the television in either new york or california; or, i probably would have watched. still, from somewhere (like the clips accompanying this film's updated 2005 release), i knew it was about a fast, orange dodge charger - and, the "general lee" is still good to go. <br /><br />hunky cousins seann william scott and johnny knoxville (as bo and luke duke) are the new riders of the orange sage. beautiful jessica simpson (as daisy) fills her skimpy short well - but, even her arousing pink bikini can't beat off the competition from a dormitory full of bouncing, topless coeds. the too stupid plot involves a graying burt reynolds (as "boss" hogg) threatening to turn hazzard county into a strip-mine.<br /><br />** the dukes of hazzard (7/27/05) jay chandrasekhar ~ seann william scott, johnny knoxville, jessica simpson, burt reynolds
