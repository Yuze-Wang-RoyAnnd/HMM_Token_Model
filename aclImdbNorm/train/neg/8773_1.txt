if you have seen very less films, this might be a big one for you. if you have seen lot of films, this is a joke. the acting of real heroes is portrayed very badly. not to mention, there are songs, there are lot of flashbacks, and most importantly, the fighting scenes are stupidily performed. new characters, good direction, would have done a better job, but since it contains all the bollywood heros/heroines, you can predict whats going to happen next. you do not feel sad when something happens, the emotions they protray is terrible, mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other hindi movies. it suppose to be a realistic movie, but it fails to show. there are times you wondering, you have thousands of army vehical filled with soldiers moving and the pakistanis are bombing at them and none of their bomb hits them. are the pakis really bad at aiming or the director made them look stupid? there were only a few characters acting that was very good, but as far it is concerned with plot, action, it is poorly directed. this movie could have been short if they took out songs, flashbacks, stick to the point.
