watch the original with the same title from 1944! this made for tv movie, is just god-awful! although it does use (as far as i can tell) almost the same dialog, it just doesn't work! is it the acting, the poor directing? ok so it's made for tv, but why watch a bad copy, when you can get your hands on the superb original? especially as you'll be spoiled to the plot and won't enjoy the original as much, as if you've watched it first! <br /><br />there are a few things that are different from the original (it's shorter for once), but all are for the worse! the actors playing the parts here, just don't fit the bill! you just don't believe them and who could top edward g. robinsons performance from the original? if you want, only watch it after you've seen the original and even then you'll be very brave, if you watch it through! it's almost sacrilege!
