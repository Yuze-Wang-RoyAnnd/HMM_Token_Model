two houses, one street, one phone booth, one car, a girl next door, a boy next door and a zombie. this list of ingredients should suffice for a great horror movie. all you need is some blue light, ambient music and...done. not in the hands of dutch director van rouveroy though! <br /><br />i like to organize "bad movie evenings" from time to time. the concept is really simple: get some booze, get some film-loving friends, and immerse yourself in the worst cinema can offer. for such an evening this peace of filth is one of the best. laughs guaranteed!<br /><br />the bizarre thing is, van rouveroy is still defending her film as if it were a great achievement. to be a witness to this you'll have to listen to the dvd's commentary track. again: disbelieve and laughs guaranteed!
