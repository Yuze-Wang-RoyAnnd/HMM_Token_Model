we have reached the ceiling of implausibility with this movie. basically, dinosaurs come aboard this ship piloted by some weird old fart named neweyes(which i needed after i watched this movie). apparently, neweyes hears the wishes of children everywhere and decides that he should grant the wish of children that dinosaurs be brought into modern times to be seen by everybody for shameless exploitation. the dinosaurs eat this stuff that makes them smarter(too bad the screenwriters didn't have it). by the way, does it seem weird that out of all the wishes of the children in the world, neweyes grants the wish of bringing dinosaurs to modern times? why not grant the wishes of kids to stop famine? disease? war? i mean come on! doesn't neweyes have anything better to do with all this power he has??? finally, when the dinosaurs get to modern times they start singing, dancing and wrecking havoc(basically the kind of thing you might see on a bad lsd trip, i mean where else could you see a t-rex playing golf and jumping on a balloon of spider-man?). they end up in the circus and neweyes brother screweyes(???) makes the kids that have befriended the dinosaurs sign a blank contract. why? why would kids sign a blank contract??? screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take some..."brain-drain" that he will let the children go. the dinosaurs instead of tearing apart the evil screweyes limb from limb, give in and agree to his terms. what?! this is stupid! they could have just menaced him, made him drop the contract, eaten it then walked off with the kids. i think the filmmakers were trying to show that violence is bad, which is a moot point when finally the dinosaurs escape and a bunch of crows envelop screweyes and apparently completely eat him. oh yeah, that's not violent at all! we're back makes no sense, it's not fun, it's goofy, it's stupid, poorly written and contains some of the biggest plot holes ever committed to film. even for a kid's film... this is bad.
