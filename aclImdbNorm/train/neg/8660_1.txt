this is possibly one of the worst giant killer animal movies i have ever seen. it follows the typical premise of a laboratory experiment gone wrong and a giant crocodile with a rapid growth chemical in it escapes. the monster looks way to much like a dinosaur, having big tyranosaurous-like hind legs, when it should just look like an over-sized crocodile. everything about this movie is unoriginal and it constantly oozes "cliche", minute after minute. why are there always two drunken redneck hunters out after dark who separate? plus, there's always a guy and girl who share a lame, obvious love interest while they are in life threatening situations. to much has already been said by me and i feel as if i'm wasting my time writing this...
