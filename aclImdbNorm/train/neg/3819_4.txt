t.z. post, college professor, receives a false letter stating he inherited $750,000. now with financial means, he withdraws his life savings of $4,000, and decides to finally going out & live. after having his baggage sent on a train to chicago, he meets a traveling vaudeville troupe, and decides there good enough for him to put on a show on broadway. the night of the show, poor prof. post has to hide from his creditors, settle the relationship woes between girlfriend pansy and & floozy diva eleanor, and still make sure the show must go on. after watching many of keaton's silent gems, this one is a pain to sit through, but i felt, it could have been a lot worse. supporting cast durante, todd, & selwyn come off very annoying at times, but still likeable. a pre-charlie chan toler is good as the frustrated show director. 90% of the script is badly written as mgm is trying to pass this off as a poor man's marx bros. film where many of the sight gags fall flat from the beginning. compiled with keaton's drinking problems at the time, this movie just is a sad moment in buster's life. rating- 3.
