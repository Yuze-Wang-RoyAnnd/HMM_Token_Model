i am completely baffled as to why this film is even liked, let alone held in such high regard, especially by so many critics who are, otherwise, quite sensible.<br /><br />there is one key word which describes this film to its core - irritating.<br /><br />the most easily explained example of this is the director's use - or, more accurately, abuse - of music. in the first half, a really dull reggae tune is played about three times (when once is too often). but in the second half, the mommas and the papas "california dreamin'" is played at least seven times, usually at top volume. godsakes, whether you liked the song or not beforehand, you'd be thoroughly sick of it by the end. just think, some people claim to have seen this film four or five times. this means they've listened to california dreamin either 28 or 35 times.....<br /><br />all of this needless hyper-repetition (it contributes nothing to the story) could possibly be excused if the remainder of the film had any lingering merit, or if the story was in any way involving.<br /><br />but it ain't.<br /><br />the only aspect i found likeable was bridgette lin's charging around and still playing asia the invincible in a raincoat and sunnies. even this wore off fairly quickly.<br /><br />i'm sure this film's undeserved high reputation will convince many poor suckers to go and see it.<br /><br />i can only warn you - if you've never seen a hk movie before, don't start with this one.<br /><br />if you feel compelled to watch it, avoid at all costs seeing it in a cinema. the fast-forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here.<br /><br />you have been warned !
