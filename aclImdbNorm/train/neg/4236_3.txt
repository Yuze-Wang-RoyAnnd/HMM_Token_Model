well, if you like pop/punk, punk, ska, and a tad bit of modern psycho billy, then seeing the live performances are about the only thing worth watching. this movie has tons and tons of band cameos, along with president of troma, lloyd kaufman as a semi-major role, and lots of goofy death scenes. sounds like it may be good, right? well, the deaths keep coming, and repeatedly to many different bands of the warp tour and the fans at the event. some of the deaths start of stylish, but then they are recycled over and over, to the point of being completely repetitive. almost everyone dies of having their head smashed, or intestines being pulled from their stomach. the gore looks as if it was from andreas schnaas' "zombie 90: extreme pestilence"; with this being the "watered-down type blood", but now that movie is actually decent, and provides humor-something that this movie terribly lacks. sure, the movie is made by doug sakmann from troma, it's got great low-budget potential, and it tries...but just too hard. everything is overly meant to be funny in this movie, and thats what brings it down. everything tries to be too comic and goofy, by using intentional bad acting, an overuse of pointless deaths, and doing the same thing...over and over. it's basically "mulva: zombie ass-kicker", "chairman of the board", or any movie you have made with your friends: it's funny to those who made it, and that's about it.<br /><br />great potential, great idea, great use of effects-but it's the same thing...over and over: a band plays, a band dies, fans die. everyone dies, blood is sprayed everywhere, the process is repeated.<br /><br />the question is for these types of movies-which is basically 'bad slap-stick'-do they try too hard, or not at all?
