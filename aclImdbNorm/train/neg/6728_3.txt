this film is hardly good, not great at all. a few memorable scenes and the unlucky choice of pairing norma jean with an actual actress. jane russell has it all working for her, marilyn's lesser woman and/or actress. one can only wonder why this is considered being one of the highlights of her lame career. 3/10
