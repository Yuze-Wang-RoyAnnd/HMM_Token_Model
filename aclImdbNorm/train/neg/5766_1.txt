this was thought to be the flagship work of the open source community, something that would stand up and scream at the worlds media to take notice as we're not stuck in the marketing trap with our options in producing fine work with open source tools. after the basic version download ( die hard fan here on a dial-up modem ) eventually got here i hit my first snag. media player, mplayer classic & winamp failed to open it on my xp box, and then totem, xine & kaffeine failed to open it on my suse server. mplayer managed to run it flawlessly. going to be hard to spread the word about it if normal users cant even open it...<br /><br />the film. beautiful soundtrack, superb lighting, masterful camera work and flawless texturing. everything looked real. and then the two main characters moved.... and spoke... and the movie died for me. everything apart from the lip syncing and the actual animation of the two main characters ( except for proog in the dancing scene ) looked fluid and totally alive. the two main characters were animated so poorly that at times i was wondering if there are any games on the market at the moment with cut-scenes that entail less realism than this.<br /><br />any frame in the movie is fantastic.. as a frame, and the thing is great if neither actors are moving. i'm so glad i haven't actually recommended this to anyone. i'd ruin my reputation.<br /><br />oh, and final fantasy had a more followable and cunningly devised plot.<br /><br />this movie would get 10 stars if it wasn't for the tragedy that sits right there on the screen.
