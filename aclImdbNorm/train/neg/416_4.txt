(some spoilers) - as if you wouldn't know how it'll end<br /><br />my expectations for hollow man were high. a very good commercial, a director like paul verhoeven and actors like kevin bacon and elisabeth shue, plus a very interesting theme - invisibility. every premise for a great movie was accomplished. unfortunately these things didn't matter at all. the movie was very very week, without suspense and awfully predictable. <br /><br />it's all about a bunch of scientists who discovered invisibility. after the tests on animals succeeded, kevin bacon decides to test it on himself. once he's invisible, he changes completely, realizing the advantages of not being seen. from this to murder there's a very thin line.<br /><br />hollow man is an ill movie. it suffers of the disease that many new movies have: the special effects. from a challenging theme that could have lead the producers to a great tensed psychological thriller, verhoeven ruins everything focusing only on special effects, without giving a damn about the real value of the movie. i must admit, the fx are awesome, probably the best i have seen since matrix, but that's not enough to make a movie good. actually that's the problem with the movies today. just like verhoeven, most directors care only about spectacular scenes - and nothing more. the exceptions are very few, and probably the matrix is the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plot.<br /><br />after starship troopers, verhoeven disappoints again. in stead of a great film, hm is cr*p. there are only 2 reasons why you could watch this movie: 1. the special effects 2. the joke with superman and wonder woman (i won't spoil this moment for you...)<br /><br />okay, so what went wrong with the movie? everything. let's see what i can remember.<br /><br />--- it's not tensed at all. it should've been, but it's not.<br /><br />--- it's too predictable . you know from the beginning who will die and who will live.<br /><br />--- in stead of focusing on the psychological part, verhoeven cares only about the effects.<br /><br />--- very many cliches. <br /><br />--- of course the bad guy wakes up a few times before dying.<br /><br />--- just like in every low quality horror, the first rule is to let the characters separate as much as possible. every time there is somebody alone in the lab, perfect victim for bacon.<br /><br />--- some holes in the plot. example: at the beginning, bacon has to scan his finger to enter the lab. after he's invisible, how can he do that?<br /><br />--- the ending: absolutely horrible.<br /><br />--- after shue hits bacon in the head, bacon falls down to the ground. then shue and brolin leave quietly and slowly, without looking back. is that normal? then bacon gets up, attacks them, they "kill" him again. and then shue screams "i heard an explosion" (happened minutes ago), and they suddenly run inside. didn't she hear that explosion some time before?<br /><br />--- there's a scene in which you can see the microphones hanging above the actors. come on, mr verhoeven , i expected much more from you!<br /><br />so that's about hollow man. what was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam. <br /><br />vote: 4 out of 10 (for the special effects)
