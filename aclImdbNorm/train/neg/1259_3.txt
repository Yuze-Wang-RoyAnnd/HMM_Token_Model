thank you hollywood. yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap, shallow, effect-heavy and redundant remake. the original "planet of the apes" was an intelligent and thought-provoking movie with a very clear message. it was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting. <br /><br />this movie, on the other hand, seems to have done away with pretty much all the dialogues. instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie. dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum, character interaction and development are non-existent and most of the time it's extremely hard to figure out what's going on. instead, we get a bunch of pointless action scenes, some marginally funny one-liners and some very hollow quasi-intelligent conversations. <br /><br />the only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. the make-up of the apes is magnificent, and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too. however, this does not distract from the fact that "planet of the apes (2001)" is a very shallow and simplistic movie, filled with paper-thin characters, stupid dialogue and a nearly non-existent plot. please hollywood, stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters.<br /><br />oh yeah, the ending did not make any sense whatsoever.<br /><br />* out of **** stars, mainly for the visuals<br /><br />
