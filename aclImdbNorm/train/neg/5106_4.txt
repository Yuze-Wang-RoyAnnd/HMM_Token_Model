alien love ( as this movie is known in britain ) is a very strange movie . i don`t mean that it`s an esoteric art house movie in the style of peter greenaway or derek jarman , i mean it`s a tvm with swearing , sex , some really good t&a , a bad script and a very retro feel . you can just imagine someone like john hughes directing this ten years earlier , though of course he would have cut out the t&a <br /><br />going back to the bad script , one of the problems is that few of the characters have any type of motivation especially amanda . why does she pick up connie at the bar ? just so she could meet an alien ? do you see what i mean about retro ? et , short circuit and a whole lot of other movies from the mid 1980s had this type of plot with most of them being more defined and convincing than the one seen here . the storyline continues to follow an ill defined , unconvincing and illogical path <br /><br />that said i did find alien love watchable and not only down to the t&a on display . as a a sci-fi sex comedy it`s much better than flesh gordon and earth girls are easy
