funny how many of the people who say this is far superior to romero's version tend to be very young (judging by their other posts). what we have here is a slick, action packed, gory and "whoopee" filled 2 hour mtv video. frantic editing, pop-video camera work, "cool" music blah blah blah<br /><br />actually it ain't bad compared to other recent remakes (chainsaw massacre was a total disaster)... pretty good acting all round, totally predictable in the "who will die next" stakes and a total cash in on the dawn of the dead name that will generate plenty of revenue alone by fans of the original who will go and see it out of curiosity...<br /><br />don't remakes of classics get on your nerves? can they really not come up with something original? why remake dawn of the dead? the things that made the original special (the middle segment kids think is so boring is supposed to be slow to show how when you get everything you ever wanted you still ain't happy) are totally missing. this is an action flick, plain and simple. the faster the better. if you are into action flicks (and as this, the 2004 version is well done) fair enough, but for anyone who likes a little substance to their films... get ready to sigh (again)...<br /><br />watch the cinemas over the next few years as we get the godfather series remade by whoever the most fashionable pop director is at the moment, and star wars remade, with all the kids saying how the new version is miles better cos the old version is slow and boring and holds a camera shot for more than 5 seconds...<br /><br />not bad, but in 10 years they will still be discussing the romero version, not this pap
