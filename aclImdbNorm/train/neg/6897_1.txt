i can see where the film makers were going with this. but they never really reach their destination. it's supposed to be a homage to spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame." but unfortunately it fall short in its attempt. it doesn't have that gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for. the characters are not vile and desperate enough like their italian western counterparts. and, failing these two points, it lacks the humor of a successful parody. in fact it looks like they intended to make a serious film, but upon completion realized they had missed the mark so far that it couldn't possibly be taken seriously. unfortunately, they also missed the humor mark by a mile. a whole lotta bad movie!
