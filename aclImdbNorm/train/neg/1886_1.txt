i once promised never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck, such as rambo 3, baise moi, deep impact) - but mr. seidl almost succeeded. hundstage was a truly awful experience. anyone who sees this movie will think that austrians are a miserable, pathetic bunch of retards. it shows a world where love and humanity don't exist, a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence. by choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like straight from the imagination of austrian shock-cartoonist deix) director seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in austrian (european? western?) suburbs. the viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and degradation. but this isn't social criticism. this is just pure shock without any aesthetic value. instead you get bad acting, bad cinematography, bad filmmaking. if anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes. this is pseudo-social criticism with a sledge hammer. and it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way. it shows ugly people - that is not the reason why i hate it. but it depicts average people in an ugly, misanthropic way. and this is why this film is truly despicable.
