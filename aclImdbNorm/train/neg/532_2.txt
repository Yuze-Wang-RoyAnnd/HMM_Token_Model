just ppv'd this. i don't want to waste too much time on this as most of the posters here put it better than i ever could, but i did want to say a few things.<br /><br />i didn't know which was funnier: redgrave chasing tiny moths and tripping over her nurse; close wailing that her "precious" boy (whom she and the mr. had decided was a drunken loser) has been turned into roadkill; that the tone-deaf ann schmoozed with peggy lee; or the horrid cgi of crypt keeper annie gazing at her younger self!<br /><br />i never bought danes as the younger redgrave. i didn't buy richardson and collette as sisters, either. if meryl streep's daughter wants to be an actress, she better get mama to give her a few lessons! i had zero idea why any girl (or buddy) would make fools of themselves over vapid stud du jour harris! ann's daughters are as whiny and thoughtless as she, luc is a retarded slacker on crack, and i didn't give a rot about any of them! evening gives chick flicks a bad name!
