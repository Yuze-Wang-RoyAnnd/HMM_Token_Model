well to answer one persons's question of "why doesn't anyone remember this film?" it's because really,not that many people saw it in 1978 and it's not been shown much on tv since. (if it's on video that'd be news to me!) even in the era of sometimes mindless comedies that was the '70s,movie-goers had the smarts to avoid this film. unless they love billy crytal,paul lynde or joan rivers "that" much! <br /><br />paul lynde was funnier on "bewitched" or "hollywood squares" than here. joan rivers at this time in her career was getting laughs making cruel jokes about singer karen carpenter's lack of weight! har-har joan! it also seems like every "somewhat" famous name from the era is in the cast. (most surprising is doris roberts later of "everybody loves raymond".)<br /><br />anyhow,a somewhat good idea for a storyline,a man getting pregnant instead of the woman goes to waste here. with help from a male friend crystal gets set up with a hooker to finally lose his virginity but because she was "on top" instead of him,he gets pregnant! (a commentary on women taking positions of power away from men).<br /><br />crystal's stomach grows,he goes through all the female emotions and related feelings. unfortunately,he is now a socially misunderstood outcast! he's attacked by a mob who wants him rubbed out (i guess).<br /><br />he's forced to go into seclusion to have his baby...in a barn. or if you will,a manger (god only knows where it may have exited from! ewwww!) it turns out (no shock here) to be a girl! <br /><br />everything else about this movie is worthless and forgettable,the humor is high school level or less.<br /><br />2 stars for a good idea and a few good touching & relevant moments w/ billy crystal. ignore the rest of rabitt test,it flunks big time!<br /><br />i can't believe roddy mcdowell signed on either!
