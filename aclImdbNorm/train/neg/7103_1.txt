that is the best way i can describe this movie which centers on a newly married couple who move into a house that is haunted by the husband's first wife who died under mysterious circumstances. that sounds well and good, but what plays out is an hour of pure boredom. in fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises anyone who dies of fright a free coffin. well trust me, no one ever took them up on that offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic skulls, peacocks, weird gardeners, and doors being knocked on. and the music is the worst, it consists of constant tuba music which sounds like it is being played by some sixth grader. and you will figure out the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking. someone dies while running and hitting their head and the police are never called to investigate. yes in the end this is a slow paced (which is really bad considering the movie is only just over an hour), boring little tale, that is easily figured out by the average person. apparently none of the characters in this flick were the average person.
