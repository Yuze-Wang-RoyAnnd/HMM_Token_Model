i am anthony park, glenn park is my father. first off i want to say that the story behind this movie and the creation of the amber alert system is a good one. however the movie itself was poorly made and the acting was terrible. the major problem i had with the movie involved the second half with nichole timmons and father glenn park. the events surrounding that part of the story were not entirely correct. my father was suffering from psychological disorders at the time and picked up nichole without any intent to harm her at all. he loved her like a daughter and was under the mindset that he was rescuing her from some sort of harm or neglect that he likely believed was coming from her mother who paid little attention to her over the 3 plus years that my father took care of her and summarily raised her so her mother could frolic about. the movie depicted my father in a manner that he was going to harm her in some way shape or form. the funny thing is that nichole had spent many nights sometimes consecutively at my fathers place while sharon would be working or doing whatever she was doing. the reason that my father was originally thought to be violent was because he had items that could be conceived to be weapons on his truck. my father was a landscaper. the items they deemed to be weapons were landscaping tools that he kept in his truck all the time for work. my recommendation is take this movie with a grain of salt, it is a good story and based on true events however the details of the movie (at least the nichole timmons - glenn park portion) are largely inaccurate and depict the failure of the director to discover the truth in telling the story. the funny thing is, that if the director would have interviewed any of sharon's friends who knew the situation they would have stated exactly what i have posted here.
