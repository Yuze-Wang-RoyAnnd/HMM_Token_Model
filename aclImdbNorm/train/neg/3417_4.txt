wow, my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not excepted. i will try to tone this one down. lets be real!!! no one wants to see a chuck norris movie where he is not the main character.there was a good fight scene at the end, but the rest of the movie stank. i have to wonder if old chuck just can't hang with the best any more. has he slowed down so much that he has to turn out junk like this and hope that his reputation will carry him through the entire movie? chuck is an awesome martial artist, and as we have seen from walker, texas ranger, a fairly good actor, but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his movies, and this one does not. very disappointing for us norris fans. chuck, stay as the main character in your movies, because this does not work for you...gary
