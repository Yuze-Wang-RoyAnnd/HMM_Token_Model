i really love the sexy action and sci-fi films of the sixties and its because of the actress's that appeared in them. they found the sexiest women to be in these films and it didn't matter if they could act (remember "candy"?). the reason i was disappointed by this film was because it wasn't nostalgic enough. the story here has a european sci-fi film called "dragonfly" being made and the director is fired. so the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker (jeremy davies) to complete the picture. they're is one real beautiful woman in the film who plays dragonfly but she's barely in it. film is written and directed by roman coppola who uses some of his fathers exploits from his early days and puts it into the script. i wish the film could have been an homage to those early films. they could have lots of cameos by actors who appeared in them. there is one actor in this film who was popular from the sixties and its john phillip law (barbarella). gerard depardieu, giancarlo giannini and dean stockwell appear as well. i guess i'm going to have to continue waiting for a director to make a good homage to the films of the sixties. if any are reading this, "make it as sexy as you can"! i'll be waiting!
