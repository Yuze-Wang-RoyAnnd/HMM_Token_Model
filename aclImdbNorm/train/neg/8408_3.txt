wow, this is very unusual in one regard: usually the first movie in a long string of sequels is the best of the bunch. people are surprised when a sequel is actually better. with tarzan, i thought this movie was the worst of the bunch, or at least the first six which comprise my tarzan collection dvd package. i will gladly watch the sequels multiple times but i am through sitting through this turkey, thanks to several characters.<br /><br />well, let's start with the good news first:<br /><br />the good - plenty of action with a lot of wild animals on display, even if they are just stock footage. you see lion attacks, crocodiles, hippos, panthers, you name it, and you see several of the different tribes of all kinds, including pygmies (called "dwarfs" in the movie.) since this movie was made almost 75 years ago, i can't knock any of the realism because they didn't have it in the movies that long ago. they do the best they can so you put up with actors talking in front of fake backgrounds. however, weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape. he and o'sullivan make a well-built handsome couple, if there ever was one in those golden years of cinema.<br /><br />the film has historical value (with so many sequels) in that it shows how tarzan acquired jane and his beginnings of learning the english language.<br /><br />the bad - from the moment "jane parker" is taken by tarzan almost every scene with her is maureen o'sullivan in hysterics, shrieking and screaming scene after scene. it's enough to give you a headache and it ruins the film. thankfully, she calmed down in the sequels, but not in this movie. the movie also does no favors for "the great white hunter" image as c. aubrey smith, playing jane's father, and neil hamilton, as "harry holt," the safari guide, shoot at every animal within sight, whether the beasts is threatening or not. these people are kill- happy, particularly smith. on another note, it's too bad there isn't anything in here explaining how tarzan got to be in the jungle in the first place. there is no history of him in here or footage of his growing up. he's just there when jane and the group get to a certain point in africa.
