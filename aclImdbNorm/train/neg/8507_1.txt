i agree with the previous comment, what a disappointment. rented it thinking it was going to be a good movie since mira and olivier where in it. i was surprised by their performance, expected more since they're good actors.<br /><br />thought it was a slow beginning but it got worse. i even laughed at some bad stunts!! when is supposed to be a mystery movie. you can even guess who is the killer beforehand!!! <br /><br />for real what happened?? <br /><br />sorry to say but don't even bother you'll waste time and money.<br /><br />boring!!!
