natural born killers (1994)<br /><br />cinema cut: r <br /><br />director's cut: nc-17<br /><br />it's an unusual oliver stone picture, but when i read he was on drugs during the filming, i needed no further explanation. 'natural born killers' is a risky, mad, all out film-making that we do not get very often; strange, psychotic, artistic pictures.<br /><br />'natural born killers' is basically the story of how two mass killers were popularised and glorified by the media; there is a great scene where an interviewer questions some teenagers about mickey and mallory, and the teenager says 'murder is wrong.... but if i was a mass murderer i'd be mickey and mallory'. mickey describes this with a situation of 'frankenstein (the monster) and dr. frankenstein' - dr. frankenstein is the media who has turned them into these monstrous killers<br /><br />most oliver stone films examine the flaws of the america, the country that the director loves and admires. i guess 'natural born killers' is about the effect of mass media, technology and how obsessive as a nation, americans are (and most of the world) over things such as mass killers and bizarre situations.<br /><br />the killers played by woody harrelson (mickey) and juliette lewis (mallory) are executed astonishingly by two excellent actors who step into the lives of two interestingly brutal killers. mickey and mallory believe that some people are worthy of killing, perhaps in the cruel theory of social darwinism (survival of the fittest) - mickey says in his interview in prison, that other species commit murder, we as humans ravage other species and exploit the environment; the script is interesting, but it is questionable how much this film amounts to, in the sense of making us think about society and human behaviour, rather than the intensity of a 2 hour bloodbath that we have seen.<br /><br />the last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison; we see the harsh realities of prison life; the attitudes of the warden etc;overfilling of prisons - maybe stone is questioning the future, the path that society is leading to.<br /><br />two other interesting characters; first, a reporter who runs a show about 'america's maniacs' and is obsessed with boosting ratings, that he goes to any length to capture the story of mickey and mallory. the other is police officer scagnetti, an insane, perhaps sadistic officer that is in love with mallory - he also has some weird obsession with mass killers, since his mother was killed during the massacre at waco, texas by charles whitman.<br /><br />the cinematography is superb; different colours, shadows, styles create a feeling of disorientation; the green colour most evident of all is green, to resemble the sickness of the killers (in the drugstore when they are looking for rattlesnake antidote).<br /><br />the camera work is insane; shaky, buzzy, it takes some determination to get use to it and accept it. highly unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual.<br /><br />'natural born killers' does not glamourise the existence of insane murderers, it questions it and how we as the public may fuel this attribute...<br /><br />although the above review sound quite positive, i did dislike the film. quentin tarantino, who originally wrote the script for the film, was not pleased with the altered screenplay and he asked for his name to be removed. i can see why. while mildly interesting at times, natural born killers is a mess of a picture.<br /><br />4/10
