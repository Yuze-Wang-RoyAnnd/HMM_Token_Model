i think dolph lundgren had potential at being a big action star a la schwarzenegger, stallone, and even van damme to certain degree. he had some big moments in his career but he also made some poor choices and this is definitely one of them although made later in his career. the strange thing about jill the ripper (or jill rips...or tied up) is that i honestly think they seriously thought they were making a provocative and serious thriller? it shows in the way that they describe it on imdb, on the dvd case, in the commentaries, and this film is not serious. to call it campy would be a huge understatement. the film tries to be complex and intelligent when in fact it's nothing more than shallow, confusing and gratuitous. on top of that they put lundgren, who is known for action films, in an attempt at a serious role which makes it even more campy because his range as an actor is pretty limited. the entire film revolves around the kinky sex world and yet they attempt at making it a serious thriller? just the plot and premise immediately make it a b-movie porn at very best.<br /><br />dolph lundgren plays disgraced former cop and raging alcoholic matt sorenson who decides to play detective when his brother is murdered. i mean put aside the numerous plot holes that has lundgren getting free roam to investigate crime scenes, and witnesses and everything else even though he's not a cop anymore and you still have a pretty strange and rather lack luster performance from lundgren. danielle brett is lundgren's eventual love interest and his brother's widow. brett plays her role decently enough considering the script and campy story. the supporting cast is huge and no one particularly stands out in their performances unless it's on the negative side such as the absolutely horrible performance by victor pedtrchenko who seems to go by several different names in the film, boasts an awful accent and is a really awful villain.<br /><br />i honestly tried to get into the mystery and film and watch closely but there wasn't any reason to because it was all a jumble of ridiculous plot and gratuitous sex games including a downright ridiculously hilarious scene where lundgren goes under cover and is strung upside down nearly naked. to explain how classy and well done this movie is (sarcasm...sarcasm) the back of the dvd i picked up (it was really cheap) has lundgren's character listed as "murray wilson" (not the name of his character in the film.) while somehow lundgren manages to be usually watchable the film falls flat on it's face trying to be serious. considering director anthony hickox is infamous for really b-movie horror flicks it only makes sense even though i think he was really trying to be serious. hard core cult lundgren fans will have to see it...no one else should...certainly for any sort of mystery or suspense. 3/10
