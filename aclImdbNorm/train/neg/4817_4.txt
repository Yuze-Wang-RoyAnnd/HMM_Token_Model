when you're making a thriller about witchcraft, i believe you should do everything you can to help the audience suspend its disbelief in order for the movie to work. some pictures ("rosemary's baby", for example) have accomplished this; others (like "necromancy") haven't and the potentially scary material comes across as corny and goofy. this film does have some atmospheric moments, but about half the dialogue is hard to make out (sometimes it's poorly recorded, at other times just incomprehensible) and orson welles, who gets top billing, has a role that is so beneath him that you have to assume he was desperate for the work. or maybe he was simply having fun.....(*1/2)
