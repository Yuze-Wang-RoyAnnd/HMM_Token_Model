walerian borowczyks la bete (1975) was obviously received in different ways: some were appalled, some were shocked others applauded the courage. i however am completely untouched, bored and cannot stop asking myself why the display of incoherent, inconsistent images which vaguely orbit around a central theme are considered an intellectual journey.<br /><br />what was this movie actually about? growing sexuality in a woman? i've seen great films on this subject, but this is not one of them. how can one attempt to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person not only as a narrative device to dream (in the nude) of beasts. where there are no characters, there is no character study. the woman persecuted by the beast was not adolescent, the girl having sex with the black butler (is he also characterized as a beast?) has a very grown up attitude to sexuality, so where is the consistency? is it a movie about religion? if yes we would need a bit more thematic material than a priest without function, character and charisma, but with a strong desire towards two young boys.<br /><br />is it about bestiality? the metaphoric feel of the movie forbids any realistic examination of bestiality, especially as realistic examination requires realistic characters. so no real bestiality here. some mythic beast and two priests talking to each other about the sin of bestiality. enough for a college essay on the topic? i don't think so.<br /><br />is it about sex? is it about anything? i don't know. i only know that showing a fired gun doesn't make a film a war movie. dealing with a topic must mean more than displaying its own associations with the theme.<br /><br />so look across the controversy. don't be scared by the bestiality, nudity, ejaculations, masturbation and stuff. i am not. look at it as you look at any other story and you might discover that this is a poorly made, poorly edited, poorly acted, really poorly written (okay, some pictures are quite nice, and the main character is a really good looking girl) cerebral masturbation of a director who thinks beating around the bush in a hypnotic slow manner will make a story intelligent. it doesn't. it makes it boring.
