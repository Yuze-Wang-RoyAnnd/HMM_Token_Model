this production has absolutely no storyline. the acting is embarrassing. the promising dutch television sophie hilbrand star should not add this movie to her cv. her acting is far from flawless and personally i think she has crossed boundary of professional decency; relating to the way she exposes herself in this movie. this movie contains too much unnecessary nudity, vulgar sexual scenes and rude language. it also shows a wrong image of the netherlands (as most movies do). do not bother to watch this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money and an embarrassing record for hilbrand, who has proved to be better with her close on on the screen.
