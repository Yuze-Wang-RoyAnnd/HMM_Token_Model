i can not believe such slanted, jingoistic material is getting passed off to americans as art house material. early on, from such telling lines like "we want to make sure they are playing for the right team" and manipulative framing and lighting, a love divided shows it's true face. the crass manner in which the irish catholics are shown as hegemonic, the protestants as peaceful and downtrodden, is as poor a representation of history as early us westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and american indians. the truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the irish catholics in the story; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves! it is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it's obvious intent, so far from attempting art. this film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library.
