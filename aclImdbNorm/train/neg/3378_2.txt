by the time this film was released i had seen chorus line on stage 4 times, and had been anticipating most eagerly the long-rumored production of a film of the story. my wife and i were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released. it was not just a disappointment, it was a kick in the abdomen. <br /><br />first, the story was "moved outside," so to speak, by including scenes not in the confines of the theater. those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story. <br /><br />second & third together (assign your own order): one of the original songs, with very dynamic dance number, was removed; a song which was not in the stage production was added. say what ?? i'm confused! <br /><br />the only reason i gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers. i've now seen chorus line on stage 6 times, and wouldn't mind seeing it 6 more times before i die. it is superbly written, with wonderful music, and heart- wrenchingly true stories. if you want to see a musical which includes a great "cattle call" audition, i recommend all that jazz. if you want to see the story of a chorus line, see it on stage.
