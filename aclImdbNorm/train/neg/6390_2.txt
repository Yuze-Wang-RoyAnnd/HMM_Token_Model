i have seen about a thousand horror films. (my favorite type) this film is among the worst. for me, an idea drives a movie. so, even a poorly acted, cheaply made movie can be good. something weird is definitely cheaply made. however, it has little to say. i still don't understand what the karate scene in the beginning has to do with the film. something weird has little to offer. save yourself the pain!
