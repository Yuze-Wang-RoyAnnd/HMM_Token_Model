i recently saw the broadway revival of "blithe spirit" starring angela lansbury, rupert everett, christine ebersole, and jayne atkinson. it's a terrific production, and shows what good actors can do with a play that is less than perfect. angela lansbury is extremely funny as madame arcati.<br /><br />it was probably a mistake, then, to check out the film version of the play starring rex harrison. the movie does not have the energy or the laughs of a good stage production.<br /><br />"blithe spirit" is probably one of those plays that works better with a live cast, in an audience full of people who have come to laugh. the actors can improvise, give touches and nuances to their performance and delivery of the lines, and involve the audience on a personal level that you can't get in a movie house, or with a dvd showing, where the audience is separated from the story by the "fourth wall." the story: charles condomine (rex harrison), a successful writer, lives with his wife ruth (constance cummings) in a house in the english countryside. seeking information for his next book, a book dealing with the supernatural, charles invites madame arcati (margaret rutherford, reprising her role from the original 1941 london production), a local spiritual medium, over to his house to conduct a s'eance. charles believes that spiritism is a sham, but hopes to pick up "the tricks of the trade." but then madame arcati brings back the ghost of elvira (kaye hammond), charles's first wife, who died of pneumonia seven years ago. elvira refuses to leave, and develops a spitting rivalry with ruth over charles (complicated by the fact that only charles can see or hear elvira).<br /><br />on stage, the actors can give performances that invite laughs in this situation. but on the screen, the actors in "blithe spirit" tear through the lines as if they don't know that anyone is listening to them. they mumble lines that were designed to get laughs on the stage. the performances by harrison, cummings, and even kaye hammond are flat and lifeless. only margaret rutherford seems to have retained her spark and humor as madame arcati.<br /><br />the oscar-winning visual effects in the film are unimpressive -- not just by today's standards, but by the standards of 1946! they consist mostly of kaye hammond walking around in fluorescent green outfits and makeup, being photographed in special lighting to make her look like a glowing ghost.<br /><br />the cinematographer deserves some credit for creative lighting. but compare the dull visual effects of "blithe spirit" to the truly groundbreaking effects in disney's "song of the south" -- which was eligible for awards the same year. in "south," humans and animated characters share the screen seamlessly for minutes at a time. compared to "south," the oscar that "blithe spirit" received for special effects was completely undeserved.<br /><br />at any rate, i can only encourage you to catch the broadway revival of this play with angela lansbury before it closes. as for the movie with rex harrison, skip it.
