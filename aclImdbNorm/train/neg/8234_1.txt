the writers and producers of this little outing have plummeted new depths of depravity. did writer's block set in so badly, or had ideas dried up so much, that they were forced to include a disgusting scene where a young woman defecates in the back seat of a van, and then promptly throws the excrement at the car behind (mind you at least this summarises what this film is worth). we had already been treated to one of the other women urinating over one of her friends at gunpoint, as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting; once would have sufficed... we got the message! this really is taking toilet humour to another level! had the script and acting been better then i could have easily forgotten that i was watching a film shot entirely on low budget video. this was a fairly original storyline, with a clever (the only) piece of direction in that we only ever got to take the viewpoint from inside of the van; thus making it feel much more real. we never got to see inside any other locations, such as the store or the field where several of the women disappeared, and this could have added much needed tension.<br /><br />the script was dire. lines like: 'i don't feel too good... i want to go home' after one of the girls has been pursued by a psychopath; subjected to rape by a screwdriver and shot at, seem a little undercooked.<br /><br />the acting was diabolical (apart from the maniac). did all the main 5 actresses in this learn acting by taking a correspondence course during a long postal strike! the sound was so bad that i had to watch the entire film with the subtitles on.<br /><br />the director seemed to have an easy job in this. it seems that the only direction he must have given was: 'scream girls'.<br /><br />and as for the screaming...... if you watch this please be sure to have some paracetamol at the ready!
