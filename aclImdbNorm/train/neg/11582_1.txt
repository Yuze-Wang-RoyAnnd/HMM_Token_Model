i am glad to see most other people here don't think much of this movie, either. it has some big names in the cast, but that's it. there is nothing else to recommend, save ogling a few pretty women which you can do in a thousand films.<br /><br />the story involves nothing but unlikable, self-centered, chain-smoking, "hip" characters that national film critics all seem to like....and most of the public can't stand. <br /><br />the oklahoma accents are so fake they are laughable, the southern racist stereotypes are right from liberal hollywood 101 and the story is depressing.
