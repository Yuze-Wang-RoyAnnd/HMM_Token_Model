this video nasty was initially banned in britain, and allowed in last november without cuts.<br /><br />it features the playboy playmate of the month october 1979, ursula buchfellner. the opening cuts back and forth between buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures. i am not sure what the purpose of that was. it would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene.<br /><br />laura (buchfellner) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom. peter (al cliver - the beyond, zombie) is sent to find her and the ransom. of course, one of the kidnappers (antonio de cabo) manages to pass the time productively, while another (werner pochath) whines incessantly.<br /><br />the ransom exchange goes to hell, and laura runs into the jungle. will peter save her before the cannibals have a meal? oh, yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. why do you think it was a video nasty! muriel montoss'e is found by peter and his partner (antonio mayans - angel of death) on the kidnapper's boat. montoss'e is very comfortably undressed. peter leaves them and goes off alone to find laura, who has been captured by now. they pass the time having sex, and don't see the danger approaching. guts, anyone? great fight between peter and the naked devil (burt altman).<br /><br />blood, decapitation, guts, lots of full frontal, some great writhing by the cannibal priestess (aline mess), and the line, "they tore her heart out," which is hilarious if you see the film.
