okay, i struggled to set aside the fact that in selling evp as real the movie was basically lying to me from the get-go. i reasoned that hell, i don't believe in vampires but i still liked dracula so i could live with this.<br /><br />however, even with that accepted the movie is just not very good. it's competently made and acted, but it doesn't really capture you at all. there are several "jump" moments, and i just looked at them and thought "yeah, i didn't expect that" without actually jumping in the slightest.<br /><br />also the resolution doesn't make sense. if the force behind this is capable of doing the things it seems to be, then why the hell does it need to use a proxy? plus, the end caption was absurd. they obviously put it there as part of the "give the movie credibility by claiming it's all real" thing, but for that to work it really needs to be at the start. but they can't put it at the start because then they give the plot away... sticking it in at the end just made it stick out like a sore thumb.
