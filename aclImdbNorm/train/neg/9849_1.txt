this is one of the worst films i have *ever* seen! it is bad, even at tv movie level standards. the plot is diabolically flawed, and the known names in this film are wasted on confused, uncertain characters. i don't know how the director managed to keep this excuse of a film together - it is that bad. billed as a 'psychological horror thriller' - it is certainly horrific. there is nothing thrilling about it. and it could do you psychological damage! the initial opening scenes held such promise - a possible embarkation on whether the soul is just an aspect of the brain, but the utter shambles that followed the car-crash scene is beyond belief. no matter how hard you try, you couldn't care less about the characters. there are so many sprinkled ideas that the film is at best a collage of disconnected phrases from chinese philosophers, and at worst the film would actually make you go brain dead!<br /><br />i have purchased over 300 films on dvd, and this is the first one i'm going to get my money back on. steer clear.
