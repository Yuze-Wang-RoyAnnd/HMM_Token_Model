no redeeming features, this film is rubbish. its jokes don't begin to be funny. the humour for children is pathetic, and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package. sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next. i couldn't enjoy the film at all. although my child for whom the dvd was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new dvd, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike with monsters inc, finding nemo, jungle book, lion king, etc. which all get frequent requests for replays.
