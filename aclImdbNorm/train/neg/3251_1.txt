i caught this movie on fx last night, and as i was sitting there watching it, it occurred to me that it could quite possibly be the worst movie ever. bad acting, bad cinematography, bad sound, totally unbelievable fight sequences, stupid characters. all these made it up to be the most laughably bad movie i've ever seen. it was so bad, i was enthralled by it's sheer lack of anything semi-competent that i had to keep watching... and they made a sequel!
