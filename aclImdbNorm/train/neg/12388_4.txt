**warning: possible spoiler**<br /><br />if you can get by the extremely unpleasant subject matter, this film does offer a heaping helping of outrageously campy melodrama. surprisingly enough, this movie has been copied and ripped-off several times over the years, although it's hard to fathom any filmmaker being inspired by this trashy drama. neither one of the hemingway women can act here (although mariel has improved over the years), anne bancroft offers the only touch of class as a prosecuting attorney, and chris sarandon is by turns pathetic and unintentionally hilarious as the smirking, smarmy bad guy of the piece.<br /><br />veteran director lamont johnson can't make a silk purse out of this sow's ear of a script, which is stuffed to bursting with howlingly bad dialogue and outlandish situations. for example, the final sequence, where margaux grabs her shotgun and chases sarandon down after his latest shocking act is meant to be exciting but elicits hearty chuckles instead. add a notoriously shrill and spacy musical score by michel polnareff and you have a true guilty pleasure, even though you're likely to feel grubby and needing a hot shower after viewing it. don't say you weren't warned.
