i just saw this movie, and i have to say that it was a big waste of time. the girl who played eva (ellen fjaestad) can't act at all. she read her lines very un-naturally, and she had a very un-natural facial expression through the entire movie. rosanna munter who played petra on the other hand, is a natural. she played her part with great perfection.<br /><br />spoilers! the story was simple - we've seen it many, many times before. she breaks up, he finds another, she get jealous, he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end. there were no surprises at all, one knew that eva would break up, and that adam would "hook up" with petra. the only thing that nobody saw coming was that petra told adam to go after eva at the party. she became all serious, which is a side of petra the viewers hadn't seen earlier in the movie, and told him to win eva's heart back, which was really cute.<br /><br />besides rosanna munter, there isn't a single actor who gives a memorable performance.<br /><br />this is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors, so i don't recommend it!
