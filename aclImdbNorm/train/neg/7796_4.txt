wow, not only is this film a "new lesson in real bad taste," but also a lesson in "real bad film making." don't get me wrong, i appreciated the concept of 'zombie '90: extreme pestilence,' but at the same time one must realize when a movie is terrible. in case you missed out on the storyline, the plot of 'zombie '90' is about a government plane carrying toxic chemicals that so happens to crash into the wilderness, causing the chemicals to spill, turning locals into hideous looking zombies. the next thing you know, zombies are all over the city eating people alive, while a goofy-looking doctor and a government agent are trying to figure out the disease that's making these people eat one another - hence the name "extreme pestilence." from then on, all we see is zombies having a field day on every local in sight - nothing but extreme and sickening disembowelments and dismemberments accompanied by endless buckets of guts and gore. since this is a german film, the film had to be dubbed into english and when you're not laughing at the feeding frenzies of the zombies, the voice-overs are quite hilarious and entertaining as well. as user unratedx mentioned *spoiler* *spoiler* *spoiler*, there is a scene in the film that crosses the line between what's acceptable and not acceptable, hence the scene in which a woman, who is carrying her infant baby, is being wheeled around in her wheelchair by some dude and a horde of zombies come out of nowhere and attack them. one zombie grabs the baby and rips it into pieces, eating its organs as you hear the baby crying. wow, that is a new lesson in reallllllllly bad taste. atrocious i tell you, atrocious.
