really bad. why anyone thinks this is a good film let alone funny is a true mystery. i like comedies as much as the next man and i loved "a christmas story." the fact that it has the same director and was based on the same writer's memoirs has me completely puzzled as to why this film is such a complete failure on every level. charles grodin is woefully miscast as the father for starters. for another it does not seem to have the same pacing -- it just doesn't flow well. everything seems tired and forced. the joy of life that permeated the first film is completely absent here -- you just want the movie to end. i wouldn't even recommend this movie for curiosity-seekers who enjoyed "a christmas story." it's that bad. 1/10.
