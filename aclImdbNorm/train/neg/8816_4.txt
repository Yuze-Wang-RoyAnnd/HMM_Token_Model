i saw mommy...well, she wasn't exactly kissing santa clause; he has his hand on her thigh and wicked thoughts in mind.<br /><br />this was enough to emotionally scar a young boy who wanted to believe. he grew up to be a bitter man who was upset at the quality of the toys being made, and the lack of christmas spirit.<br /><br />expecting a real slasher flick, i was very disappointed that less than a handful of people dies, and there was no nudity at all. what a bummer.<br /><br />i wanted to like this flick, but it was just too slow and really didn't have a good script. i didn't expect great acting, but i sure wanted some action. there just wasn't any.
