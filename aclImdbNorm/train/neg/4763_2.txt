the main reason for writing this review is i found this "revisioning" of a great play and worthy 1972 film, a horrible movie experience. if i can save someone from watching it, i will have done a good thing.<br /><br />this "new" version is loaded with talent, and it all goes wrong. kenneth branagh oks an ugly, sterile, one note set. he proceeds to film the movie from every arty, distracting, self-centered angle possible. we see reflections of the actors in stainless steel, on security monitors, shots of their heads from 200 ft above, close ups of eyes, chins, and on and on. the screenplay, by a nobel laureate, introduces long stretchs of unpleasant homosexual banter, that is being faked by both parties,.... i think?? given the character "twists" how would i know? the characters themselves,so richly drawn in the original, are crass and unsympathetic. the running time has been cut by an hour, which is either the real problem or the kindest thing the director did for us. the actors perform their lines effectively, but nothing they say or do is remotely believable. jude law is over the top more than caine, but as the credited producer, must have had branagh's blessing.<br /><br />all in all i found this to be an ugly to look at, unconvincing shell of a former classic. why was it even made??? the paying public spent less that $4m worldwide to see it! a vanity piece of work that fails at every turn.
