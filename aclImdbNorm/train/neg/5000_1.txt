this is probably the worst excuse for television programming since, oh, i don't know, whats happening now? nothing ever happened on this ridiculous "series". even though it's mostly shot by britney and kevin themselves, you don't get any good details into their personal lives. it's mostly just them making stupid, jokey small talk and acting like white trash. look, i love britney's music as much as the next babe, but this show is just pure filler for a nation so addicted to britney that they would watch her clip her toenails (yes, that could be an actual episode). thank god these two broke up, because they were painfully dull together. this show is toxic!
