the first one was different and funny. this attempt should have never left the studio. this movie does not make you laugh. it is a weak attempt at gross out humor. the movie picks out current and old movies to rip-off. this time the jokes seem used and overdone. the audience that i saw it with only re-acted to hannibal dinner scene and was otherwise asleep.
