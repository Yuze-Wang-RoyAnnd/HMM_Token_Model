stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so i am happy to see any of their films. basically a man at a horn factory is the fourth to crack, and soon enough ollie cracks with all the horn noises. he is resting at home with stan by his side, needing quiet, and the doctor (james finlayson) phones to say he is coming over to check on ollie. after realising plumbing and electricity is muddled up by a cross-eyed repairman, the doctor comes in for a check-up, and after some tests, he recommends drinking goat's milk and getting some sea air on the ocean. after stan practises some trumpet playing, hanging out the window by the phone cord and a car crash, he and ollie to a dock to rent a boat. they keep the boat on the dock trying to milk a goat, and stan has brought his trumpet! meanwhile, the newspaper's front page reads that killer nick grainger - escaped convict (richard cramer) has escaped, and he sneaks onto the boys' boat while they are sleeping, and the goat chews through the boat rope, drifting out to sea. in the morning, the see their location, and the killer comes out demanding something to eat, and he spots stan and ollie making fake food, e.g. string for spaghetti, soap for cheese, belt for bacon, sponge for meatballs, and he forces them to eat it. when ollie starts choking on something, stan blows his trumpet to help, and ollie's rage gets him punching the killer, and it keeps going till the police arrive, only to have ollie's rage get them put in prison too. there were the tiniest moments of comedy, but it isn't a great black and white film. "well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into!" was number 60 on 100 years, 100 quotes, and stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians' comedian. okay!
