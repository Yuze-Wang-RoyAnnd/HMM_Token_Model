sure, this one isn't really a blockbuster, nor does it target such a position. "dieter" is the first name of a quite popular german musician, who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and thats exactly what this movie is about. it is based on the autobiography "dieter bohlen" wrote a few years ago but isn't meant to be accurate on that. the movie is filled with some sexual offensive content (at least for american standard) which is either amusing (not for the other "actors" of course) or dumb - it depends on your individual kind of humor or on you being a "bohlen"-fan or not. technically speaking there isn't much to criticize. speaking of me i find this movie to be an ok-movie.
