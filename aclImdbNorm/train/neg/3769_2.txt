there have been many movies featuring bigfoot, the majority of which are not good but most at least have a goofy charm to them. sasquatch hunters doesn't even have that going for it. it's just a crashing bore.<br /><br />sasquatch hunters is about a group of paleontologists, primatologists, and forest rangers that venture off into a remote part of a pacific northwest forest. bones belonging to some sort of abnormally large primate have been discovered in this region and since apes aren't natural to north america to begin with this leads to a scientific expedition. sure enough, they soon discover a whole burial ground full of the skeletal remains of these enormous ape-like creatures. i think we all know what happens to people that disturb ancient burial grounds in the movies.<br /><br />the first half of the movie consists of uninteresting, interchangeable characters assembling their gear, hiking through the woods, stopping to rest, hiking through the woods some more, pausing long enough to investigate and discuss a few findings along the way, yet more hiking through the woods, looking for a group member that has vanished, even more hiking through the woods, digging through dirt, random theorizing, and gathering around a campfire to discuss what little they've done that day. when sasquatch finally shows up it just turns into people stumbling around in the dark while being picked off one at a time (done in a blink and you missed it fashion and the actual killing occurs off-camera). all of this is excruciatingly boring.<br /><br />the movie wants to be taken seriously and the director is clearly trying to build suspense but there is none to be found, thus we are left with dull, drawn out scenes of people wandering around the woods just to get somewhere and wander around the woods at night trying to act scared. i'd be lying if i said i didn't make liberal use of the fast forward button to speed these scenes up.<br /><br />as for sasquatch himself, much like every other character else in the movie, it doesn't have much to do and lacks a distinct personality. it looks like a shaggier version of king kong, which isn't all that bad except in the scenes where they used cgi instead of a man in a bigfoot costume, which is painfully obvious during the daylight monster scenes. a part of me can't help but feel that even using computer effects to bring bigfoot to life is a tad sacrilegious. if there is any single movie monster that i believe should only be brought to life through situation, it's bigfoot.<br /><br />this is one of those movies that doesn't so much have a plot as it does a premise. that's all it really is, a premise, which the people involved stretched out to make a feature length motion picture without bothering to add all the ingredients to make a worthwhile movie.
