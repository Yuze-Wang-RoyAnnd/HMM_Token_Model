savage island (2003) is a lame movie. it's more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting. not only that the storyline and script was wretched. i don't know why this movie was made. i have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones i really hate are movies that make me angry. this one made my blood boil. the situations were inane at best. if i made a movie like this it would have been a short. really because those backwood "idjits" wouldn't have been in the picture.<br /><br />don't be fooled by the cover on the d.v.d. i am an avid watcher of bad cinema. but this movie is virtually unwatchable. i don't mind movies being shot on d.v. but if you're going to do that make the movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans wrong turn).<br /><br />i have to not recommend this waste of disk. if you come across this one in the rental store pass on by.<br /><br />movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1.
