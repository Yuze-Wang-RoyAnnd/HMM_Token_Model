this had to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen and i'm 64 years old and a football fan. i went expecting to see a football movie. about 10 minutes into it, i began to wonder exactly how such a bad movie (particularly the acting) could have gotten into a theater. about half way through, i whispered to my husband that it was awful and he explained to me the facts behind the movie. although i was a little offended (and can see how some could be very offended if they were not christian) at being preached to in a movie theater, it wasn't that big a deal. it was, however, a big deal to be subjected to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and, above all, the quality of the acting. it is an appropriate movie for a church outing but to be shown in a church auditorium and not in a theater. do i go to church? yes. do i want to go to church when i attend a movie? no. would i recommend this movie? absolutely not!!!
