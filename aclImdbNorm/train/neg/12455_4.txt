i remember watching this on prime time when i was about 7 years old. i was a huge comic book reader at the time, and anything relating to superheroes was anticipated heavily. the end result, however, was underwhelming.<br /><br />i was aware of the "emma peel" diana prince stories, as they had only recently come to an end and diana was returned to her amazonian form. however, there was so little action that i was bored throughout most of the movie. the final costume was an interesting idea, but looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero.<br /><br />i saw the movie again in my late teen years. it hadn't improved much. cathy lee crosby was more familiar, thanks to that's incredible, but her acting was no better. the script had a few good ideas, like the rogue amazon, and a decent villain in ricardo montalban, but it just didn't come together and was still boring.<br /><br />i think they should have built the back story better, and built the show into a more epic climax. it was too much like a bland spy film, crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book. the amazon elements were intriguing, but needed to be expanded.<br /><br />the film did succeed in forcing producers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something more faithful, if a bit too camp and low budget. the budget was also pretty low here, and superheroes don't come cheap.<br /><br />it would be nice to have the movie available on dvd, if only as a comparison and historical document. even superman 4 is available, and it has nothing over this film (except chris reeve and gene hackman). it's worth seeing for curiosity sake and for a bit of inspiration and caution for future versions.
