this movie was yet another waste of time... why oh why do i keep renting crap like this?... someone please tell me... *sigh* oh well. back to the movie at hand: cube zero is probably worth it if you really really enjoyed the first movie, (like i did), and just want to check out what's up in the last (hopefully) movie scraped together just to keep some poor actors and screenwriters employed, then of course this is the movie for you. but if you are looking for a good movie with good acting and a fantastic plot... *evil grin* then this movie is definitely for you :-d.... ok i'm lying... at best this movie sucks. ok, i have to admit that certain elements to it was cool.. well.. coolish... and i laughed quite a few times, prolly at the wrong things, but nevertheless i was amused. :-) but all in all the few things that barely makes the "ok" category isn't enough to make this movie worth it at all.. unless you count "manos - hand of fate" one of the top ten movies ever!
