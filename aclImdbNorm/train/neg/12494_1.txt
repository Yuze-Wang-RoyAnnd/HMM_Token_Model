there was nothing about this movie that i liked. it was so obviously low-budget with bad lighting and camera work (almost like blair witch project, only it wasn't supposed to be that way). there wasn't really much to the plot, and the movie just drug on and on. i actually fast-forwarded through the last 1/3 of the movies, but that did not help matters much. it looked like it might be good from the box, but i must say again: nothing about this movie even resembled good. no good actors, the special effects were so fake, the camera work was horrible, and the dialogue was painfully terrible. on my own personal scale, i give this movie a 0 of 10. yikes!
