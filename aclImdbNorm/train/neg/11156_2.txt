dark wolf (quick review) let's get right to it: this is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sh*t on it. it's just an awful movie. it's an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an 80's high school drama film. what's worse is that poor kane hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf. kane f*cking hodder. someone's trying to ensure that playing jason voorhees is the height of his film career...<br /><br />anyway, former playmate jaime bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf, too. it's kind of a crappy cop drama with the world's worst looking werewolf in it. but it does have moments of near-rampant nudity. but that's about all. want to know more? okay, the werewolf is generally an ugly-looking black blur zipping around the screen. and when we're privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence, we're presented with something that resembles a full-motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the playstation. the first playstation. the cg animation is really that primitive. only good for horror hardcore fanatics that want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit. 2/10<br /><br />www.residenthazard.com
