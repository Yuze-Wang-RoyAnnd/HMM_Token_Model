this movie serves as a timely warning to anyone who thinks they can both write and direct their own movie. face it, you can't. because that way there's nobody around to tell you when you hack great holes in your plot, have meaningless transitions, trite, unmemorable dialog and manage to turn a fairly cool korean legend into a steaming pile of celluloid turd.<br /><br />i wanted to like this movie as a trashy popcorn movie, really i did; i like lots of crappy movies. but once i've been forced to ask myself what the hell just happened and why, dear lord, why? more than a few times, i really can't take it any more.<br /><br />also, i would love for someone to explain how la became mordor for the last scene.
