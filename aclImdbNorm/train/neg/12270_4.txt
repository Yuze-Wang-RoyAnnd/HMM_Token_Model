this kiyoshi kurosawa ghost movie is pretty wild, and it did have at least one jump scare that caught me off guard. but all in all, the movie is incredibly stupid, with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer, only to find out he may have committed one of the crimes. then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous asian lady ghost, and has no idea why (and neither does the viewer). as other murders are committed, he becomes even more confused as the killers are easily found, and this ghost still haunts him for some reason. not only is the plot completely stupid, the lady ghost is more funny than anything, especially when she suddenly flies across the city, like wonder woman. and the ending makes little sense, in fact, the whole movie makes little sense, and i can't recommend it at all. if it didn't take itself so serious, i would think it was supposed to be a black comedy. outside of "bright future" this is the worst movie directed by kiyoshi kurosawa i have seen yet.
