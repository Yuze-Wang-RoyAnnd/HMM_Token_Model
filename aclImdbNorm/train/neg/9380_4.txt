the last couple of weeks in the life of a dead vagabond woman is told in flashbacks. like the vagabond, the film wanders aimlessly and rather pointlessly. mona, the lazy, sullen, and drug-addicted title character, is not likable and bonnaire does little to make her interesting. although there is some pretentious dialog attempting to explain why mona has chosen this miserable lifestyle, her motivations are never really clear. the episodic nature of the film, involving some random characters, becomes tiresome after a while, making it seem much longer than its running time. it is also hard to believe that an attractive young homeless woman would not draw more attention from men.
