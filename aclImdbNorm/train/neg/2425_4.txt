### spoilers! ### <br /><br />what is this movie offering? out of control editing and cinematography that matches up with a terrible plot. it is sad to see denzel washington's talents go wasted in trashes like this.we are certainly hinted how the mexicans cannot save themselves, outside forces needed, possibly militaristic, american ones. and we know the father is a shady character, he is a mexican after all, unlike the wife who appreciates creasey more because he is american. he killed all of them thinking she died. and did she? of course, she won't, she is a young kid and you are not supposed to hurt the sensibilities of the hollywood fan. the trade off scene was the only thing that prevents me from rating it below the "implausibly successful"(as some critic pointed out)'taken'. the nausea of such movies will take time to go. it is in the rating of such movies that we have to doubt imdb's credulity.7.7 for a movie like this and 7.0 for my own private idaho. go figure! mine will be in the range of 3.5-4.0
