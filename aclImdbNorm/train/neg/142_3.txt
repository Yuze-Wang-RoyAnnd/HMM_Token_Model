firstly, there are some good things about this film, but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie. in the advertising of this movie, that i've seen, a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it, but she's a poor actress, and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be (not that that has anything to do with the movie). and what's with that look she gives everyone? perhaps it's part of the character, but like i said, the acting... still, the writing is fine. you know who it is all throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what is about to happen, but not in an irritating way. i think the book it's based on is probably good, judging by the plot line, but next time i'll read the book to find out rather than watch this.
