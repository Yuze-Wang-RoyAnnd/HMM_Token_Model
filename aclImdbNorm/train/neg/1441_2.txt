i picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of "indiana jones and the temple of doom". unfortunately i was in for a virtual yawn. not like any yawn i have had before though. this yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie. the cover described amazing special effects. there were none. the movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were awfully portrayed. it does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence. good if you want to teach your kids that. i don't. keep away from this one. if you are looking for family entertainment then you might find something that is more inspiring elsewhere.
