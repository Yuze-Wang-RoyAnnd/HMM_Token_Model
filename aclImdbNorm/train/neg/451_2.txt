i don't care how many nominations this junk got for best this and that, this movie stunk. i didn't know whether to turn off the set, or file a lawsuit with o.j.'s attorney for wrongful damage to my mental health. i have seldom been this bored; to call this dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every movie-goer across the planet. the whole story was stupid, the acting was uninspired, the 'drama' was emotionless. i am thankful i didn't have to pay for this unfulfilling experience.
