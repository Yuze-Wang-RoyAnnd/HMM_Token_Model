here we have a movie which fails in pretty much every way it is possible for a movie to fail. terrible script, lousy acting, amateurish directing, laughable special effects...it's just an utterly awful movie. not to mention the fact that when you get to the end you'll realize the whole thing doesn't make a lick of sense. after spending the whole movie wondering what in the world is going on here when things are finally explained you realize the story has been built on a foundation which is ludicrously impossible. in one of those hideous "villain explains the whole movie" sequences we are told that our villain has done something which quite simply can't be done and which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. oh, and after that we see that there also appears to be some kind of jell-o monster involved. i'm sure drew barrymore would very much like to pretend this movie never happened. if for some ungodly reason you are ever tempted to sit down and watch this movie may i suggest instead taking that time to bang your head against a wall for 104 minutes. that would prove to be a much more pleasurable experience than sitting through this garbage.
