i've seen other guinea pig films, like mermaid in a manhole & he never dies, and while they're pretty sick, they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them (however dark). devil's experiment though, is nothing more than filming a bunch of punks submitting a young girl to many methods of torture and violence and there's no plot and no redeeming values to it whatsoever. it isn't remotely scary, except for perhaps the mind-set, but it's definitely disgusting and i certainly would not call it entertainment. now, i'm not the paragon of good taste in films and i like my trash and sleaze, but this was too much for me, really. i'm all for disturbing, in fact, i seek out things that are disturbing whenever possible, but this was a bit much. the young woman is kicked, beaten, submitted to continuous noise via headphones until she drools, and then pelted with raw meat and innards and left hanging in a hammock out in the woods somewhere. if you think that sounds great, go for it, but it certainly put me off viewing any more guinea pig stuff. 1 out of 10, absolutely nauseating.
