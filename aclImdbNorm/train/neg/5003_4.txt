i'm embarrassed to be writing this review. i say that because those of you reading it will know that i sat through the whole thing and that is embarrassing to admit even to strangers. but i just had to warn those who read the viewer comments on imdb before they watch a film not to watch this one. it's the least i can do. this is a bad movie! trust me. the plot is goofy. the acting is amateurish. and the directing, camera work, sets, costumes, etc. are all second rate. let it go.
