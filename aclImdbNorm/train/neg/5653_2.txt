lets put it this way. i actually get this movie. i get what the writer/directer was trying to do. i understand that the dialog was meant to be dry and emotionless. i understand that the plot was supposed to be non-climactic and stale. that was what the writer/director was going for. a very very very dry humor/comedy. with all that understanding, i still think the movie sucked. it seemed like the writer/director was trying to recreate napolean dynamite with this movie. it had all of the same features. even the main character behaved similar to napolean. but napolean dynamite was actually funny. its script worked. this movie is not. it has no purpose. well, let me rephrase that. its only purpose is to rip off napolean dynamite and try to capture that look and feel. too bad it didn't work.
