discovery channel/animal planet must be ashamed of themselves. this fantasy is modeled after the "walking with dinosuars" series. even though this is 100% fantasy it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way. even mixing the fantasy dragons with t-rexs and the extinction of the dinos. added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say sci-fi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this show.<br /><br />on its own the show is about an 7.5/10 far as entertainment goes. but the way in which it is presented i have to give it a 1/10. don't get me wrong i have no problem with fantasy but they way they put this out is so wrong. i can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is real.<br /><br />i also think this weakens the great "walking with dinosuars" series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini-series.
