disappointing film. performance of actors is weak. sets are fine, could have been better. the story is also weak. battle sequences are awful. sounds and quality of film are trashy. the history of kazakh people was told very poorly. this film should have included more kazakh actors, in leading roles. and also should have been in kazakh language. kuno bekker and jay hernandez are hispanic origins. i don't get it. since when hispanic people play turkic-mongolian people. this film is shame of kazakh cinema. rustam ibragimbekov disappointed me. he is one of the finest filmmakers in the world. czekh director is excused, since he is not nomadic origin, he cannot know true spirit and history of nomads.
