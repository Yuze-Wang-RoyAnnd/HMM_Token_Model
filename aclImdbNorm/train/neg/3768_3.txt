that's right. a movie written, directed and produced by fred tepper and family. (fred should have known better, having worked the sets of 'titantic' and 'dogma'.) <br /><br />so, the plot. there are some scientists, and some forest rangers, and a hot chick with huge fake breasts. they are all really bad at their jobs, including the hot chick(who i think is supposed to be a photographer, but who cares because she wears a bikini). one of the forest rangers comments that the scientists are "professional people," which is good, because it would be horrible if they were professional grubs or jellybeans or ewoks.<br /><br />they are hiking through the woods in search of some strange ape-like bones, and no one even once mentions that the bones just might be those of the infamous bigfoot. they just wander around and one of the rangers unabashedly hits on the hottie. we all hope he dies real soon (along with his sister who's meant to be the cute naive one, but is really just annoying). then they, *gasp*, find a sasqu... i mean, ape-like animal burial ground. of course, no mentions that it might just be bigfoot bones they're messing with... i guess scientists and forest rangers just don't think about those types of things.<br /><br />then sasquatch and his tribe get really angry and kill all the people we dislike, chases the other losers away and buries his great aunt muriel and cousin josh (who died in an unfortunate trout accident) all over again.<br /><br />insipid, boring dialogue (i zoned out several times), inane plot, unlikable characters, bad cgi (a man in a monkey suit would look better), and acting that just wasn't very good all add up to make a movie i won't be watching again.<br /><br />you check it out though; it's good for some unintentional laughs.
