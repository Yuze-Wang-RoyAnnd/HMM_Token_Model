abysmal with a capital "a". this has got to be one of, if not the, unfunniest show on tv right now. i'm about as anti-bush as it gets, but this show doesn't even get a chuckle out of me. what you think of bush as a president has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you'll like this piece of crap show. the "jokes" are not funny at all. for example, in a scene when lil bush has his underwear on his head: "welcome to camp al-qa-eeda!". there is nothing funny about that. is it even supposed to be joke? the commercials that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show, hyping it up, were funnier than the show itself, and that's just sad. hopefully this does not even get considered for a second season. it shouldn't even have had a first.
