at least with the teenage geek gets the girl films, the guy is usually unpopular with girls. in the 40 year old virgin he is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is popular with women but somehow has remained a virgin. but then you are not supposed to engage your brain with this film or did i miss the bit about him being comatose for 20 years?<br /><br />one of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them. i find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent tv comedies seems to think it has to rely on crude and shallow characters for laughs. they've done the gross out movies. they've done the let's act like all americans have a mental age of 15. where will they go next? <br /><br />this film is crass and crude entertainment with nothing to recommend it.
