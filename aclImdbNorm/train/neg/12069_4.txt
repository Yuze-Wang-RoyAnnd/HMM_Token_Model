a grade-z horror filmmaker carl monson was one of the most prolific directors operating within the field of the low-budget gory mayhem.his movies are full of inept gore,laughable acting,boring sub-plots and woeful dialogue.a mysterious black clad figure is savagely murdering guests staying at the family mansion.unfortunately this film is almost bloodless.you don't actually see the murders except with shadows and a few blood splatters.the pace is lethargic and the plot is rather uninteresting.the acting is merely competent,but the lack of gore and mutilation left me disappointed.a generous 4 out of 10.just beware:do not mistake monson's film with andy milligan's equally weak "legacy of blood".
