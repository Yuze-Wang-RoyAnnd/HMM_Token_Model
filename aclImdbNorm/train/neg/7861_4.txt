the premise of this awaited sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake i expected a lot sincerely.<br /><br />the sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and inept. the situations are dumb and beyond reason and the acting is truly awful.<br /><br />this time there aren't likable characters or violins unlike the remake. also, the gore is not that abundant and when it happens it's truly bad.<br /><br />the violence is minimal and it's a shame because there are many arguments that make you think that there's room for heavy violence. i mean, there's a swat team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants. you surely expect something different! when i watched it on the movies i wanted my money back.<br /><br />anyways this is a clear example of how rushed out movies turn out to be a mess and demonstrate poor quality on all aspects.<br /><br />a mess that let down the fans of the remake like me. that's why sequels are never welcomed; at least this movie isn't as terrible as the 1985 sequel to the original.
