this apology for a movie is about absolutely nothing! rachel griffiths must have needed the money. the film must have been made on a very low budget, because the lighting was non existent. i made a vow if i ever see pete postlesumthingor other i'll commit suicide. i'd be happy to know if there was 1) a plot or 2)a script. my biggest regret is i wasted my time watching this rubbish.
