a disappointing end to a season that started so well ...<br /><br />exodus part 2 and other notable episodes were amongst the best seen on tv in any series, where as this was rather bad.<br /><br />well i am not sure if it was the episode that was a disappointment, but the cheesy guitar music at that accompanied the closing sequence was laughable and would have been more at home in the original series.<br /><br />its almost as if the corporate execs didn't like the low key down note ending and wanted to jazz it up. they failed and rather spoilt everything.<br /><br />lets hope this is not a trend for the future.<br /><br />still at least we saw the return of a certain person even if somewhat bizarrely and tritely done.
