there was no characterization in this movie and really shows how much this talentless hack who directed this needs to learn his craft. all his characters in this movie were so unlikable and i could care less. the best point in this movie was the end credits and the hour long shower after this cause i felt so damn dirty that i wasted money on this stinking load. hey genius....triads and yakuza are from two different places learn something about asian culture. the dog scene in this felt so tacked on and useless. this dvd does prove useful i do love my new coaster.<br /><br />so kids don't waste your cash on this crap buy hostel instead.
