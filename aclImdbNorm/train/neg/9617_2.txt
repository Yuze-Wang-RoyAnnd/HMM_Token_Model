three years ago, rachel(therese fretwell) was partying at the lake with her friends when her brother falls out of a boat and drowns. rachel's friends think it is time for her to stop beating herself up and taking blame for something she had no control over. so grab the brew and something to chew and head back to the same lake that has been in rachel's constant nightmares. as expected, a bloodbath has already started when two of the friends are splattered before even heading to the party. this flick has the feel of a high school play where everyone forgot their lines and 'winged it'...very badly! writer marcos gabriel gave himself the meatier role as rachel's boyfriend leo. outside of fretwell and gabriel there are some pretty lame acting and a few characters you would like to choke the crap out of before they get 'offed'. giving attention to a few more players that had the nerve to appear: erin gallagher, andrew williams, jasmine trice and derek nieves. this is one memorial day you wouldn't mind missing.
