i wasn't expecting a lot from a film directed by sidney j. furie and starring dolph lundgren but i was surely expecting more than a got. a one-liner user comment - 2nd rate action movie - didn't seem too depreciative to me for a lundgren film. on the other hand, i wouldn't have bothered to watch this film if its rating was below 5.0 but hey, the movie had a 5.9 out of 10 score, which seemed pretty acceptable to me for this kind of production.<br /><br />now i understand that the 37.5% of people who rated this film a 10 (excellent) was clearly a publicity stunt because detention is the regular nu image garbage you have seen before, over and over.<br /><br />lundgren does not convince as an ex-military turned a history teacher assigned to a rough school. his acting is just plain terrible, emotionless and contrived. lundgren's inability to act becomes more visible in the scenes with the juvenile delinquent kids. either they are great actors or, compared to lundgren, they seem great actors - just because they seem natural and believable.<br /><br />detention has some elements that could have been potentially interesting for this low budget movie - a closed-for-weekend high-security high school, four teens in detention with a war-veteran teacher and a group of ruthless criminals trying to get in - but the story (something like the breakfast club meets die hard, or is it panic room?) is full of unbelievable situations, lots of clich'es and stereotypical characters. and let's not forget dolph lundgren is the main actor.<br /><br />alex karzis and kata dob'o play a bonnie and clyde couple in love and they deliver the most acceptable performances of the movie, even if he seems a low-budget version of sam rockwell and she, a milla jovovich wanna-be. in a movie where everything fails, their craziness and style supplied enough fresh air to prevent my interest from dropping to ground zero.
