okay, so the introduction, with its hokey offer of a free coffin to anyone who dies of fright during the film, is so lame it's funny. and so the first "skull scene" is so drawn out and un-suspenseful it's funny. the actual plot of the movie is somewhat decent, there's at least a little bit of genuine food for thought in the behavior of the characters, and the plot twist is decent as horror flicks go. the acting is average, not truly bad. <br /><br />altogether, this movie doesn't quite fall flat in the way a 1/10 movie would. it's not terrible enough to get the lowest rating or even second lowest. if i just read the screenplay, i'd say there was potential for this to be a decent movie. it's just that the horrid direction and production that ruin the movie. so it's a bad movie, but there are much worse ones out there.
