mix exotic tropical locations, babes in skimpy attire, explosions, good-looking dudley do-right clones, a movie star with his best years behind him (martin sheen), a little martial arts and a sexy villainess (tracy lor.....er, sorry...tracy elizabeth lords) and you'd think you'd be in for some escapist fun. not so! this is a dreary tv movie and even though it likes to promote itself as a "charlie's angels" deal,it is nowhere near as good as the original series or even the gawdawful, irretrievably stupid, recent c.a. movies. this abomination is best described as a third rate andy sidaris film. nowhere near as much fun as andy's "hard ticket to hawaii", although some of the fight scenes are decent enough. the girls spend too much time posing and trying too look prissy and it gets annoying after a while. there's better genre stuff that this out there. oh yeah, and the "babes" aren't as hot as they like to think they are. terrible soundtrack...when it's there.
