this is just a joke of a movie,they lost me already at the opening scene (spoilerwarning) dangerous creature kills other creature in his cage,this is watched by a scientist that works there on a monitor and guess what she does,well lets go in to the cage to check the stuff out,omg how dumb do those writers think human beings are come on thats the same like jumping in a fish tank with a great white shark because it ate your goldfish...pretty useless and even more dumber.and i will not even talk about the cast because they aren't worth the effort. why they didn't fired the guy that wrote that immediately is a mystery to me.....and this kinda dumbness continues the entire movie. only good thing where the cgi that is better then average for these kinda low-budget movies.<br /><br />if these kinda things don't bother you go see it,but be warned if your iq is above 60 you will probably hate it.
