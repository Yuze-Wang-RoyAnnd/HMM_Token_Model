first, i realize that a "1" rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst. this movie gets that from me because, as one reviewer points out, it's not bad in a self-aware, over-the-top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value. it simply misses its mark on every count. **contains possible spoilers** the dialog is completely disingenuous. the continuity is so deliberate it's painful. daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love, and with his final word the flamenco dancers start. the mock-shock of what's her name (see? i don't even remember her character's name, let alone the name of the forgettable actress) when her husband (the baldwin) first tells her that her friend is the bad guy. the car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things. vegetable carts gone flying. cars crashing into each other. motorcycles going down the stairs. people nearly being hit, but remarkably, no one is. oh, that's right... except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times, is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds, and an approaching car apparently didn't notice him there. hmmm. <br /><br />it's becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made. there is so much pressure in the film industry to make money, you'd think that someone in hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing. now there's a novel idea. <br /><br />my suggestion: don't see this film. don't rent the dvd. don't watch it on cable. there are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied.
