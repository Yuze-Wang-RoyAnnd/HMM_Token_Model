this movie was a confusing piece of garbage. you never knew what was going on. the characters were poorly written and for the most part they were totally unsympathetic except for gus (played masterfully by george eads). i hate this movie but compared to others (dark harvest, dracula's curse) it should have won an academy award. it was particularly sad to see a talented actor like george eads in such a disgraceful and tacky film. lifetime you have sunken to whole new low. someone needs to make sure that this director never works in movies again. also was this supposed to be a horror film because it was a lot more funny than scary. for shame lifetime, for shame.
