even worse than the worst david lynch "confusathon", "brain dead" makes no sense whatsoever. shamefully wasted talent (bill pullman, bill paxton), bounce around like they are in a "tom and jerry" cartoon on acid. there is negligible character development. it simply starts climbing the "strange scale", until climaxing in total chaos. do not get sucked into this because of the above fine actors. they are given nothing to work with, and you will be wondering what's going on throughout the entire, unbearable 85 minutes. i highly recommend avoiding "brain dead" at all costs, unless you are into scattering your brain into total nonsense. - merk
