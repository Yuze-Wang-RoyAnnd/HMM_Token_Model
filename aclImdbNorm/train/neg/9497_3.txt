you have a strong stomach. holden was actually 55 years old at filming but looked near 70 and he only lived another 8 years. at one point holden said, "i am over twice your age." okay, try triple grandpa! the "old enough to be your father" theme they were shooting for didn't work. granted senior citizens sometimes wind up with legal teens. more power to them, but that doesn't mean i want to watch it. it's not a matter of judgment but the digestive track. i like my food where it belongs. lenz is fun to watch and the 70s cars, clothes, furniture, etc. make it worth it if it comes on cable late at night and you want to watch something to wind down for bed. it would have been nice to see the blonde friend of lenz, the one who hocked her guitar, get more scenes. pleasingly spacey... who was this chick? i'm going to try and find out.
