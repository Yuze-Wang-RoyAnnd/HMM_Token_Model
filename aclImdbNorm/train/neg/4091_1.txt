ah, lucio fulci, rest in peace. this infamous italian is most<br /><br />famous for "zombie," and the absolutely unwatchable "the<br /><br />psychic" and "manhattan baby." well, add this to the unwatchable<br /><br />list.<br /><br />the plot, as it were, concerns a nekkid woman who wears a gold<br /><br />mask and a g-string. she wants the power of a young dubbed<br /><br />stud who has a set of magic arrows and a bow. they are magic<br /><br />because they glow. arrow boy teams up with a guy in a bad wig,<br /><br />and they spend most of the movie rescuing each other from flat<br /><br />action sequences. in the end, the nekkid chick is defeated, but not<br /><br />before taking the mask off and reminding me why i broke up with<br /><br />my high school girlfriend.<br /><br />fulci bathes every shot in an orange glow and fills the screen with<br /><br />smoke. nothing like a smoky orange action sequence to make you<br /><br />crave sunny delight and a cigarette. the special effects are<br /><br />laughable. in one sequence, our ambiguously gay duo are<br /><br />attacked by dozens of arrows that are obviously pin scratches on<br /><br />the film itself. the majority of the effects budget must have been<br /><br />spent on the fulci-licious gore, which consists entirely of spurting<br /><br />wounds. hey, we can all use a good spurting wound once in a<br /><br />while, but when you get into spurting wound overkill, it gets boring.<br /><br />i kept having to play with the brightness setting on my tv anyway<br /><br />just to see what the heck was happening.<br /><br />there is lots of talk of fulfilling omens and prophecies, so let me<br /><br />do a little look into the future...if you find this movie and watch it,<br /><br />you will regret it. the scene on the video box (by media) does not<br /><br />appear in the film in any context whatsoever. "conquest" is a con<br /><br />job. what mst3k could have done with this!<br /><br />this is rated (r) for strong physical violence, strong gore, female<br /><br />nudity, brief male nudity, and mild sexual content.<br /><br />
