i bought this dvd set, sight unseen, and wish i hadn't. the script needed some serious rewriting as it seems to be completely devoid of any feeling and pales in comparison to the book. the lighting is horrid, very unpolished, but if it was just that i could overlook it. the script doesn't focus enough on the characters...there is hardly an introduction to various characters making it a tad difficult to distinguish who is who(especially in the planes--no idea who dies when).<br /><br />i have long felt that the key to a good film is in getting the audience to care about the characters; if you don't have that you don't have anything. there was no focus on the characters at all--you never got to know them--who they were, what they liked..what made them do the things that they do. the series is 5 hours long and split up into 6 parts...i bet you are wondering what they did with all this time if they didn't detail the characters---they put a lot of filler in it....i will say at least an entire hour is spent watching them land and take off in their planes lol (i mean do we really need to see that over and over again???). i would have given this a much higher rating had they just improved our knowledge of the characters.
