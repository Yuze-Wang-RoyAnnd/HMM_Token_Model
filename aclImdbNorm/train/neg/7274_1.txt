"national lampoon goes to the movies" (1981) is, simply put, the worst movie ever made, far lamer than even the inept "plan 9 from outer space."<br /><br />the lampoon film is told in three segments, each one supposedly a spoof of a conventional movie genre, but each one landing at our feet with a sickening thud. there is no rhyme or reason for these execrable vignettes, and no discernible story lines.<br /><br />another reviewer on this site has written that the only good points about the film are the nude scenes. true, misses ganzel and dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh, and very nice it is too. but the directors seem not to realize that even t&a needs a good story to surround it. there's none of that here.<br /><br />probably the worst of the three segments is the last one, featuring robby benson and richard widmark. here, we see benson as a young, eager-beaver policeman being paired with a cynical oldtimer played by widmark. and for just a moment, those of us who are still watching this odious cinematic exercise are heartened by the thought that we are about to see a redemptive tale about how the young, idealistic cop brings about a purifying change in the old-timer's approach to police work. but no such luck. as we've said, this film has no redeeming values. it is sickening all the way to the final fade-out -- which, perversely, is stretched out longer than it should last on the screen. apparently the film makers knew they had a bad thing going, and wanted to make the least of it.
