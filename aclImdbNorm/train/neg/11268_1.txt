i was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable. the plot was weak to say the least. i was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up (i wonder if any of them will include this on their cvs?). at least i didn't pay to rent it. the best part of the film is definitely dani behr, but the rest of the film is complete and utter pants.
