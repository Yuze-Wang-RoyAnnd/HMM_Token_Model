being that i loved the original "caligula" even with all its flaws, i have to say this remake trailer was abysmal.<br /><br />listening to jovovich say in that lazy american accent "mmm cuhligyooluh..." makes me feel sick. the set doesn't look roman at all... it looks like some rich actor's hollywood mansion backyard, and the roman costumes look like cheap crap you buy at a suburban costume shop.<br /><br />that "charming" adriana asti looks like a fifty year old hispanic woman totally terrified out of her mind, as if not knowing it's a movie trailer.<br /><br />the acting has got to be some of the worst i've ever seen, with most of the lines i hear being random actors screaming "caligulaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!" as loudly and obnoxiously annoyingly as they can.<br /><br />the random sex scenes also filled a good 40 or 50% of the trailer, and the scenes with notable actors/actresses like gerard butler (who graces the screen in shadows for all of three and a half seconds) not doing anything but looking uncomfortable or going all-out over the top with their minimal lines, just dragging it down with the ridiculousness of their delivery.<br /><br />courtney love's part consists of her looking like her usual dumpy crack-whore self leaning against a door mumbling about the moon or something. you can't tell because she's either drunk or high or just mumbling idiotically.<br /><br />karen black is just annoying... randomly laughing, and screaming in such a way that irritates you.<br /><br />helen mirren... she was in the original, and her return to "caligula" consists of... "caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaligulaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" i particularly "love" (and by love, i mean hate) ennia's line, "caligola... j00 no maki me *something incoherent*.... *something that sounds like j00nalo*" it's also insanely arrogant to say caligula's four year reign was greater than jesus's birth and death.<br /><br />honestly, this has got to be the worst, most exploitative, self-indulgently arrogant piece of crap labeled as "art" i've ever seen. even if gore vidal hated the original caligula, he shouldn't have shown up or given his name over for this crap-pile, no matter how much they paid him (unless it was a billion trillion yen). worst trailer ever.
