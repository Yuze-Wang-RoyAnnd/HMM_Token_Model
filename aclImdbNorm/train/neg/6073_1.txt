*many many spoilers in this review* this movie was horrible. i am a huge baseball fan so i thought i'd watch it, and i was very disappointed. it started out okay.. when i saw the bad influence deniro had on his young son, i was hoping that he would become a better father throughout the movie or something. anyways, at the beginning it seemed as if deniro was supposed to be the protagonist. he was the only one that believed in bobby, and he had his adorable son that he was losing custody of, which gave me a reason to feel bad for him. he wanted to help bobby by talking to primo, when out of absolutely nowhere he brutally stabs primo to death... not to mention that sketchy reoccurring song "i want to **** you!!!!" at random unfitting moments.<br /><br />later, when deniro saves bobby's son from drowning, i was hoping that the movie could redeem itself.. he could forgive himself for killing primo if he saved bobby's son. but of course this is far beyond the depth of the movie, because all he cares about is getting credit for the murder, and does so by stealing bobby's son, car, and dog and holding them hostage- bobby just has to hit a home run and announce that deniro is a "true fan" while displaying a picture of him biting a knife.<br /><br />now we get to the completely unrealistic scene at the end... it is pouring like hell and we are expected to believe that the game hasn't been called. then deniro somehow magically appears on the field in an umpire suit and calls bobby out at home, proceeding to pull out his knife and start stabbing everyone that runs onto the field. there are seemingly no officers on the field (but the police are on their way), so deniro steps on the mound and prepares to pitch a knife to bobby when he gets shot to death. but don't worry, this cheerful and pleasant movie has a happy ending, because bobby find his son.<br /><br />this is not a sports movie. it is not about a fan. as far as i know, fans are not rabid psychopaths that threaten, rob, and throw knives at their admirees. this is likely to be the sickest movie i will ever see in my life. the plot was shallow, the soundtrack sucked, the movie had no purpose whatsoever. i warn you not to waste your time on this disgusting excuse for a film.
