this reminded me soo much of michael winner's crappy 'dirty weekend' with it's awful english low budget feel.<br /><br />firstly i must say i am a fan of both exploitation and serious film. i appreciate, say, 'demented' for it's ineptitude and 'last house on the left' for it's sheer unashamed brutality. and any number of inventive and increasingly brutal italian spin offs.<br /><br />this was just pointless though. kind of like a british budget director thought 'let's remake "i spit on your grave" without making it too harrowing now that horror is back in fashion with hostel.<br /><br />the whole thing just doesn't hang together or have a point. what's with the rapists's daughter? why bother having the man be an expert in security cameras? crappy.
