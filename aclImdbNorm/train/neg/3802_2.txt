i know that actors and actresses like to try different kinds of movies - hey, no one wants to get typecast - but danny glover, brenda fricker (happy birthday, brenda!) and christopher lloyd should have known better than this. "angels in the outfield" is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes and saves the day. do i even need to tell you how it ends? the movie is just plain lowly escapism (examples of high escapism are the various sci-fi movies from the '50s). if these movies had some political undertone - or at least offered us a new look at life - then they would be ok; this one is just pointless. far closer to diabolical than angelic. also starring tony danza, adrien brody and matthew mcconaughey, and i suspect that they don't wish to stress this in their resumes.
