i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because i think "the wild women of wongo" is worse. this is an exercise in patience. it's like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist. there's no plot. there's no logic. there is certainly no acting (although the shark has some quality dialogue). we don't wonder about anything. we don't know how people got where they got. it's always amazing to me how things like this even get released. i agree with the previous writer that it isn't even funny bad. i know. it's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a dvd collection. it's like a paperweight. or a bad painting you bought at a starving artists' sale. it covers the crack in the wall.
