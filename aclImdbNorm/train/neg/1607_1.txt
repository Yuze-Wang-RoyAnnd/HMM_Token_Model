this "documentary" is a proof of talent being used for mean purposes. the fact that it is financed by the venezuelan government gives it a lack of legitimacy in the purpose of searching for the truth of what really happened those horrible days of april 2002 in venezuela, something even we venezuelans don't know for sure.<br /><br />there are ways of lying, and the directors of this stuff lie both by omission and by knowledge. <br /><br />the venezuelan political process is too complex to be easily understood by foreign audiences, and they take advantage of that. for instance *possible spoilers* they show pro-ch'avez demonstrators shooting at an empty street (what the hell they did that for?) in a way of saying they didn't kill anyone, but didn't bother showing the images we all saw here, of opposition demonstrators (and a journalist) falling dead or injured at the other side of that "empty" street. they can't explain why the chopper of the political police was the only one authorised to fly over caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers that were all over the roofs of the buildings nearby the presidential palace, something that would exhibit how inefficient would be the security measures to guard the president. a few days after the "coup", the chief of the military guard in charge was asked at the national assembly (our congress) why didn't they act against the snipers and he said "'cause they weren't there to act against the president", isn't that a confession?<br /><br />there is so much more, the fact that the highest rank military announced that ch'avez had resigned and 2 days later he said he had lied because "that's politics" and nowadays is the minister of internal affairs of ch'avez' administration.<br /><br />it would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies depicted in this "documentary", made with the intention of selling the world an image of the good old hugo ch'avez who rules for the poor and the bad rich opposition that wants him out at all costs, when the truth is that 60-70% of people rejects his government, and that percentage includes the poor.<br /><br />i hope those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see a different version that is being made by a group of venezuelan people showing no less than 30 lies.<br /><br />nazi propaganda has returned!
