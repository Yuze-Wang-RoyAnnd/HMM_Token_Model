yeah i saw the rough cuts. the unedited sex scenes. the dire cut scenes. almost on a par with the film 'the need' for awful acting. this movie is as bad as bad films get.the bad script, bad acting, bad effects, bad locations, bad stunts bad everything. the best 'actors' in the film were the lap dancers they hired for the vampire extras!<br /><br />sean harry, the 'foppish actor' as someone else put it, makes a matchstick look talented here. his amazing ability to badly drive a car, when it is obviously being shook by people on the bonnet (check out the reflection in the windscreen), his inability to turn left, which is class. oh and don't forget the sex scene. plus his noteworthy use of a toy gun which the props guys couldn't even be bothered to disguise as a real gun. the other actors on screen could barely deliver their lines.it was as if half the time they were waiting for a line that wasn't there!<br /><br />the 'special effects' were soooo good to the point that the guys who did it took their real names off the credits!<br /><br />if you want a laugh at a party then rent this movie...then again there are plenty of good comedies that are just as funny and don't give money to people who don't deserve it.
