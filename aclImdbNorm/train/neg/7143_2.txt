this movie has some of the most awesome cars i've ever seen in a movie, and definitely the hottest women, but i would have to say it is still one of the worst movies i've ever seen.<br /><br />here is the plot, and if you read it with a little inflection, you have the acting as well.<br /><br />beginning, bring in characters, hot woman singing (obvious lip sync). music agent or producer comes in, thinks that she is awesome asks her to race. she turns down, too many bad memories. flash to war hero, back from war, has several fights, and becomes movie hero with attitude that he is better than everyone. drive off in fast exotic car. brother races, then dies. hero to avenge death, cut away to getting weapons from friend. (you have never seen this friend before or after, but seems to really care about him) are you sure you want to do this; yes; i mean are you really sure; yes, give me weapons; are you really sure; yes; ok, i guess i can't talk you out of it, be careful man, i love you.<br /><br />now he goes to blow up his uncles house who owned the car his brother drove. finds woman, decides to rescue her, she drives off, and he doesn't finish killing his uncle. now there will be a race to finish the movie. oh yeah, need to throw in one more scene with bad people coming in to beat up people that don't really matter, but maybe it adds a little plot. race is not even that exciting, of course it ends with two cars racing, and one that should win throws in a surprise ending.<br /><br />ok, i just saved you $7.00. you can send all of your money to me, because i should have given you the same amount of enjoyment as this movie does. don't get me wrong, the cars are awesome, and nadija is beautiful, but it is truly an awful movie.
