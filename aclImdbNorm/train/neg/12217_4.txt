as low budget indies go, you will usually find that you get what you pay for, and let me just say, i didn't pay much for "frightworld"...<br /><br />writer / director: david r. williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park, besieged by the vengeful spirit of a slain serial killer. not a bad premise, but executed with a bevy of low budget mistakes. the camera work tries to be too cleaver for it's audience, by constantly using shaky quick-cuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing gory or scary to show us. this becomes evident right off the bat, as we are introduced to the would-be killer, and soon realize that the (acting) is the scariest thing happening... after a painfully long title sequence we are brought back to modern times, yet the acting remains the same. "frightworld" does generate some rather unique cinematography when showing scenery from inside the fun-house, but with an extremely long running time, it can't save the film from it's below average indie hell.<br /><br />there is some mediocre nudity, but not much for gore, which is usually the saving grace for these types of movies.<br /><br />fans of really bad b-movies might find something of interest here, otherwise, don't spend a lot of cash.
