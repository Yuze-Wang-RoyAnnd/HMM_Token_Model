my kid makes better videos than this! i feel ripped off of the $4.00 spent renting this thing! there is no date on the video case, apparently designed by wellspring; and, what's even worse, there's no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie! the only date given is 2002, leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he's getting a recent film.<br /><br />this movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made, that i'm amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a video. it might be of interest to students studying the counter-culture of the 1960's, the anti-war, anti-establishment, tune-in, turn-on and drop out culture; but when you read the back of the video case, there's no hint that that is what you're getting. if you do make the mistake of renting it though, it is probably best viewed while on drugs, so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors, fassbinder and fengler. regardless of your state of mind while watching it, i can tell you that it doesn't get any better after the first scene; so, knowing that, i'm sure you'll be fast asleep long before the end.
