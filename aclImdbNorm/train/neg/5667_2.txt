had i checked imdb before renting this dvd from netflix, i'd have a couple of hours of my life back. i'm frankly suspicious when i see that a film's director also wrote it. in this case, according to the credits, the same guy was "writter and director" - unfortunately, an indication of the overall quality of this production. there were a few interesting moments (e.g., judy tenuta's scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting judy-ism) which led me to rate this two stars rather than one. those moments, however, were few and far between ... and i almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me, not to mention reprehensible in its violence. i admit i went back to watch that part again to see if i had missed something that would help me figure it out once i'd seen the whole thing. nope, though i at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later. the "spinning camera" technique was overused and essentially pointless. i found myself talking to the tv screen: "what?!?" or "for goodness sake, get on with it!" not recommended.
