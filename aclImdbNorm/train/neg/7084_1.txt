as many others have stated, this is a terrible movie, from every aspect of movie making. how they ever got some known name actors to take on this project is amazing.<br /><br />many people have complained that it was shot on 'cheap' video cameras. yes, it was shot on video, but not 'cheap' video. what made it bad was the lighting, white balancing, shooting technique and editing.<br /><br />there were so many different shooting and editing techniques used that it was a production mess. harsh, inconsistent lighting, over use of hand held shooting (ala woody allen), choppy editing (another allen technique), but poorly done, without real purpose.<br /><br />the lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen scenes is embarrassing; very amateurish.<br /><br />the simulated sex scenes had no acting value at any level.<br /><br />how this video ever made it to print is beyond me. it is worth watching if only to be amazed at how bad it is.
