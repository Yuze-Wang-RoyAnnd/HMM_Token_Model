the first look on the cover of this picture, it looks like a good rock n roll movie. but don't let the cover fool you, or the fact that alice cooper and blondie is in it. the storyline is just horrible, and so is the acting. plain and simple: bad<br /><br />it's not a movie about a roadie, its just a thin love story, so awful that you see right through it. the only good thing about this movie, is the soundtrack.some good songs, and that is why i give 2 out of 10. if it wasn't for the music, it would of been 0 out of 10. meat loaf is a horrible actor(at least he was in 1980), and the girl who plays the groupie isn't even good looking! this movie was a huge disappointment for me, because it makes a lot of good promises.
