*spoilers and extreme bashing lay ahead*<br /><br />when this show first started, i found it tolerable and fun. fairly oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked. it also had high ratings along with spongebob. but it started to fall because of the following crap that butch hartman and his team shoved into the show.<br /><br />first off, toilet humor isn't all that funny. you can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp, but that's pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a clich'e joke. next there are the kiddie jokes. lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people cross-dressing. lololol!!! i just can't stop laughing at such gay bliss! somebody help me! but of course, this show wouldn't suck that bad if it weren't for stereotypes. did you see how the team portrayed australians? they saw them as nothing but kangaroo-loving, boomerang-throwing simpletons who live in a hot desert. but now... is the coup de grace of why this show truly sucks the loudest of them all... over-used jokes!!! the show constantly pulls up the same jokes (the majority of them being unfunny) thinking it is like the greatest thing ever! cosmo is mostly the one to blame. i hated how they kept on mentioning "super toilet" (which also has a blend of kiddish humor in it just as well) and cosmo would freak out. and who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in dimmsdale would use in that one e-mail episode? you know, the one in which every single parent (oblivious to other parents saying it) would utter the exact same sentence before breaking into their kid's room? yes, it may be first class humor to some people, but it is pure s*** to others.<br /><br />if i'm not mistaken, i do believe butch hartman said something about ending the show. thank god! everyone around my area says it's, like, the funniest nickelodeon show ever. i just can't agree with it
