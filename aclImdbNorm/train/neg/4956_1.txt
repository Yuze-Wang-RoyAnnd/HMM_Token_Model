when this cartoon first aired i was under the impression that it would be at least half way descent, boy was i wrong. i must admit watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching batman and robin with george clooney all those years ago. i watched a few episodes and two of them had batman literally get his ass kicked left and right by the penguin who fought like jet li and beat the crap out of batman and i watched another episode where batman got his butt kicked again by the joker, who apparently was using jackie chan moves while flipping in the air like a ninja. since when were the joker or the penguin ever a match for batman ? and worse yet when were joker and penguin kung fu counterparts of jackie chan and jet li. it's truly embarrassing, depressing and sad the way the image of batman is portrayed in this show. the animation is awful and the dialog is terrible. being a batman fan since my boyhood i can honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all cost, because it doesn't project the true image of batman. this cartoon is more like a wannabe kung fu flick and if you really wanna see a classic batman cartoon i strongly recommend batman the animated series, but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of s---t! get batman: the animates series and don't waste your time with this cartoon.
