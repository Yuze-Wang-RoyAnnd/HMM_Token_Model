those 2 points are dedicated the reasonable performance from akshay kumar. i know bollywood films do not really strive to be realistic but please a walt disney production is more realistic than this plot. the father is dying and does what any good parent does...kick his son out the son with his pregnant wife. a few things that were too hard to swallow- 1. priyanka 'cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom' and to go from that to living hungry in her in-laws garden shed???????? 2. akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man, gets bitten by rabified dogs, to then just walk off. this film is an insult to our intelligence i really cant believe i contributed financially to the 'people' who made this film by taking my family to see it, we left the cinema with a frown, please do not subject yourself to this mess to watching this take my advice and do not waste your 'waqt'.
