for a film with so much promise it was disappointing, thinly plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and unbelievable.the plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and it's the worst clich'ed ending i've seen in a movie for some time. the final scene would have ripped my heart out, if the entire movie hadn't been so painful to begin with. i was numb! from the very first scene - one was left wondering, if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help, or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting i've seen to date. it was a horror in the true sense of the word.
