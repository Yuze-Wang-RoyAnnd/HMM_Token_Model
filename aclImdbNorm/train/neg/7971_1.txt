i am not sure who is writing these<br /><br />glowing reviews for this movie but trust me it stkinks. i have seen hundreds of horror films and slasher flicks and this one is lame it is only about 80min long and believe me that is all i could take. plot is terrible, acting is even worse. and there is no development at all.<br /><br />even the david cocteau films are better than this. run away from jigsaw . i expected to hate the acting, which can be forgiven in direct to video movies, if the plot is good.<br /><br />this had no scares, very little gore,<br /><br />and a truly unattractive cast.<br /><br />i watched this with three other friends<br /><br />who i hope are still talking to me!<br /><br />they wanted me to fling the disc out the window. i can not believe anyone could have<br /><br />given this tripe a good review.
