i wish i could say that this show was unusual in it's banality,but it is usual in every way.it has the dumb husband,his smarter but boring and conventional wife, along with the idiotic sidekick for "comic" relief-it sorely needs it.stale predictable jokes, with even more predictable reactions from the laughtrack, punctuate this noxious mental narcotic's nauseatingly unimaginative plot lines to leave me either physically ill, or in a deep sleep more resembling that of an induced coma. but it might be on for a while yet because it gives the average american a personage to which they can truly identify.a "regular" guy just like you and me.i live in the southern u.s, so to me this show is just the opposite of escapism.down here, that obnoxious character is everywhere, in some form or another.seeing him on television is brutal overkill.
