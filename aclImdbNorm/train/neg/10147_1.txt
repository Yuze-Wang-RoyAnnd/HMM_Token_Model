i usually don't comment anything (i read the others opinions)... but this, this one i _have_ to comment... i was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action, f-117 and other hi-tech stuff, but by only few first minutes and i changed my mind... lousy acting, lousy script and a big science fiction.<br /><br />it's one of the worst movies i have ever seen...<br /><br />simply... don't bother...<br /><br />and one more thing, before any movie i usually check user comments and rating on this site... 3.7 points and i give this movie a try, now i'm wondering who rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points ??????????
