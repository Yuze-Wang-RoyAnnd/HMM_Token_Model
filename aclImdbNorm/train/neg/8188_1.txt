the most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is its conceit that if one becomes a saint, he or she and his or her family and his or her significant other live forever. let's forget that in order to become a saint, the saint must be dead, and saints don't have significant others. that, for a millennium, nick has been the jolly elf to fred's scrooge is never even hinted at! open on nick learning how to make toys, then on fred learning how to run numbers; nick giving a sick child a dolly, fred repossessing the dolly, along with the family farm! after a few more such episodes, morph to present-day fred venting his spleen at siblings anonymous as his fellow losers nod in empathy. there, i just wrote a more cohesive storyline than this idiocy!<br /><br />this santa, who is one "ho, ho, ho, ho, ho" away from a massive coronary, is a neurotic wuss saddled with the queen of the harpies, an operation straight out of mega-mall hell, and answers to a board (huh?) which just gave the easter bunny his pink egg. oh, and his right-hand man is a ditzy blonde in a skin-tight mini-dress and go-go boots. ho... ho... ho... ho... ho!<br /><br />but what really sent me over the edge was slam being named #1 on the naughty list. shouldn't a naughty list be reserved for the future hitlers and stalins? children who are the true embodiments of evil? nope, to old sausage-fingers, a good boy who lashes out because he is unwanted and unloved is the demon seed!<br /><br />the nimrods behind fred claus should be boiled in their own pudding! bah!
