another weak third-season entry, 'is there in truth no beauty?' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as spock would say, fascinating. the main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. it's too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise. obviously, i think, it was a mistake to ever 'show' the alien, as its actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting build-up; all we get is the standard star trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. in any event, kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by mr. spock, and then only if spock is wearing a special visor. (for the longest time, i thought the alien's name was 'carlos,' which i found humorous, but i digress.) spock is required to mind-meld with kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the enterprise back to safety. this is accomplished, but when spock/kollos go back to end the mind-meld, by golly, spock forgets his visor. uh oh. he goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. this might have been a really bizarre, excellent episode but it is poorly directed and comes across as yet one more badly executed show of the series' last season.
