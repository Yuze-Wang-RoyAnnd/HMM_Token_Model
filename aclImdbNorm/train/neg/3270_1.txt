it is enjoyable and fast-paced. <br /><br />there is no way on earth that the actor playing mat could be eighteen. however, the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly. it must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him. i quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy.<br /><br />while his was the best performance, most of the others were also very engaging. in particular, the interplay between the policemen was natural and well-balanced, and worked very well.<br /><br />it is only about 45 minutes long, so the plot is not complex. more key is the style of the whole thing. it is very slick and vibrant, and the backdrops are atmospheric, especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich. the gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences, but still manages to be distinctly australian.
