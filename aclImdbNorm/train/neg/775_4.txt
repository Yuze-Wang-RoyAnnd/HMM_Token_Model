john candy. need we say more? he is the main reason you should see this film. most people don't realize how gifted he was as an actor. witness him changing from poor slob to horny jerk. just a simple(subtle) facial change and off we go. there are many great bits in this movie and many really dumb bits. the best moments for me are the kung fu u scenes as well as the great moment when john(in a trance) goes up on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend-that is how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend. i'm sure reading this you might think this sequence sounds really crude. it is, but it is also very funny mainly because it is john candy doing this bit. the story in general is pretty lame and eugene levy and joe flaherty(both sctv alumni with candy) are not given enough to do in the film. levy has his moments, especially filming the wedding at the end(think rod serling) and the great scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone. overall a good movie if you have had a tough day and need to put your brain on stupid. i give this one 4 out of 10.
