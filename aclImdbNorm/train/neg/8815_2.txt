yes, i am just going to tell you about this one so don't read if you want surprises. i got this one with the title christmas evil. there was also another christmas horror on the dvd called silent night, bloody night. whereas silent night, bloody night (not to be confused with silent night, deadly night) had lots of potential and was very close to being good, this one wasn't quite as good. it started out interesting enough watching the villain (if you can call him that) watching the neighborhood kids and writing in books about who is naughty and nice, but after awhile you are looking for some action and this movie doesn't deliver. you need character development, but this goes overboard and you are still never sure why the heck the guy snaps. about an hour in he kills three of four people while a whole crowd watches in terror, and the guys he kills aren't even his targets they are just making fun of him. this is one of many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to knock of the naughty. he then proceeds to try and kill this other guy, and he tries to break into his house by squeezing himself into the fireplace. he promptly gets stuck and barely manages to get out. he then enters through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by smothering him in his bedroom. he can't seem to kill the guy this way so he grabs a star off the tree and slits the guys throat. what the heck was a tree even doing in the bedroom in the first place? oh yeah, the killer before this kill stopped off at a party and had some fun too. well that is about it except for the town people chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and that tune he wants to play. what was that even about? he kept talking about something that was never really explained. how does it end you ask, well since i have spoilers i will tell you. he runs off the road in his van and proceeds to, well lets just say it was lame!!!!!!!!!!!!
