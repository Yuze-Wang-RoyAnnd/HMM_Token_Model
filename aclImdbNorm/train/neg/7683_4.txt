"the cobweb" is an example of many examples of movies that feature strong, sometimes noteworthy performances and high points, but unfortunately are shattered and slowed down drastically by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience. it stars richard widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all.<br /><br />the plot is preposterous. its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows. one old woman wants to have her drapes put over them, but a lot of the patients want to make their own. and somehow, this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart. it sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children.<br /><br />the questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a real-like lunatic could buy it. don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with the acting. the cast following widmark is composed of other great actors, many of them academy award-nominees and winners. and there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly, but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes. unfortunately, there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus, the movie slows down. a lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint, adhering to the slow pacing and lack of viewing interest.<br /><br />in a short analysis, "the cobweb" is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus, which it does pretty quickly. it just really doesn't sound like much fun to watch and i tell you that it is not much fun to watch.
