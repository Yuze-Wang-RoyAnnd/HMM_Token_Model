as a great admirer of marlene dietrich, i had to (finally) watch this very, very dull picture. it is miss dietrich's first color film, and the world's most beautiful blond is a redhead! bad start. the story is a tremendous bore, involving a subject which itself bores bores me stiff: religious guilt. (who needs it???) suffice it to say, perhaps, that of all dietrich's films (and i have seen most, including "pittsburgh") this is the only one where even her performance is barely worth watching. the color photography is ok (this is a very early technicolor release), but to no purpose. ridiculous casting: c. aubrey smith, basil rathbone (enough said?). the only thing of any interest at all is john carradine's outlandish caricature of a performance as "the sand diviner," who foretells all that will happen. the supposed "happy ending" is one of the most depressing ever conceived. yet another example of david o. selznick's highly inflated reputation (did he ever make a really good film? -- other than that one?) and, for one final annoyance, the soundtrack of the mgm dvd is a mess, with volume levels seemingly randomized. highly unrecommended.
