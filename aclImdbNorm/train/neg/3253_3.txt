i actually saw china o'brien ii before i ever saw the original china o'brien. and i have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse. but: worse = funnier! and funnier = better. if you're a bad movie fan like i am, this is great material. if, however, you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot, acting ability, or movie-making skill, this is best avoided. the best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in stuttering fast-forward. hilariously bad. see it for a laugh, see it for mindless entertainment, but whatever you do, see it for free on tv.
