this film differentiates itself from the run-of-the-mill "wonder of the human body" documentaries by bravely, if bizarrely, opting to elicit disgust in the viewer. in one scene, the camera closes in on a gigantic 50-foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it. in another, the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo. in a final tour de force, the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of...teenage armpit hair. unfortunately, i'm not making any of this up. see this film if you must, but: bring your vomit bag, and don't have pasta salad beforehand.
