this scared the hell out of me when i was a teenager. now i find it more amusing than scary, but with some pretty unsettling moments and with a kind of sleazy quality to it that i like. and, come to think of it, the plot is rather disgusting actually...but handled with some kind of taste. if there is a problem with this movie, it is that there are huge gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens. also, the ending goes on forever, making a potentially tense climax seem silly after a while with barbara bach screaming and screaming. the "monster", after it is exposed, isn't very scary either unfortunately. the somewhat drab look of the movie also works against it, making it appear as a tv-movie more than something made for theaters. but it is an example of films that are rarely made nowadays so i urge horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic...
