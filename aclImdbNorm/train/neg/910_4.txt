the story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no-brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring. some of the audience seemed to find it funny but i like more intelligent humor.<br /><br />there were several known swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script. lena endre was good looking as always.<br /><br />i don't remember the original movie so i can't say if it's better or worse.<br /><br />if you enjoy movies like s"allskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at.
