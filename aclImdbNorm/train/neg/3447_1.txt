this is easily one of the worst 5 movies i've ever seen. it's not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot outline. this movie is agonizingly slow and i was bored for almost all 98 minutes. while the acting is mediocre at best, the biggest problem is the script, which is poorly written, slow and plodding with no real direction. occasionally an eerie mood is set only to be broken by some useless line or event. i'm not surprised that the entire cast was sick and throwing up between shots, they did after all have to try and digest a terrible script. as a huge fan of good horror movies, i'm always irritated that something this bad gets made. save yourself 98 minutes you'll never get back.
