i was thirteen years old, when i saw this movie. i expected a lot of action. since escape from new york was 16-rated in germany i entered the movie as fallback. it was so boring. afterwards i realized that this was just crap where a husband exhibits his wife. i mean today you do this via internet and you pay for instant access. it is more then 20 years ago, but i am still angry that i waste my time with this film. this is a soft-porno for schoolboys. undressing bo derek and painting her with color - nice. but then they should named the film undressing bo and painting her.
