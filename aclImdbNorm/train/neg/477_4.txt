i read somewhere that when kay francis refused to take a cut in pay, warner bros. retaliated by casting her in inferior projects for the remainder of her contract.<br /><br />she decided to take the money. but her career suffered accordingly.<br /><br />that might explain what she was doing in "comet over broadway." (though it doesn't explain why donald crisp and ian hunter are in it, too.) "ludicrous" is the word that others have used for the plot of this film, and that's right on target. the murder trial. her seedy vaudeville career. her success in london. her final scene with her daughter. no part logically leads to the next part.<br /><br />also, the sets and costumes looked like b-movie stuff. and her hair! turner is showing lots and lots of her movies this month. watch any other one and you'll be doing yourself a favor.
