terrible film made on a budget of about $9.99. very obvious miniature sets used, poor acting and an awful storyline concerning aliens who use discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship. the film contains some blood (not enough to disturb) and a character with an eggbeater replacing one of his hands. (yes you read that correctly.)<br /><br />one saving grace was a song performed at the "talent show" (how's that for irony?) by a punk/new wave band that i think was called "i'm a heat seeking missile". other than that, this is not worth your time, not even on a "so bad it's good" level. watch if you are into cheesy alien films, but anyone else should steer clear. <br /><br />rating: 1 out of 10
