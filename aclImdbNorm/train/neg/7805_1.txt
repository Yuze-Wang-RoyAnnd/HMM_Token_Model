an actor's first film is usually something one can afford to miss - it's often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display, and this film is no exception.<br /><br />but worse than that, even by 1982 standards this is so bad, it's hysterically funny. filmed entirely in the chicago area on an obviously small budget, most of the acting by the entire cast is stiff, wooden, and cartoonish - a cross between a high school play and bad community theater. noise from nearby traffic often drowns out the dialog, and the dialog is truly bad, very declarative in a way that comes off as forced and expedient rather than natural and organic. scenes are contrived and choppy, and even though the characters go through a span of years, neither the children nor the adults age at all.<br /><br />i do believe it's possible to make a christian film that's palatable to a large, secular audience, but too often the creators of such films are so focused on 'the message' or in this case, their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values are tossed aside. (i'm sure it's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer/director/editor - and cast member.) <br /><br />luckily, michael madsen was much more interesting - and believable - to watch in his subsequent films. careers like his are certainly not built on films like this one.
