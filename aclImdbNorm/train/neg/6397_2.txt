that's a problem i have with movies that come on television, when there is nothing else to watch. i somehow get sucked into really bad movies.<br /><br />but this one was fairly watchable. the concept of being the only ones left on earth after a comet, then finding out zombies are around makes me laugh. and that's why i gave this movie a 2, instead of 1. the story was stupid...but in that way that makes you laugh (too stupid >funny).<br /><br />i think i only watched it because the guy from star trek was the lead. i was surprised to see him as a younger guy...and he was the only funny character anyway.
