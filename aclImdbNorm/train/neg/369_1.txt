i almost called hbo and demanded my money back for the month just because they've been airing this movie. i can just see the movie execs sitting around going, "okay, we need to come up with something that's just like home alone, only we'll add a bunch of cash for the kid, hire cut-rate actors, and oh yeah, we'll make it a lot less funny!"<br /><br />okay, maybe not the last part, but that's basically what you've got here. not even worth seeing if someone else rents it. and as a movie for kids? forget it. i wouldn't let my kids see this, not necessarily because of bad-taste jokes, but because i wouldn't want them to say, "what were you thinking showing us that lame piece of garbage, dad?!?!"
