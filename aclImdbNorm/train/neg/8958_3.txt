i wasn't really fond of the first "cube" movie. it was a good idea, but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much. didn't really feel the need to see its sequel but when i heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original. i was intrigued, thinking that maybe they would fix some of the original's problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters. well i thought wrong.<br /><br />"cube zero" starts well enough by introducing us with the two characters in charge of watching and maintaining the never-ending maze of traps that plagues the people in the cube. the filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two men's daily routine. several questions are created from it, concerning the reason why people are send there and also the true nature of the ones who run the entire operation. all of which are left entirely to the viewer. the acting was a bit weak but all in all the movie's first half moved relatively well.<br /><br />with the story moving on, one of the two "watchers" begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing. and later decides to go and help a group of the people trapped. here is where everything rapidly starts to dissolve into dull cheese.<br /><br />sent by the people who run the cube program we are introduced to the character "jax". along with his two underlings play a major reason as to why this movie is failure. to start of "jax" looks and talks more like a third rate villain taken directly from a james bond movie complete with the ever "popular" glass eye, that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the first half's relatively nice pace. whats more is that it begins to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie. with some incredibly corny lines, perhaps the screenwriter got bored and didn't care. the acting itself degrades to a further low when the former "watcher" meets the group in the cube. the entire interaction is painful to watch as is everything else following it.<br /><br />again failing to impress on anything but weak characters, dialog and acting "cube zero" is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie.
