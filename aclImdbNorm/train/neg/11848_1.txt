what is supposed to be a simple generic mystery plot involving a dead philanthropist is, in fact, a head-ache inducing tale about a bunch of characters (the only big actor being ginger rogers, in a very early role) all trying to find the murderer among a small cast of residents in a posh apartment building. these characters range from utterly stupid to downright mean. as a cheap, low budget production, most of the action revolves around rogers and her lead man (some guy, i don't care who he is 'cause he really sucked) talking about their various possibilities of solving the crime, while being constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head in his butt. honestly, i've never had a worse time watching an old b-rate movie of this type, and i've seen some real head-slappers.<br /><br />oh, and the butler didn't do it, because there wasn't a butler. but pay attention to the guy who's closest to a butler. there ya go.<br /><br />--polarisdib
