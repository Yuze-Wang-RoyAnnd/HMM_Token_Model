i'm not particularly fond of remakes, or to steal the modern jargon "retellings", but this film truly peeved me off. the original prom night, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. there are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! the scares were cheap, and foreshadowed terribly. (a good example of scare which has been done to clich'ed excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) this film couldn't successfully pull that off, so how could i expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. there needs to be a likable hero or heroine. this film doesn't have one. the person i most identified with was the head detective. his calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. common sense approach to events that occur. (if you're running from an axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killer's progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path.) if you friend disappears, you don't go looking for them alone. and if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. these clich'es are tired and well overplayed. in the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular.
