having listened to and enjoyed harvey bernhard's omen ii commentary i was shocked to discover he was also behind this absolute piece of rubbish. it's like a really bad tv movie you might glimpse in the middle of the day when you have the flu and are too ill to reach the remote. i think at the bit where michael lerner is confronted by what i can only describe as a high school cast of les miserables my mouth hung open in disbelief. and then my mouth was going up and down because i was laughing so much. dire. i don't know why i have to write a minimum of ten lines, i have made my point succinctly, there's nothing clever about all this modern verbiage.
