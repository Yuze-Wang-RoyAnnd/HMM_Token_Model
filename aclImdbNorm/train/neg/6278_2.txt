you gotta wonder how some flics ever get made... this one decided to skip with the why among many other things and just wanders off beyond the moot. <br /><br />and yet you have a number of decent actors doing their best to pump some life into the story. the blue tint throughout the movie overshoots into 'yet again', which on its own would be depressing but here it's overkill. the idea that it's not a medical condition, not some house or gypsy or trinket curse but just something that for no apparent reason starts to happen to our protagonist and then to everyone else around her, just winds up being much like taking a big swig out of an empty mug. some doppelgangers have super powers but others don't or don't know they do? it seems they're just as clueless as we are.<br /><br />it's a poor man's rip-off of "invasion of the body-snatchers" with keifer sutherland's "mirror" and "the sixth sense", were you to seriously botch those three together.
