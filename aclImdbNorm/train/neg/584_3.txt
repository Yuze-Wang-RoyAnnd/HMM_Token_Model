this film, like the first one ("the man from snowy river") has the same good and bad features, perhaps even more so than the original. unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good. <br /><br />the good - magnificent scenery, better than the first film. i love those high country shots in australia. tom burlinson is still a likable guy, as "jim craig." bruce rowland did a nice job with the music, too.<br /><br />the bad - once again we get an extremely obnoxious feminist heroine "jessica" (sigrid thornton) who is a world-class pouter with an extremely annoying face and manner about her. in this film, we also get a big downgrade in who pays the father. previously it was kirk douglas, now replaced by the always -profane brian dennehy. speaking of that, it is a disgrace that a walt disney film would includes usages of the lord's name in vain. that was one reason was almost totally down the tubes in the 1980s. this film, like the first one
