i won't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't good either. i expected something good but i guess hum aapke hain kaun was much better than this. this was completely old fashioned. at every stage of this movie, i hoped for some twist and what do i get? the girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love. <br /><br />despite of being engaged, they have to take permission for every little move they make. they are so darn shy even after so many meetings. i expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. all she did was crib madly. <br /><br />hey, we have kids too, but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always. this movie is a dream. happy family, one cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. in hahk anupam kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa. and i somehow knew that mohnish behl would be in this movie. anyway i believe i wasted my time. i give it a 2/10.
