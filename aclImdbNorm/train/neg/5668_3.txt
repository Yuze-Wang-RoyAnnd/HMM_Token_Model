first off - there's absolutely no flirting going on in this film - with anthony or anyone else. these people don't flirt - they just do it. your first test of endurance is to wade through more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion. this wouldn't be so bad - hell, i like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer, but without a context to put it in, it is repellent. so you make it through the torture and mayhem. then we meet donna and the movie turns into something all together different - not better - just different: a road picture without heart. there are lame attempts at comedy thanks to cameos - broadly written and broadly played by broads like judy tenuta and mink stole (and a few hookers and drag queens, too). they all deserve better. the photography is purposely disorienting, so if you get motion sickness (or really any kind of sickness) - this flick is not for you. come to think of it, i'm not sure just who this flick is for -except maybe gay and bi-sexual s&m fans who like poorly scripted, poorly shot indy films about themselves.
