only reason i have seen 101 dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the oscars. i must admit that i was less than impressed with this film. in this sequel, cruella devil(by the way glen close pulls off this role very well) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour. she likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away. from that point, we only wait until she starts having crises. soon enough, she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world, of course for herself and from fine dalmatian fur. apart from glen close, i found all cast quite silly but from a child's eye funny. that is fair enough as its target market is, i assume, children under 12. quite a good entertainment for children and families, but didn't do much for me. * out of *****
