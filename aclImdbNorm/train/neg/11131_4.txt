first off, i agree with quite a bit that escapes mr. chomsky's mouth. his matter-of-fact delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a hit on the university campus circus. he comes across likable, unassuming, pragmatic. he doesn't cater to the current political style (obnoxious bi-partisanship) and he sets his sights on the far left as well as the far right, chastising both, and for good reason.<br /><br />unfortunately, the film itself is a dud. in fact, i would not even call this a documentary but rather just a collection of speeches. watching "rebel without a pause" is no different from watching a speaker on a 3am taped segment on cspan. there are no camera movements, no edits, no stylistic touches. there is no story, no narrative.<br /><br />technically speaking, the production is strictly amateurish. audio is terrible and inconsistent; sometimes we cannot hear noam speak, other times we cannot hear the questions that are being posited by those in attendance. when noam is speaking rarely are we allowed to see the reactions of the audience except when we are given a quick shot of his wife who apparently attends every one of his speeches and beams with pride every time we see her.<br /><br />i cannot recommend this film and would say that you're probably better off checking out his taped speeches on cassette or cd to listen to in the car.<br /><br />4 out of 10 stars...and i'm in a generous mood today.
