basically there's a family where a little boy (jake) thinks there's a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time.<br /><br />this movie is slower than a soap opera... and suddenly, jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie.<br /><br />ok, first of all when you're going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama! as a drama the movie is watchable. parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life. and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film! i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie, and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots.<br /><br />3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs. as for the shots with jake: just ignore them.
