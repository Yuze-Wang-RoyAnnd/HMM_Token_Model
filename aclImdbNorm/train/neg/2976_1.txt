miraculously, this is actually quite watchable. i mean, it's bad. it's really bad. but whereas the original was so-bad-it's-ruining-my-life bad, this is so-bad-it's-mildly-entertaining bad. right, that's enough faint praise. production values are rotten across the board, the acting is excruciating and the romero-wannabe satire can't make its mind up which side of the ecology fence it's mocking. internal logic takes a back seat to heads propelling themselves out of fridges, virus incubation times fluctuating as the 'plot' requires, bullets working against the zombies or not, zombies having the power of speech or not. gore is the draw, obviously, but the framework is so slapdash it's annoying. the dialogue sounds like it's been translated by the same computers that mangle instruction manuals, and the scale of the zombie infestation is implied with none of the ingenuity of romero's films. it's all topped off with a horrendous synth score. absolute rubbish.
