the flock is not really a movie. it's a wannabe movie, with wannabe actors. not including richard gere, he gave an excellent performance, but when only one of the actors truly gives himself to his character, and the rest of the cast is just acting... the result is pathetic, just like this movie. you see, the idea of acting is to hide the fact that you're acting. what the hell was claire dains doing in this one?! she's the most inappropriate actress for this character. in 99.9% of the movie she looked extremely out of place, out of everything!! the only thing she was doing was asking stupid questions, like " do you really think so?? " , and making silly faces. i was embarrassed by her acting, seriously, and i used to like her... she's the romantic movie type, i don't know who picked her among all the actresses out there.... lol, and seeing avril lavigne?! this really made me laugh.. anyway.. if you want to get the feeling of throwing up, this movie will do the job for you!!! i wish i could vote -5..
