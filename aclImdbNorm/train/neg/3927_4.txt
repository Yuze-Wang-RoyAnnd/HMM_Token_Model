a so common horror story about a luxury building at brooklyn which hides the gates to hell. it is reminiscent of polanski's "the tenant" (released a year before "the sentinel"), but is too far from the movie of the polish filmmaker in any aspect possible. "the tenant" was so disturbing, whereas "the sentinel" is not at all.<br /><br />what it's more surprising from this film is the cast: it is full of great names of american cinema (burguess, gardner, wallach), veteran actors acting for food (i guess).<br /><br />verdict: barely entertaining.<br /><br />*my rate: 4/10
