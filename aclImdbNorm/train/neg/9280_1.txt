honestly, i don't know what's funnier, this horrific remake, or the comments on this board. masterpiece's review had me in tears, that's so funny. anyway, this movie is the among the worst movies ever, and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels. the "omen" name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on hbo, but it's a slap in the face to the other three, especially the original. there are so many classically bad moments, but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic fair!! good times ! this movie is to the omen series what "scary movie" is to the entire genre. avoid unless you're looking for a good laugh.
