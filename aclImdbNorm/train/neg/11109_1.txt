i am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this! i haven't seen such a bad movie for years.omg this was a really bad movie. splatter, is not enough to describe the unnecessary (nearly funny) blood scenes). if you didn't like hostel2 or wolf creek or halloween (2007) ..well this is 10 time worse. the story remind me rl stine goosebumps.!<br /><br />i can't tell about the acting since the script was so terrible.clich'e all the time. (why i must write 10lines? i never understood this.)<br /><br />==here comes spoilers==<br /><br />the story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro. we are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice. actually those people are just missing. and there is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery (well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy) and as usual no one believes him! what a surprise! in the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher!
