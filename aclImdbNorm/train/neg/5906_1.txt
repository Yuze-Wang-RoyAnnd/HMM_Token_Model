this movie was terrible. the plot sucked, the acting was bad, the editing was inept and this movie makes me want to poke my eyes out. i wish i had the time i spent watching this movie back. the balloon scene was stupid, the mormon jokes are really old, the soundtrack sucked, i saw no chemistry between the two leads, it's full of stereotypes, stupid local "celeb" cameo's..most noted was del "i'm going to drive as fast as i want to.." computer idiot. what is worst is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even they screwed that up. this movie help create a long line of lackluster efforts to mainstream lds beliefs into hollywood. i.e. the rm, church ball, etc. etc. i would forgo watching this movie and instead run head first into a brick wall. you will be more entertained than watching this poor excuse for a show.
