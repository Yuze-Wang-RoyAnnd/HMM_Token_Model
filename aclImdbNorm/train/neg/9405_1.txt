i just finished watching this on tv and what can i say but this is the worst film i have ever seen! i'm embarrassed to be from melbourne, where the film was made. diabolical acting, amateurish makeup effects and a really bad soundtrack. as for the plot, well, thats even more stupid! some of the scenes just left me stunned as to how bad it was. there's a reason they put these types of films on late night tv - because they're utter rubbish! avoid at all costs.
