as a physics student, i've become aware of many idiot professors, and other so-called experts, in the field. as i continue with my studies, i learn more and more about real physics experiments going on, and about the people who are doing things right.<br /><br />then, my friends tell me of this "physics movie" they want to see. knowing nothing of it, i'm excited, hoping that the information will be presented well.<br /><br />i've done real quantum mechanics; this wasn't it.<br /><br />this movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can, and will, occur to you, if you just open your eyes. let's think about that, for just a moment.<br /><br />our bodies are composed of somewhere around 10^30 such subatomic particles. that is a million billion billion billion particles! the more "mysterious" quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50% probability of cancelling each other out completely. as you add more and more particles into the mix, it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result. to tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption, with no rationality behind it...it's just stupid.<br /><br />my friend, also in physics, and i counted 3 facts during the course of this movie. but they were presented in the most misleading manner i've ever seen.<br /><br />i cannot say as much for the neural portion of the movie, as i have not had any kind of medical training. it seemed as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it, remembering my days in biology, but i cannot say.<br /><br />at least this film had a redeeming quality: the dancing peptides (or whatever they actually were) scene. not to ruin the invaluable plot that drives this movie, but the main character goes to a wedding, where she sees all different types of personalities "driven" by their peptides*, and then the film cuts to the dance floor, where we are spliced between people dancing, sometimes surrounded by cg peptides, and a fully cg scene, filled with dancing peptides. the film, at that point, was trying to tell us how we're "addicted to emotions," so we're treated to the full song of that smash hit, "addicted to love."<br /><br />this scene was redeeming, because anyone who could go through that scene, and still take this movie seriously...well, you are the ones that need to "open your eyes."
