i was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a bernard malamud story. this is basically a story of possible redemption, racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrust.<br /><br />a black jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife. if morris mishkin (zero mostel) will only believe in the angel (belafonte), his wife fanny (ida kaminska) will recover. the problem is that morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that belafonte is an angel.<br /><br />when he believes it, fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and fanny suffers accordingly. it would have been very nice if there had been an english translation in the last scene when a dying fanny speaks to morris.<br /><br />jan kadar, who successfully directed miss kaminska in her oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966's "the shop on main street" directs this film as well. kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesn't convey the desperate situation that she faces. she keeps calling for ruthie, their daughter, who disobeyed them by marrying out of the jewish religion. for most of the film, she does not realize the angel's appearance in her apartment.<br /><br />the scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the angel's girl friend confronts belafonte in their apartment, is memorable but all too brief.<br /><br />we don't know why belafonte is in danger and why he has died.<br /><br />those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation.
