reading through all these positive reviews i find myself baffled. how is it that so many enjoyed what i consider to be a woefully bad adaptation of my second favourite jane austen novel? there are many problems with the film, already mentioned in a few reviews; simply put it is a hammed-up, over-acted, chintzy mess from opening credits to butchered ending.<br /><br />while many characters are mis-cast and neither ewan mcgregor nor toni collette puts in a performance that is worthy of them, the worst by far is paltrow. i have very much enjoyed her performance in some roles, but here she is abominable - she is self-conscious, nasal, slouching and entirely disconnected from her characters and those around her. an extremely disappointing effort - though even a perfect emma could not have saved this film.
