well its official. they have just killed american pie. the first 3 were absolutely hysterical, but this one and the others have been awful. i mean the story is about two college fraternity's who battle each other for its houses, i mean come on talk about a weak plot, the first three dealt with growing up, change and marriage, which are all worthy points of development in human society.<br /><br />the new stifler is the biggest joke, i know its hard trying to compare yourself with the steven stifler but so no cigar. i give this movie a 3 because there is 2-3 funny bits in the film.<br /><br />the best character in this movie of course is jim's dad i don't know why he keeps continuing to do these poorly developed films.
