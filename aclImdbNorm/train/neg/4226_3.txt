wow...i can't believe just how bad zombie doom (aka violent sh!t 3) really is. i'd heard the rumors, read the reviews - but had to make my mind up for myself. well, let me tell ya - it blows!!! the worst acting of any film ever made, dubbing that must have been done while everyone involved was completely wasted, inept and laughable gore fx, no discernible plot, "cinematography" that looks like my grandma filmed it with her camcorder, weapons props that are no joke - made out of tin-foil - the list goes on and on...<br /><br />three guys get stranded on an island where a bunch of weirdos run around with plastic and tin-foil swords. two of the captives are freed along with a rebel of the island freaks, and are given a day's head start before they are hunted down by the rest of the "tribe"...that's pretty much it...<br /><br />honestly - this is one of the worst films i've ever had the misfortune to subject myself too. the budget had to be about $200 and was spent entirely on the gore fx (which actually may not have been a bad idea...). there is nothing to zombie doom other than strung-together ridiculous looking gore scenes with lots of horribly dubbed dialog. this film makes other no-budget outings like premutos: lord of the living dead look like titanic. some may rank zd in the "so-bad-it's-good" category - and i guess if you're really drunk or high and watching it with a few friends mst3k-style - i guess it could be looked at that way. but not by me. i hated pretty much everything about it. if zombie doom or zombie 90 (which is equally appalling and is included as a "bonus" on the shock-o-rama release of zd) is indicative of andreas schnaas' other works - then he should be banned from ever having anything to do with making a film ever again under penalty of death. there is one amusing kung-fu battle in the latter half of the film, and a lot of blood - so i'll grant this one a very generous 3/10 - do yourself a favor and skip this.
