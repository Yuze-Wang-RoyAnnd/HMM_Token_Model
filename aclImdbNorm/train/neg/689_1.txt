what the ........... is this ? this must, without a doubt, be the biggest waste of film, settings and camera ever. i know you can't set your expectations for an 80's slasher high, but this is too stupid to be true. i baught this film for 0.89$ and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back. can you imagine who hard it stinks ?<br /><br />who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations??? well actually, you couldn't possible care less. and why should you? the makers of this piece of garbage sure didn't care. they didn't try to create a tiny bit of tension. the director ( stephen carpenter -- i guess it's much easier to find money with a name like that ) also made the kindred (1986) wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors. complete crap as well, but at least that one had eliza dushku. this junk has the debut of daphne zuniga !!! ( who ?? ) yeah that's right, the melrose place chick. her very memorable character dies about 15 min. after the opening credits. she's the second person to die. the first victim dies directly in the first minute, but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares ? the rest of the actors...they don't deserve the term actors actually, are completely uninteresting. you're hoping they die a quick and painful death...and not only their characters<br /><br />my humble opinion = 0 / 10
