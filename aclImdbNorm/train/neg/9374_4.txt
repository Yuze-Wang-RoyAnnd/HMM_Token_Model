this documentary is at its best when it is simply showing the ayurvedic healers' offices and treatment preparation. there is no denying the grinding poverty in india and desperation of even their wealthier clients. however, as an argument for ayurvedic medicine in general, this film fails miserably. although indian clients mention having seen "aleopathic" doctors, those doctors are not interviewed, and we have to take the vague statements of their patients at face value-- "the doctor said there was no cure," "the doctor said it was cancer" etc. well, "no cure" doesn't mean "no treatment," and what type of cancer exactly does the patient have? the film is at its most feeble when showing ayurvedic practice in america. there it is reduced, apparently, to the stunning suggestion that having a high powered wall street job can make your stomach hurt.
