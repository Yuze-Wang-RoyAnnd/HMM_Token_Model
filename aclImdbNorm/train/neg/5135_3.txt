i think scarecrows are creepy, so it's a pity this movie doesn't make more of them. <br /><br />a bunch of robbers do an emergency parachute from a plane into a enormous field with scarecrows. one of them goes missing with the loot and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by inexplicably evil scarecrows. the acting is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive (when they move). on the positive side, the director does get some suspense out of the static scarecrows. it is as alfred hitchcock says, "a bomb under a table goes off, and that's surprise. we know the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off, and that's suspense."
