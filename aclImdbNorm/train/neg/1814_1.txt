all these reviewers are spot on. i've seen many bad films over the years, believe me, and this beats the lot!<br /><br />this is not just a "so bad it's good" exploiter waste of time, but a genuine, hilarious, movie atrocity.<br /><br />check out the white furry monster type thing!<br /><br />wet yourself laughing at thom christopher's "spell-weaving" acting!<br /><br />gape in sheer a**e-clenching disbelief! at the threadbare sets!<br /><br />this is one of those "european co-productions". no wonder we have so many wars. i swear, some of the people taking part in 'wizards of the lost kingdom' aren't actually aware they are appearing in a film!<br /><br />fact! i originally watched this movie on htv wales late one night while suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation. i had to track down a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really this awful. it is. worse even than lee majors in the norseman, more laughable than all of john derek's films, this is, truly, the citizen kane of trash.
