i saw brigadoon on tv last night (12 sept 2009). i am 61 years old and have been watching films as long as i can remember. i can truthfully say that brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film i have ever seen. the accents were shameful. the local children's club would have produced better sets. the characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them. it is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film. the owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film.
