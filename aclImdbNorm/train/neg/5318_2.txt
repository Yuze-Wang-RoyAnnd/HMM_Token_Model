well, i had to be generous and give this a 2. this was mainly due to the gratuitous holes cut in that lady's shirt where her breasts are. i found that mildly amusing. other than that, this movie does nothing more than provide a few good laughs with a friend. funny if you're willing to throw "mystery science theatre" comments at it with someone, but it ain't no better than a 2. and a 2 pretty much sucks.
