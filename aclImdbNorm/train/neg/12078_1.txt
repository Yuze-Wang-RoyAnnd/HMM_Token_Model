i literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie. granted, it's shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not. but this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not, that may prevent many from just not caring about a shakespeare based story.<br /><br />the largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters. often during character's interacting, it's nearly difficult to distinguish who's lines are who's. granted, i believe this movie is dubbed in english. certainly they could've obtained voice actors which could've added a bit more drama to these classic, literary lines.<br /><br />it would be difficult to rate this movie greater than 1, although perhaps that's based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget. still, it's absolutely painful and boring. if you insist on hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1/10
