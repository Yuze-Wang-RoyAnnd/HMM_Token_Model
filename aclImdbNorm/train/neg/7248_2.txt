when his in-laws are viciously murdered by a gang of thugs, a young deputy is ordered to escort his mute friend, forced to take the rap by the gang, to tucson for trial and ending up having to face the real killers along the way.<br /><br />the decoy is a real-life decoy sent to video stores to lure you away from better films! it's talky, illogical, slow, and ultimately very boring.<br /><br />there's some good costumes, sets, and photography but nothing else is good about this vanity project from writer/director/producer/star justin kreinbrink, who apparently had too much money on his hands.<br /><br />they used to make westerns like this, that were under an hour long. trim this of about half it's length and you might have something watchable.
