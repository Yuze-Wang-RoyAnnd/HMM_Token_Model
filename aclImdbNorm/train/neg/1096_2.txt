while some scenes of training were realistic, too many of them depicted military instructors as ex-nazi types. obviously, the people who wrote the screen play were either anti-military types or writing a film for that audience.<br /><br />i am a viet nam vet and, even during this period, military instructors who behaved in the manner some of these did would probably still be serving time in military prison.<br /><br />and i really loved the scene where the "hero" and his buddy (both privates) are sitting down in the captain's office, smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the captain as if he were their buddy. this sort of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation, as was the purpose for the scene.<br /><br />at the end i asked myself, "what was this film about?" as it seemed to wander around all over the place with no focus except "i hate all authority." thank god i got it from the library and did not pay to rent it.
