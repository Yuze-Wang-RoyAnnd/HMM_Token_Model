the british claymation series putting "witty" conversations taped from "average" people in the mouths of "cute" fanciful creatures at least had the advantage for non-british viewers of seeming droll and the kind of rarefied cultured humor you couldn't get on u.s. television. someone made the mistake of putting it on u.s. television.<br /><br />sort of like the sadly miscast american version of the sublime brit-com coupling which died in a month on nbc when the same basic scripts didn't "translate" from british english to american english, what seemed droll and cultured (and just a bit dull) in england, comes across in creature comforts, the american version, as simply boredom with puppets. there's no through plot-line, no characters and after one and a half episodes watched (of the three ultimately aired), no reason to suffer through more.<br /><br />the only positive thing to be said about the new summer series and the mercifully brief run it had is that the claymation is at least professionally done and coming as a set-up for the single worst show on the cbs schedule, the new adventures of old christine (or "how to be a horrible mother - or person - in one interminable, unfunny lesson"), kids who wanted to stay up past their bedtime happily ran to bed rather than sit through this show, and the adults could wait to tune in until 9pm when "two and a half men" (guilty pleasure) and "how i met your mother" (actual quality writing) come on.
