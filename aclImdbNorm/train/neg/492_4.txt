if you're after the real story of early baroque painter artemisia gentileschi, you'll be disappointed- however if you're after a reasonably crafted bodice ripper with an art theme, you've found you're movie.<br /><br />this film is such a foundationally inaccurate depiction of artemisia gentileschi's life that it almost made me weep. (type in artemisia inaccuracies in google and check out some of the fact vs. fiction articles.) from a purely technical point of view though, the film was alright: the sets, costumes, and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive early 17th century experience; although the above mentioned glaring factual inaccuracies let it down a bit.<br /><br />i wonder how the director/co-writer agn`es merlet defended her film at the time? perhaps she refused to portray artemisia as a victim, which would've been unfortunate, because lets face it, she was.
