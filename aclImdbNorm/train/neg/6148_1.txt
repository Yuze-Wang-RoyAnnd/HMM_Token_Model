first off, the movie was not true to facts at all. i just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie wasn't anything like it. first of all nash was a genius at mathematics and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on. also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong - the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it. in my opinion russell crowe didn't fit to this part at all since he doesn't look the intelligent/individualist type, therefore he really couldn't play one. it would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics (similar to pi) and not the over-dramatized lovelife. at this level abm was too hollywood-ish and too superficial to be great. personally i think he wasn't mad nor paranoid and he was onto something since people of that caliber tend to know more than we "lesser mortals". 5/10
