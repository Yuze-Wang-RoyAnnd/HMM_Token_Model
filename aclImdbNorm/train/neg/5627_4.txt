as i watch this film, it is interesting to see how much it marginalizes black men. the film spends its time showing how powerless the most visible black man in it is (save for an heroic moment). for much of the film, the other black men (and dark-skinned black women) in the film are way in the background, barely visible.<br /><br />vanessa williams' character was strong and sympathetic. the viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. there are also some fairly visible and three-dimensional support characters who are light-skinned, and some white characters of some warmth and dignity. but 99% of the black males in this film are nothing but invisible men. voiceless shadows in the background, of no consequence. such a horrible flaw, but anything but unusual in the mainstream media.
