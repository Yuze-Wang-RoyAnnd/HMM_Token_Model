oh my goodness. this was a real big mess that just couldn't help itself. jeffrey (jon heder) is a 29 year old man still living with his mum (diane keaton) and not planning on going anywhere. until his mother meets a rich businessman named mert (jeff daniels) who she may be getting married to.<br /><br />it would have been an ok movie if heder didn't play his jeffrey so annoying, from the very start there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse. in the end, we are supposed to like him, but there was no reason to as he hadn't changed from the selfish brute that he was at the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />keaton doesn't look to even be trying and is in horrible form after 2007's because i said so. not to mention the shocking chemistry between heder and keaton, and where supposed to believe that their mother and son? the only saving grace is jeff daniels and anna faris although they don't look very interested either. apart from a few little smiles, this film really doesn't deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is barely anything to laugh at! if your in the mood for a recent diane keaton flick watch mad money or smother which are a lot better than this abysmal effort.
