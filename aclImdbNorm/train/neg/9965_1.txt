warning! small plot details revealed!<br /><br />i can find virtually nothing positive to say about this film. it is written so badly that every character is a caricature, yet it seems to take itself seriously. it is poorly cast, especially ralph macchio (all baby-faced, 5-foot-nothing of him) as a streetwise tough. plot elements are all drawn in black and white, with every situation almost immediately escalating to some extreme climax.<br /><br />most egregious of all (plot element about to be revealed) it has perhaps the most gratuitous and contrived nude scene in the history of semi-serious film. one can just imagine the filmmakers saying, "we need jobeth to shed her top...hmmm...i've got it!...early in the film, let's give nick some ridiculous dialogue about baring yourself in the hallways...then jobeth can use that line on him later and really bare herself in the hallway...yeah, that's the ticket!"<br /><br />i will give the producers credit for tackling a weighty subject in 1984, one that proved all too weighty in the late 90's with events like columbine. however, the execution is dreadful. this film could have been a dark comedy in the vein of "heathers", a campy political statement like "network" or a serious examination like "brubaker". instead, it tries to be all of these things -- and ends up being none of these things. "teachers" get an f.
