i was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie, but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what i recalled from the excellent "short history of nearly everything" and what i was able to choke down in "a brief history of time," it sounded interesting at times. however, the obvious nonsense of the story of the indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was ridiculous. i really started questioning what was being shoveler at that point, but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually "channelling" some loony named "ramtha" completely upset the applecart for me.<br /><br />what a waste of two hours.
