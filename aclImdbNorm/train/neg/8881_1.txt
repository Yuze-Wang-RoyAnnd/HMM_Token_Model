the character acting is a little stiff, as if it is the first time man of the actors have appeared on screen. unfortunately one of the better actresses, jean simmons (played many bit roles on tv, like in star trek tng and in the heat of the night), dies quickly and thereafter her acting can be markedly missed.<br /><br />the lead role is mr ballard, as portrayed by cliff robertson. cliff is forced to carry this movie with his body language for most of the time. he doesn't do a poor job, but it is a little overmuch to ask of an actor to plug the oceans of blank screen time during which the characters spend their time not talking and also not acting. robertson's most memorable role may have been ben parker in the last 3 spider man movies (starring tobey maguire).<br /><br />the plot is predictable. a husband murders his rich wife for her money. thereafter the wife seems to comeback and haunt the husband driving him insane until he leaps from a high window (fearing the specter of his dead wife approaching him) on the day he is predicted to die no less.<br /><br />the second chauffeur mr ballard hires looks a lot like an english mark hamill. uncanny really! the only thing that stands out is the utter disregard for dialogue. many minutes pass in quietness, no one speaks, and few act. it is a shame the mst3k guys never got hold of this movie. it could have been much better, if not just as predictable, with more dialogue, or shorter scenes of 'nothingness'.<br /><br />i kept expecting g'mork's red eyes to appear from the shadows and proclaim that he works for the "nothing" that inhabits this film.
