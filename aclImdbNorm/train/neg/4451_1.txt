this movie was probably about as silly as the naked gun (which was supposed to be). case in point:<br /><br />1. in order to fake her drowning roberts is secretly taking swimming lessons at the ywca. after her "death" the ywca calls her husband at work to give their condolences. hello how did they get his work number?<br /><br />2. before she leaves town she drops her wedding ring in the toilet. days or even weeks later her hubby finds it in the john. does this mean the toilet was never flushed?<br /><br />3. no explanation is given on how she is paying for her mothers care in the retirement home (since she did it behind her rich husbands back).<br /><br />4. towards the end of this tiresome film roberts suspects her husband is in the house. instead of running for her life she runs to the kitchen instead to see if the cans are stacked neatly.
