ahh, the dull t.v. shows and pilots that were slammed together in the 70's to make equally dull t.v. movies! some examples would be riding with death(the most hysterically cheesy of the lot), stranded in space(confusing and uninteresting), san francisco international(horribly dull and unbelievably confusing), and this turgid bit of quinn martin glamor. <br /><br />shot in hawaii(although you wouldn't know it from the outside shots), it's apparently a failed pilot for a lame spy show. the real problem is that you don;'t like most of the characters, including the drab main character diamond head, who seemed half asleep for the entire movie; his boss 'aunt mary', who had a really weird delivery of his lines and shellacked white hair as well as the a tan that looked like it had been stuccoed on; diamnd head's girlfriend/fellow agent(hell, i can't even remember her name) a skinny, wooden woman with a flat way of speaking that is just not sexy or interesting; and the singing sidekick zulu(again, i can't remember his character's name)who wasn't bad in small doses. the most interesting person in the whole production was ian mcshane, who sucked as a bad guy but still proved his acting chops. alothugh the make-up jobs this so-called 'chameleon' used to disguise himself were just laughable. i have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that caused him to dress as a south american dictator cum american general. nor do i care. the plot simply wasn't interesting enough to hold your attention for even ten minutes at a time, let alone the hour and a half or so it goes on. just call this one - hawaii five no!
