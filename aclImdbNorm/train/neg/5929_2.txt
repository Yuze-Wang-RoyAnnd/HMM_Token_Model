the people who are praising this film are the real disappointments -- i am hoping at least that leonard will see some good $$ out of this, as his life savings were embezzled away by a manager a couple of years ago and he's over 70 now. but this film is simply terrible. at the beginning leonard himself says he is not sentimental about his past, and then for the next hour and a half the film emphasizes all the worst sentimental elements of leonard's songs. it is so bloody precious with its endless close-ups of over emoting singers. cohen's interview is all done in lo-fi video closeups and i so wanted to see a medium or a long shot of his whole body! i couldn't care less about the comments of the performers, especially those overblown ego boys edge and bono. none of the performers in this film have done even one song as good as leonard's own music and if you are thinking about seeing this and you have any doubts at all, heed them. this would be an acceptable pbs special, maybe, for a one time showing. but i will even hesitate at getting a dvd of this. when the film finally shows leonard semi-performing "tower of song" it's ruined by bono taking a verse. even the occasional good performances (antony, rufus' first number, martha's the traitor) are spoiled by the context of the rest of this turgid blabla. forget this one, and go buy leonard's most recent album if you want to pay tribute to him.
