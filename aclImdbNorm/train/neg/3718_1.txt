chris rock deserves better than he gives himself in "down to earth." as directed by brothers chris & paul weitz of "american pie" fame, this uninspired remake of warren beatty's 1978 fantasy "heaven can wait," itself a rehash of 1941's "here comes mr. jordan," lacks the abrasively profane humor that won chris rock an emmy for his first hbo special. predictably, he spouts swear words from a to z, but he consciously avoids the f-word. anybody who saw this gifted african-american comic in "lethal weapon 4," "dogma," or "nurse betty" knows he can elicit more laughter with the f-word than martin lawrence and eddie murphy put together. sadly, despite a few witty one-liners, "down to earth" hits rock bottom both as a contrived comedy and an improbable interracial romance.<br /><br />"down to earth" utterly destroys any good will that the weitz brothers generated with their landmark gross-out face "american pie." this disposable drivel qualifies as a contrived as well as confusing comedy with a thoroughly improbable color-blind interracial romance. unfortunately, a more than competent cast
