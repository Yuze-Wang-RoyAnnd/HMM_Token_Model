yes, this movie is a real thief. it stole some shiny oscars from avatar just because politicians wanted another war-hero movie to boost the acceptance (support?) for the wars u.s. is still fighting today. i do not really want to go here into politics, but come on, this is more clear than the summer sky. hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding, no real plot at all. i really feel myself in the 50's of hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like. the same propaganda movies were produced that time, only with the exception that those were black and white. even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the "u.s. wars are cool" genre, you surely have much better movies to choose from.
