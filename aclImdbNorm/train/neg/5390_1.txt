do not be mistaken, this is neither a horror, nor really a film. i firmly advise against watching this 82 minute failure; the only reason it merited a star was the presence of chris pine.<br /><br />nothing happens. you wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flicker of a twist, a hint of surprise, a plot to emerge - but no.<br /><br />the characters take erratic turns of pace in their actions and yet don't have the time to develop - thanks to the thrifty editors and frankly ashamed writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful (bring on the teen rock montage) state. the only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the perishable token ethnic 'companion'.<br /><br />their encounters with obstacles (be they human or physical) are brief, confusing and entirely pointless.<br /><br />chris pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast. lou taylor pucci couldn't be dryer if he spent the summer with keanu reaves combing the navada desert.<br /><br />watch 'the road', watch '28 days later', watch day time tv...anything but this; i implore you. suffer the boredom, unlike you may be led to believe in the film, this film is no cure.
