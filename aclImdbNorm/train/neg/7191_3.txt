saw it yesterday night at the midnight slam of the festival des films du monde in montreal. what a disappointment. this movie is clearly over rated by imdb fans. the acting was only but regular. the directing didn't bring anything new or interesting. the plot lacks considerably : the movie is all about those college grads and the game they play making prank calls(7eventy 5ive). and on top of that, you can predict the movie's end in the first five minutes. if you like prank calls and a slasher with an axe that makes you jump only once or twice during the whole movie, you might like it. if you don't, this movie is not worth it.
