how did this ever come into existence? i generally love sci f/bigfoot whatever films etc. . . but i still expect them to be written without quite so much cheese as this. the effects were sad, the lines were sadder. avoid at all costs. i only ended up renting it because it was in the wrong case (i was looking for the sasquatch film with lance henrikson in it -- still haven't seen that one). the idea of the film is actually a good one. there was a lot of potential to make a great little movie here. i just don't understand how something like this ends up like this. go speak to the film/arts/english interested students in any high school and you'll find people who can write a better script.
