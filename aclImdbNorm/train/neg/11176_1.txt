saw this movie in an early preview, and i cannot stress enough how bad i thought this film was. from the very beginning, the audience was groaning over pacino's awful southern accent. poor al looked really, really haggard, and i can't decide whether this was purposely part of his role as a drug addicted publicist, or perhaps he just didn't get any sleep before coming to the set. much worse than pacino's close ups, however, is the wretched excuse for a plot. early in the film we are given indications that pacino's character is gay, and i suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended. later, however, we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both tea leoni and kim basinger (both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles) lust after this elderly, half dead looking, effeminate man with the ridiculous accent. the worst part overall was the main plot thread, which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never, ever care about in the slightest. because this was a preview i will reserve my final judgment, because of the possibility of re-shoots and editing, but you can bet i will not pay a cent to see this in theaters.
