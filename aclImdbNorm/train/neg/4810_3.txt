for starters and for the record, the term "necromancy" describes the black magic art of bringing the dead back to life and it does not, in any way, relate to having sex with cadavers. that is called necrophilia and, yes, i know it's an obvious difference but i'm already getting a lot of remarks from acquaintances and relatives that i sport a perverted taste in movies! this movie is quite the opposite of perverted or sleazy, in fact, and merely just qualifies as boring, inept and terribly bad. "necromancy" makes at least one top five ranking, namely in the list of most incoherent movies ever made! now, director bert i. gordon is not exactly famous for delivering masterpieces (on his repertoire there are titles like "earth vs. the spider", "king dinosaur" and "food of the gods") but he really surpassed himself here with a totally senseless, redundant and utterly nonsensical tale about witchcraft and secretive little towns. shortly after the tragic experience of seeing their baby being born dead, lori and her husband frank move to the quiet little town of lillith, where frank suddenly got offered a prominent job in a toy factory. lori is suspicious and senses an atmosphere of morbidity, especially with the town's patriarch and "owner" mr. cato behaving very obtrusive and mysterious. that's another thing. how can anybody "own" a town and everybody in it? either way, lori gradually discovers that everybody in lillith is a witch and mr. cato exclusively lured her to the town because of her supernatural ability to resurrect the dead. since many years already, cato has been trying to bring his deceased son back to life and he's prepared to make any human sacrifice it takes. i honestly don't see the point of the whole movie. it's a blatant rip-off of "rosemary's baby"
