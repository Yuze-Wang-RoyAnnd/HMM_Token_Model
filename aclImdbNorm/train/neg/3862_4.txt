i just watched it. a couple of laughs, but nothing to write home about. jason lee looked like he was having fun. the (long) dvd gag reel consists almost solely of him having fits of uncontrollable laughter. selma blair seemed to be punching a time clock, but then again, her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud, so "well done" i guess? jim brolin was surprisingly funny. (being married to babs can't be a picnic.) the soundtrack was hip, and eclectic. larry miller, who played julia stiles father (hilariously), in 10 things i hate about you is funny here as well. he's great, but the best aspect of this movie was the casting of julia stiles. i could spend two hours watching her fold laundry, and i feel like i just did.
