absolutely the worst film yet by burton, who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs. a miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film. this is the kind of movie where every time something happens, you'll be sure to hear someone shout out "he's lost his gun!" or whatever it is to let everybody know. carter is really awful and so is wahlberg, who can't play this straight and be convincing. very nice effects and photography, but poor music in the john williams mold by burton's crony elfman. heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch-phrases from the first movie. very poor results.<br /><br />if anyone else out there also saw "sleepy hollow", they will probably have noticed, as i have, the declining quality of burton's films. i've heard that this particular project was produced by others and that burton was brought in as director, in which case his judgement should be questioned. but i think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip; the evidence is there in the films. in "sleepy hollow", he couldn't decide what kind of movie he was making, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of british character actors (chris lee, etc.) made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film (those are never scary, as horror fans know). the movie couldn't succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic, and no style had been developed to smooth the two together. "planet of the apes" is much the same way, and the result comes off more like "total recall" or "tango and cash" than like sci-fi. he's also fallen into the rut of so many other "big" directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience. word to burton, if you're out there -- pick something and do it straight, or use some style to peice it all together (as in "mars attacks" or "beetlejuice") or you might as well retire, because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going.
