quite possibly. how francis veber, one of the best comedy directors in the world (at least when sticking to his native france), managed to turn in a film so completely unwatchable is beyond the reason of mere mortal man to discern. it's not just that the characters are so unlikeable or that the film is so utterly devoid of even the lowest form of wit: it's genuinely physically painful to watch, such an endless parade of inept writing, acting and film-making that you cannot believe this is the work of experienced - and talented - filmmakers. for once the near-eternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before its blink-and-you'll-miss-it theatrical release tells the whole story. what were they thinking?
