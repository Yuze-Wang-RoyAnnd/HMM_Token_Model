slackers is just another teen movie that's not really worth watching. dave (devon sawa), sam (jason segel) and jeff (michael c. maronna) are about to graduate from holden university with honors in lying, cheating and scheming. the three roommates have proudly scammed their way through the last four years of college and now, during final exams, these big-men-on-campus are about to be busted by the most unlikely dude in school. the plot is very stupid and there's no reason why to watch this unless your looking to shut off you brain for a little while. slackers is just a predictable teen flick that really adds nothing new to the genre. the comedy in slackers is either hit or miss but there's no real true funny or original moment in the movie. its really just a collection of gags and some are actually pretty funny. though for every joke that works there's at least eight more that don't. the screenplay is full of penis and breast jokes that some high school and college students may enjoy. even if they do they probably won't remember this film after awhile as its not a very memorable comedy. jason schwartzman plays the freaky ethan and after appearing in some good comedies he has stoop pretty low. jaime king and devon sawa are the other main stars but they do a rather poor job in this film. this is directed by dewey nicks and this is his first film so you can't blame him too much. the funniest character was probably laura prepon though, she's not in the movie very much. the film is very short at only 86 minutes long however, that may be too long for some people who don't really like this type of humor. slackers isn't the worst film of 2002 but certainly is below average. when compared to other films in the genre there's a lot better out there such as not another teen movie, american pie and its sequels , scary movie 1 & 2 etc. so unless you have seen most of them and you're looking for something new then slackers might fit that bill but its better if you just watch something else. rating 4.3/10 a below average teen comedy that's worth skipping.
