"drawing restraint 9" is a kind of movie one either loves or hates; fortunately or not, i left it with a strong feeling of wasted time and of being thoroughly stuffed with "killing whales is bad" propaganda. aesthetically, the movie could have been pleasing, especially its first half, until it is not clear that every action portrayed serves as an allegory of various aspects of whale hunting. until then, it might be slightly amusing to look at daily chores of japan workers, but later it becomes obvious that anything that appears on the screen is a propaganda, and no single frame is an exception. i use the word "propaganda" because the movie uses basically the old morality play device, where "good" and "bad" are not deduced in the course of action but are set in stone. probably it's just me, but i find such type of art shallow and preconceived, even when it's all about the noble (no sarcasm here) quest of protecting the environment.<br /><br />in my opinion it is a cardinal sin when a movie material is stretched out without any justification, for the sake of stretching only. in my opinion, "drawing restraint 9" could've been easily fit into 75 minutes, but has a torturous length of 2 and 1/4 hours. yes, there were interesting shots, but there were not enough of these to leave 15-minute gaps of nothingness without notice. the movie has no standard scenario, and there's no evolution of characters, but neither it is a documentary, it's rather a kind of conceptual installation. that's an unusual form for a movie, but it still can be viewed as art even when the concept is as simple and naive as here. otoh i also believe that the director should've had some honesty and did not pretend that it could be only delivered in no less than 135 minutes.<br /><br />and yes, the music score mostly resembled whale sounds. how surprising.<br /><br />2/10.
