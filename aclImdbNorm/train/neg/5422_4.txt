what "noise" fails to do is get us to understand its character. tim robbins plays an obsessive new yorker who can't deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer, particularly car alarms. it's an odd idea for a film, which has about as much creative credibility as "death wish." it is clever at points; particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through hagel, "i'm too stupid to be understanding this." he reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion, we read it and don't get it either.just then a car alarm goes off. throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises. though, all in all it does little to help us understand our hero, who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeper-into his persona. <br /><br />the film-making itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems, shoddy editing, and visible boom mikes. no, "noise" isn't all-bad. william hurt is at least colorful. at least the ending doesn't fall flat. overall it drives home a logistical point, one you haven't probably thought of. at least i hadn't. though all in all, ninety minutes long, it couldn't have ended sooner. the story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started.<br /><br />this is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival, but probably won't get picked up for distribution. check it out on dvd if you're really partial to someone involved in the project. otherwise skip it.
