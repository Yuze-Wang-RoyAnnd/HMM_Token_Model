this movie is bad. if you are thinking about watching it, there is only one decent scene in the movie, and it lasts about 5 seconds (amanda carraway's topless scene). the rest of the movie is horrible. i think high school plays probably have better acting. the plot makes no sense at all. the set was pretty lame, and it wasn't even good to make fun of. it was just dull and very very bad! i watched this on starz so i thought it had to be at least decent. the mini description sounded like it'd be alright. the girlfriend kills herself for apparently no reason at the beginning of the movie, after you have to watch some horrible music video. the transitions between scenes are very abrupt and its like someone just put a ton of clips into a movie without even thinking about how to transition them. just cuts from one scene to another, no smoothness. kind of like my random switching from talking about how bad the movie is, to explaining why the plot sucks. the audio gets low at some points, where you can barely hear it, then gets loud with gay 'horror screams' thrown in at random points in the movie. it is the same sound every time. this is now officially the worst movie i have ever seen<br /><br />acting: 0/10 effects: 1/10 storyline: 0/10 music: 3/10<br /><br />lame-meter : 1,000,000 / 10
