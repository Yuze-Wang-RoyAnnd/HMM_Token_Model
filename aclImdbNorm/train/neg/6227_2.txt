good performances can't save this terrible script, larded with every cliche in the chick-flick book. both main characters are deeply unsympathetic, and the scene where laura linney's character reminisces about sex with her dead husband in front of her teenage son -- which i think is supposed to be poignant -- is just horrifying.
