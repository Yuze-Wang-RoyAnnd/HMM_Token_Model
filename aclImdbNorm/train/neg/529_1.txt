this is, without a doubt, the most offensive "chick flick" i have seen in years, if not ever. the writing & characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film verges on parody. before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster, we were subjected to the following themes: having a baby will solve all of your problems, "performer types" are miserable messes, & musicians can't be good mothers unless they toss their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle. what a waste of a talented cast & some great-looking sets & costumes. when natasha richardson told toni collette that unless she lives a more mainstream life, she'll end up - shudder - "alone!", i felt queasy. i can't believe this movie made it to theatrical release. it's the sort of fare one expects from those "women's" cable channels that i always pass right by when channel-surfing. i am female and over 35, so i should be part of this film's target audience, but boy, does "evening" miss its target.
