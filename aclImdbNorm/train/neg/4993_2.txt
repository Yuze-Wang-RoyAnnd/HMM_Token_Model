went to watch this movie expecting a 'nothing really much' action flick, still got very disappointed. the opening scene promised a little action with a tinge of comedy. it keeps you hooked for the first half coz till then you are expecting that now its time for the action to kick in. well, nothing of that sort happens. the movie drags and the ending just thumps you down to a point that you get annoyed.wonder what was the director thinking. made no sense watsoever. the movie lacked in all aspects, had no real storyline and it seemed very hollow, even if "rambo" was in it, i don't think he could have helped the rating at all. there is simply no logic to the movie. a perfect way to waste your time and money. by far the most irritating movie i have ever seen and i am sure there will b others who'll have the same viewpoint after enduring it. definitely not for people who have a little movie sense left in them.
