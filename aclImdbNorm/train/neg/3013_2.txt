beginning with its long opening shot of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a chinese factory, manufactured landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies. its droning narrative assumes that industrial development in china and elsewhere is entirely unprecedented, as if there had never been an industrial revolution in europe and america and karl marx had never visited the british museum. that there might be a connection between the present-day asian drive for industrialization and wealth and earlier experiences of starvation and terror is never mentioned.<br /><br />at the same time, there's an effort to present edward burtynsky's photographs of industrial waste as somehow "beautiful". much of the film is a slide show of these images. they are well produced, of museum size, and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions. to me, however, they only demonstrate that almost any photograph can be made to appear beautiful if well presented. industrial waste is still industrial waste. the relationship, if any, between the photographs and the film's spoken message remains unclear.<br /><br />i don't mean to imply that there aren't real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialize. manufactured landscapes, however, offers only strange and bitter hopelessness. it's like a two-hour lecture by noam chomsky. maybe it has some value as a demonstration of what's wrong with the american (and canadian) left.
