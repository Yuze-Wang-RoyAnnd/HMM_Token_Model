jean rollin artistic nonsense about vampires, aliens and the quest for immortality.<br /><br />the women are beautiful and the photography stunning. the dialog is inane. its a laughable mess. great to look at but as any semblance of a horror film or thriller purely awful. i'm trying to figure out if we're suppose to be scared or not. at the same time is it a put on or not? its an odd mix of art film and horror that never quite meshes and while its nice to look at it never seems to "mean" anything, and its by no means scary even if the occasional shot or sequence creates a moment of frisson its well made pretentious twaddle. something to leave on in the background as a living wall paper for those who like naked women.
