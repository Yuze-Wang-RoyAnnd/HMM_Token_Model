the progression of the plot is enough to "rope one in" and create curiosity about the outcome. however, ultimately, the feeling that remains is that the producers of the movie forgot to end it. if the intention was to create a perpetual circle (occasionally done in the twilight zone), it was too sloppy to view as a positive effort.
