this is not a commentary on the actual movie, but on the ruscico dvd release for north america. i don't know if there have been different releases and updates, but the disks we rented had a 2000 copyright on them, if that means anything. anyway, the sound mixing on these dvd's was absolutely horrible. the levels often yo-yo-ed up and down; when the scene cut to a battlefield panorama, the orchestral track would thunder so loudly that i didn't know which would blow out first -- my eardrums or my speakers. when it was time for dialog, the volume would usually drop to something barely audible. occasionally, the orchestra and foley-work would stay loud while the dialog was superimposed at a much lesser level. my wife and i found that the only way we could watch this movie at all from these dvd's was if one of us kept a hand on the remote to continuously modulate the volume. and, like another user has already commented, when we selected english audio the dialog kept switching back and forth between russian and english; and occasionally when the characters spoke in french on the native track the dubbing was in russian, so you're sol if you understand neither. ultimately, we gave up watching after the first disk. before you fork out $50+ for this movie on dvd for your own library, i'd heartily recommend getting your hands on a rental copy to see whether you can really enjoy this epic flick when burdened by such bad sound, particularly if you've never read the book and really want to understand the storyline.
