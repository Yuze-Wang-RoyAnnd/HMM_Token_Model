let's just say i had to suspend my disbelief less for spiderman than i did for hooligans. that is, to say, i have less of a problem believing toby mcguire can stick to buildings than i do elija wood throwing down with toughs in manchester. i won't get into specifics, as i don't want to write a spoiler, but the idea of grown, professional, british men getting into near death scraps every weekend is, well... funny. and this film is not. the fighting, the idea of fighting, is taken far too seriously. the gravity of the pugilism, the reverence with which the subject matter is treated becomes irritating, as it neither establishes or resolves the conflict. it seems as though the plot, with holes big enough to drive a guiness truck through, has been slapped together with a contrived "fish out of water" theme so that viewers can gaze into woods teary eyes as he learns how to become a man ie. hitting other young men of opposing football tastes with blunt objects and then running away as fast as he can. the characters are cartoonish, especially the americans at harvard. the character development and story line are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the picture. unfortunately, the absurdity of the film doesn't reach its height until nearly the end, which by then you'll have spent nearly two hours of your life you are never getting back. pick up "the football factory" or "fight club" instead of this corny, and disappointing dud. it doesn't waste time with empty melodrama, the tired old "yankee in king aurthur's court," or weepy, parables of coming of age bullsh*t. they're just pure, dark, and clever fun; the way violence is supposed to be.
