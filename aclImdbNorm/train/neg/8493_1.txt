many days after seeing conceiving ada, i am still in awe that any group of people would spend so much time to make such an atrocious film.<br /><br />no one ought see this film in hopes of learning anything of consequence about ada lovelock, her colleagues or the product of her endeavors.<br /><br />likewise, no one ought to see this film in hopes of being entertained.<br /><br />as a sci-fi film, this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure. somehow, the main character manages to bring the past to life and interact with it on her personal computer--with the advice and encouraging words of timothy leary. i doubt anyone could suspend their disbelief enough to keep this from seeming absolutely absurd.<br /><br />as a drama film, this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure. somehow, the writer/director manages to fill eighty-five minutes with constant, unnecessary, annoying and trivial drama over essentially nothing. i doubt that anyone could feel that all the drama in the film serves only as an irritating distraction.<br /><br />i find it difficult to fully express my degree of contempt for conceiving ada. the circumstances under which i saw it forbid me from leaving the theater but there is no question that i would have otherwise. i am still angry that i wasted the time that it took to see it. only that i might more effectively criticize this movie, i wish that i were more articulate.
