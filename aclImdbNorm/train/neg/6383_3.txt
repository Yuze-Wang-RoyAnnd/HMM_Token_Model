gayniggers from outer space is a short foreign film about black, gay aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble upon earth. being gay, their goal is to have a male-only universe in which all people are gay. hence, when they discover women or "female creatures" live on earth, they are at first terrified; eventually they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and liberate the male population.<br /><br />an offensive title with a racist, homophobic and sexist storyline, albeit probably intended as a satire, give this film some shock value. however, there's little substance underneath. as another reviewer pointed out, there are few jokes besides the characters' names (eg. arminass); i think i laughed once at one small gay joke. i think i got the point of the film quickly, a satire of bad science fiction, but after that i had had enough; i kept wanting the film to end already (and it is a short film!). not brilliant or particularly well-written.
