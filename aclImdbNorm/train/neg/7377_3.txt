even though the plot was very well detailed,and the story line was understandable the fact that steven seagals voice was dubbed with some one else's through out most of the movie was distressing as you were unsure who was talking . there were many parts where he would start to talk in his deep raspy voice and then the next some one else's voice was doing the talking for him. i don't know the reason however if he had difficulty with his voice during production of the movie i think they could have re shot the events that did not contain his own voice when he had recovered. i have rated this movie 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the film. when one pays for a movie whether or not its at the theater or on dvd this movie was not worth the admission price that was charged. i have been a long time follower of steven seagal and all his movies that he has done over the past years.to date i think this is one of the worst ones we have seen yet
