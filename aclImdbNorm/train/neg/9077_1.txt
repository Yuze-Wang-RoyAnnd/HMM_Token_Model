if you enjoy films like american pie, road trip & van wilder; avoid this cinematic refuse at all costs. it is an unamusing, mean-spirited, insipid waste of resources that should never have been discussed aloud; much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers. easily the worst film i have seen in the past 18 months; mind-numbingly bad for the entire 86 minutes of it's runtime. had it been much longer, i would not have been able to write this review without using profanity. consider yourself warned!
