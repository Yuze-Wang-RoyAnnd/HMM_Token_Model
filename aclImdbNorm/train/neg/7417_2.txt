this film is so bad - dialogues, story, actors and actresses - everything! - that it's hard to imagine that we'll see a worse movie this year or in the following years. "love's brother" (set in australia among italian immigrants) has nothing but shallow clich'es about italian culture to offer, and it is quite telling that even the italians from and in italy speak english in the film. the message of the film - ugly people have to marry ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - is truly discomforting. giovanni ribisi is quite good in films like 'suburbia' or 'lost in translation', but here his pseudo-italian accent is hard to bear. see this film at your own risk. trash as trash can!
