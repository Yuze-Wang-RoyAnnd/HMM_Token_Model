as a single woman over 40, i found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over 40, not to mention every other woman, of any age. it was a sad, pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a "chick flick", and it failed miserably. andy mcdowell isn't much of an actress to begin with, but given the non-existent "plot" (i hate to even refer to it as a plot) in this, she didn't have a chance. there was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy/empathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable. and then there's the obligatory male-fantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try -- please.<br /><br />not only do i wish i could get my money back for the dvd rental, i also want those 112 minutes of my life back. what a ripoff.
