sorry fulci fans, but i could not get through this one. the soundtrack was about as annoying as they come, the acting was puerile, the story has been done and done, and the direction was non-existent. <br /><br />massacre honestly looked like a children's film project. but i've seen some of those, and they actually look better than this did! it appears to have been so underfunded they couldn't afford ... anything! not a dop, not a director, no one who even remotely had a clue what acting was. it was a very poor cinematic experience; one of my worst.<br /><br />this was about the worst suck-fest i've seen, next to terror toons which is second only to killer klowns from outer space. i've nothing else to say about it.<br /><br />it rates a 0.1/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
