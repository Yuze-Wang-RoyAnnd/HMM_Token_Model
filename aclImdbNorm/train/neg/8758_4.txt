not a movie, but a lip synched collection of performances from acts that were part of the british invasion, that followed the dynamic entrance of the beatles to the music world. some of these acts did not make a big splash on this side of the pond, but a lot of them did. featured are: herman's hermits, billy j. kramer and the dakotas, peter and gordon, honeycombs, nashville teens, animals, and of course,the beatles.<br /><br />it is so much fun watching these young acts before they honed and polished their acts.
