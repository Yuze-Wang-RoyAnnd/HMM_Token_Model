this 1970 hit film has not aged well, but frankly, it was not that good when it was released. yet, it was a hugely popular success perhaps because the idea of fatalistic young love must have appealed to audiences saturated by constant tv coverage of the vietnam war. the plot is pure drivel as it concerns oliver barrett iv, a privileged harvard hockey player, who meets and falls in love with jenny cavelleri, an antagonistic vassar music student proud of her working class background. his old-school father naturally disapproves of jenny, and in a typical act of rebellion, that means the young couple gets married in one of those hippie-era, extemporaneous ceremonies. he lands his dream job in new york, but she gets unexpectedly ill and dies of her terminal disease. there is a veneer of then-contemporary film-making techniques displayed by director arthur hiller, but none of that can hide the old-fashioned, clich'e-ridden story at its core. the inevitable ending left me particularly unmoved.<br /><br />both ryan o'neal and ali macgraw became stars with this movie as oliver and jenny but inexplicably so since neither seems able to convey the depth or complexity required to make their characters compelling. at least the boyish o'neal is sincere in his weakly defiant approach, but macgraw is so wooden and smirky in behavior that it's hard to see what oliver sees in jenny beyond her sarcastic facade. john marley (two years before finding the decapitated racehorse in his bed in "the godfather") does better as jenny's plainspoken baker father phil, as does ray milland as the seemingly insensitive barrett paterfamilias. the overly familiar frances lai music has almost become parody in itself over the years. the print quality on the dvd is good, though the only extra is a rather effusive commentary track by hiller. the most interesting bit of trivia is that author erich segal (upon whose book this movie is based) conceived oliver as a mix between two harvard roommates he knew
