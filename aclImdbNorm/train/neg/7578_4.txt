suggesting nothing less than a movie-length version of the 1970s tv hit "love, american style," decked out with flashes of nudity, "superchick" (1973) is a lighthearted piece of fluff that somehow still manages to entertain. and the lead character here, tara b. true, really is some kind of superchick. a stewardess (not flight attendant) who's so good-looking that even her plane's autopilot has made a pass at her (!), and with a hunky boyfriend in every port, this wingin', swingin' gal really does put the "lay" in "layover." what with her germaphobe surgeon beau in new york, her playboy with gangster problems in miami, and her creatively challenged rock star dude in l.a., tara sure does keep busy. and when she's not draining these guys of all their manly energies, as the viewer learns, she's liable to be taking a karate class, mile-high clubbing, fending off flashers and rapists, attending groovy pot parties and stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane. as i said, lighthearted fun, and surely good for a night when you're feeling somewhat brain-dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube. future astrologist joyce jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as tara, and the film looks handsome enough to please. disappointingly, buxom '70s faves uschi digard and mary gavin (aka candy samples) are wasted here in very small roles, but still get to do what they do best--show off their chesticles! though the picture is never laff-out-loud funny and doesn't really have many thoughts in its metaphorical head, it does succeed in being consistently amusing, and i suppose that is something. strange that the end credits should call attention to ms. jillson's body double, however; don't think i've ever seen that before!
