it's a while ago, that i have seen sleuth (1972) with two great actors michael caine and laurence olivier. michael caine is back, but he is now the husband and jude law the lover of his wife. the story is still the same and it's a fantastic play.<br /><br />during the movie i always had the feeling to watch a play. that's one of the reasons i dislike this remake of a classic. when i watch a movie adapted a play i still must feel to see a movie and not just a play. director kenneth brannigan did some marvelous movies in the past, but this time he missed. another reason was the look of the movie. the design was modern, stylish clean, uncomfortable and cold. i never got the feeling that somebody ever lived in that house. the photography wasn't bad, but the lightening was awful. sometimes there was blue light, dark, green light, to round it up not friendly for eyes.<br /><br />the acting was really good. michael caine's and jude law's perform at their best. i really would like to see these 2 guys playing together on stage. but i have to confess i never was a fan of jude law. the weakest part was the mid part. i remember that in the original that this part was still very mysterious and just marvelous directed. i tried to watch it twice and always in the mid part i felt asleep. the end part is better and more interesting. sleuth (2007) isn't awful, but it seems to be more a movie for critics than for the audience. sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more entertaining than sleuth (2007).
