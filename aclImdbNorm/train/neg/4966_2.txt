i understand this movie was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is grendel. deathstalker, the throne of fire, barbarian queen, conquest, the invincible barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor. the primitive costumes, dark castles and beautiful bulgarian landscape gave grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film, but the makers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor cgi effects and colorless characters. compare this film to beowulf (1999). it may not be citizen kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget sci-fi/ adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and appealing characters.
