trust me, this is one let down movie that you want to avoid and this comes from one huge denzel washington fan. the frustrating part is that it's 1/3 of a great film. the first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between creasy and the girl he's paid to protect. the trailers to this movie all mention that she is kidnapped. so, i'm giving nothing away when i say that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess after she's kidnapped. whatever the director was trying to accomplish, all he succeeds in doing is making the audience literally nauseous. rapid, frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half-hour as creasy tracks down the perpetrators. these cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is to jolt you out of the story. i'm sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story signified a change in creasy's character and signified that a different movie was to follow. well, he was right. the movie that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap. the result of which is a depressing ending that ruins even the quality first forty minutes of the movie.
