before the release of george romero's genre-defining night of the living dead, zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures. they certainly had much better table-manners in the old days. but social etiquette aside what thrills did these early zombies offer to the movie-going public? judging by this film, none whatsoever.<br /><br />the story is about an expedition to cambodia, whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication. one of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie army.<br /><br />this film is basically a love triangle with zombies. but seeing as this is a 30's movie, the said zombies are more like somnambulists than the flesh-eating variety we think of today. they seem to respond to mind-control, rather than insatiable appetites. and, quite frankly, the 'revolt' is somewhat underwhelming too. the whole thing is really very dull. aside from the lack of horror, there isn't any over-the-top melodramatic theatrics to keep us entertained. it seems unlikely that this could've provided much entertainment even 70 years ago. see it if you have to see everything with 'zombie' in the title but otherwise i would advise skipping this one.
