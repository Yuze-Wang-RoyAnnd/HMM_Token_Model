carry on matron was released in 1972 and it's becoming clear that the series has reached a natural end with the best entries like cleo , up the kyber and screaming being from the mid to late 60s <br /><br />in itself matron is by no means bad it's just that we've seen it all before with a thin plot ( a bunch of spivs trying to break into a hospital to steal a supply of contraceptive pills which they plan to sell to third world countries ) surrounded by gags of a slightly amusing though unsophisticated nature . i think that's where the problem lies - the gags aren't all that amusing with the unsophisticated nature starting to show its age . did we need another movie that uses a man dressed up as a woman in order to drive the plot ? perhaps the worst criticism i can make is that i saw carry on matron this afternoon , less that twelve hours ago and i have a problem in trying to remember a very funny line . that's a serious problem for a comedy
