admittedly, i watched this piece with already very low expectations. dieter bohlen is a rather untalented composer parvenu whose lack of talent is only surpassed by the size of his ego.<br /><br />this was the first cartoon movie that i watched that was 100 per cent humor free. it is rude, offensive, redneck and blatantly anti- women. as such, it is a creation befitting bohlen, but the average viewer will be rather put off by it. no wonder that it was never shown in a cinema theater: it would've bombed big time!<br /><br />not even the expense of 6.5 megaeuros were able to save this utter piece of crap. save your time... and money!
