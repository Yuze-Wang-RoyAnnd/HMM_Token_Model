after hearing raves about this movie for years, i finally decided to rent it and watch. let me start by saying that i'm glad that the rental was free from the local library. this move was slow, boring, unrealistic and the plot made no sense. after 2 hours, i was ready to nuke that backwater texas town and put the group of those characters out of their misery. i realize that taste is subjective, but believe me, i just do not understand all of the hype that i have heard about this movie. dallas provided as good a detail of the life in texas as this movie. rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the general public that a bad movie is good.
