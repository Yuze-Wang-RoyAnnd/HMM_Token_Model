after watching this, i had lost a little respect for christopher lee (this has passed over time). this film was utter garbage. first, they tried to recreate the ending from the first "howling," with incredibly bad make-up. then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film! the plot sucks and the whole film is just awful!!!! a brother of a werewolf victim from the first film (from the look of it, it was supposed to be dee wallace stone)teams up with lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves, lead by sybil danning, who seems to be naked all the time.<br /><br />this is not even worth renting (unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity.). try to catch it on cable instead. it would be so chopped up, it may actually make sense.
