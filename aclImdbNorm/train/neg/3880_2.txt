i can watch a good gory film now and then. i've seen some pretty sick stuff. however, this is one of the few films that i found to be grotesque in a way that was just plain repulsive and revolting. i like gore films when they are fun. i like wen they are a lot of creativity behind them. the gore in this film is not creative. it is sick. it is repugnant. it is completely unpleasant. because of this, this film is certainly not entertaining. the film is a horror film, but it lacks scares. so pretty much the only reason why one would watch this film is for the gore, but that is the most unappealing and ugly aspect of the whole film, and that's saying a lot. the acting is terrible, the plot makes no sense, and the music is really annoying and way too electronic sounding. it all took me right out of the film. pretty much the whole film is one big long depressing ordeal. there's this guy that has a freak accident in a shuttle and awakens in a hospital to find that his skin is dissolving and melting off. i guess that after that he goes out and eats human flesh in order to slow down the melting process. there's some weird subplot involving an old couple getting chased by a dog, some dismembered head floating down a stream, and an ending involving a man being electrocuted. there were times where i tried really hard to enjoy it, but the only scene in the whole film that i thought was even entertaining was the scene early on in which a nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion. if you like ugly, nasty, ad unappealing horror films, this one is for you.
