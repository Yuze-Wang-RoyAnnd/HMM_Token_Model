"paula, i may be a bitch, but i'll never be a butch!" <br /><br />a hilarious line in an otherwise rather tiresome skin flick which features a pretty honey in stacey walker, but that's about all. this gal's a real tease who lures her boyfriends, co-workers and even her lesbian roommate paula into her bedroom, but then turns into a whack job who cries "rape" and calls for the police! <br /><br />the schizophrenic personality of this certified c**t is interesting for maybe a little while, but this story ultimately turns into a real repetitive one-note affair. at least the ending is worth the wait, for those who will still care by that time.
