uta hagen's "respect for acting" is the standard textbook in many college theater courses. in the book, hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor: the presentational approach, and the representational approach. in the presentational approach, the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible, by introducing emotional elements from the actor's own life. in the representational approach, the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion, through a high degree of control of movement and sound.<br /><br />the representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this hamlet was made. british theater has a long history of this style of acting, and olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the representational school.<br /><br />time has not been kind to this school of acting, or to this movie. nearly every working actor today uses a presentational approach. to the modern eye, olivier's highly enunciated, stylized delivery is stodgy, stiff and stilted. instead of creating an internally conflicted hamlet, olivier made a declaiming, self-important bullhorn out of the melancholy dane -- an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger london theaters, but is far too starchy to carry off a modern hamlet.<br /><br />and so the movie creaks along ungainfully today. olivier's tendency to e-nun-ci-ate makes some of hamlet's lines unintentionally funny: "in-stead, you must ac-quire and be-get a tem-purr-ance that may give it... smooth-ness!" instead of crying at meeting his father's ghost (as any proper actor could), bright fill lights in olivier's pupils give us that impression.<br /><br />eileen herlie is the only other actor of note in this hamlet, putting in a good essay at the queen, despite the painfully obvious age differences (he was 41; she was 26). the other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done, given olivier's tendency to want to keep! the camera! on him! at all! times! <br /><br />sixty years later, you feel the insecurity of the shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable, flawed hamlet, and instead elected to portray a sort of elizabethan bullhorn. final analysis: "i would have such a fellow whipped for o'er-doing termagant; it out-herods herod: pray you, avoid it."
