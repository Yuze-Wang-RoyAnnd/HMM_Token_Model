i have yesterday seen the second part. and i must say, it was actually better then the first one. at the begin, i realized, it is actually a sequel, not a remake but not a good one. i do not like the old movies and series of galactica, because the cylons saw like toasters (just as it was mentioned in this new movie) and were completely harmless for the old galactica. this movie turns the sides - the humans were harmless but the whole movie was for me completely chaotic and stupid. many scenes were unnecessary, for instance the story of the "computer expert" - completely a crap. if i were a scriptwriter i would leave him die in his house, killed by the cylon woman. and the evacuation from the planet? oh, please if it would be bombed by 50 megatons (why exactly 50 mt??) nukes, they would be dead killed by the radiation. and how is it actually possible that the big fleet of cylon was completely hidden before the attack? aha, it was possibly this computer virus, created by the cylon - the script was probably written by ten-years-old school boy. the good side of the movie is, that the humans are at last defeated!! really defeated, the population is near the extinction (children are dieing - two times explicit in the movie: 1. a baby!!! maybe one month old and a girl in age of max ten - what a violence...). and the bad-asses won and i think it is the first time in such sci-fi galaxy fight movie. i also appreciate the design of the cylons (not only of the humanoid cylon:-) a good job with these ships - i like the design of the ships by both of them - human an cylons. the human ships are a good never version of the old ones. and galactica - really pretty with these docks, i liked that. but this is all, only the design is not enough. the acting was really bad, the whole plot was expectable (only two things not - the human-cylon on the ragnardocks and the human-cylon at the end).the dialogs were trivial (and in the slovak dabbing just stupid, but that is not fault of the movie). the whole movie looked like a pilot film for a series, but who would shoot such series? what it would be about? one star for the design the second one for the near extinction of humanity.
