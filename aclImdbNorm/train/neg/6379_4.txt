with a movie called "gayniggers from outer space" how could you go wrong? just throw in some over the top stereotypes for the characters, use the village people as the main suppliers for the soundtrack, and throw in tons of gay-gags. plot is unimportant. too bad, this film doesn't contain any of this and every joke misses the spot. the characters all look alike apart from the german gaynigger, one or two jokes work, the rest fails.<br /><br />the title made me laugh and i was prepared to laugh even more about the film. my expectation were to high apparently.
