a missed train. a wrong phone number. an extra cup of coffee. what happens to those around you when you make a seemingly innocuous decision? most people don't give it a thought as they absorbed in their own thoughts and actions.<br /><br />"happenstance" tells the story of the interrelations and cause-and-effect of the mundane as it pertains to a group of normal parisian folk. it has all the components of what passes for contemporary theater, with the full cast of the dysfunctional and disillusioned.<br /><br />there's a cheating husband, an illegal immigrant, a classic slacker, a pickpocket, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girlfriend, a selfish roommate, and a homeless man. audrey tautou serves as the erstwhile protagonist (in the sense that she's on camera as much as anyone else and opens and closes the film) and normal girl who just can't seem to find the right rhythm in her life.<br /><br />she learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on a train what her horoscope holds for her. what happens to her in the course of the day is told through various characters. does the prediction come true? the concept is good, but the storytelling is flimsy. the connections from one event to the next are weak. there's better storytelling in 15 seconds of the liberty mutual insurance commercial where one person sees a good deed and passes it along to another than there is in two hours of happenstance.<br /><br />if you enjoy audrey tautou, then you certainly can sacrifice the time for this film, but you'll finish it dissatisfied and wondering what this same storyline could be if it were handled by a better producer and director.
