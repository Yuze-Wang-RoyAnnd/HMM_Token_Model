a less-than-subtle poke at the beliefs and teachings of the catholic church is given a darker shade of death near the end of the show. throughout the show, dark humour plays a medium through which several commonly heard rhetoric questions are asked, especially "if god is so good, why does he allow evil to exist in the world?"<br /><br />diane keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version (though some might disagree) of they stereotyped religious teacher who spouts the "company line" and condemns half the world to burn in hell. to celebrate her school's 25th anniversary, she invites her first students to return and perform their christmas pageant.<br /><br />however, when the quartet "update" their play to parody sister mary's "fallacious" teachings, the nun is pushed over the edge, sending the story spiralling into a chain of unhappy events. the ending finally leaves the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts.<br /><br />not recommended. go watch the play instead.
