note: i will reveal a key part of the plot, but if you've looked at the dvd cover or any promotional material, you'll already know it.<br /><br />this movie seems to have been written by an eleven-year-old who isn't very bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it. the writer doesn't know the difference between a chemical and an organism.<br /><br />forget the fact the the un and the nsa seem to be running the show in hungary. forget the fact that when these master intelligence agents go chasing after someone whose mere touch will kill you in about a minute they don't wear protective gear (not even gloves). these are quibbles in the context of this movie. in the scientific world within this story, 2+2=6.34 and gravity goes sideways.<br /><br />the fact is that the people in this movie do not (with a few exceptions) behave the way human beings behave. almost every time a character responds to something it is inappropriate. the love story (of course there is one) makes soap opera scripts seem like shakespeare.<br /><br />i can't believe we wasted a free movie rental on this thing.
