i watched this movie on march 21 this year.must say disappointment.but much better than "tridev".plot is hackneyed.tells about prabhat who lives with his father,wife and his little brother.the movie opens when he saves a bride.anyway.azghar jhurhad makes a plot to kill his young brother.he makes a plan by sending few man.they come to a school pretended to be prabhats friends.kill that kid.his father throws him out of the house.then later comes back.he and aakash go to kenya to find him.sunny gives a good performance,chunky was annoying at best,naseerdun is wasted.divya did good,sonam was wasted,jyotsna was wasted but looked cute.the kid which played sunnys brother in the movie was cute.too sad he had to get his character killed.the girl was cute but was annoying.the other kid did good.alok did good.kiran was adequate.amrish and gulshan did good.the cinematography is excellent in both india and kenya.script is weak but has a few good dialogs.also drags .the movie.the music was alright.i only liked one song"saat samundar" the lyrics of that song was good.the other songs were forgettable.don't watch this. rating-3/10
