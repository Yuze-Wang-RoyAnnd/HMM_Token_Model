this film's premise is so simple and obvious that only a texas millionaire high on oil fumes and whiskey would have a problem understanding it if someone shouted it across the proverbial parking lot. in summary: the oil business is in cahoots with the government (or gummint if you prefer), the gummint is in cahoots with middle eastern despots, and the cia is a singular festering pool of double dealing sons-of-(insert word) willing to toe any line that comes their way. the only people that get done over are the good ones, like mr clooney ("bob"). oh, and terrorism is a result of the poverty which globalization creates when wicked multinationals stalk the world looking for a tasty takeover or three . that really fits to the profiles of the well-heeled 9/11 perpetrators.<br /><br />in syriana this facile tissue of political half-truths and hollywood holograms is stirred up in a repugnant vermicelli of story strands that twist, turn and whirl through the gloopy circumlocutions of their own insignificance until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion that: <br /><br />1. the "director" (good joke) should never be let near a camera again <br /><br />2. people like clooney and hurt might know how to act, but they sure don't know how to pick a script <br /><br />3. if you want to see a film that deals with corruption in big business and the state, go and see claude chabrol's "l'ivresse du pouvoir", which is insightful, funny and brilliantly acted. <br /><br />empty, doom-laden sententious piffle spun out to evening-ruining length.
