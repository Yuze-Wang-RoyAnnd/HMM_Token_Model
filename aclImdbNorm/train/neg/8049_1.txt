a warning to you not to be seduced by the names bigelow and red. _undertow_ is pointless and unengaging, and made me think often of a phrase by twain about wishing all the characters would be drowned together. when someone brings up the category of worst films ever made, it's not the likes of _plan 9_ or _attack of the killer shrews_ that i think of; it's the likes of this. what a complete waste of time--my own and everyone who was involved with this flick.
