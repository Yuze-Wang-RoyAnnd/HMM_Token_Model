this must have been an embarrassment to every member of the entirely african-american cast. every derogatory, disparaging stereotype of the black american community is featured prominently. i won't reinforce the insults by listing them here, except to mention chickens, watermelons, and dice.<br /><br />one good song by ethel waters (and a couple of bad ones), and the fantastic singing and dancing talents of 8-year-old sammy davis bring the total up to something below 1 on the imdb scale.
