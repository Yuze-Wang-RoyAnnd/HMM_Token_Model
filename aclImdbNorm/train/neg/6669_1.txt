i saw this film in my cinema class. i am glad that i did not pay to see it. i came into it with an open mind, and was even a little excited. i really enjoy ed norton and evan rachel wood, and the rest of the cast was interesting. i just never connected with this movie. the acting was great, the cinematography was interesting, but the storyline, or rather, lack thereof, was a problem. there was no central, connecting theme to the movie. was it a romance between norton and wood? well, no, not really. was it a western? kind of, but no. i'm all for twists in movies, i recently saw "brick" and loved it, but the place that this movie went was just too out there. it was so weird, and if i weren't required to have sat through the whole film, i would have walked out. the writing wasn't terrible, but it was just all over the place. by the time this movie ended, i was just left terribly confused and wishing that it had ended sooner. there was just something about this film that didn't resonate, i understand more offbeat films like "fight club", but i just did not care about the characters at all.
