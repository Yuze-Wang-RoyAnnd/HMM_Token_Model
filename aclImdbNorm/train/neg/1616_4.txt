star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning <br /><br />this second instalment of the che films moves the story forward to the late 60s, where the man has now moved his resistance fighters into the hills of south america, surviving without enough food and water and with tensions mounting between the group. everything comes to a head when he crosses the border into bolivia and the government forces step up their campaign to bring him down.<br /><br />without the flitting between time and places of the last film, soderbergh's second instalment focuses solely on the action in the hills, and manages to be an even duller experience. and more pretentiously, the score has been drowned out, giving the second instalment more of an unwelcome air of artsieness that proves just as alienating. there's just an unshakeable air of boredom to the film that never lets up. you can't fault soderbergh's ambition or del toro's drive in the lead role, it's just a shame that somewhere in the production things managed to take such a disappointing turn. **
