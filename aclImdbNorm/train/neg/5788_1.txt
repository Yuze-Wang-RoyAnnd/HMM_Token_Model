ok, so mr. agrama's company (which is involved in some dubious business with former italian pm silvio berlusconi) produced a horrendous mish-mash by a mr. carl macek.<br /><br />what is this horrendous mish-mash i'm talking about? well, macek took three entirely unrelated japanese sci-fi animated series (namely, macross, southern cross and mospeada), added tons of dialogue - believing firmly that the american audience is too dumb to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence - , edited the whole lot heavily for violent content, added some metaphysical mumbo jumbo, dubbed it using some of the worst voice actors this side of acting hell (reba west's singing was - and still is - unbearable and a total outrage, especially compared to mrs. mari iijima)... and the result was an 85-episode series with hundreds of continuity problems and plot holes.<br /><br />of course, the mecha were cool to look at (especially those in the "macross saga") and the plot parts that remained unscathed were good. but whatever was good about robotech was not the result of macek's work or the "voice talents" he recruited. it was because of the toils and efforts of the (uncredited - why? would i be too bold to accuse hg of plagiarism here?) japanese creators. those of us who eventually got wind of the real deal and compared the originals to robotech now wish we had never been exposed to robotech. the originals are so much better, naturally, and make a lot more sense.<br /><br />robotech, however, did something worthwhile: it prompted legendary anime creator leiji matsumoto to start a campaign for the protection of japanese anime creators' intellectual property from such unauthorized and uncalled-for reworkings that talentless people like carl macek produce.
