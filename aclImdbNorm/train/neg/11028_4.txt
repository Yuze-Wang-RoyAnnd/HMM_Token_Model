near the beginning, after it's been established that outlaw john dillinger (warren oates), is an egomaniacal rapist, another bandit of the 1930s is cornered in a farm house and surrounded by the fbi. second-in-command melvin purvis (ben johnson), surveys the situations, sticks a lighted cigar in his mouth, picks up two loaded .45-caliber automatics, and stalks off into the distant house alone. bang, bang, bang. purvis emerges alone from the house, carrying the female hostage, the miscreant dead. all in long shot.<br /><br />if you're enthralled by stories like red riding hood, this should have considerable appeal.<br /><br />oh, it's as exciting as it is mindless. pretty boy floyd meets his demise dramatically. multiple violations of the civic code. plenty of shoot outs with tommy guns and pistols. blood all over.<br /><br />as history, it stinks. few remember melvin purvis as an fbi hero, partly, i would guess, because of his name. melvin purvis? we all remember j. edgar hoover, who fired melvin purvis because he was a rival in the quest for public attention though.<br /><br />the picture was written and directed by john milius. he's the guy who had it written into his contract that, should any animals be shot and killed in the course of one of his productions, he should be the designated shooter. milius is the guy, a compleat gun freak, who had teddy roosevelt's rough riders in the spanish-american war shouting quotations from henry v -- "saint crispin's day" and all that.<br /><br />exciting, yes, and complete garbage. "i knew i'd never take him alive, and i didn't try too hard neither." that is, kill 'em all and let god sort them out.<br /><br />you'll just love it.
