the. worst. film. ever. made.<br /><br />after watching this supposedly gay made film, i suspect someone rounded up a brain damaged half blind neo-nazi and had him make the worst gay film ever, all in some deluded attempt to attack gay culture. i had to stop the movie and call a friend to come over just so i had someone to scoff at when i paused the movie out of shock, disbelief and outrage at such sheer stupidity.<br /><br />on top of all the horrible writing and acting and illogical and stupid plot, its just a poorly made film. a dog with a handycam tied to its tail could have churned out better.<br /><br />seriously, after reading the few positive reviews this movie has here, i suspect the writer must have a half a dozen imdb accounts. anyone who says this film is even watchable as anything other than a joke, is a liar or being paid heavily to say so.
