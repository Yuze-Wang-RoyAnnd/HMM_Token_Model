human pot roast joe don baker (mitchell) stars in this dull, unremarkable `action' movie as deputy geronimo, a fat, gassy slob who sits around in a stupid looking cowboy suit, listening to country music and eating too many donuts. meanwhile, a vaguely criminal guy named palermo (played by the guy who owned the drill in fulci's gates of hell) stumbles into joe don's territory and shoots the sheriff in a poorly edited scene. joe don- slowly- gives chase and offs palermo's brother after uttering his now legendary catch phrase `it's your move. think you can take me? well, go ahead on'. for some reason joe don, a texas lawman, must transport palermo to italy (`mr. palermo's been a major source of embarrassment to the italian government,' says mr. wilson, another vague character played by bill mckinney, who was in master ninja 1, she freak, and a lot of good clint eastwood movies). <br /><br />anyhoo, joe don's plane must land on the island of malta, where palermo escapes with the help of a briefcase and a guy who looks like jon lovitz. and that's where the movie grinds to a halt. for the rest of the movie, joe don looks for palermo, looses palermo, ends up in a jail cell, is yelled at by the malta chief of police, and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more. then joe don keeps looking for palermo, looses palermo, ends up in a jail cell, is yelled at by the malta chief of police, and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more. then joe don looks for palermo, looses palermo, ends up in a jail cell, is yelled at by the malta chief of police, and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more. this is one aggravating movie.<br /><br />at one point joe don is thought to be dead at sea. all the other characters wonder if he's dead or not, finally concluding that he is. but then he shows up (he was rescued by a poor family) and no one mentions the fact that he was missing at sea for several days. even his cute, julia louise-dreyfuss-esque sidekick doesn't welcome him back. she does, however, offer to help him find palermo, so joe don looks for palermo, looses palermo, ends up in a jail cell, is yelled at by the malta chief of police, and then let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more.<br /><br />highpoints include, a bizarre carnival with strange colorful floats, some sexy strippers, a shoot out involving a kid dressed like napoleon and a cart of tomatoes, a chase scene involving a guy dressed like a monk, and any scene without joe don. lowpoints include joe don threatening a stripper with a coat hanger.<br /><br />it should be noted that this is from greydon clark, director of angel's revenge, who appears as the sheriff. ick!<br /><br />
