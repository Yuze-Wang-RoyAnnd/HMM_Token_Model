"the house of the spirits" is quite awful. i live in south america, in a country that suffered a military dictatorship just like the one the movie tries to describe, and even though everyone knows movies may be far far away from reality, this particular movie treats viewers as both ignorant and stupid. things are not so simple and linear as appears here, and of course political process are much more complicated and interesting that the plot in "the house...". if you can't show that complexity on screen is better not making a movie at all. there are a lot of examples of how can politics be seriously taken in cinema, without so many commonplaces. in some parts i felt that carmen miranda may appear within parrots and palm trees. when you talk about certain things you must be not only careful but respectful to your public's intelligence.
