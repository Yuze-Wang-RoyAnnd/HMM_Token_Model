a movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself, blue juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and cornwall. sean pertwee is the real star of this film, while the more famous catherine zeta jones plays his girlfriend and ewan mcgregor plays his drug addicted pal.<br /><br />for those who don't like surfing or cornwall in the slightest, you'll find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting. the beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes. plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional. the plot is an interesting idea but because of the shallow characters you have no idea why they act in the situations they're put in.<br /><br />only ewan, sean and catherine's characters make this a film worth being on videotape, which is why it was only released on videotape in the us after ewan and catherine reached mainstream fame.
