michael jackson would have claimed a spot for the top-billed character in the golden child, and because he loves kids. that didn't work (and why should it?), so instead we have eddie murphy out to save the world by rescuing "kid midas". i would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actor's inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy - adventure - comedy that's a step closer to ishtar. whatever murphy says or does can be best liked, but don't get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent; he doesn't belong in this movie, and the same went for dr. dolittle! the violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic, and that wouldn't have made any sense as hollywood and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy. speaking of visuals, they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of ronald reagan's presidential fame. murphy is far better at coming to america and 48 hrs, but this stale movie isn't my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste.
