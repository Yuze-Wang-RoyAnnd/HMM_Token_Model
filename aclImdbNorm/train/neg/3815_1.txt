the acting is bad ham, all the jokes are superficial and the target audience is clearly very young children, assuming they have below average iqs. i realize that it was meant for kids, but so is malcom in the middle, yet they still throw in adult humor and situations.<br /><br />what should we expect from a show lead by bob saget, the only comedian in existence who is less funny than a ball hitting a man's groin, which is probably why he stopped hosting america's funniest home videos.<br /><br />parents, do not let your kids watch this show unless you want to save money on college. expose your kids to stupidity and they will grow up dumberer.
