:spoilers:<br /><br />i was very disappointed in love's abiding joy. i had been waiting a really long time to see it and i finally got the chance when it re-aired thursday night on hallmark. i love the first three "love" movies but this one was nothing like i thought it was going to be. the whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way to many goofs, and the editing was very poor - to many scenes out of context. i also think the death of baby kathy happened way to soon and clarks appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. it seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. there seemed to be no interaction between missie and willie at all.<br /><br />i think the script writers should have went more by the book. it seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from janette oke's writings. i mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or clark getting hurt because of it. and i think missie and willies reactions to kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard.<br /><br />out of the four movies that have been made so far i'd have to say that love's abiding joy is my least favorite. i hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if clarks character is in them i hope he's got a bigger part and i hope his part isn't so bland. i also hope there is more of scottie and cookie and maybe even marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next.
