the film is a bit tedious. it's mostly a silent film, with the bulk o the story provided through a series of voice-overs. while making a silent film like this is not such a bad idea, this is one of those films where the lack of dialog and the repetitive early scenes make it simply tedious. you don't understand the reason for the tedium until well into the picture, and by then it's too late. the first 40 minutes of film is something of a slow piece of mexican soft porn, and unimaginative soft porn at that. later in the film the style of the first 40 minutes starts to makes sense, but it's too late, because by then the audience is lost. there is some nice location shooting at the national autonomous university of mexico. i've often wondered why more films aren't shot there. the campus is built on the edge of lava fields that lend the campus a very otherworldly feel. my biggest problem with the film is that the director/writer has made the film the way he wanted to see it without regard for how a viewer who doesn't know the story will view it. you can't ignore the audience when you tell a story.
