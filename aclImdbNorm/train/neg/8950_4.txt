i have heard about this novel a long time ago, many of my friends have recommend me to read it. i searched it in every place and finally found it. this is a book that every man should read, because it is genius and because of it's vision. i enjoyed every page.<br /><br />i knew about the movie and could not wait to see it. when i finally did i was very disappointed, many things that are in the book are not in the movie (i do not think that this is a spoiler) that just makes the movie not logical... michael radford might be a good director, but a bad writer. especially as a book adopter. the movie is not dark at all, the writing is really bad, the only thing that is good, even great, is the acting. john hurt is an amazing actor and the only face i myself could see as winston smith.<br /><br />what angers me the most are the people in imdb that called this "the best adaptation ever" without even reading the book! or knowing anything about screen writing!<br /><br />you can only understand the brilliance of the story by reading the book, do not consider this as an alternative. as a fan of the book, i was very disappointed.<br /><br />the points i gave for this movie goes for the acting.
