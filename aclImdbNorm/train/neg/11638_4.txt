"blood of the sacred, blood of the damned" is the third installment of the gabriel knight games, a series of adventure games about the roguish writer/paranormal detective, gabriel knight. gabriel and his companion, grace, have been asked by prince james of albany to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by so-called "night visitors." when the son of prince james is kidnapped, gabriel pursues the night visitors to rennes le ch^ateau, where he begins piecing together a mystery relating to the holy grail.<br /><br />despite the marketing, this game is not about vampires. vampires have a token appearance in the game, but never command center stage, as did the voodoo hounfor in "sins of the fathers" or the werewolves in "the beast within." gabriel and grace make no attempt to uncover the true nature of vampires, or to research lore on vampires. although the vampires do murder three people during the course of the game, their victims are chosen at random and have nothing to do with the main plot.<br /><br />a large part of the charm of the first two gabriel knight installments was in the relationships which gabriel formed with the villains. through these relationships, the player could not help but sympathize with the villain, and thus the villain was transformed into more of a human and less of a monster. however, in "blood of the sacred," gabriel's only interaction with the villain is through a single, cheesy interview, which does nothing to endear the villain to the player.<br /><br />the roles that gabriel and grace play in this mystery are fairly futile. gabriel spends his time snooping into the identities of members of a treasure-hunter tour group staying at his hotel, but what he uncovers amounts to nothing more than a red herring. grace spends her time researching the mystery of rennes le ch^ateau, but all her research is rendered superfluous by the presence of a perplexing ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries.<br /><br />the actions of this perplexing ally and his polar opposite --- the vampire leader --- are insupportable. the ally leaves hints about the mystery of rennes le ch^ateau in broad daylight and expects grace (and not the other treasure hunters from the tour group) to find them. however, he could have revealed the mystery to grace in its entirety on day 1, instead of putting the kidnapped child at risk for an additional 48 hours. and in the end, he simply tells grace the mystery in its entirety anyway.<br /><br />meanwhile, the vampire leader fails to achieve the goals of centuries of scheming, because he chooses to refrain from action for two days after the kidnapping of the child. the only reason given for his decision to delay action is that he wants to savor his victory.<br /><br />the game would have been much better had it been purely focused on the holy grail. the kidnapping and vampires should have been omitted, replaced with a race against the vatican to uncover the mystery of rennes le ch^ateau. since gabriel is portrayed more than once as reluctantly catholic, this conflict would have had many opportunities for character development.<br /><br />all in all, the game was a disappointing installment in the series, despite an improved interface and the return of tim curry as the voice of gabriel knight.
