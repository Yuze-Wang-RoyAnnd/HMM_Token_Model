i'll be honest, this is one of the worst movies ever. if not, then it's very close. ever seen a bad teen soap opera. well this is like one of those. except worse. for example: (possibly spoiler) girl: i wanna go somewhere else.<br /><br />guy: all we need is here.<br /><br />girl: but i wanna take myself somewhere different.<br /><br />guy: i'll take you somewhere else.<br /><br />... proceeding this line they have sex. the music is bad pop and bad punk rock. if you've ever read the book, avoid this movie like the plague. they completely change the personalities of the characters and the events. additionally, they just get rid of things. also, the movie ends about before the book finishes. it is an awful movie. so, if you haven't read the book, don't watch it. if you have read the book, burn it (the movie). if you like stupid teen soap operas that are lower quality than your average low quality teen soap opera, go for it. then again, should we expect anything different from mtv?
