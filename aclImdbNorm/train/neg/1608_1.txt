(psychopaths don't have ideals.) i do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of che's earlier life. did he actually consider it too uninteresting? a massacre of 600 people holds no interest for the viewer, huh? amazing. some much better directors than this over-praised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a 4-hour movie.<br /><br />soderbergh, in a sense, becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative, dark side - which is more than 90% - of guevara. by spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy, consciously ignoring the ugly truth (god forbid he should taint the holy image of che), soderbergh proves himself not a humanist - a fake image which most hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold - but the opposite: that he cares only about ideas, never about the people on whom these ideas are tested (like on guinea pigs). soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind; such people often have a latent contempt for the "proleteriat" (what a stupid term) they're supposedly siding with.<br /><br />half of all students around the world wear che's image on their red and orange shirts, but without ever knowing why. he has become an iconic figure for clueless, uninformed, very often young people, who think that by having this man's face on their chest that somehow makes them appear "edgy", intellectual, hip or interesting. in reality, wearing a che shirt only underlines one's overall shallowness and total disinterest in self-education. (wouldn't you want to find out more about a person before you start advertising his/her face to the world?) wearing che's by-now clich'e image has become as common as having a bart simpson coffee cup. all those "che-wearers" probably know more about marge's blue hair than they'll ever read up on about fidel castro's dead ally.<br /><br />after everything that'd been done in the name of marx, one would think that these mongrel "ideals" would be finally laid to rest. it seems mankind will never learn. stalin, mao, kim il, pol pot, castro, milosevic, ceausescu, the iron curtain, a hundred million dead, more than a billion ruined physically and/or mentally through this system... so none of that matters, huh? <br /><br />the fact that del toro won a cannes award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless as to how cannes and other european festivals work - and vote. hint: sean penn headed a jury not long ago.<br /><br />for my music-related rants, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/fedor8/
