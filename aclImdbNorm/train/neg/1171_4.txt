i can hardly believe that this inert, turgid and badly staged film is by a filmmaker whose other works i've quite enjoyed. the experience of enduring the lady and the duke (and no other word but "enduring" will do), left me in a vile mood, a condition relieved only by reading the imdb user comment by ali-112. for not only has rohmer attempted (with success) to make us see the world through the genre art of 18th century france but, as ali has pointed out, has shown (at the cost of alienating his audience) the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a dislikably elitist woman of her times. the director has accomplished something undeniably difficult, but i question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so -- or for us to watch the dull results of his labor.
