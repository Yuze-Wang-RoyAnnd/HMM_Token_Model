i have been a fan of without a trace from the premier episode. i really cannot express my disappointment in the episode last week. this is a real problem that far too many afican-american families have dealt with and continue to deal with. the lack of media coverage crucial in the first 48 hours has been documented by a recent study. law enforcement including local , state, and federal are also complicit. what was the purpose of advertising this subject matter and then copping out on the ending? seemingly, television can deal with almost any subject matter except race. this is shameful.get it together or don't explore it next time.
