this is the story of two guys who found a copy of 'funky monkey.' finding this seemed odd at the time figuring that there are still posters for the movie at the local cineplex odeon. after seeing such classics as 'every which way but loose' and 'project x,' these two guys figured movies with monkeys are awesome.<br /><br />these guys were in for a long ride as they watched this movie. there was some monkey that was replaced by a stunt man when action sequences were required. it was apparent that the monkey wasn't trained in the school of shakespearean acting. perhaps replacing the monkey with ben affleck might have helped the guys thought.<br /><br />maybe a strong sidekick would help like a jackie chan or heck maybe even hulk hogan. luckily this movie had amazing martial artist and jet li look-a-like matthew modine. while some might argue that matthew modine doesn't come close to jet li, camera tricks prove that he is every bit as good. when it becomes obvious that an untrained chimp can't handle the movie, the movie leans on matthew modine to be the real star.<br /><br />did i mention that there is some dorky kid that develops a bond with modine and the monkey? is there a possibility that the kid learns confidence and even picks up a girl in this movie? even matthew modine should get jealous with this one (because using the pick-up line 'i'm second fiddle to a monkey' doesn't seem to work with the ladies.)<br /><br />shortly after watching this movie the two guys got a phone call from matthew modine telling them 'seven days.'
