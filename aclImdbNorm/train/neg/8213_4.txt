i can't believe it, imdb really does have every tv show known to man! i have not seen this show in over 20 years. i only remember two episodes, and i barely remember those. i remember that tony may not been on from the start, because one of the episodes i remember is the one in which everybody trying to get tony to join, but he rejects them, but typically at the end of the show he becomes a member of power house, with everybody cheering.<br /><br />the other one i remember is the one where lolo for some reason pretends to be dead,(complete with funeral and mourners). i don't remember why he plays dead, or how the show ends.<br /><br />this is one of those shows that i convinced myself that i must have dreamed up since no one else had ever heard of it.
