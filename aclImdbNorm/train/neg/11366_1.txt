the first (and only) time i saw "shades" was during a sneakpreview. it hadn't even been in premiere. i remember there was someone of the directors staff there, don't even remember who. it was a belgian movie, we never heard of it, so we were quite neutral, not knowing what to expect. mickey rourke is a brilliant actor and he's stands miles ahead all the rest. he plays an actor who's star has long stopped rising. he's helping to realise a movie in belgium entitled "shades".<br /><br />as soon as the movie started, we noticed how much swearing there is. nothing against the occasional swear word. however this was way beyond annoying. whenever rourke uses the f*** word to express something, it comes naturally. however, when someone from the cast, a non-english speaker uses the f**** or s*** word, it becomes arrogant and aggressive.<br /><br />we quickly lost count of how many times they used the f and s words. everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre. and we had to give a vote, but it was hard for us because it was only from 0 to 10, and we were looking for the -10.
