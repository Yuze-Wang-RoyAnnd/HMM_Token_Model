ok i had higher hopes for this carnosaur movie simply because it seemed like the sequels were getting better as they came out. i did like carnosaur 2 better than 1. i figured well this one is newer so it must be better right? well... i quickly learned i was wrong. i was extremely confused with the casting. they brought back rick dean for another spotlight character and michael macdonald as a police officer. now for rick dean lol, in carnosaur 2 i thought he fit the role pretty well and wasn't really annoyed by him, now in carnosaur 3 wow they placed him as an elite soldier. now we are getting goofy here. the movie actually started out pretty good with a decent gun fight and dinos escaping out of there little freezer trucks, but as soon as scott valentines team showed up we had a mix of a romantic comedy with very funny performances from retarded and floppy dinosaurs.<br /><br />i'll start with the raptors first, they had there tails drag the ground, which in the second one they were up in the air which looked more common for a dinosaur that can run up to 50-60 mph. now when they ran they wiggled back and forth and the heads didn't move at all. there hands were floppy all over the place and since they were extremely poorly shot by the director they looked stupid and out of place.<br /><br />the t-rex was extremely pathetic, they would of been better off using the one from the previous 2 movies. at least that one looked somewhat frightening. the one in this film looked like it was smiling all the time. the legs when it walked was hilarious, like it was john wayne in the old west all stiff legged and stuff. lol another thing i noticed is that the hands did not move, they were stuck next to its body so it looked and sounded (god the sound effects were awful) retarded!!! now if i was the director and realized that i had this to work with maybe i would of maybe tried a little bit harder to hide the fakeness fact. as for the rest of the movie, well this was the sloppiest and loudest military team i have ever seen. the weapons they used wouldn't make sense for the scenario. they even had an arm wrestling scene inside the warehouse where the carnosaurs were roaming, now i was tickled at this scene because i thought that while this stupidity was going on that the dinos would get in there and cause some damage. instead the director wasted about 7 minutes of our time. i would like to look at this movie as the 3 stooges of dinosaur movies. you have retarded military, retarded dinosaurs, retarded scenario and you have a wonderful 83 minutes to spend of your day watching this.<br /><br />now i'm not saying i wouldn't watch this, bc actually i do recommend everyone see this movie that wants 83 minutes of pure entertainment. it may seem like i'm ranting but really i'm hyping this movie up to what it is. its really a lot of fun to watch because while watching this you think to yourself, "did the director really make this seriously?"
