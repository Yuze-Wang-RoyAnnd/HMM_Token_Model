i have no idea how anyone managed to stay awake during this show. the acting was ham-fisted and amateur, the story was old news, and plot development (or lack thereof) invariably had my eyelids sagging less than halfway through each episode. that's about all there is to say of it, because it genuinely lacked substance of any kind.<br /><br />how can you people like crap like this? it's freaking stupid, it's an insult to your intelligence. i don't even know how to further explain it... it's as if some of you will stare mindlessly at junk like this solely because you like the way some of the actors look, or because, for whatever crazy reason, you haven't seen the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times before.<br /><br />i just.. forget it. this show sucked, and thankfully it's gone forever. i wish they'd get to work on demolishing the o.c. once and for all.
