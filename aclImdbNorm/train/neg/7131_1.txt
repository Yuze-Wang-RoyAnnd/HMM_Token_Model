i like bad movies. i like to rent bad movies with my friends and rip on them for their duration. then there are abhorrent movies like this. redline is not just a bad movie, but a telling sign that maybe the american movie industry should please, for the sake of the viewer, at least proofread scripts before funding a movie.<br /><br />if a stereotype took a crap, this movie would spawn from that. the storyline is unbearable, and the acting all around is laughable. nadia bjorlin and eddie griffin have, perhaps, the worst screen chemistry i've seen in a good while, and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street merchants (about the only thing they can legitimately qualify for). furthermore, how angus macfadyen got convinced to do this movie is so far beyond me that i can't even think of an analogy. i am a loyal fan of his, but this has made me question him.<br /><br />to sum it up. several people want revenge for different reasons (and if you care enough to know what they are, you're a bigger person than me), so much so that it turns to violence (i guess). the movie is like ouroboros, the snake that swallows its own tail, in that it's an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue not fit for human ears. this movie is essentially one big car commercial for the first half, and an indecipherable action movie for the rest, it should be avoided at any and all costs.<br /><br />i wish i could find one positive aspect to this movie, and i think it lies in the fact that eventually the credits do roll.<br /><br />p.s. nadia bjorlin, if that was you singing those two songs in this movie, then you are a hack, and i hope old age ravages you.<br /><br />p.s.s. if you do rent this movie looking for a laughable experience, listen for the lyrics to nadia bjorlin's awesome songs.
