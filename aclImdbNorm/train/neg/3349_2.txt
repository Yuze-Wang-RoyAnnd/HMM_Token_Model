i have yet to read shirley jackson's novel, something of which i've been meaning to do for quite sometime. i am sure it has got to be scarier than this film. i remember jumping once when i watched it the other day, although i cannot recall the scene. <br /><br />the special effects are great and i watched this on dvd, but i am sure in the theatre it must have been an awesome sight. after the first few special effects are done with i was waiting for a story to develop.<br /><br />i figured this movie at the least has to be loosely based on the classic novel, so a good story should be there, but it wasn't. i was relegated to staring at the gorgeous catherine zeta-jones character throughout the movie basically because there was nothing much else to watch. lili talor was such a suck character. i did not like her one bit, something about whiny people. also, the guy in this film reminded me of the cartoonish dudley doright with his voice and face. i could not relate to the characters at all. quigon, ahem liam neeson did an admirable job trying to get through this movie with some type of acting.<br /><br />half to three quarters of the way i was just dying to go see a campy friday the 13th or a scream queenish film! at least there is some type of entertainment value. if there is no story there at least they fill it up with gory deaths or attractive females. this had nothing. <br /><br />
