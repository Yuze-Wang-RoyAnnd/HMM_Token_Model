i would just like it to be known, that i do not often rate movies below a 5. i was originally very excited to see this movie. its numerous trailer bumps on tv for several months made me reaally want to see this movie. so, the other night when i saw that it was available on fearnet on demand, i got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film.<br /><br />the storyline seemed intriguing enough - some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway. there's a photographer obsessed with the missing people. where are they going? what's happening to them? one day, the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken, and becomes obsessed with the butcher, following him around, yada yada. the film had a way of sucking you in, even though the plot was highly predictable. "oh no, it's dark, look out behind you" i say, quite bored with the cheap thrills.<br /><br />the plot, even though predictable, was intriguing...that is, until the end. "this was good until the end.... then it just got silly", says jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. and i fully agree. and here come the spoilers...<br /><br />see, i was hoping it was some mad killer, some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism. no. it was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries. woo. how original. how unrealistic. how dull.<br /><br />3/10. come on lionsgate. you've had amazing films, but this one sunk.
