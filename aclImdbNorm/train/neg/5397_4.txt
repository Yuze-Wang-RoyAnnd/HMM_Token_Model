i think this is one of the weakest of the kenneth branagh shakespearian works. after such great efforts as much ado about nothing, etc. i thought this was poor. the cast was weaker (alicia silverstone, nivoli, mcelhone???) but my biggest gripe was that they messed with the bard's work and cut out some of the play to put in the musical/dance sequences.<br /><br />you just don't do shakespeare and then mess with the play. sorry, but that is just wrong. i love some cole porter just like the next person, but jeez, don't mess with the shakespeare. skip this and watch "prospero's books" if you want to see a brilliant shakespearean adaptation of the tempest.
