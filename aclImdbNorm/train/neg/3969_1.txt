i'm writing this because i somehow felt being led to believe dark remains was a good movie. whilst it's not the worst i've seen, it certainly isn't good.<br /><br />a weak script, weak actors, and weak directing. even if they can't afford big name cast, would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress? it was painful to watch a plain actress through out the film with her dull performance. the story was a clich'e and poorly scripted. the special effects were minimal. the "suspense" tricks employed repetitively here were hard to swallow.<br /><br />to be fair, dark remains is no worse than quite some of the masters of horrors' episodes. but not quite on par with quality movies yet. dark remains is only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who don't want to miss any movie in the genre, even if it's a poorly made one. as for anyone else, time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy.
