curiously, season 6 of the columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts, based on this outing for the "man-in-the-mac" and also "fade into murder".<br /><br />furthermore, it is not a coincidence that peter s. feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts (incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard here).<br /><br />this adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material. the story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversation.<br /><br />columbo is also shadowed by a colleague here(similar to "last salute to the commodore") but the entertainment value is minimal. to add to this, celeste's holm characterisation, which is intended to provide comedy, induces embarrassment rather than laughs.<br /><br />the script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift columbo the case, though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crime.<br /><br />ironically, what turns out to be, arguably, columbo's worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series. he quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircut/manicure at the same time. the next 5 minutes are hilarious - it's just that columbo's hair is so perfectly groomed, then he can't afford to pay the bill and then, when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstyle!<br /><br />sadly, this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes. <br /><br />for columbo completionists only.
