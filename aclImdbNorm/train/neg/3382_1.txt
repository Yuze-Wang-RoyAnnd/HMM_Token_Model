this is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made. the stage version of a chorus line is wonderful. this movie misses the mark in almost every way. even the casting is baffling. take audrey landers as val. "dance 10 looks 3" is val's song. val's story is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department. yes, she finds a solution, but ultimately she's a great dancer. what do the brilliant filmmakers do? they hire an actress who can't dance and is famous for looking great. way to miss the boat.<br /><br />then there's the choreography. i'm sure michael bennett was turning over in his grave. why didn't they use his choreography? it really can't be improved upon.
