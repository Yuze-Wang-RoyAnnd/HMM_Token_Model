avoid this one, unless you want to watch an expensive but badly made movie. example? the sound is good but the dialogue is not clear - a cardinal sin in a french film.<br /><br />this film attempts to combine western, drug intrigue and ancien regime costume epic. what? well, consider this. the cowboy music is hilarious during sword fights. or how about the woman in her underwear, holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed?<br /><br />someone should do a 'what's up tiger lily' on this bomb. rewrite the script and then either dub or subtitle it. heck, it's almost that now. (btw, gerard depardieu and carole bouquet, both known to american audiences, have roles.)
