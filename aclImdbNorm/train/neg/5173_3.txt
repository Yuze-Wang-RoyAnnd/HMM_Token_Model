when i saw this at a shop i thought it looked really good and original. like wolfs creek meets texas chainsaw massacre, and i mean it only cost three quid (around $6). to be honest i don't think it was even worth that.<br /><br />it seemed like the directors- the 'butcher brothers' couldn't decide whether wanted to do a artsy sort of horror or a gory slasher horror. it ended up with a clich'e ridden gory sadistic hour and fifteen minutes with all the characters being one dimensional and you couldn't care less what happened to them but to try to make the audience care about the characters they added a useless monologue at the end and the beginning of the film which to be perfectly honest wasn't needed.<br /><br />the only good part really was the middle/end- i won't ruin it for you. but that was the only "good "part.<br /><br />overall a pointless watch. it felt like a two hour film but was in fact only 75 minutes. if you want an artsy film-don't bother. if you want a slasher movie- don't bother- the film moves so slowly with nothing ever happening.
