the show's echoed 'bubbling' sound effect used to put me to sleep. a very soothing show. i think i might have slept through the parts where there was danger or peril. i had also heard that some set up shots for a show on sponge divers was shot in tarpon springs, florida. i would assume lloyd bridges never dove there. i only remember the show in reruns and although it was never edge-of-the-seat exciting we would make up our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmother's house... imagining the echoed bubbling sounds and narrating our adventures in our heads. i thought 'flipper' had better undersea action. of course, he had the advantage of being in his natural environment.
