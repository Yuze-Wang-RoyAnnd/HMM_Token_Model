five across the eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their curfew, they stop off at a store & accidentally hit another car & decide to just drive off & leave it. soon after the other car forces them to stop & a crazy woman with a shotgun gets out & shouts at them, makes them take their clothes off & makes them pee on them & then randomly drives off. shaken & shocked the girls think their ordeal is over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as she seems intent on killing the terrified girls who are lost & are low on gas...<br /><br />produced & directed by greg swinson & ryan theissen with swinson writing the thing & theissen responsible for the cinematography & editing i have to say that five across the eyes is easily one of the worst films i have ever seen if not the worst, i mean i'm struggling to think of a film i have seen that's worse. now let me start off by saying that i am sure a lot of the film-making decision taken here were deliberate to try & provoke atmosphere, tension, realism & suspense but there is not one aspect of five across the eyes that i didn't hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that has been put up on youtube & even then it's still slightly embarrassing & a frankly worthless waste of 90 odd minutes of my time that i could have been doing something more entertaining & fun like pulling my fingernails out with pliers. the reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the imdb (the amount of 1 star comments is revealing & they can't all be wrong, right?) & it's message board which i think is much more of an indicator of what the average person thinks it's absolutely trashed by just about everyone & the phrase 'the worst film i have ever seen' is used a few times & to be fair most of these negative comments mention th same things & i have to agree with them. the story is terrible, alright i suspect it's meant to be minimalistic but this minimal? there's never any reason or explanation for the events that happen & it just feels totally random. it goes on for ages, the amount of plot here would struggle to fill a thirty minute made for telly program let along a full length feature. the dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who don't seem to have a brain cell between them taking about random stuff & screaming a lot. oh god the screaming, there are seemingly endless scenes of these girls screaming or crying or whining which not only irritates & annoys & prevents any sane viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impossible to hear properly. then there's the real killer, the entire film is set & shot within the confines of a mini van, seriously the camera never leaves this car & as you can imagine it gets really boring, add that the low body count of just one person killed on screen & five across the eyes is a film that i hated with a passion.<br /><br />on a technical level again i can see that the film-making style here was a deliberate choice but i have to be honest again & say five across the eyes is the worst looking film i have ever seen. as a fan of film i like my films to look like proper films as it's a visual medium & i definitely don't want them to look worse than the average youtube video or my home films shot on a camcorder while i was drunk. it really does look that amateurish & that bad, it's a complete eyesore & i hated every moment of every second of it. just think the blair witch project (1999) only ten times worse looking & sounding & you will be almost there. there are times during five across the eyes when you literally can't tell what's going on or happening because of the camera-work & the almost pitch black & grainy contrast levels. the violence is tame too with a few splashes of blood & a stabbing at the end.<br /><br />low budget doesn't even begin to describe five across the eyes, with a supposed budget of about $4,000 this is easily one of the lowest budgeted films ever given a wide release. the two vans in the film were owned by members of the production & that's basically pretty much the entire budget right there, the locations. the acting is pretty bad by the main cast, i just hated all the fake put on crying & screaming that didn't convince at all but did irritate immensely.<br /><br />five across the eyes will go down as one of the worst films i have ever seen & i have seen a few films, whenever anyone now ask's me what's the worst film i have ever seen five across the eyes will definitely get a mention. i hated it, every single aspect & wretched moment of it.
