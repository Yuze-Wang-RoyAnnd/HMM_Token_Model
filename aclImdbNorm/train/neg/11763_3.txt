yes. i'll admit it. i believed all the hype surrounding this piece of work, about the trials and tribulations of 6 people, living in mexico city concerning their sexual lives. and so, i was really expecting to finally see a mexican movie (in ages) that was both popular and interesting to watch. unfortunately the film was utterly disappointing. the story presents us with two couples, both with very obvious marital problems. when a third party comes into the life of each couple, their problems reach a pivotal point. or absolute absurd. the plot then turns into a battle of the sexes. the stance taken by each group (yes, they literally group, girls with girls and boys with boys) is blatantly stupid and childish (i guess the humor was supposed to be there). and it all goes from bad to worse. the performances range from good (miss zavaleta) to mediocre (mr bichir), with serrano doing an acceptable job on his opera prima. however, the flat circumstances that make up the plot, the one-dimensional characters, the very poor (if not stupid) perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship etc, make the movie fail. miserably. spyl has had an (impressive) good reception at the box-office. believe the hype at your own risk.
