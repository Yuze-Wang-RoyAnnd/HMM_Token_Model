well, it's all been said about this movie and i hate it when writing reviews where everyone else already said what's to be said. but the thing is, i have seen zillions of movies and i am working on writing reviews on all the movies that i've seen. so, i have to write something.<br /><br />the acting is stupid. it's truly stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness towards the plane crash. the nun is nice though and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child. the three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid can the makers of this movie be. don't they realize that even rip-offs can still be scary. we don't see how the granpa is killed. the dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die, you just don't sympathize with them. and uncle tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been worked better. we just hear him scream and we see nothing!
