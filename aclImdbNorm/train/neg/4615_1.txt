i may not have the longest of attention-spans, but this is the second movie i have refused to see all the way through, and i even bought it on dvd because of its "classic" status. <br /><br />at first, i thought that the director was playing a big joke, so i kept waiting for a resolution, something to laugh at, something to keep my interest, but this resolution never came. rather, the writing was laughably amateurish, the movie dragged on and felt disjointed, like someone cut a tv series to feature-length. the academy must have been on drugs when they nominated this movie for no less than eight oscars.<br /><br />once again, i repeat myself. this is the second movie i have refused to watch all the way through. the first was "exterminator". i hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is. 1/10
