the nsa, cia, fbi, fsb and all other snoop agency in the world should watch this movie to gain information as to how to spy on people. (as mst3k commentary states it..."sanata has the dirt on every! santa's tentacles reach far and wide! there is no hiding from the klaus organization")<br /><br />from telescopes that can spy over millions of miles to ears that can hear everything. its amazing that the cia doesn't have santa on the payroll. <br /><br />satan's dance routine is hilarious. pitch...he is so useless.<br /><br />the cheese factor in of this movie is tremendous. very low budget but so fun to watch. i recommend watching the mystery science theatre 3000 version for even more laughs.<br /><br />you even get a laugh at the missfortune of the good kids.<br /><br />i give this a 1 for production quality and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.
