i rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable. judge for yourself. be warned, the following will not only give away the plot, but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie.<br /><br />a computer virus, designed by a frustrated nerd, sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors. when the code - in the form of light - enters the eye it can access the 'electrical system' of your body. what it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium. within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck, develops tunnel vision, his skin will turn white of the calcium, after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk. <br /><br />this virus is very intelligent. when it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device - operated by hands - the device is set on a very high voltage, which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the expert's head. the virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an atm. fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pc's in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water.<br /><br />oh dear...
