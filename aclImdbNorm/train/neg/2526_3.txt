i disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed "masterpiece" of the german new wave: <br /><br />1) there are major flaws in simple exposition, in the basic communication of critical plot points, as relating to maria's abortion and the secret contract between oswald and her husband. how many viewers understood that the husband agreed, in exchange for substantial financial remuneration, not to return to and reclaim his wife until oswald was dead?<br /><br />2) the ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental. the original screenplay called for maria to commit suicide after the reading of oswald's will, on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to oswald. in the final version, however, maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide. maria is then summarily blown up, rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self-delusion and moral compromise.<br /><br />3) fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private, the political on the personal. contrary to what the critics and "experts" assert, i don't think it works. merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of german reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama. <br /><br />the selfish ambition of maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so-called economic miracle of postwar germany. maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place, but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific. women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self-advancement for ages. <br /><br />4) lastly, there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness -- fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect. unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen; music is clumsily intrusive in places; and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting.<br /><br />strangely, for a movie condemning a country for willful collective amnesia of the holocaust, it itself never mentions it once.
