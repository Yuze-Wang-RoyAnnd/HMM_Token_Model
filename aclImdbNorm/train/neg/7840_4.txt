this movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school, watching as the rawandan genocide un-furls around him.<br /><br />the movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and rivalry of rawanda. then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic "new-comer" a young teacher who doesn't take life or the situation too seriously. as he and the driver approach a road-block he plays around with his drivers i.d. not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can't identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers they'll be killed. and thats how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolding around him. suddenly realizes that every rawandan (including his driver) is involved and that the europeans soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help. the media cameras cannot stop machete's, and there's too many machete wielding militia-men too shoot. the title comes from the armies captain saying he's going to shoot the dogs eating the dead-bodies around his compound, but won't shoot the militia-men that are killing people around the compound. mainly because they haven't fired at the soldiers yet. finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims, flees with his tail in-between his legs, rather than face immanent death with the school kids he's promised not to leave behind.<br /><br />it's more of character study, and a come to jesus moment for one character, than a story about the genocide in "rawanda". this movie didn't have to take place in rawanda, it could have taken place any one of the genocidal hell holes going around this world at any given time.
