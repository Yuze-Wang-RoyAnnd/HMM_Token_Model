this short spoof can be found on elite's millennium edition dvd of "night of the living dead". good thing to as i would have never went even a tad out of my way to see it.replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper. in execution, it's a different matter. this short didn't even elicit a chuckle from me. i really never thought i'd say this, but "night of the day of the dawn of the son of the bride of the return of the revenge of the terror of the attack of the evil, mutant, alien, flesh eating, hellbound, zombified living dead part 2: in shocking 2-d" was a very better parody and not nearly as lame or boring.<br /><br />my grade: f
