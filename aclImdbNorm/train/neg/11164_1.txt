what a disappointment!<br /><br />this film seemed to be trying to copy 'cutting edge' comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy, sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition. jack black's acting/role was self-indulgent and self-regarding... and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting. the soundtrack was tedious. we are ( were) fans of black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration. why did he feel he needed to make this mistake?<br /><br />we will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first!!<br /><br />was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel?
