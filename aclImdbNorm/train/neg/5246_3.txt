wow, the spookiest thing about this episode was the price of houses 40 years ago. i'll preface by saying i'm not a fan of narrated episodes. if the story/actors/etc. are worth their salt, they should be able to convey the bulk of the narrative without having to read it out, reminded me of personages who can't think off the cuff but rely on teleprompters. the psychobabble was tedious and boring, but some enjoy that kind of thing, it's just not my cup o tea. they could have kept the narrative but at least made it much more believable and interesting if it was coming from a psychiatrist or maybe a newspaper reporter or something. niggling little things like peugeot being at the house, which has a singular half circle driveway, yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree he was standing under, because it's nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property. sloppy editing, as she pulls into the driveway (for what seems the 100th time) exactly who are those 2 guys you see at 24m30s walking towards the car as she pulls into the driveway of the deserted house? the dolly close-ups were also overdone, like some jr. high drama student discovering the zoom function on his camera for the first time. i could keep picking apart, but that might get almost as boring as this episode was. it kept dragging on and the true purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the stock footage they had shot of elaine driving the newport convertible. i fully expected to see the chrysler logo and a nice jingle play while a voice over told us all about the 8 track player, automatic top etc. the only good thing i have to say about his one is that it just ends, abruptly. no loose ends tied up, nothing explained or terminated. not that many would notice, i suspect most had already changed the channel or dozed off by the end.
