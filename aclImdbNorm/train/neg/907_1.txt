i wrote a review of this movie further down after buying it on dvd and being sorely disapointed.<br /><br />i tried watching it again after reading a few of the comments made since then. being a film student and making similar budgeted movies myself (ie no budget, shot on digi cam), i stand by my original comments. this is a no budget student project (and not a particularly good one), released on video/dvd to look like an award winning film (if you read the cover). so deceving the public into thinking it's something it's not. i want my money back under the trades description act! complete rubbish!
