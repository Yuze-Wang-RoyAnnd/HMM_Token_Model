oliver hardy awakens with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see ollie's new wife and baby. the problem is, they don't exist--ollie apparently made them up! so, it's up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family.<br /><br />this isn't a particularly unique story idea, as i've seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot. the best of these was bobby vernon's don't kid me. it is much better than one too many--probably much of this was due to it being made a decade later--when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick. now i am not against physical comedy, but in some slapstick films, people starting shooting guns wildly, kick and strangle each other, etc. with little provocation. sadly, at the end of one too many, that's exactly what they do. none of it makes sense and it was as if they'd just run out of story ideas.<br /><br />overall, not exactly a milestone in entertainment. there's just not enough payoff to merit watching it unless you are an obsessive silent fan like myself.
