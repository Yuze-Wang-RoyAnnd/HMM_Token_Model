(review in english, since swedish is not allowed)<br /><br />i saw this movie with extremely low expectations, and i can sadly inform you that the movie barely lived up to them.<br /><br />as much as i loved to see janne "loffe" karlsson on the big screen again, the writers should have realized early in the scriptwriting process that seven people falling into the water, isn't original or funny. the story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable, the ones that ain't, is just plain boring. i smiled like three times during the entire film.<br /><br />the placement of swedish findus products is (unintentionally) funny, why not just a big sign saying; "findus made it happen!".<br /><br />g"ota kanal 2 doesn't need to be seen at the cinema or on dvd, just wait for it to air on tv, it wont take too long.
