nicholas walker is paul, the local town reverand who's married to martha (ally sheedy), but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair, veronica (dara tomanovich). however in so doing, he gets a bout of amnesia (hence the name of the film). sally kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good reverand in a shades of "misery" type of way. it's sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this. not the least bit john savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator. in a film billed as a 'black comedy', one has to bring both elements into said movie. while this does bring the former in spades, it sadly contains none of the latter. furthermore you can't emphasize with any of the characters and as thus, have absolutely no vested interest in them. technically not an all-together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one.<br /><br />eye candy: dara tomanovich gets topless; sally kirkland also shows some skin <br /><br />my grade: c- <br /><br />where i saw it: showtime showcase
