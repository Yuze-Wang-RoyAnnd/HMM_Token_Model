i'm a big fan of the old westerns, and do not believe that hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory. but not even ronda fleming and stewart granger can help this 1957 movie which carries nearly all the trite characteristics of westerns of the reformed gunfighter turned good guy. fallen but virtuous woman, bigoted townspeople who must turn to gunfighter for salvation, etc. i can't help but notice the last names of the writer and young "actor" who plays granger's son. any nepotism there? i've seen better acting in high school plays. chill wills plays a cartoon characterization of chill wills. have i reached the 1000 words yet?
