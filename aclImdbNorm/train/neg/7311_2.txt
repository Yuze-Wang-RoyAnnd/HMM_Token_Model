okay i had heard little about this film, so when it came on the movie channels on tv, i wanted to watch it, being a horror aficionado. i think i can do a collective "huh?" for everyone who watched it.<br /><br />i decided to move on with my life, but at a party with my closest friends, we saw it was coming on and some of us having seen it already decided we could laugh our way through it, both of us proclaiming "this is the dumbest thing i've ever seen". it wasn't scary; ill give it to roth (who i think is a young hack); characters do change throughout the film, ala "cube".<br /><br />however despite your typical "rats in a cage" scenario- who will turn on who, etc., it was pretty average horror.<br /><br />a few points: 1.) what was with that kid? i'm not even talking about him being weird and biting people. i'm talking about the whole "slow motion karate kicking", what was that? 2.) okay i know rider's character liked jordan ladd's, but as a young woman, i was appalled that he just went ahead and molested her in her sleep. uh, thats illegal.<br /><br />3.) roth was in the movie just so roth could be in the movie. talk about pointlessly writing yourself in! 4.) what was with the deputy? 5.) so she was just instantly pulled apart by the dog? and there was little to no blood left? just a scrap of her jeans? anyway we were laughing our asses off, and i love laughing during horror movies (return of the living dead 2, evil dead), but i don't know if we were supposed to be laughing here...
