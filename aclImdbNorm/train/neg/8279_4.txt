this movie had all the elements to be a smart, sparkling comedy, but for some reason it took the dumbass route. perhaps it didn't really know who its audience was: but it's hardly a man's movie given the cast and plot, yet is too slapstick and dumb-blonde to appeal fully to women.<br /><br />if you have seen legally blonde and its sequel, then this is like the bewilderingly awful sequel. great actors such as luke wilson should expect better material. jessica simpson could also have managed so much more. rachael leigh cook and penelope anne miller languish in supporting roles that are silly rather than amusing.<br /><br />many things in this movie were paint-by-numbers, the various uber-clich'e montages, the last minute "misunderstanding", even the kids' party chaos. this just suggests lazy scriptwriting.<br /><br />it should be possible to find this movie enjoyable if you don't take it seriously, but it's such a glaring could-do-better than you'll likely feel frustrated and increasingly disappointed as the scenes roll past.
