when the remake of when a stranger calls was out, obviously i was interested in watching the original. then when i read about the original (which i recall had my sisters totally freaked out back in the day) i saw that the real money is on black christmas, which apparently beat everyone to the "the caller is in the house" punch. so i netflix that, and it sits at the top of my list for months due to its "very long wait." all this time i am getting more and more eager to see it! then one day, out of the blue, it finally arrives! ...and it's a total snore.<br /><br />sure, maybe i had elevated expectations, but i don't think it would have gained more had i seen it fresh. the thing is it's christmas in some canadian college town, and there's this sorority having a party. we see some killer-pov shots as he climbs this trellis and sneaks into the attic. so we know he's in the house. then we're introduced to our characters
