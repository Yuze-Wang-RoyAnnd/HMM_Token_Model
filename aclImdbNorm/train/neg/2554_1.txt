honestly i am not even joking when i say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen! this film dosen't have a single ounce of originality in its flimsy dialog or its blatantly plagiarized story line. i can not even begin to count the number of things in this film that are obviously ripped off from "the omen" and other movies like it. for example the nanny "lucy" in this film is actually one of the devil's minions sent to guide and protect the spawn of satan.....does this sound a lot like mrs. baylock to anyone else. another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted, just like in "the omen". however luckily one priest survived the blaze and escaped with sever burns all over his body....yet another coincidence?????? and to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of jesus all over the walls, much like the priest in "the omen" having pages of the bible plastered on the walls like wall-paper. please don't even get me started drawing comparisons between the ending of this movie and "the omen" for you because as i've stated above there are far too many to mention here.
