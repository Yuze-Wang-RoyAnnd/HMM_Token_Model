it's nothing more than a weird coincidence that i decided to watch starlift on the 59th anniversary of the day in june 1950 when president truman's ordered us forces into the korean war. starlift, you see, is set largely at travis air force base in california in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being shipped out to fight in korea. but you'd need to do your own research to know this because not once during the film is the name 'korea' mentioned. we see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but there's no mention of where these men will be fighting or getting injured. which is kind of weird for a film designed to wave the flag and salute america's men in uniform. released in december 1951 by warner brothers, starlift is a very obvious effort to replicate the success of the studio's star-studded world war two home-front morale booster "hollywood canteen." this 1944 crowd-pleaser told the story of two soldiers spending their last three nights of leave hanging out at the famous armed forces nightclub in la hoping to get a date with joan leslie. but really it was just an excuse for warners to trot out every star under contract, from joan crawford, john garfield, and barbara stanwyck to peter lorre, bette davis, sydney greenstreet and more. starlift features two air force soldiers hoping to meet fictional starlet nell wayne (a mask-like janice rule) and persuading a bunch of warner bros stars to put on a show for the departing troops. but in place of crawford, garfield et al the best the brothers warner could scrape up in 1951 were doris day, ruth roman, gordon macrae, virginia mayo, gene nelson and phil harris with fleeting appearances by james cagney, randolph scott, and a clearly embarrassed looking gary cooper. this threadbare cast, whose combined star power would struggle to illuminate a standard lamp, is perfectly matched by the crummy production values. presumably in an effort to save money several long scenes were shot using really really bad back projection. how bad is it? you can see the join where the screen meets the floor of the soundstage! to describe starlift as a sloppy, lazy and third rate movie is to do a disservice to films which are sloppy, lazy and third rate. it's just terrible. avoid it.
