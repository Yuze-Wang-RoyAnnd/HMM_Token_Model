some here have commented that this is the worst elvis movie ever made. well, they are only partly right. for me, this is the worst movie ever made period! i have never seen anything so basely crude, and insulting, and vile, and against human nature as this film. a true embarrassment to the motion picture industry, this isn't even so bad, its good. there is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of elvis' other bad movies like clambake. this one is so rotten to sit through its painful. pure garbage. native americans should sue for their poor clich'ed and stereotypical treatment here. actually, perhaps all human beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as a whole 0 stars, seriously. grade: f
