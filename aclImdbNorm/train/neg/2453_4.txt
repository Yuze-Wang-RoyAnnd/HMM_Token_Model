i might have given this movie a higher rating before peter jackson's trilogy came out, but seeing the two of them side by side there is simply no comparison. the pace of this movie is rushed, many important scenes from the book are left out, and there is little character development. the animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted over, which i found distracting. and the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks off in the middle of the story and was never finished. there are some good points- the battle scenes are exciting to watch, and the dialogue follows the book pretty much to the letter. watch this one if you're in a hurry and can't spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy. but if you haven't read the book you'll probably be confused, because there is a lot missing from this version. 4 out of 10.
