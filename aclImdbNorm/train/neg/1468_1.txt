wonderful cast wasted on worthless script. ten or so adults reunite at the summer camp they attended as juveniles. could this ever happen in a million years? it's simply a fantasy, and a boring one at that. do they become teenagers again? do they reenact their pranks, games, good times? they may try but ultimately the answer is: no. is there any intrigue? any suspense? horror? comedy? none of the above. how anyone can be entertained by this drivel is beyond me. i wanted to like this movie; i tried to like this movie, but my brain refused.
