the beginning of this movie was good. it started to get really dumb after he told the people he wanted to kill himself. i think if i came from a little town like that i would be offended after seeing this movie. they made a lot of these people look dumb and crazy. how could these people have so little to do that they follow him around all day. a lot of times these people were telling him ways to kill himself like they were urging him to do it. how can so many people have little respect for other people? i also think they could have made a much better ending for this movie. there were some good parts to this movie also. some people might like it, but i wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
