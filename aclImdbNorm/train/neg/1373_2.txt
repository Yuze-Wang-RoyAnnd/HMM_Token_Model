this was one of the worst films i have ever seen.<br /><br />i usually praise any film for some aspect of its production, but the intensely irritating behaviour of more than half the characters made it hard for me to appreciate any part of this film.<br /><br />most common was the inference that the bloke who designed the building was at fault an avalanche collapsing it. er ok.<br /><br />also, trying to out ski an avalanche slalom style is not gonna work. running 10 feet into some trees is not gonna work. alas it does here. as mentioned before the innate dumbness and sheer stupidity of some characters is ridiculous. in an enclosed space, with limited oxygen a four year old could tell you starting a fire is not a good idea.<br /><br />anyway, about 5 minutes of the movie redeems itself and acquires some appreciation. however, if you have a modicum of intelligence you too will find most of this film hard to tolerate.<br /><br />it pains me that so many quality stories go unproduced and yet someone will pay for things like this to be made.<br /><br />oh, did i mention the last five minutes? well to give you a hook you have to keep watching in order to see the latest in combative avalanche techniques. absolutely priceless.
