i watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare. and i have to say, it did not deserve it.<br /><br />parinda was so hyped, that i was really looking forward to watch it.<br /><br />parinda is one of those movies which fail to satisfy the standards set by other good indian film-makers, despite having a great story. it was even more pathetic to know, that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic "on the waterfront".<br /><br />anil kapoor was irritating, especially when he comes from america. the direction lacked quality many a times, except a few in-between scenes.<br /><br />give this script to any of them - ram gopal verma, deepa mehta, mahesh bhatt, sudhir mishra, and i'm 100% sure, they'll make a mind-blowing movie out of it.<br /><br />i'm not saying parinda was bad. it was just not good enough.
