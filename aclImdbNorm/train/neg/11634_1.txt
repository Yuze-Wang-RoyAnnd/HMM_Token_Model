i saw this movie at the edmonton international film festival, with the great dr. uwe boll in attendance.<br /><br />the film is, simply put, very, very bad. and no, not in the usual uwe boll "so bad it's actually entertaining" way, but just plain bad. the plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life (because of a past criminal record, apparently), can't get a job, and with an awful 900 pound cheating wife. this man turns to his cult-leader uncle in a plan to steal a truck load of toys that contain the bird flu virus. al qaeda also has designs on stealing the toys, and what follows is just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence.<br /><br />the acting is awful (except for dave foley, who really tries, despite it all), the jokes never rise above children being shot in the chest in slow motion, and people taking a poo. it's supposed to be satire, but i'm not sure of what.<br /><br />think "airplane!", but done by the creators of south park, and without any jokes.
