this is not really a proper review since i did not see most of the film. i stopped watching it. the film is very violent, with nasty drug dealers and street punks, but that is not why i stopped watching.<br /><br />here was the problem: i watched just enough to be introduced to several characters, all of whom were not interesting. everyone was a tedious, despicable psychopath, with no engaging personalities, giving me nothing to look forward to. i found myself not the least bit curious about what they would do next or what might happen to them.<br /><br />if there had been even one person of interest, and i don't mean good or nice person, i mean an interesting person, i could have stayed with it. watch "state of grace" to see what i mean. in that film the gary oldman character is a complete lunatic, but he is *very* interesting. al pacino perhaps did a good job in scarface, but his character just did not engage me.
