most book adaptations are bad but this film left out key parts of the storyline and changed the description and some characters. they rewired the storyline and combined scenes and changed the order. they added ridiculous things into it that never happened in the book and would never happen.<br /><br />if i hadn't read the book beforehand it would have been an incredibly dull film, it didn't make you care about the characters, like them or dislike them. it turns the characters into jokes.<br /><br />awful.<br /><br />ridiculous.<br /><br />waste of two hours of my life.
