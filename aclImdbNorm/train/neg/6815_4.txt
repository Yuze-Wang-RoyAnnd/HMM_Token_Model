the eight jean rollin film i have watched is also possibly the weirdest; the intriguing plot (such as it is) seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim 84 minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along! a would-be female vampire (scantily-clad, as promised by the title) is held in captivity inside a remote ch^ateau and emerges only to 'feast' on the blood of willing victims (who are apparently members of a suicide club) as if unsure where all of this would lead him, the writer-director ultimately has the human villain
