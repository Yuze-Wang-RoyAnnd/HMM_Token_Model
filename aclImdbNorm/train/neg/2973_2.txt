i have two very major complaints regarding this film.<br /><br />1. that my local rental store shelved what is very clearly a soft core porn in the "suspense" category. (had i known what it was, i would not have wasted my time renting it in the first place. and yes, this movie is a soft core porn.)<br /><br />2. the title has nothing to do with the movie. no one in this movie does anything that is either deviant or obsessive, let alone a combination of the two.<br /><br />actually, make that three major complaints:<br /><br />3. that i for some reason watched the movie long enough to discover point number two on this list. boy do i regret that. stay away from this movie. learn from my mistake. this movie is valueless on virtually every level.
