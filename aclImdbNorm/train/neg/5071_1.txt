i can't even believe that this show lasted as long as it did. i guess it's all part of the dumbing down of america. personally, like david spade said, i liked this show better when it went by its original title - "seinfeld". what bothers me the most about this show, aside from the obvious, base sense of "humor", and general smuttiness, is the pretentious way the episodes are titled. truly great shows are still funny after many, repeated viewings, like, "the one where rob gets accidentally hypnotized", on the "dick van dyke show", or "the one where lucy and ethel work at the candy factory." in other words, it's an honor bestowed upon great programs by the viewers. that the writers and producers of "friends" would have the unmitigated hubris to actually title the episodes, themselves, in such a fashion, before anyone's even had a chance to even see it a second time, speaks to not only the mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of said writers, but, also, of the stultified minds of their viewers.<br /><br />you read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a hallmark card-like neverland, full of greeting card sentiment. the true meaning of friendship? i want to be a friend? i want to live in manhattan? wake up. these people are supposed to be working in coffee shops and looking for work as actors, but they somehow manage to live in $4000/mo. apartments? get real. all i have to say to those amongst us that want to move to manhattan and live the idyllic new york life with your rosses and monicas, good luck with all of that. that new york doesn't exist for anyone making less than a serious six-figure income. but, good luck with all of that, anyway. now, shut-up and pass the soma.
