i really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but, wow, did it turn corny, or should i say, "just plain stupid." this is just another example of outdated humor. it might have been funny in 1940, but not now....not even close.<br /><br />dick powell is always interesting to watch. i especially liked him once he started switching from his boyish looks and high voice of the busby berkeley musicals to where he's mature and sounds it, too.<br /><br />he was fine as "jimmy macdonald," but the rest of the cast just played stupid characters, the worst being the boss (raymond walburn) of the maxford house coffee company, who did nothing but shout all the time. he was brutal to hear and was a big detriment to the movie.
