this is a review of the wizard, not to be confused with the wiz, or mr. wizard. the wizard is a late-eighties film about a seriously silent boy's ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits. the wiz is an unnecessary update of the wizard of oz, and mr. wizard is that guy that attached 100 straws together and had some kid drink tang out of it.<br /><br />now that we've gotten all that out of the way, let me say this: there's really no reason to see this movie. it's simply a 100 minute nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the powerglove, the legend of zelda and super mario brothers 3. i use the word "designed" in the loosest sense possible, because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team of people who had never played nintendo, and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother. maybe if the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together, they'd realize that they were about to film total rubbish and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereos.<br /><br />i hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you. it sure hasn't been for me. in fact, i think i might have lost a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it. next time you're at the video store and you see the the wiz, the wizard and the wizard of oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row, give them all a miss and play duck hunt instead.
