caught this movie on the tube on a sunday. i thought it was so bad i looked it up on imdb to see what others thought of it. i was not surprised at the amount of silly people who enjoyed this fluff. i was however surprised when i looked into the comments to read the hated it categories only to find that their were none. i was shocked at this; i always look at the hated it's as their are always those who hate a movie no matter how good it is. somehow this movie made it through unscathed by the haters i say nay to that and proclaim proudly that i hate this movie! i know i should go into detail about why i hate this movie but to do so would only grant this movie more respect than it deserves.
