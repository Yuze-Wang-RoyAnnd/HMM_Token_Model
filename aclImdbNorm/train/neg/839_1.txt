the only redeeming part of this movie was the price i paid. at least all i lost was $3.00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb. the crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat. when the female lead and the fbi guy went to the alleged killers location, mr. fbi handed the female a revolver. when the alleged killer came out the door, the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic. one is left to ponder would an fbp agent hand a weapon to a civilian? i think not. ms. xavier appears to be a very attractive female. it is too bad the r rating did not allow much of her to be seen. it would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out.
