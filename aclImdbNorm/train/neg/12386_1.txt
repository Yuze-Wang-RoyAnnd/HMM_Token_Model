it is hard to make an unbiased judgment on a film like this that had such an impact on me at such a young age. this is with out a doubt the worst kind of exploitation film. i was unfortunate enough to see this film for the first time in my youth, iwill never forget it. i thought it was the most horrible movie ever made. i then saw it again earlier this year and was once again horrified.<br /><br />i am not a zealot or one to say what others should and should not see but i did take great offense to the way in which something as horrible as rape was dealt with in this movie. i love lowbrow cinema but this is just plain nasty. rent some rus myer instead.
