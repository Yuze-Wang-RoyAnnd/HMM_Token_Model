weak plot, unlikely car malfunction, and helpless fumbling characters. at first i thought this movie was made during the seventies, since the picture quality, as well as the storyline and drama seemed taken from an old kojac episode. when i checked and found that it was really made as late as -97 i was astonished. this is by far one of the worst and least (thriller) movies i have ever seen.<br /><br />if you read this, be advised, if you see it you waste time when you could have done something more exciting, like watching paint dry.
