all of the x-men movies were great. and i mean all of them, including the long hated x-men 3. they had solid characters (magneto and xavier were the best ones, in my opinion), and a good story arch.<br /><br />i was all excited when i heard this movie was on production, and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until i saw the movie. i was so disappointed.<br /><br />hugh jackman is not a bad actor (his best movie is the fountain, although you won't hear about this movie when they talk about the actor), and his acting is not what screws the movie up.<br /><br />the whole film is plagued with lots of meaningless characters that add nothing to the plot (like blob or gambit), which were tossed there to make fans believe that the film makers had read the original comics.<br /><br />i am a fan of xmen, i have read many, many of their stories and this movie respected none of them. none. not even the continuity. it doesn't respect weapon x project, or the relationship between wolverine and sabretooth, or emma frost, the motivations for wolverine are plain stupid and seen in millions of movies: revenge for the death of a loved one.<br /><br />oh. what i was expecting the whole darn movie was a berseker moment for wolverine similar to the one he has in x2 in the school when stryker men come in and he alone decimates the enemy forces, but hey, this is fox, this a family flick and you will not see explicit violence from the most violent and gruesome marvel hero.<br /><br />besides, i had a feeling of constant dej'a v`u with this movie because wolverine's origins are already explained in x2, we already know how he got his adamantium skeleton so it kind of does not make sense to make a movie of something we already know.<br /><br />i personally believe that wolverine is one of those few characters that does not need a solid back-story because mystery is the nature of the character. do we really want to know how the joker got his scars?
