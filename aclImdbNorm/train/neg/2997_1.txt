this was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 re-make of conan doyle's famous novel 'the lost world'. and it shows.<br /><br />the film starts promisingly enough, with a ruthless organization intending to exploit the lost world and challenger et al returning to defend the prehistoric plateau, but then things go downhill. everybody is stranded on the plateau and we're left with a feeble, boring, over-length rehash of the first film.<br /><br />the dinosaurs (who are hardly ever seen) are just laughable. are we expected to take that cuddly toy that's supposed to be an ankylosaur seriously? and the tyrannosaur seems rooted to the spot.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and get hold of the 1925 silent version of the lost world. unbelievably in this age of cgi and other advanced effects, the twenties version is the best and will remain so until somebody finally decides to do a decent re-make.
