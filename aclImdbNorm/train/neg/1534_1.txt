from the blocky digitised footage to the acting that makes keanu "i'm so wooden i could be a plank me" reeves look like an oscar winner this film bites (pun not intended). the best thing about it is the box of eraticate in the 2nd segment (which out of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and 'twist'). wish i'd spent the lb3.99 it cost me on something else, like erm.... natural born killers: directors cut. if you do buy this, you're really in for a disappointment, do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague. if you're looking for something amateurish and with actors that are more wooden than a 2x4 then go ahead. however if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere, like dog soldiers, wolfen, romasanta:the werewolf hunt.
