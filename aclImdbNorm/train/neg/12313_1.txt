this may or may not be the worst movie that steve martin has ever made, but it certainly was far from his best. obviously, he did this crap for the pay check. dreck like this certainly does nothing to enhance his reputation as a funny man. what he doesn't seem to grasp is that when people go to see a steve martin movie, they expect to be entertained, not bored to tears. it's sad that he dragged dan aykroyd and phil hartman down with him. i don't understand why talented people can't get a grip on the fact that people don't want to see them in lousy movies. if you're going to call a movie a comedy, then it should be funny. this wasn't. shame on the us military for allowing itself to be associated with this pabulum, too. full metal jacket had more laughs than this miserable excuse for a "service comedy." surely, phil silvers is rolling over in his grave.
