i haven't seen anything this bad since i walked out of the james bond movie "moonraker" twenty years ago. i managed to sit through the entirety of this one only because of tilda swinton, but there was nothing she could do to save this beast.<br /><br />as a cross between "pi", "orlando", and "tron", this movie failed miserably in every aspect of moviemaking. the characters were cardboard and unable to evoke any kind of sympathy. the plot was wholly unbelievable. the acting was, with the exception of swinton, amateur. the computer graphics were worse than in "tron." timothy leary was extremely annoying. i could go on, but what's the point.<br /><br />the only good thing i can say about this film is that tilda swinton was in it. i have no idea why an actress of her caliber consented to appear in such a dud, but she most likely regrets it now.<br /><br />don't waste your money or your time on this stinker. there's nothing worth seeing here.
