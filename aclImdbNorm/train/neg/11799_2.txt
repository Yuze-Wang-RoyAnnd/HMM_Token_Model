this could have been a good episode but i simply had to turn it off. the british representation was horrible to watch. have the makers ever set foot in britain prior to filming? at least set foot in england?? i don't think any british person have had such an accent apart from a comedy skit of the royal family! also with the 2 english boys... well i don't think any english boy has acted, spoke or dressed like any english kid in the history of the british nation since prince william and harry's preteen public appearances. to american film makers.. there is more than 1 country in the uk. england, wales, scotland and northern ireland.. meaning more than 1 culture! i can handle some stereotyping but this was so bad i could not watch it. fire looked cool though!
