oh god,what an idiotic movie!incredibly cheap with fake special effects(the creature is played by one guy in lame costume)and stupid plot.all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors(ha!ha!ha!)...they're simply ludicrous.for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk(these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more).all in all,this is a great entertainment if you're drunk.avoid it like the plague.am i drunk?i don't think so...
