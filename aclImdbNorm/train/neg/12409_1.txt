and that comes from someone that will withstand almost any viewing. the acting and sound is awful. this might qualify for a "so bad it's good" point of merit,,,for some. however i take my horror movies seriously and this is just crap-it's just soooo cheap, i think that's my major complaint. the dialogue is often hilarious-attention to how many times "you startled me" is used. the "child" actress is seriously god awful-i pray her acting career ended here..her line "donuts! i hate donuts" is worth repeated viewing however.
