this movie made me feel as if i had missed some important scenes from the very beginning. there were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started. i was very disappointed because i love whoopi goldberg & danny glover, in addition to that have always trusted & respected danny glovers taste in his choice of roles, "grand canyon" for example. i just could not finish this movie, after what seemed an eternity, but was probably just a little over an hour; we had to turn it off. there was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them, there was no evoking of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited, confusing, and unnecessary. what could have been a great idea for a movie, even as a drama & not a comedy (although i think a comedy in this situation would have been better, because i love to watch white people freak out & start acting like complete idiots, it makes me laugh) became a waste of my $1 credit at the video store.
