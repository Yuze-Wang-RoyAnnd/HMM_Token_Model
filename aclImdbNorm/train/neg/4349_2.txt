this movie is terrible. carlitos way(1993) is a great film. goodgfellas it isn't but its one of the better crime films done. this movie should be considered closer to the sting part2 or maybe speed zone. remember those gems! the only reason this movie was made was to capitalize on the cult following of the original. this movie lacked everything de palma, pacino and penn worked so hard on. there wasn't a likable character and that is the fault of everyone responsible for making it. i hope rise to power wins every razzie it possibly can and maybe even invent some new categories to allow it be a record holder. after i watched this s@*t fest movie, i sat down and watched the original carlitos way to get th bad taste out of my mouth. after watching this i wish pachanga came and whacked me out of my misery.
