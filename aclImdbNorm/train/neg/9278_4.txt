the fact that i watched this entire movie says something about it...or me. it is not a good movie. terrible in fact. but terrible in the way that kept my attention in that perverse manner that is akin to watching a tragedy and not being able to look away. it would have made a great mst3k subject!<br /><br />most of the things that make a terrible movie enjoyable are here: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, contrived plot sequences, ridiculous pseudoscience. you'll thrill to slo-mo death sequences, the poor victims with mouths agape and waaaaaaaay too much time to contemplate their impending doom, facing the outrageously contrived deliverer of their deaths. your heart will be warmed by old action scene cliches like when two women struggle for a gun and it goes off, but who's shot? both look at themselves, then the other, then themselves, then (seemingly 15 minutes later), one finally goes down. you'll sing along (in latin of course) with the street carolers that turn into a ghastly death's-choir that, for a moment, threatened to turn the movie into a twisted musical.<br /><br />so if you believe like i do that as movies get worse they get better, then this might be a decent choice for you. it's not as funny as my current sci-fi schlock favorite, "they live" featuring rowdy roddy piper, but it's more fun to watch than luke-warm movies like omen ii or iii.<br /><br />i give it 4 out of 10.
