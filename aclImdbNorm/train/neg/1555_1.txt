when i decided to watch the barbarians, starring those twin bodybuilders, peter and david paul, i thought it couldn't be that bad because the film was directed by ruggero deodato, who has a reputation for creating sleazy movies but well made sleazy movies. well, the barbarians is remarkably trashy action/adventure movie that wants to be another conan the barbarian, and fails at every level. the look of the film is all wrong. some scenes were well shot but the tone and the schintzy, tacky "disco" look of the clothes and hair people are adorned with just doesn't make any sense whatsoever, even for a low budget flick like this one.<br /><br />richard lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairdo and costume. he's supposed to be menacing but he comes across as a buffoon. and it's funny to see eva larue callahan, one of the stars of all my children, appear in her first movie, walking around in skimpy fur bikini. i'm sure she wants this dreck to disappear from the face of the earth! the so-called barbarian twins are okay as the muscle bound heroes but it's almost impossible to construct a proper critique of their acting because their roles are, like everything else in this mess, really ill-conceived. the only way the film tries to differentiate one twin from the other is by having one twin wear a loincloth that covers his ass, while the other twin's loincloth barely covers his muscular butt. i'm not kidding! don't ask me who's who though.<br /><br />deodato must have been really desperate to agree to make this film. and his desperation is reflected perfectly in this trashy flick. it's just bad.
