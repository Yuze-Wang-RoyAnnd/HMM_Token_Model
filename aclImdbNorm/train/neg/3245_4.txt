david mamet's film debut has been hailed by many as a real thinking-man's movie, a movie that makes you question everybody and everything. i saw it for the first time recently and couldn't understand what was supposed to be so great about it.<br /><br />the movie is about a female psychologist named margaret who is also a best-selling author. margaret has become disillusioned by her profession and her inability to really help anyone. she tries to rectify this by helping settle her patient's gambling debt to a shark named mike (played by joe mantegna, who is the only reason to watch this film). she discovers that mike is actually a professional confidence man when she nearly falls victim to a scam he pulls immediately after meeting her. intrigued, she returns to see him and asks him to show her how con artists operate (she plans on using this as the subject of a new psychology book). she then falls for him and accompanies him on a long con that he and his associates have set up.<br /><br />i don't feel like going into details, but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were an elaborate con by mike and his cronies to swindle margaret out of $80,000.<br /><br />first of all, the big twist towards the end was very predictable. any scene where the con men were operating was made very obvious by the stagey acting and weird line reads. not only that, but the audience (and the main character) knows that they're dealing with con men, so is it really such a big surprise when we find out that margaret has herself been conned? besides, margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who is an expert at reading people, yet she allows herself to be duped far too easily -- and keep in mind, she knows full well that mike is a con artist.<br /><br />secondly, we are led to believe that margaret was conned from the very beginning, yet in order for the con to ultimately work, she had to do several things that the con men couldn't possibly have predicted that she would do. first, she had to decide to help settle her patient's debt, allowing her to meet the con men in the first place. if she hadn't done this, the entire con would have failed. i just have to say that it's pretty unreasonable to assume that a psychologist is going to take it upon herself to settle a patient's gambling debt. not only that, but what are the odds that the con men would be at the right spot on the very night she decided to show up? did they simply show up at that bar every night, hoping she would come and see them? another thing that had to happen that couldn't have been predicted is that margaret had to return to see mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade. what are the odds of this happening? and yet the whole con is based on this premise.<br /><br />another problem i had is with the ending. margaret finds out she's been conned and decides to get revenge on mike. at first, mamet leads us to believe that she's going to con the con, but that falls through, so the ultimate ending is her gunning mike down in an airport baggage area. somehow that just felt like a clumsy and inept way to end a movie about con artists plying their trade. not only that, but she didn't even take back the money he stole from her.<br /><br />ultimately, the movie leaves you feeling empty and unfulfilled. and if you, like me, predicted ahead of time that margaret was going to be conned, you will find this revelation just as unsatisfying.
