there have been some low moments in my life, when i have been bewildered and depressed. sitting through rancid aluminium was one of these.<br /><br />the warning signs were there. no premiere (even the stars didn't want to attend) and no reviews in magazines. the only reason i sat through the film was in the hope that i might catch up on some sleep.<br /><br />nothing in the film was explained. the narration was idiotic. i cheered at one point when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot, then to my growing despair, it was revealed that he hadn't really been shot dampening my joy. i sincerely hope all involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity. <br /><br />there were some positive aspects, mainly unintentional moments of humour. for example, the scene in which the main character, for some unknown reason feels the need to relieve himself manually in a toilet cubicle, while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his ears.<br /><br />my words cannot explain the anger i feel, so i shall conclude thus.<br /><br />rancid aluminium: for sadists, wastrels, and regressives only who want to torture themselves.
