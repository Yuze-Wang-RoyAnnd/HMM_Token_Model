generally over rated movie which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialog and of course dean martin songs. problem is nicholas cage, there is no chemistry between he and cher and they are the central love story. cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to cage's shifting accent and out of control body language. cage simply never settles into his role. he tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that's what's needed in a love story. cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a jimmy stewart type character. cage keeps taking these roles, perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesn't lend itself to them, though he's gotten better at it with repeated attempts. he should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self.
