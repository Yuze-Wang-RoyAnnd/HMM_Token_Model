this movie was probably the biggest waste of my life ever. the acting was pathetic. jordan hinson could not show any upset emotions. at the beginning of the movie, she was supposed to be discouraged. instead, she bobbed her head with her bottom lip stuck out. she sobbed pitifully without any tears for the crying scene. i was almost angry that out of all girls who wanted to be actresses, they had to pluck out her. everyone else was suffering from over-acting as well. it was flat out annoying. it was also an insult to figure skaters. jordan took a month to train, and they cast her as a person who makes the olympic team. it's practically spitting on the effort real figure skaters put into their work. a pitiful excuse for a movie, and a pitiful attempt to associate hockey and skating. don't waste your life. it doesn't even deserve one star.
