i saw this when it was in the theater, it started out so strong i mean back in 1980 this was a bold movie and the special effects were excellent at the time. now you would have to of been at least 30 or so in 1980 to really understand this point because studying film historically misses the mind set at the time the expectations, and other related psychological factors. now as i said the movie was engaging suspenseful and very entertaining. it builds to an excellent climax then.... it ends i mean the person that described it as having a water balloon break in your hand before throwing it, besides being a very poetic description. in my experience, it was just not strong enough. my wife and i were well... how can i say this? we were upset, i mean we paid money, invested the time to watch the movie which was excellent. "we both felt we were robbed with an ending that convinced us both the production company must of run out of money and could not raise enough to finish it correctly. in fact my wife said it best, it did not end, it just stopped!
