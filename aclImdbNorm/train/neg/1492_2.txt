rented a batch of films from blockbuster last night, and this was the first one i watched (it was late on a saturday night, wanted a "horror film fix")...<br /><br />wow, this was awful, almost embarrassingly so... stupid slasher-type story i really thought films like scream had put an end to; amateur actors delivering clich'ed' and insipid dialogue that is hard to believe was actually typed and read off a page; and gore scenes that are nothing to get excited about (especially when occurring in a film this poorly scripted).<br /><br />but i've always believed no film is 100% percent totally worthless. here's the few good things i can say about this mess: <br /><br />#1 bobbie phillips: love this actress. she's the only member of the cast who displays any acting talent whatsoever. the only reason i took a chance on renting this is because her name was on the front cover. she acquits her presence in this dreck with professionalism, even though she looks bemused at times that she's acting in such a moronic story.<br /><br />#2 unintentional hilarity: this is the kind of film i can remember seeing back when there were still grind house theaters around the country and they used to include crap like this as the third movie on a triple-bill with some prestige thriller movie that was finally making it's way to the hinterlands. unfortunately, in this direct-to-video age, most viewers have to endure these turkeys alone now without the communal experience of being part of an audience jeering and throwing stuff at the screen because the film is so terrible. which leads to--<br /><br />#3 porn stars trying to act!: mostly on hand because the producers don't need to cajole or plead with them to disrobe for extended sex scenes, but this trade-off usually means they actually get to speak some lines that are supposed to advance a story (other than "ooh yeah baby", or "harder!"). and, proudly, they all deliver expertly at looking foolish when trying to act. i'd almost exclude ginger lynn allen from this group if her character wasn't supposed to be an irish mom and she's actually attempting at times to do an accent, which just keeps the smiles coming.<br /><br />it's nice to look for the positive in all experiences, and that's what i took from this cesspool a.k.a "evil breed"
