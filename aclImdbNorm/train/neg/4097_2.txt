the bad news is it's still really dreadful. i gave it a 2 because occasionally some of this kitchy slapstick parody actually seems funny.<br /><br />it's supposed to be better than "mulva, zombie ass kicker", and progress should be rewarded. or maybe i was drinking heavily when i watched it and felt generous. whatever, "2" it is.<br /><br />maybe the best thing about this movie is that it's over pretty quick. it takes elements from most of kill bill i & ii's key themes and fight scenes, hacks them up, dumbs them way down, dirties up the dialog, and squishes the whole mess into about an hour of truly awful amateur video.<br /><br />you'd best smoke a lot of something powerful if you want to enjoy this one. and get this dvd back to the video store on time! you'll really hate yourself if you have to pay a late fee.
