for a made-for-tv "horror" movie the movie started off very interesting. i was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the film. but the ending was a total dissappointment. the movie was going along fast-paced and was building up to, it seemed like anyway, to a very climatic end. but guess what there is no end. the movie is just over and after almost one-and-a-half hours the audience is just left wondering what happened. why were all the unanswered questions in the film left unanswered. there was no explanation at all about any of the key points in the plot. this film is like watching a murder mystery and then never finding out who did it. very dissappointed. this film looks like the producers just ran out of money and never completed the film. a real bomb!
