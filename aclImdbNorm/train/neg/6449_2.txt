imagine the big chill with a cast of twenty-somethings whose characters are all unlikable, and an iguana-like man-lizard chasing them around and you have an idea of the foolishness herein. on the positive side, the movie does not skimp on showing the monster. there's no peek-a-boo shots, or nighttime scenes where you have to imagine what he looks like; he's right out there folks. unfortunately, the design and construction aren't that inspired. a little bit of mystery might have helped. mind you, i've seen far worse, but if you're going to have him out on full display for a lot of the flick, your monster better look damn good. <br /><br />spoiler ahead!!!<br /><br />oh, and there's a twist ending involving the supposedly dead brother that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. this came as no surprise given the shoddy writing of the script. as for the acting; well let's just say it wasn't painfully bad, but i don't expect we'll be seeing many of these kids in future cinematic outings.<br /><br />gore quotient: 2 out of 5; nudity quotient: 1 out of 5; intelligence quotient: negligible
