i grew up watching inspector gadget. it was, and still is, one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. i learned a lot of geography and history from the spin-off inspector gadget's field trip. i wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective ever.<br /><br />but the film has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon.<br /><br />matthew broderick, an actor with potential, was definitely not the role for inspector gadget. first thing- in the film, inspector gadget is smart. not so in the cartoon. in the film, gadget solves the mystery mostly by himself. in the cartoon, it was almost always penny, brain, and the awesome book (i still want her book!). if gadget solved the mystery, it was by accident. gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective, but in the cartoon was pretty dumb, which was where the humor came from.<br /><br />another thing is that it's too much "good guy v. bad guy" in the film. it's not just meant to be a silly saturday morning cartoon. also, gadget never should have a love story, but disney corporation is filled with idiots.<br /><br />also i miss the true gadgets that gadget had, and especially the gadget car. in the movie it was a chic convertible. in the cartoon it was a sedan police car and could turn into a van. it also barely had any gadgets and was mainly there to get him from place to place.<br /><br />but if anything, the one thing that was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature movie. inspector gadget was a silly saturday morning cartoon. the movie was too serious, too overdone, had too much of a plot and wasn't even remotely as funny.<br /><br />tip for those who haven't seen it: never see it. ever. watch the cartoon, it's a true classic.
