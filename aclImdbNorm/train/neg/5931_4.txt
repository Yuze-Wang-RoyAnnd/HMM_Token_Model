this film should have been only 10 minutes. i mean there is really only 10 minute worth of watchable content in this thing (i even hesitate to call it a movie). the opening credits of the film was somehow promising. as the film begins by short comments of the man himself, you really rub your hands and stay tuned for more footage from cohen's life. well, nick cave does a reasonable job covering one of cohen's famous songs. the length of cave's performance makes you even more eager to see more of cohen whose wit and well spoken words have already tickled your fancy. but as it turns out cave's performance is only the start of lengthy super boring performances by literally a bunch of no ones who don't even have a minimal attraction to keep you on your seat. i mean what does the filmmaker really think? five-minute close-up shots of wanna be singers in a fake concert in australia!!! what does the filmmaker really think to insult the audience by adding "fake applause" to these endless nasty performances. the film is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you came to see. there is not a single footage of cohen's past. in fact, except for a few photographs of his early days as a singer/poet there is absolutely nothing! if you add up all the minutes that cohen talks it may not even reach 10 minutes. but these 10 minutes are tortuously presented bit by bit in between disastrous camera-work that captures some of the most unattractive people screaming cohen's lyrics. if you ever decided to waste your money on this film, don't! just throw it in the garbage and at least save your time.
