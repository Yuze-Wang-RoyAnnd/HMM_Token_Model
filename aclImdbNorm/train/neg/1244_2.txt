this is a bit of a first for me, the first time i have ever been disappointed in a tim burton film. pota isn't a bad film (great sets, costumes and the odd great performance) but it could have been made by any off-the-shelf hollywood director. the pacing was very odd, the last third was just spent waiting for the film to end, by myself and the cast. tim roth was excellent, probably the only pleasure in the film. come back tim.
