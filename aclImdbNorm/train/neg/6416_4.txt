some not-so-spoily spoilers ahead<br /><br />why do people, when they are disoriented or sick or scared at a club, cut through the middle of the crowded dance floor on their way to the bathroom? <br /><br />who in their right mind would hide under a bed when someone breaks into their room? <br /><br />how often do you knock on a stranger's door and when they don't immediately answer, you open the door, walk in, shout a few hello's and then start going through their stuff? <br /><br />if you were being pursued by someone you just discovered was a murderer, what would you do? quietly sneak off and hide under a wooden platform or among metal implements? run, quietly of course, to a ratty old barn or other decrepit structure? <br /><br />i could be talking about almost any thriller that's come out in the last few years, but since this is the "the return" page, obviously i'm talking about "the return." i saw it free because i work at a movie theater and make a point of screening all the "scary" movies. i thought this one was tolerable... aside from the well-worn clich'es. sarah michelle gellar is really drab and looks kind of "huh?" through most of the film. the details of the plot are slowly given out as the movie progresses and it's almost enough to make it interesting except there wasn't enough explanation as it moved on and so i was almost lost until the last 2/3 of it.<br /><br />if you're a die-hard thriller fan, it's worth seeing at least once. if there's nothing better at the theater and you really want to watch a movie, eh, i guess it's worth a matin'ee ticket. if you thought the trailer made it look like an interesting movie and you can't wait... wait.
