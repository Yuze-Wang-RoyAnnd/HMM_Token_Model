i had to register for imdb just to post a comment on just how awful this movie is...my cats and a ball of string have a better storyline than this. not the worst acting i've ever seen, but when you wipe out almost the entire cast of the movie within 5 minutes, it leaves a bit to be desired. there wasn't a single 'scare' moment in the movie, with the exception of when they were watching the movie 'halloween' on the tv. all around, it seems like it could've been a good story, rolling the credits and saying that chasey lain was in it was a bit of a loss as i didn't recognize her right away and her scene was already over before i could've said 'oh yeah, there she is'. i'm so glad i saw this in a hotel and didn't pay for it as i'd be real ticked if i had payed a cent to see this. i normally like or can at least find a redeeming factor in a movie, but this one is an exception. it's so bad that it's not even that amusing so-good-it's-bad....it's just plain bad.
