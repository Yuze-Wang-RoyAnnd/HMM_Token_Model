this is a movie which attempts a retelling of thai history, set in the ancient city of ayutthaya. i decided to watch this film because i thought it was along the lines of many thai films i've watched and enjoyed, one that has thai actors speaking thai and martial arts craziness. well, it's none of that. this film is shot entirely in english, is chock full of anglo actors, and has production values so terrible it is laughably bad....but not funny! who can we blame for this rubbish? the acting, dialog, and most of the sets were quite bad. some of the fight scenes looked like they were choreographed by the local high school drama club. the special effects were also mostly bad, but a few were just cheap animation patched onto the screen that provided an especially cheesy effect. it has one large, epic-style outdoor battle scene, where a few thousand extras get to run across a field in costume, but when we see the two armies collide in combat--ha! what a joke! the film does feature a couple of beauties. what a pity they didn't show a little more skin. at least that would have been something for the guys to appreciate. don't bother.
