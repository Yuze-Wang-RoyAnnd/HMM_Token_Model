if an auteur gives himself 2 credits before the main title and about 15 more credits before the movie starts, and the first shot shows the auteur rolling around on a bed in lycra bike shorts, it won't be a surprise to observe that said auteur has the kind of body that should never be seen in spandex. the kind of look that might be useful to a homosexual aversion therapist.<br /><br />others have given this thing the dishing it deserves. for me the most pitiable moment came when the trip from la was signified by a plane landing at what appeared to be lax; and the return was signified by a shot of a fedex cargo plane.
