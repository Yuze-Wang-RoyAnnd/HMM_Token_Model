this film is stale, and misses the mark. it is far off compared to the 89 batman that it tries to coppy. that women singer whats her name can not act, and we see why her film carrier died. notice how this film died in the box office no one see this film on tv either. my uncle and dad were expecting batman, and the films impression is more like cop rock. not worth renting 3/10
