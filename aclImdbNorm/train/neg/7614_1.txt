this may be one of the worst movies to ever make it to production, ever.<br /><br />1. the most exciting part is the beginning, where the guy is walking... and walking... and walking (spoiler). there is about 15 minutes of just walking. how? <br /><br />2. not to mention there's a lot of issues with the lighting, and it's almost like they even shot the night scenes during the day. <br /><br />3. the acting was terrible. it looks like they found a community theater (in mexico)... and then took the people who were turned away.<br /><br />please, for the love of everything holy, don't rent this movie. if you know someone who owns it, apologize to them. the director should be subject to punishment through the war crimes tribunal for foisting this on the public.
