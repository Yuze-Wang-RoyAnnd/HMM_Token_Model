woody allen has lost his ability to write dialogue or characters that are clearly distinguishable from each other. this is the case with "melinda and melinda," where all the characters speak with allen's generic pseudo-sophistication and have problems and points of view that are not relatable to anyone outside of a four block radius of where allen lives. they also share the same curious condition of being able to afford multi-million dollar manhattan apartments that appear to have been designed by professional decorators regardless of their financial situation or what they do for a living.<br /><br />the only character who exists outside of this dull mindset is will ferrel as the obligatory woody allen surrogate. although he does not simply come off as merely doing a woody allen impression (like kenneth branagh in the god-awful "celebrity"), ferrel lacks the charm or charisma that the real woody had when he was playing the part himself in his best movies.<br /><br />the end result is another in a string of self indulgent bores from a once-great filmmaker who has been trading in on his former reputation for years.
