no reason to bother renting this flick. from the opening credits on, i knew i was in trouble.<br /><br />it was filmed as though it was a soft porn movie, but there really isn't anything erotic about it. the look into the world of sex addiction is intriguing, but only to a point.<br /><br />boring sex scenes, bad plot, and cameos by ed begley jr. and rosanna arquette aren't enough to save this film.
