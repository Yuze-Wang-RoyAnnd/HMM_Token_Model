it as absolutely incredible to me that anyone could make the comment that this film is not preachy. it is not only oppressively preachy, but absurd, stagebound, dramatically straight-jacketed, and painfully overwrought. watching it, one feels like an 8 year old child being punished by having to write "i will not become a fascist" on the blackboard 100 times.<br /><br />now i understand that it was made during the height of ww2, and was intended to be a brave condemnation of hitler and the terrible suffering he brought about, (which anyone would whole-heartedly applaud) and i'm sure it accurately captured the mood of the day. but it is presented in such an immature, over-obvious, sledgehammer way, it fails abysmally as a work of art.<br /><br />the only good performances here are from paul lukas, who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic anti-fascist; and lucile watson as the amusingly ill-mannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become. though their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of hardships, the children are ridiculously shown as robotically well-behaved little snips. they do not even remotely resemble real human beings. and bette davis, a great actress, here is so one dimensionally noble i cringed every time she was on screen. her every word, her every gesture is meant to convey how supportive and understanding she is of the sacrifices her husband has to make and the great cause he is fighting for, that she must've been wired to receive a painful electric shock if she dared allowed any hint of doubt or shading to surface in her portrayal.<br /><br />so yes, this is a very important film, just not a very good one.
