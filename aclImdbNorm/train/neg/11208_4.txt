raymond burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend (dick foran) thanks to his affection for his friend's wife (angela lansbury). this was a full year before he started doing perry mason, so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting.<br /><br />there isn't all that much else here that's interesting though. lansbury is always good, but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious. there's an interesting performance by lamont johnson as a painter who's also in love with the "femme fatale", but the burr character is pretty straightforward. it's frankly bizarre to see an actor like burr doing these romantic scenes with lansbury, and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films i've seen him in. there's no mystery at all really, and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that burr's character is setting up the lansbury character to implicate herself (double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder, presumably). he does so with a very large tape recorder which she doesn't notice when she comes into the room i guess.<br /><br />a few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for tv.
