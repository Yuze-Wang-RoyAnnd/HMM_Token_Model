will they ever make movies without nudity and sex? this came on at 3:00 on sunday afternoon and i couldn't believe what they showed. thank god my son was outside or i would have been freaked out if he had seen the soft/medium porn! do people who make movies not care who they offend or corrupt? kids could have been watching after church and that is what they show???!!! the acting was good and i enjoyed the suspense but gee! there was violence and bad guys but that is to be expected in a western movie. randy travis was really good in his role. if the writers, directors and producers would just quit putting on so much uncalled for sex scenes. what has to happen to get them to quit going in that direction? where can i complain?
