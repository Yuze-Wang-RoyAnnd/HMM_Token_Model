this was a really funny movie.<br /><br />every 1 in the movie was trying to be serious that is what made this movie so funny. i mean come on a shark's head on a human body. can it get any funnier. good job sci-fi keep the comedy movies coming. i never thought movies could get anymore retarded. if they keep it up they will have to rename the sci fie channel the comedy sci fi channel or something like that.<br /><br />i cant wait 4 the next blockbuster movie from sci fi.<br /><br />ill be ready with a bowl of popcorn and a case of beer or a bottle of liquor and ill be ready to laugh it up again!!!
