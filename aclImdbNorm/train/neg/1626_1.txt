this film turned up on local tv here in south africa recently and i thought that i'd warn even those who enjoy watching b grade bad movies (which i do)that this is not even amusing. the plot concerns a couple visiting a house in the country. some strangers appear and .... the problem is that most of the film, obviously shot in the early seventies, consists of extreme wide shots of people walking, in real time and awfully slowly, from a to b. this makes the film tedious in the extreme and the expected blood and gore payoff just never happens. i am really curious - how many people have actually watched this from beginning to end?
