pictures that usually glorify a hero have meaning. as an example, bonnie and clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds. why? they were two people caught up in the depression when people were desperate to survive.<br /><br />this film has absolutely no substance. the viggo mortensen character soon emerges as a folk hero. why? he speeds along an idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his stricken wife has been taking. no one bothers to understand why he is trying to flee everyone. even worse, when the realization becomes apparent that he is not a red-neck terrorist, no one in government wants to help him as they try to save their rear ends.<br /><br />jason priestley co-stars as a radio emcee who builds upon the story in support of our hero.<br /><br />the ending is absolutely unbelievable.
