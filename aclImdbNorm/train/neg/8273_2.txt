a lot of promise and nothing more. an all-star cast certainly by hk standards, but man oh man is this one a stinker. no story? that's okay, the action will make up for it like most hk action flicks. what? the action is terrible, corny, and sparse? dragon dynasty's releases up to this point are by and large superb and generally regarded as classics in asian cinema. this is a blight. they managed to wrangle a couple of actors from infernal affairs, but they can't bring life to a disjointed script. there are scenes of dialogue where two or three lines are spoken with a cut in between each and no continuity in what the characters are saying. you almost feel like they're each giving a running monologue and just ignoring the other characters. michael biehn is made of wood, really? sammo hung uses a stunt double? no way. yes way. stay away.
