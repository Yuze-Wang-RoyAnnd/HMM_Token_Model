i have never seen a worse movie.<br /><br />it is possible to take a shootem up video game and make it into a decent movie.<br /><br />mistake 1: absolutely no connection to any of the characters. in this movie you don't bond with any of the characters because... you don't get a chance.<br /><br />the only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is the deck hand: salish as played by clint howard. except for this unique character, the outcome of the movie is meaningless as all the characters were lifeless from the begining.<br /><br />mistake 2: the worst gunfight scene ever. i love gunfights. i love when the heros open up on the badguys and clean house. heck i even like to watch a badguy clean house sometimes. but this gunfight was weird i guess that the best way to describe it is "apathetic" i've seen people shoot with more feeling and emotion while playing the videogame. in this movie it looked and felt like the "actors" were simply walking through shooting everything that moved without emotion.<br /><br />why? where's the trash talking? where's the snarls of rage amongst the gunfire? these are supposed to be kids that got caught at a rave gone bad... but even real soldiers acting professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity.<br /><br />if you want a good horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters, i recomend sam rami's evil dead series. do not see the disaster that is house of the dead. i hope that they burn the master and all copies of this movie.
