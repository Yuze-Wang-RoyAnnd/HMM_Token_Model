omen iv (1991) was a bad made-for-t.v. movie. since the 80's were over, i guess the executives were experimenting in meth (the drug of choice during the 90's) because there is no other reason to explain this travesty. why did they even bother making this? a t.v. movie? what were they mulling over when this one came up on the idea board? did they even think for a second that this movie would catch on as. perhaps they thought it could make it as a series? we'll never know. but i know one thing. this movie was the major reason why i never bought the omen trilogy. they should have knocked off a couple of bucks instead of putting out this "extra" disc.<br /><br />omen iv is basically a average american family remake of the first film. instead of a snot nosed punk kid, we get the spooky girl who's a total brat to everyone around her. if the family had stronger parenting skills, then none of the demonic events that have transpired in the past films would have never occurred. these parents need to put their foot down and do some real discipline! <br /><br />not recommended, best to avoid at all cost!
