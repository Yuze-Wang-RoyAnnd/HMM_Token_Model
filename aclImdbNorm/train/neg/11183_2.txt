"people i know" is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about -- despite the game efforts of a talented cast.<br /><br />pacino delivers his usual tour de force as eli wurman, a past-his-prime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption. but unlike michael corleone, it's impossible to have an emotional investment in this character, his dilemma, or his fate.<br /><br />the film traces eli's preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause, while distracted by a client's (ryan o'neal, good in an underwritten part) latest "dirty laundry" -- in this case, a tv actress companion who's gotten involved with the wrong people. tea leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role, although again, the script doesn't give her much to work with. as eli's sister-in-law, kim basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics.<br /><br />this movie is strictly for those who like watching pacino strut his stuff, and enjoy the other principals. unfortunately, between the script and direction, "people i know" is strictly amateurish. hence its limited theatrical release, and speedy journey to dvd. consider yourself warned.
