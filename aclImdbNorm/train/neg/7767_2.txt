to anyone not familiar with c.s. forrester's book this film should be interesting. it is colorful, well acted and depicts high adventure, but to those of us who know the original stories it is appalling. i could hardly sit through it.<br /><br />for some reason screen-writers seem compelled to rewrite the stories they are working on. of course, the spoken word is different from the written word, and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film. but, why do the screen-writers rewrite the story instead of just adapting it? in this case the writers out-did themselves.<br /><br />just a few examples: there was no mutiny on the renown. the officers did take over the ship after the half-insane captain was driven completely mad when he fell through a hatchway -for reasons implied but never given. there was no court martial. the court of inquiry was conducted in an almost congratulatory atmosphere. captain pellew does not appear appear in this part of the hornblower saga, nor does col. ortega's wife. hornblower, himself, was never in the brig either on the ship or on shore. there are plenty of such manipulations of forrester's story.<br /><br />on a purely technical basis, i think the film's repeated use of the flash-back device hurts the continuity of the story.<br /><br />why, oh why did screen-writers have to mess up a good story?
