this flick reminds me some really bad science-fiction movies from 50's and 60's.it is not scary or interesting,but it's dull,cheesy and stupid.special effects are laughable,all actors are ludicrous and the ending is simply awful.don't waste your money,rent or buy something better.i give it 3.5 out of 10( i found this turkey quite amusing because of its stupidity).
