ulli lommel's 1980 film 'the boogey man' is no classic, but it's an above average low budget chiller that's worth a look. the sequel, 1983s 'boogey man ii' is ultimately a waste of time, but at the very least it's an entertaining one if not taken the least bit seriously. now ii left the door open for another sequel, and i for one wouldn't have minded seeing at least one more. one day while i was browsing though the videos at a store in the mall i came across a film entitled 'return of the boogey man.' when i found out it was a sequel to the earlier films i was happy to shell out a few bucks for it...i should have known better. though the opening title is 'boogey man 3,' this is no sequel to those two far superior films i named above. well, not totally anyway.<br /><br />pros: ha! that's a laugh. is there anything good about this hunk of cow dung? let's see...it has footage from 'the boogey man' and, um...it's mercifully short. yeah, that's about it.<br /><br />cons: where to start? decisions, decisions. first of all, this movie is a total bore. it goes from one scene to the next without anything remotely interesting or scary happening. the acting is stiff at best. the "actors" are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before, and probably none since. the plot is nonexistent and script shoddily written. the direction is just plain awful. the director tries to make the film look all artsy fartsy by making the camera move around, lights flicker, and with filters, but it adds nothing. the music is dull and hard to hear in parts. ties to the original are botched. suzanna love's character was named lacey, not natalie! and the events depicted in the beginning of the original did not take place in 1978. also, if this has a 3 in the title, why is there no mention of what happened in ii? finally, this adds nothing new or interesting to either the series or the genre.<br /><br />final thoughts: the people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves. it's one thing if that had been an original film that was the director's first and sucked. but instead it's supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece, but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this. if there ever is another sequel, which i doubt it, then it needs to forget this one ever happened and be handled either by lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea of how to make a decent horror film.<br /><br />my rating: 1/5
