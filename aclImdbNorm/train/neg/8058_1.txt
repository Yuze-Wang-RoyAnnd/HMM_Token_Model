having seen the hot eliza dushku in the pretty good wrong turn, i decided to pick this one up instead of return of the living dead, of all movies. haven't seen that one yet, but, considering it is one of the most highly acclaimed horror movies ever, safe to say i made the wrong choice. there is simply nothing to recommend this movie, and i am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut. it didn't even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movies like i know what you did last summer or valentine or urban legend. it simply made no sense, held no excitement, had very little interesting acting or compelling writing. the release date was apparently put off numerous times for about a year running, and the reason is obvious. the whole movie comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly, to meaningless effect. get wrong turn instead, if you want to see dushku. i would like to see a movie with her and the super-hot elisabeth harnois--but i don't think even that would have made this movie watchable. casey affleck, so promising in good will hunting, is awful here--he seems to lack both intelligence and guts. that's enough on this one.
