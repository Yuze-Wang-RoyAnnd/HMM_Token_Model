let's see...i'm trying to practice finding the positive in everything, so what kind thing can i say about the pallbearer?<br /><br />i know! the performances were -- no, that won't work as they succeeded in draining all personality from gwyneth paltrow, usually so vibrant, and ended up creating caricatures out of carol kane and barbara hershey...<br /><br />oh - how 'bout the story -- nope. that isn't gonna fly either, as it was doze-inducing. what was the genre anyway? it wasn't funny, that rules out comedy. it wasn't interesting enough to be dramatic. was that a romance between schwimmer and paltrow? i have to ask, as i can't be sure - let's just call it "losers in like." i'm sure those behind this film started with a vision, i mean, they must have had one to pitch to the studio suits, but i need help finding it.<br /><br />even if i were a patient person who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story, i couldn't in good conscience recommend a film that allows a guy to go into a professional job interview in a windbreaker and messy, fluffy, stupid hair. speaking of hair -- are we supposed to be amused by the deliberate black roots and platinum locks worn by hershey?<br /><br />what am i doing? i already lost 97 irretrievable minutes in the actual watching of the movie -- i cannot devote any more time to this loser.
