i've never actually seen this film but can tell you one thing about its production. while a comedy/oldies radio dj in 1988, i got a call from the production company. they asked if i'd write and record a bit they'd drop into the soundtrack as sounds eminating from a tv (the television screen itself would never be shown). i said sure, wrote a parody of '50s sci-fi monster clich'es, rounded up some sound effects and called in another dj, pam landry, to play the female part. as she happened to be on the air at the time, she put on a long song, joined me at the mike in the production room and we cut the voicetrack in a single take. giggling, she then went back to her show while i mixed in the goofy sound effects. we'd have never done it if we'd known that "woodchipper massacre" was going to be such a turkey -- but, then again, we never got paid for our efforts, either! -- gary theroux
