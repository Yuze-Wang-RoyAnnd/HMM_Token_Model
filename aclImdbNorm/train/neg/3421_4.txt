star rating: ***** the works **** just misses the mark *** that little bit in between ** lagging behind * the pits <br /><br />some plutonium's gone missing and some very nasty people now have the means to develop a bomb capable of wholesale destruction- so josh mccord (chuck norris) and his cocky young prot'eg'e deke (judson mills, a different actor from the previous film) with the assistance of josh's adopted daughter que (jennifer tung) set out to stop them.<br /><br />this was another film that dealt with terrorism a year after the events of 9/11. filmed in 2001, norris himself even commented afterwards how eerily the plot line to the film resembled what happened in downtown new york that day, so there'd have been those that would have been in the mood for a film where norris and his side-kick kick some terrorist ass if nothing else. other than that, it's as interchangeable as anything norris has ever been in. it makes you wonder what the original did to warrant a sequel in the first place, and whether if this one could get made a president's man 3 might come out sometime soon.<br /><br />if you've seen one norris film, you've really seen them all and there's really nothing new or unexpected that happens with this one, but at least you know what you're getting and, like i said, it might have been just what some needed to let off some steam. **
