i read the reviews for this and while not expecting a saving private ryan i was expecting a film of some substance.<br /><br />the film starts off very lob-sided with the usual intro of history and how the unit came into being. but immediately it's 1944 and you are not sure where everyone is. the accents etc are very poor as this unit is supposed to be hawaiian/asian american but everyone speaks in a very poor take on harvard english imitation of a japanese person.<br /><br />i gave this film 3 out of 10 as after 10 minutes i couldn't watch any more of it. the characters were 1 dimensional and even though they were most likely based on real people i had no feeling for them and this left me not caring about them. very poor direction of a very average tv movie which will be shown at midnight on some cable channel. i'd avoid and look out for better efforts.<br /><br />this is a good story but it was deserving of a better telling. you got a sense the director had seen band of brothers and thought that that was enough to sell his movie. my advice, avoid and watch band of brothers, tuskegee airmen, glory or any other movie like when trumpets fade...
