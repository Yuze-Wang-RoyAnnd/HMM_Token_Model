this superior inferiority to the original dumb "blind dead" movie is another trash bin waste. so many people have hyped up these films that i can't believe what they say about it. since i was a kid i have heard about how scary and great these films are and i saw them all and was throughly disappointed, was everyone on drugs, from the 1970's or do they just not know how boring this crude is?
