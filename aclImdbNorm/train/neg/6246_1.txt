it does touch a few interesting points.. but! - it fails to show evidence of all the 'exclusive' studies shown. who are the 'friends' and 'small groups of scientists' that gathered this data? - what's up with all the al gore biography going on there? like how he liked playing with the cows on the ranch or that his kid got hit by a car.. too bad but.. what does that have to do with the ozone layer?<br /><br />i've seen much better stuff, in much less time, on discovery channel.. i really don't understand why this has such a high score on imdb. unless you've been living under a rock, this 'documentary' shouldn't be any news to you... all this is old news... and all al gore is trying to do is get some popularity points. p.s. i'm not american so don't even try saying that i'm a bush fan :p
