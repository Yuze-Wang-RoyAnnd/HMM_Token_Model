i had the pleasure of viewing this movie early and i have to say i thought that it was going to be boring and wondered how could they ever improve upon the 1984 version of bachelor party starring tom hanks, which i thought was pretty good...i was right...in all honesty i thought it could have been better...sure there were some funny moments but it just didn't seem to hit the mark with me...the acting was ok and the storyline pretty well follows the original but i think it could have been so much better...this movie i'd say is for teens and the young of heart; full of female bodies, alcohol and sex...it's just another typical run of the mill party movie that has been done over and over again. 4/10 is my vote for this one.
