this may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close. the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life, and i want it back!<br /><br />chris kattan is funny for about 10 minutes. his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old, and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse. he falls into a long line of former snl-ers that have attempted movies. some have been brilliant, some have failed miserably. there's not much middle ground in this category. although chris farley was brilliant, and then okay, and then not so funny, and then dead...so i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one career.<br /><br />avoid this movie like the plague.<br /><br />c
