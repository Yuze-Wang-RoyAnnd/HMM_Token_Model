no laughs whatsoever. yes, i watched this entire train wreck but only so that i wouldn't later wonder if cleese had come to his senses in the latter part. (no, he had not.) <br /><br />this may be historically interesting to you youngsters out there, to see that british "humor" included black "jokes" like these, thirty years ago. <br /><br />what amazes me even more though, is to read the other reviewers' comments, which acknowledge this isn't very good, yet then turn around and give it high votes. if the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are even much worse than this one, then i certainly pity your torturous existences. <br /><br />the humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids, yet the subject matter does not. so who is this for? people who enjoy repeated & drawn-out double-takes, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip back to '77), and other "low" humor. the three stooges are still funny, and were to me as a kid, too. they exerted some effort in making jokes work. this however is sloughed off schlock. i fear that it is the end of civilization, if this stuff really is accepted as worthwhile. next you'll be telling me that tabloid tv is popular. :(
