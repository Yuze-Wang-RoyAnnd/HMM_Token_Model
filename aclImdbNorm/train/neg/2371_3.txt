i'm not a huge freddy krueger fan,but that doesn't mean that i don't like robert englund and his other nightmare on elm street movies.i think that robert is a very good actor.nobody plays a better freddy krueger than he does.but,no offense robert, this movie sucked.the acting is terrible,the plot is really weak,and freddy krueger is the only part of the cast that's even worth watching.sometimes sequels can be better than the first,such as the friday the 13th franchise(i thought the remake was the best in the series.)but this isn't one of those movies.the original was good,the 2nd in my opinion was better,the 3rd was okay but i haven,t seen the others.whatever you do,don,t make the same mistake i did by watching this piece of crap.
