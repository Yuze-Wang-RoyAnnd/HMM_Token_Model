i, like many other bachchan fans, having been eagerly awaiting the remake of sholay. this movie was not it. thank god they didn't let them use the name "sholay" in the movie title. ram gopal's remake is not worthy of the title. the camera work, the locations, the costumes, the totally out-of-place dancing, the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie i have ever seen. you wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and ram gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast. the only non-paid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie. abishek's role was totally ridiculous, did he need money to pay for the wedding to ash? save your money, your mind and your time, don't bother with this movie or the dvd when that comes out.
