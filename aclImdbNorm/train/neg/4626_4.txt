after seeing midnight offerings i am still convinced that the first decent movie about (teenage) witches yet has to be made. i didn't think much of the craft and i'm not into charmed either. the only film i more or less enjoyed (about teenage witches) was little witches (1996), and even that one wasn't very good. but changes are that if you liked all the aforementioned movies, you will also enjoy midnight offerings.<br /><br />i was expecting a silly and cheesy early 80's movie about teenage witches in high school. but i was rather surprised that this whole movie plays it rather serious. the acting is decent and serious all the time. no jokes are being played by teenagers or something. and the musical score, at first, i thought was pretty good. it added some scariness and also something 'classy', with the use of threatening violins and all. but as the movie progressed i came to the conclusion that the score was just too ambitious. they didn't have to add those threatening violins when you simply see someone back up a car and then drive away at normal speed.<br /><br />then there's melissa sue anderson, who was the main reason for me to see this movie. a few weeks ago, i saw her in happy birthday to me, a rather enjoyable, thick-plotted (and goofy on some occasions) slasher-movie which she had done in the same year as midnight offerings. and i must say, she was very good as the icy-cold bad witch vivian. but the main problem with the movie is: almost nothing happens! vivian causes a death and an accident, yes, but that's it. then there's robin, the good witch, who is just learning about her powers. and we expect the two of them using their powers more than once, but at only one occasion they use their powers to make some pieces of wood and other stuff fly through the air as projectiles. that was supposed to be a fight between two powerful witches? and what's worse, i was hoping to see a spectacular show-down between the witches at the end of the movie with at least some special effects, flaming eyes or whatever... but nothing happens. there is sort of a confrontation in the end, but it's a big disappointment.<br /><br />so, the acting of the two witches was good. the musical score was decent (even though overly ambitious). and the cinematography was rather dark and moody at times. but that doesn't make a good movie yet, does it?
