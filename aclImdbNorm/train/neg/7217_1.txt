i just got through watching this dvd at home. we love westerns, so my husband rented it. he started apologizing to me half way through. the saddles, costumes, accents--everything was off. the part that made me so mad is where the guy didn't shoot the "collector" with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy's soul. his only excuse was "he only had 2 arrows left." we watched it all the way through, and, as someone else said...too many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked. i mean, the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found, what's the point of that? and why were there a grave yard where everyone died on april 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around? if you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers, this may be your movie. however, if you want a real western, you will hate this movie.
