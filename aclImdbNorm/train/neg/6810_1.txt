to be honest, i didn't like "executive decision" - which was obvious the template - very much, but compared to this piece of crap, it looks like a masterpiece of art.<br /><br />not only that the people moving in the film (the term actors would be an insult for all other actors) should attend more acting classes, the guy who build the setting hasn't even seen an aircraft from afar. it is so ridiculous, that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. the film is full of illogicalness (e.g.: use sleeping-gas, then don't use it, then use it anyway), which dropped my rating finally to the bottom.<br /><br />you can have more fun in rearranging you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk.
