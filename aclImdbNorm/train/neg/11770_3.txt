'p' (or club-p) should really be called 'l' for lame. every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its much-hyped logline: "thai lesbians fighting monsters." rather, this is the tale of a khmer country girl who's grandmother has taught her a little witchcraft along with a few odd (but specific) rules: "don't walk under a clothesline," "don't eat raw meat," and "don't accept money for your powers." well, guess what folks, the girl moves to bangkok to raise some money as a 'bar-girl' and manages to break all the rules granny taught her which subsequently releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills the 'foreign johns' who pay for her services.<br /><br />while this film can't even be released in thailand due to it's controversial subject matter most american audiences will find this ho-hum horror pic a cross between "showgirls" and "interview with the vampire" as directed by walt disney.<br /><br />if not for a few scenes with significant amounts of blood the mpaa could probably rate this for pre-teens only. there is literally broadcast tv adult fare, although you'd expect at least a sex scene considering the fact that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a thai porn star in real life.<br /><br />as for the 'lesbian' angle, there's one brief smooch and a couple of "i love you's" to prove that the two main stars really are a couple (on brother). and the p-bar has got to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their sarongs on and do carnival stunts (there's a swordsman who cuts cucumbers out of a girl's mouth ... ooh, phallic imagery).<br /><br />no nudity, no real monster (unless you count a five foot high thai spirit with yellow eyes), and no way any adult should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on dvd. you've been warned!
