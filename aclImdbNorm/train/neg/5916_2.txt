the excruciatingly slow pace of this film was probably the director's express intention, in order to convey what life was like growing up as a village teen in china. however, i found the combination of the glacially slow 'plot' and the general filming style so impersonal as to be totally alienating, particularly to a western audience. at times i actually had trouble telling some characters apart, as they were filmed from such a distance. two hours in and i was totally past caring. as someone who is not only interested in music but is also very into the history and culture of china (and is by the way no stranger to chinese cinema), i couldn't engage with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth into. it begs the question: if i disliked it, who on earth would like it? give me zhang yimou, give me chen kaige. give me the work of just about any other chinese director i've ever seen. this sorry effort just doesn't measure up at all. i'd be sorry to see chinese cinema judged against this benchmark.
