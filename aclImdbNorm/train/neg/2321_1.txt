i can't believe this show is still rating a 9 out of 10. i could see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons, but what would possess anyone to continue to rate it high after that? i was a huge fan the 1st season. i was hooked - all the mystery, suspense, unexplained events. you never knew what was going to happen next. by season 2, i was still watching faithfully, but was getting a little frustrated that some basic things had yet to be explained. and instead of giving you more answers, it just seemed like more questions. i love suspense, but you have to throw people a bone every now and then to keep them watching.<br /><br />now, i can't even remember what finally turned me off, but somewhere in season 2, i had enough. i'm not a big fan of appointment viewing - and you clearly can't miss an episode to stay up on what's happening. so, it was no longer worth the effort to me.<br /><br />it's a shame that they couldn't have been a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans. i agree with some of the posters that it appears abc just got greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show out. don't they realize that in the end, they are going to lose more fans than they could possibly gain.
