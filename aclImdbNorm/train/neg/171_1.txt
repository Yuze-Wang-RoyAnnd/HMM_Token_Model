i thought hedy burress (who managed to escape from the watery grave of part one) was going to be in part 2 guess not. i just think they should of killed her off like in friday the 13th part 2 (you know what i mean).<br /><br />this movie like scream 3, and urban legend 2 followed movies within a movie.<br /><br />this was pure crap! the whole movie within a movie crap.<br /><br />bad stay away!
