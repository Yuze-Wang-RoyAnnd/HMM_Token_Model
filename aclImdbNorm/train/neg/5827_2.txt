don't get the impression from other reviewers that this film stinks cos it's ambivalent about the japanese whaling industry (which, morally, is no worse than the us meat trade or the scottish haggis cull), it stinks cos it's pretentious tosh, the sort of up-its-own-behind guff that gets modern art a bad name. that said, there are some stunning images, but there are stunning images in the average bus ride if you use your imagination, so that's no reason to go and see this nonsense. what happens in the film happens very slowly and often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a cat being gutted, and then, just when you thinks it's finished, it starts again. i saw it it in a porn cinema in rome which had been hired for the weekend to show barney's film works, which is an admirable and clever way to reclaim what had once been a local fleapit from the dirty-old-men-in-macs brigade, but if the trendy young things and the slightly older beard-stroking bjork fans were to be honest, everyone might have had a lot more fun if they'd just shown one of the pornoes!
