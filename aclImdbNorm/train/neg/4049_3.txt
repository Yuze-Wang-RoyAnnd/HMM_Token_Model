i didn't like this bill murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80s, so i tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my movie-going tastes in the 80s or was it that "stripes" is simply a bad movie. well, the verdict is in and "stripes" is a bad movie.<br /><br />now, "stripes" may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s, and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are bill murray fans, but its still a bad movie.<br /><br />why is it bad? mostly because "stripes" is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not that funny. there are some laughs, but they are few and far between. most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting. this lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you're used to more contemporary comedies such as "anchorman" which strive for laughs in every part of the movie.<br /><br />"stripes" further suffers from bill murray and harold ramis's lack of acting ability. bill murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career, and harold ramis is playing harold ramis. these two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie.<br /><br />lastly, most of the comedy that there is in "stripes" revolves around bill murray's self-centered, smart-alec man-child character so if you don't find that character funny (like i didn't) you're not going to find most of what little comedy there is in "stripes" funny either.<br /><br />"stripes" is very much a movie of its era, it hasn't aged well and is not worth watching. if you want to watch an early 80's "buddy" comedy i would recommend "stir crazy." like "stripes" the humor in "stir crazy" is not as fast-paced as in contemporary comedies, but unlike "stripes" it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable.
