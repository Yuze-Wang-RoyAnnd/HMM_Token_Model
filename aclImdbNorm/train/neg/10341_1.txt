i rented this movie from the library (it's hard to find for good reason) purely out of curiosity. i'm a huge plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment. the bell jar (1979) is by far one of the worst movies i've ever seen. the script is horrible, not because it strays from the original novel text, but because it strays without focus or intent. the scenes are ill-constructed and don't lead the viewer anywhere. what's with the hokey voice over of plath's poetry? lady lazarus has little do with greenwood's situation; plath's poetry was completely misused. marilyn hassett is completely unbelievable as esther greenwood (or any 20 year old for that matter) partly due to casting (she was 32 during filming, the age plath was when she died) and partly due to the fact that she can't act. hassett is all emotion, no craft, no skill. the direction is mediocre; the director simply covers what's there, which isn't much. the only reason i'm giving the film a 1 is because 0 isn't an option. sorry sylvia, you'll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting.
