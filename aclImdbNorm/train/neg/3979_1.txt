ok, this has got 2 be one of the worst excuses 4 a movie that i have ever had the misfortune of watching. like all other olsen twins movies with the possible exception of new york minute , this film had no story, gaping plot holes,disgustingly putrid acting and bad filming even!!!!!!!!! in case you haven't guessed yet i hate mary kate and ashley!!!!!! the only reason i watched this was because i was really bored and nothing else was on. i wonder if the twins will ever stop making the same stereotypical movies where they have an unbelievably stupid adventure in an exotic location and save the day meanwhile getting the help of two cute guys who drool over them immediately. the least they could would be to have a guy 4 1 of them or have them both falling 4 the same guy. the plot in this story was so imbecilic and just plain dumb. even a toddler could see the flaws in it.maybe they should split up and start making films individually or maybe films with a different kind of story. anyone who liked this movie was no offense-either really stupid, really artificial or has not seen any really good movie. or maybe they are really smart and just have bad cinematic choices. either way i would not recommend this movie to my worst nemesis for a good movie experience.. the only thing it is good 4 is some rib splitting laughter at the pathetic attempts to be cool. if you watch for laughs it's hilarious. basically i give it 0 or less.
