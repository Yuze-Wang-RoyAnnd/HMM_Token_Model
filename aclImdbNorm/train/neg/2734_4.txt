but, lets face it... it got a few nostalgic sighs out of me.<br /><br />the show is just so consistently great that it is allowed to have a few hiccups. i get a new season, and just power through them like i have 2-days to live. i like the idea of wrapping it up, but it was much more of an end of season episode which would explain the following:<br /><br />dr.cox isn't supposed to be bald for a couple more episodes, only explanation i can think of is they changed the rotation of the episodes or had to re-shoot the beginning.<br /><br />and that my friends, is why the hell cox is bald.<br /><br />anyways, the show is awesome...bring on the 7th season.
