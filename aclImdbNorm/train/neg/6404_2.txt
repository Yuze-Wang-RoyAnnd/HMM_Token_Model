spoilers... if such a thing is possible... . . . . . . . as a rabid robin williams fan, i felt it necessary to buy this film as first on-screen appearance. wow... i could not imagine a more mind-numbing movie. essentially, the movie takes one bad joke after another that your uncle artie would tell you after dinner and dramatizes them. robin williams plays a lawyer in a 30 sec skit.<br /><br />i'm all for bawdy humor, but this humor wasn't pleasantly vulgar, or ribald... it was just mind-numbing. there are no redeeming qualities to this film, other than robin williams fanatics, like me, who simply have to own every piece of film.
