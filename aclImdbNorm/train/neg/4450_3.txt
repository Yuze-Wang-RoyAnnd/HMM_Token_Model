julia roberts obviously makes a concerted effort to shake off her cotton wool pretty woman persona with this spurious spousal abuse thriller, but it's hard to imagine she'd end up putting in a performance as powerful and convincing (and oscar winning) as she did in erin brokovich based on the back of this rubbish. and make no bones about it, it's nothing more than a julia roberts vehicle, but unfortunately, her performance is not the most lacklustre thing about it.<br /><br />the plot has all the markings of a late night made-for-cable, and don't be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because non of the characters are sketched out enough for you to really care. <br /><br />ultimately disappointing and unsatisfying, without roberts' name above the title, i'm sure it would have totally flopped, deservedly.
