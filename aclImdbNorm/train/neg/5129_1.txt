the message of this movie is "personality is more important than beauty". jeanine garofalo is supposed to be the "ugly duckling", but the funny thing is that she's not at all ugly (actually she's a lot more attractive than uma thurman, the friend who looks like a model).<br /><br />now, would this movie work if the "ugly duckling" was really unattractive? when will hollywood stop with this hypocrisy?<br /><br />in my opinion, despite the message that it wants to convey, this movie is simply ridiculous.<br /><br />
