"indian burial ground": if those three words appear anywhere in a real-estate listing, look for a different neighborhood. a young couple with a young daughter and a toddler-age son move into a maine house adjacent to a pet cemetery--and, after a l-o-o-o-ng hike, an ancient indian burial ground. seems the indian ground can bring fido or fluffy back from the dead--if you don't mind having a raving hell beast for a pet. it can do the same for dead people--if you don't mind having a homicidal zombie around the house.<br /><br />throw in a busy two-lane blacktop, speeding big rigs, a well-meaning (if somewhat dim) old neighbor, and one kid who really doesn't get enough supervision, and i think you can figure out what happens from there--an over-the-top, illogical mess, which, in all fairness, does offer up a few scares.<br /><br />well, there are worse stephen king adaptations (such as "maximum overdrive," which king also directed). but there are far better ones, too (such as "salem's lot," "the dead zone," and both versions of "the shining").
