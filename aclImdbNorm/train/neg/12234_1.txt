i think that it was just pointless to produce a second part of a movie like "my girl". "my girl" was a very good movie but it is ridiculous making a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters (macaulay culkin as thomas j.) dies. the story was over after the first movie. i wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story going on. that was senseless!
