poorly written conspiracy drama/mystery about the possibility that aids was introduced to the public by the government. wlaschiha plays a gay researcher looking for answers--that within this foggy plot would be hard for anyone to find. despite the cinematography itself being commendable, the camera hungers for characters of true depth instead of the shallow, amateur acting it unfortunately has to convey. grade: d+
