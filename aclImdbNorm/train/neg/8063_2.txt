i have anticipated the various sci-fi and thriller type movies this summer but was so disappointed about this particular film. while some people walked out of the film, i decided to stay, only to laugh along with the other moviegoers at the acting, lack of suspense, ridiculous ending and difficult to follow story line. i found myself almost as confused as the main character in the film. the only redeeming quality of the film was the soundtrack. this is one of those budding star films which they later regret doing. in retrospect, i wouldn't even rent this one, let alone pay more than $5 to see.
