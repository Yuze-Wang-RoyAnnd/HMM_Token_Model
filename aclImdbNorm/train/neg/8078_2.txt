the world is facing imminent destruction and a suicide mission is sent to the sun to avert catastrophe by firing a bomb into its fiery heart: yes, it's solar crisis, aka crisis 2050, which burned up a huge chunk of change that's never apparent on screen back in 1990 and returned barely enough to buy a happy meal for each of the cast in japan before going straight to video (remember them?) in a re-edited version credited to one alan smithee. the plot hook's pretty much the same as sunshine - suicide mission to the sun, saboteur on board, logic cast adrift - except that this time they're not trying to reignite the sun but to prematurely detonate a solar flare before it can reach earth. with a talking bomb. voiced by paul williams. who wants to be promoted so the crew will take him more seriously
