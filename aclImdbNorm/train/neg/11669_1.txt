i suppose it's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this. with the sometimes pointless excesses of many hollywood films, we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions, foul language, and corny one-liners. minimalism has its place, and can be very effective when employed properly. however, this film is not one of those cases.<br /><br />take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary, sparse scenery. i'm sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight, because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement. the acting is poor... bland and pedestrian... and features one of the worst crying scenes in history (at the end of the film, if you can sit through it to the end). the scenery is drab, and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled. i would call this anticlimatic, but as the film didn't build to any sort of climax whatsoever... not even in the "erotic" scenes... it would be untrue. i'm sure that there was a script employed during the filming, but with the amount of dialogue, i think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin. basically, this film offers nothing to interest or amaze... no great story, no stunning insights, no visual drama, no excitement. apart from two or three amusing moments, this film is a waste of two hours. a tragically boring and dreary film.
