pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion/philosophy. the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is just plain wrong.<br /><br />examples? quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion. how? well, in the world of the subatomic, you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time. you can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time. also, the act of observation seems to affect the event. solid particles can pass through barriers. all of this, so far, is accurate. but then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall, you could indeed do it. this is complete poppycock. instead, the theory asserts that at our level, it is possible for you to walk through a wall, but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief. also you'd have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall, the odds are so astronomically against it.<br /><br />this is but one example of how they misrepresent the science. but much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer, played by marlee maitlan. about halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible. something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self-hate. there may be some truth to that, but quantum physics has nothing to do with it.<br /><br />plus, string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays. instead of wasting your time with this dreck, i suggest you rent the elegant universe, an amazing series done for nova on pbs that gives you a history of physics from newton and gravity to ed witten and m theory in only 3 hour-long episodes. quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation.
