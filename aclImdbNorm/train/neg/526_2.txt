almost as tedious to watch as it was to read, evening is a gorgeously produced failure...until meryl streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff. vanessa redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying ann and claire danes is a cipher. perhaps if vanessa and claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young ann that gave her entr'ee to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older ann actually was dying. <br /><br />i was hoping the addition of michael cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas. it gave me a headache.
