this movie was in a sci-fi 50-pack a friend of mine got me for christmas. it is very similar to the first gozilla movie, and like that movie, has scenes with american actors inserted for no real reason. one interesting thing about the inserted scenes is that there's a cold war tension portrayed between america and russia. like in godzilla, gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and rampages across the world, paying close attention to tokyo because no big monster movie is complete unless tokyo bites it. all in all, this is an okay movie. some of the scenes involving gamera, particularly the scenes in toly, are quite spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at the time. if you like japanese giant monster movies, you'll really get a kick out of this one. i give it a 4 out of 10. had this been the unedited japanese version that i watched, it probably would've gotten a 5.
