ok, as everyone has pointed out, this film is a complete dog. to some degree this is because it was a gory sexploitation film that had a lot of material excised (or darkened down to near invisibility) to escape the censor's x-rating; but the film has many other flaws as well.<br /><br />to begin with, the scriptwriter seems to have got his werewolves and vampires mixed up. the baddies in this film are furry and don't like silver but in every other respect they behave like vampires. now you just can't do that with a crappy genre flick, you've got to stick to the rules of the genre or the fans get all confused and annoyed by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing. in fact the whole (confusing and poorly presented) plot is something that has already been done for vampires, but doesn't make any sense in a werewolf movie.<br /><br />secondly, the werewolf costumes are the lamest you have ever seen. anybody in the werewolf movie business ought to know that the werewolf costumes and transformations are something the fans assess critically, yet some of these werewolves are just plain goofy.<br /><br />there are a couple of slightly good bits. i actually quite liked the score. others have mentioned sybil danning's tits. and...<br /><br />(***spoiler***, if such a thing can exist)<br /><br />i also quite liked the plan for attacking the werewolves' stronghold. there are so many horror movies that rely on characters behaving stupidly, but in this case they first acquire a very sensible and effective anti-werewolf arsenal and go slaughter the monsters. i mean, you can kill werewolves with silver bullets, and we have some pretty powerful firearms these days. shouldn't be too hard to put two and two together, hmm? but in typical style this movie goes over the top and adds some other very zany and amusing anti-lycanthrope weapons.
