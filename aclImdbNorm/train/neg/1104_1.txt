this is one of the worst-written movies i've ever had to sit through.<br /><br />the story's nothing new -- but it's a cartoon, so who cares, as long as it's pretty and fun? <br /><br />i'm not going to go as deep as the characterisations, or i'll be here all day (except to say that there aren't any; the characters change personality whenever it's convenient to the plot), but whoever wrote the script and visual direction should be forbidden access to so much as pencil and paper. thumbs down? i'd vote to cut their thumbs off.<br /><br />"narrow in on an object/prop. cut back to character close-up. character gives a knowing look, which the audience will not even remotely understand. repeat that several times, with different objects/props."<br /><br />"make the characters pay no attention at all the huge lumps of rock are floating around, crashing into each other, generally raining destruction all over, and which could kill them all at any moment -- but make them stop and gasp in fear when they see a harmless-looking, almost pastoral green rock in the distance." <br /><br />the whole thing is a long succession of events, actions, and behaviour that are only there for the convenience of the writer, to save him having to think or make any effort at all to write the story properly.<br /><br />this is the plan 9 of cg cartoons, except that it doesn't have ed wood groan factor to make it fun to watch.<br /><br />do yourselves a favour: spend your cartoon budget on pixar movies.
