hobgoblins....hobgoblins....where do i begin?!?<br /><br />this film gives manos - the hands of fate and future war a run for their money as the worst film ever made. this one is fun to laugh at, where as manos was just painful to watch. hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term: "80's cheeze". the acting (and i am using this term loosely) is atrocious, the hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you will ever see, and the garden tool fight has to be seen to be believed. the movie was the perfect vehicle for mst3k, and that version is the only way to watch this mess. this movie gives mike and the bots lots of ammunition to pull some of the funniest one-liners they have ever done. if you try to watch this without the help of mike and the bots.....god help you!!
