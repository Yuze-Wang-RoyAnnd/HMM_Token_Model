wow...speechless as to the making of this film, i can't say much. the coverbox at the local videostore should've said it all...nothing but 6 actors/actresses who get lost on the set of scream and decide to shoot a movie!<br /><br />the acting was apparently not in the budget, but they were able to afford nudity and good-looking actors! style over substance almost makes its mark here, except most of these acting-class failures keep forgetting that there is a plot that needs to go somewhere when they were reading this script. after only 4 or 5 kills by the so-called masked murderer and a confusing tie-in plot about a murder club which the dumb lead actress thinks is a real club that she can join (only if she can get over a girl bumping into her car), you want to stab your hands with the nearest sharp object to remind yourself never to get overly excited by a possibly good movie such as this.<br /><br />i feel bad for the people who bought this film and can't find anyone to take it off their hands. another example of what's wrong with the growing number of straight to video horror releases with no thought put into the essentials. throw it away if you did buy this.
