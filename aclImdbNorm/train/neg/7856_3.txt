this movie pretty much sucked. i'm in the army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible. if your in the military and you see this movie you'll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted as a squad. it was ridiculous. they acted like a bunch of normal people with army uniforms on not knowing what to do. it was a pretty gory movie i'd have to say the least. there was a couple scenes where they try to make you jump. i'd recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent, gory movie. it will be a better movie also if your not in the military. i also would have to say i liked the first one better than this one.
