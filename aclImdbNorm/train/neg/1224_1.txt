who in their right mind does anything so stupid as this movie?<br /><br />accidental killing of a security guard... characters that are so two dimensional that a two year old could have painted drawn them... and better...<br /><br />a red toolbox of death? please....<br /><br />hypothermic weak thugs...<br /><br />acting from hell...<br /><br />stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy, thriller, voyeurism and... female ... (uhm) rambo?<br /><br />unbelievable and it's an insult to any thinking person. do not watch, walk away it's more horrible than you may imagine...<br /><br />and on top of it all it's trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it's violence...<br /><br />mrs montford: shoot 'em up was fun and funny, this is just pathetic and terrible. good luck next time. :-(
