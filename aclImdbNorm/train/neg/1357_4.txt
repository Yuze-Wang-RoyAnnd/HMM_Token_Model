*may contain a spoiler of sorts?* the mere mention of crispin glover is enough to send some geek's panties in a bunch. his landmark appearance in back to the future as george mcfly has sealed him into the american conscience forever. more recently, he has been trying to get back into the culty subconscious with bartleby and willard.<br /><br />this time, however, crispin has made a 76-minute, cheap dada film. at times it reminded me of genius, while overall it almost insulted me, but not because of its content. content? what is it? is a movie where, in one half of the movie, all of the actors have down's syndrome, giving it a freakshow feel to it. the other half of the movie includes crispin glover, adam parfrey, and a guy with cerebral palsy. this all had the feel of what john waters was attempting to do with desperate living, and simultaneously feeling more successful and failing miserably.<br /><br />the half with the down's syndrome actors also features many many killed snails. it is about a guy who has snails, and ends up killing one. he is also tormented by a bunch of other people, and a grasshopper. he falls in love with 2 girls, one of which he has sex with in a graveyard. he also has a falling out with a friend who teases him.<br /><br />in a weird semi-interior set, crispin glover is the director of this show. he is something like the control of the guy's mind, and the cerebral palsy guy is something like the sexuality. well, he at least gets masturbated in explicit scenes. there is other "shocking" imagery made humorous, like nazi swaztikas crossed with shirley temple, and minstrels in black face saying they're michael jackson.<br /><br />in the outside world, the tormentor is still dealing with his love of killing snails and being beaten by the other people. they beat him with rocks, and such. later, they beat the minstrel after putting him on trial.<br /><br />back to the interior, crispin glover is still the ruler of his set, and tries to control everybody, but fails miserably.<br /><br />what is it? makes less sense than dr. caligari, and has more than a passing style stolen from it. the claustrophobic mental space feels very much like the way the no-wall sets of dr. caligari felt claustrophobic. they also had some dialogue that was absolute nonsense. and, it was all wrapped up with absurdist imagery for humor.<br /><br />the problem is, about 20 minutes into the movie...maybe a little more...what is it? runs out of imagery. for the next 56 minutes, we keep running on the same sets of images, only introducing new imagery in the form of an absurdist puppet show. the movie seems little more than a movie which attempts to push the envelope in offensive and taboo imagery. it tries to mock and confuse the audience. but, the issue is that it only has enough different imagery for a 40 minute movie.<br /><br />even worse than that, the cinematography, set design, and everything else felt very very cheap and almost unplanned. it felt like "ok, this is the way we can do it and get it out of the way." it didn't feel interesting, and was quite...boring. dr. caligari, on the other hand, had amazing cinematography and framing. the difference between the two is quite astounding.<br /><br />rating: c
