usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it doesn't have a lower rating, and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating. this is not the case here.<br /><br />bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0/10 film. it does nothing right and it doesn't have the chance to because it doesn't really attempt to do anything. there are strands of a bad d&d novel kind of plot which doesn't hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout. it is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort, because even a completely patently untalented persons' hard work would amount to more. a truly awful film.
