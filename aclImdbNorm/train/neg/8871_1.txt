i view probably 200 movies a year both at theaters and at home and i can say with confidence that this movie is by far the worst i have seen this year (if not ever, however i have not actually seen "quest of the delta knights" yet). this movie is just bad joke after bad joke geared to the 13 year old and because i had he displeasure of viewing it on a bus trip i couldn't walk out.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and skip this one in the rental aisle. the four dollars could be better spent on any movie by numbers produced by jerry bruckheimer.
