there are three movies with this animation style that i fondly remember from my youth. this movie, "the last unicorn," "flight of dragons" and "the hobbit." i own copies of both "dragons" and "the hobbit" (both excellent) and i hadn't seen "the last unicorn" in more than a decade. that was until today and now i wish i hadn't. what bothered me the most was the script. it was incredibly choppy and often inane. things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation. we're not just talking about little things here either; we're talking about key plot points! the story itself isn't that great to begin with, but it could have worked had the script been decent. not even close. on top of that the music was awful! i know that music in movies such as these rarely have what one would call classic pieces, but the music in this movie made me want to knock myself unconscious with a bowling ball. this was one of those films that i was going to show to my kids some day, but it just got cut. i don't think i could ever sit through that crap fest again. disappointed is putting it mildly.
