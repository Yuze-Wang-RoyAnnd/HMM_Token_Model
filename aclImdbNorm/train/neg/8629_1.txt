dear richard, i know we all loved you on home improvement with tim allen. but seriously, do you not have anything else to do besides lame sequels to air bud? i would have thought tim might have actually give you a bit role by now or even becoming his personal assistant. i know that seems ironic, but the pay benefits are much more rewarding.<br /><br />everybody would see you around tim and instantly think "tool time". you would even get roles with bob vila more often. instead, you appear for 10 minutes with a golden retriever and smiling. i know there wasn't much of a script, but you could have added to it. i mean, come on. tim owes you one.<br /><br />but seriously, this movie does nothing for the air bud line. quite the contrary, the fake talking puppies are cornier than actually seeing the dogs play sports. the original was better. and you, mr. richard karn, know that more than anybody.<br /><br />this is an "f" movie.
