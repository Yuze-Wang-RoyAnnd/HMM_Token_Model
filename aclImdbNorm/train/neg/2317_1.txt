the direction had clearly stated that this film's idea and plot is totally original....however, as to those who have read 'slam dunk' comic, we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes...<br /><br />another note is jay chow himself do not know kung fu, it just won't impress anyone if he tries to act like he can, many people today can see the differences.. luckily the movie do not contain much of kung fu fighting and much are enchanced by stunners and visual effects...<br /><br />i think that jay's acting is still a pain to watch, especially when almost everyone else in the film is so much better. the only reason i think why jay is the main actor is simply is for his popularity.<br /><br />despite how hard i wish to stop anyone from watching this thus making this "orginal" movie getting what it shouldn't have, it has became one of the best budget films in china for this year.
