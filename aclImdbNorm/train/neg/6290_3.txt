recap: ron is about to marry mel. they are deeply and love and certain they are perfect for each other even though they met just a few months ago. todd, ron's brother in law to be is not so happy. he is afraid the marriage is a threat to his cushy job in the family business and decides to arrange ron's bachelor party. but his real plan is to put ron in a compromising situation, get evidence and break ron and mel up.<br /><br />comments: supposed to be a sequel to a comedy classic but it isn't funny at all. it is mostly a pubertal show and a juvenile excuse to show scantily clad women. actually, in a way, it is almost impressive have many you can put in there, because they are everywhere. unfortunately that is also one of the signs of a movie that can't support itself. it simply isn't good enough.<br /><br />it has three redeeming points though, or actually three actors that is worth a better script than this. it is lead actor josh cooke who actually manages to give an impression of some common sense. sara foster i know has more talent than to do movies like this, and emanuelle vaugier seem to have a lot more talent than this movie.<br /><br />what is suspiciously absent are good jokes. actually, bad jokes are rather scarce too. it just isn't funny.<br /><br />3/10
