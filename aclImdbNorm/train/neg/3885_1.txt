this movie wasn't just bad - it was terrible. after i watched it, i actually felt the need to take a shower to get the filth off of me. there is running 'gag' with an elderly couple making out, it is not funny, but it is disgusting. the monster make up was cool, but that is all. the continuity errors alone will have you angry - at least i was. the editing is really poor.<br /><br />almost anything else you could possibly do would be better than spending time watching this movie. even if your group of friends are into 'bad movies' this one is exceptional in its ineptitude, i couldn't even bring myself to laugh at it. you have been warned.
