this has to be, by far, the absolute worst movie i have seen in the last 20 years. when i saw that michael madsen was in it i figured it couldn't be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films, and he was a pretty fair actor. wrong! no one should waste their time on this film. i fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and i don't feel that i missed a thing.
