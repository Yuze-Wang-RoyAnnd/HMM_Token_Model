the volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters. thankfully, highly acclaimed director nelson mccormick has brought us the second best volleyball movie of all time (rated lower than side out and higher than, well, umm). however, don't let the cover of this movie decieve you. kill shot stars up and coming star koji as a modern day sherlock holmes. using such high-tech gadgets as a computer that is less powerful than my gameboy, koji is able to aid fbi agents in the tracking of a man who has not committed any obvious crime. while there are other actors in the movie, including brief cameos by denise richards, a gay negro, and a preposterously ugly and annoying girl, koji carries this movie on his own. any fan of movies such as the matrix or hackers will definitely love kill shot.
