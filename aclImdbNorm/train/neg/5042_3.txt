the main complaint with this film is the fact that i can not tell who is who. no racism intended, but these asians look all the same! i can tell somewhat of the story, but heck thats about as far as it goes. the peoples identities are not a mystery, if they were a mystery i would care about them. instead i wasn't them off the screen asap.<br /><br />tons of wide shots and silent emotionless faces occupy this movie. heck is it boring, not only do i not know these people, but they are just sitting there.<br /><br />the production is typical chinese john woo, terrible video with blotched scenes. this looks only slightly better than andy lau's "fulltime killer" (which was a great movie.) you would think with a decent budget they could at least make it look like 90s hollywood. i didn't know the chinese had these art-house beatniks.
