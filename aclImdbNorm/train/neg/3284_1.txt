have i seen a worse movie? perhaps only "manos: the hands of fate" dragged more than "dukes". i had more fun poking at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point. let's touch on a few...<br /><br />there was a noticeable script death and rebirth when sheev is talking to the dukes and they don't respond. he shrugs and moves on, since neither the knoxville or scott know what he's talking about (nor do we). it was like the engine died and was restarted.<br /><br />the few times the general lee flew through the air weren't even that exciting. nothing i haven't seen on the tv series.<br /><br />very little chemistry between knoxville and scott. the best part was when bo is upset at luke for stealing the girl he liked. the only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it (although roughly). the rest of the time it seems distant and forced.<br /><br />seann william scott's awful, horrendous accent (or lack thereof).<br /><br />i hated willie nelson's performance. were bad jokes supposed to be endearing? i wanted him to disappear.<br /><br />jessica simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen. she actually felt like one of the better actors in the film. that's telling you how horrible this movie is. she's a goddess.<br /><br />during the climax of the film, i was rooting for boss hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of hazzard county, starting with willie nelson and his accomplices. a nuclear bomb would have sufficed.<br /><br />this is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film, but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly heartwarming film.<br /><br />if only we could erase and start over...
