unless somebody enlightens me, i really have no idea what this movie is about. it looks like a picture with a message but it's far from it. this movie tells pointless story of a new york press agent and about his problems. and, that's basically all. when that agent is played by pacino, one must think that it must be something important. but it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is. to one of the best actors in the world, al pacino, this is the second movie of the year (the other is "simone") that deserves the title "the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year". so, what's going on, al?
