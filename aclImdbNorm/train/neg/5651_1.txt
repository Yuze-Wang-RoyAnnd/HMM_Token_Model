in my life i have seen many great and awful movies. i am not an expert in professional reviews, but i have definitely something to say about this one. firstly, these actors are the worst i have seen... their acting is so unreal that you even want to throw away the dvd in the first 2 minutes. i think that these actors were not interested in the quality. <br /><br />another awful thing is about these dialogs - they are so lame. you sometimes feel uncomfortable when you hear them. it seems that your 14 year old son could act better. i feel that this movie had a budget similar to the cost of my 14 year old european car...<br /><br />please, if my message reaches you - save your time and money.
