i didn't really expect much from "the night listener" and i actually never heard of it until i saw the cover in the videostore. however, the movie is very effective when it comes to building up suspension and tension. on occasion it drags a little, but it actually helps to keep you wondering what's going to happen and more importantly: when. as the movie progresses, the character played by robin williams gets dragged into some kind of "cat and mouse" spiel to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and existence about a 14 year old abused kid that no-one seemed to have ever seen in person. the night listener is an interesting story, which is great in building up the suspense throughout the movie and you're pretty much kept in the dark of who is lying and what's real. however, in the end it kind of disappoints and doesn't live up to the potential it could have had. it doesn't really give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character, which would have been helpful and interesting.
