a one is the highest rating i could have given this movie, considering zero and negative numbers are not allowed. pee yew, pointless mess of a movie with a lot of wasted b-list actors who have done better work, written and directed by some guy with the mentality of a twelve year old who smirks and giggles at stupid puns, and poop and fart jokes. for example, gene stapelton's (ding-bat from all in the family) character telling marilu henner's character that she "swings both ways" sexually, was a cheap attempt at humor indicative of the general lameness of the movie... you want good, cheeky humor? rent animal house, american pie (part one only), old school or office space.
