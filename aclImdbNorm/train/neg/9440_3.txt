unhinged was part of the video nasty censorship film selection that the uk built up in the 80's. keeps the gory stuff out of the hands of children, don't you know! it must have left many wondering what the fuss was all about. by today's standard, unhinged is a tame little fairy tale.<br /><br />3 girls are off to a jazz concert... and right away, you know the body count is going to be quite low. they get lost in the woods, & wind up getting in a car accident that looks so fake it's laughable. they are picked up by some nearby residents that live in the woods in a creepy house. one of the girls is seriously injured and has to stay upstairs. then there's talking. talking about why the girls are here, and how they must be to dinner on time because mother doesn't like it when someone is late. and more talking. yakkity yak. some suspense is built as a crazy guy is walking around and harassing the girls, and someone's eyeball is looking through holes in the walls at the pretty girls in something that looks like hitchcock's psycho. i digress because there is so much blah blah in this film, that you wonder when the killings are going to start. in fact, one of the girls gets so bored out of her mind that she walks in the woods, alone, looking for the town. smart move. she probably knew about the lonely virgin walking alone in the woods part, but just didn't care. more talk continues after this as we wait, wait, and wait some more until the next girl may or may not be killed.<br /><br />and then there's the twist ending. the "expected" unexpected for some viewers, for others a real gotcha. quite possibly the only reason why someone would really want to watch this. i don't care how twisted it is, nothing in this movie makes up for the most boring time i had watching it. even with the minor impact of the ending, the director just didn't have what it takes to really deliver a good story with it. it would have made a much better 30 minute - 1 hour tv episode on say, tales from the darkside.<br /><br />if you really must get this for any reason, perhaps just to say you've watched every slasher movie, do yourself a favor and have the fast-forward button ready. since the movie has so many unimportant scenes, just zoom through them, and in no time, you'll get to the "wow, that's what it was all this time" ending. oh and halfway through the movie there's a shower scene with 2 girls showing boo-bees. horray for boo-bees. those beautiful buzzing honey-making boo-bees.
