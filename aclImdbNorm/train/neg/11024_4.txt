i saw this film first in the soviet union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee. but then, in poland in 2000, i watched it in a complete form. and so what? the plot is incredibly unwise - 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong, straight and fundamentally severe ladies. the men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clich'es follow - sex-drive, constant masculine desire for sex, feminists who are shown like complete idiots (you may agree with them or not, but idiots certainly they are not), and so on. the performance even of the stellar jerzy stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad - he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like "i am in the elevator with a nude chick and i haven't done anything to her!". this was intended to be a comedy, instead, it turned out to be a vapid farce, full of predictable jokes and below-the-waist innuendos. do not waste your time on it - this is just bad.
