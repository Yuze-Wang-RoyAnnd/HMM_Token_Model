urgh! 3 things a movie needs: a good script, a good plot and good casting. i watched this movie expecting it to be hilariously terrible and was unfortunately disappointed when it was just plain terrible. i lost the will to live halfway through. the only thing which stopped me from stabbing my eyes out with a fork was rose byrne (who was the reason for me watching it in the first place). she did a good job as rastus and her appearance hasn't changed much since she was 13. it was a fantastic first effort in a movie. the dog was also very good. both did a great job with such awful material. sandra bernhard i think was the biggest mistake of the movie. she was completely miscast, and i don't think she ever quite got the character.<br /><br />i give the movie 2 out of 10 - and thats only because of rose.
