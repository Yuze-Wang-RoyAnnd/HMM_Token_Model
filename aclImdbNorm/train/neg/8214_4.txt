this doesn't quite plumb the depths of creepshow 3, but it comes close. it also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology, which is distracting to say the least.<br /><br />it also rather irritating rips off the twilight zone (with the bookshop being comparable to serling's later night gallery). unfortunately, the producers & writers forgot that serling would build up sympathy for his characters before messing them over. none of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment.<br /><br />framing story: adam west is... well, himself. he doesn't go the bruce wayne/batman campy 60s route, but he rarely does. he simply plays the not-particularly-enigmatic "jay" (there's an ominous spine-chilling name to compare to the likes of dr. terror, eramus, and the cryptkeeper), and makes some mildly awkward/creepy statements.<br /><br />abernathy: seen rod serling's "a stop in willoughby"? then you've seen this. the red herring of the nutso wife is introduced to no purpose, but even the main character's friend identifies him as a wimp. as well directed as can be expected, but basically incoherent.<br /><br />nex's diner: reminiscent of various serling time travel stories, mixed with steve allen's "a meeting of minds." most of the actors aren't too bad (except for josh astin as cassius, who manages to walk, talk and even breathe awkwardly), and the idea is mildly interesting. but like abernathy, it doesn't go anywhere. the main character raises some relatively reasonable questions, bugs out a bit (who wouldn't?), and for some reason he ends up banished to a nuclear wasteland.<br /><br />life replay: not a bad little piece, and manages to predate both click and creepshow 3. i suppose it says something that people are fascinated by the magical properties of remote controls. the main character is mildly sympathetic. nothing substantially innovative here, but it's okay.<br /><br />fighting spirit: you see the twist coming a mile away but like the main character, it has some heart and it's a decent story of defeat and redemption.<br /><br />finale: so... why do people end up in cold storage in silver lame suits? don't know. and doesn't make sense. so... all the protagonists wandered into the bookstore and became trapped? kinda undermines the happy ending with the boxer (thanks, guys!), and the guy in the first segment died. so how did he get trapped? did he visit the bookstore before he died, got trapped and... didn't die? what? huh? i supposer this isn't expected to make sense because it's supernatural. but still...<br /><br />overall: basically not dissimilar from the two newer twilight zone series, or some episodes of tales from the darkside or monsters. the last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time. but there's nothing really spectacular here.
