posh spice victoria beckham and her alleged new adventures after just moving to la for work purposes (footballer hubby david is now a galaxy la player after his transfer from real madrid) was originally going to be a full series,but was thankfully abridged to just one hour or so.but even in this form,it is still numbingly interminable.<br /><br />like virtually all 'reality' tv shows,most of the incident comes across as blatantly faked,with the programme itself even admitting that posh's newly appointed personal assistant is an actress.an ugly-betty lookalike,we hear some lamely written and performed banter early on(with an obvious joke about becks' apparent dalliance with a previous,and rather more glamorous pa rebecca loos,though her name is not mentioned) with further sequences involving a fake blow-up doll to trick the paparazzi and hopeless attempts to pitch a baseball.<br /><br />this could have been more entertaining if all had acknowledged it was a piece of fluff,and had an actress or impersonator in the lead role.talented impressionist ronni ancona would've been perfect and is better at being posh than posh herself is,and if this more sensible decision had been taken,much more fun and amusement would've ensued.sadly,we are left with the real thing here (ms ancona may have rejected the script as too weak anyway),and although there are odd scattered attempts at self-deprecation and irony,it never remotely works because of prior info of la beckham's considerable wealth beforehand,and her non-ability at delivering would-be jokes;despite the intentions to send up her image,mrs beckham comes across as a shallow egotist,and her weak one-liners don't persuade us she has any humorous self-awareness.i suspect that if a more realistic fly-on-the-wall documentary approach had been taken,namely posh walking down any street in la and being totally ignored (instead of the frantic,staged scenes of mild hysteria on show here), and associates making unscripted jibes about the previously mentioned ms loos,this would've made marginally better tv,but being sycophantic pr material,the bony one herself would never allow such events to happen.<br /><br />having said that,the later scenes where she made a special appearance at the baseball stadium where she was indifferently presented in front of an uninterested crowd show it will be tough times ahead if she wants to make it big in hollywood.her colleague scary spice (aka mel brown) also found it impossible to make it big residing in the movie capital despite her affair (which was not consummated) with big name eddie murphy.<br /><br />the spice girls were of course a massively successful bubblegum pop group in the mid 1990's,more so in their native britain but still popular briefly in other countries,including the us.they were certainly good fun at their peak of glory (1997) when there seemed to be a glorious period of optimism in the uk with cool britannia and a new labour government which the spice girls seemed to sum up better then anyone else at the time,even if it was somewhat manufactured.but they were never outstanding musical or singing talents,and uk optimism seemed to fade rapidly later that year (the starting point was arguably the tragic death of princess diana),as did the spices' themselves.their presence on the music and entertainment scene soon became repetitive and obvious,and if they had all quietly moved out of the public eye permanently with dignity to enjoy their fortunes, then we would have all had pleasant memories encrypted on our mind without any guilt.unfortunately,the emergence of the hideous 'celebrity' culture in the uk towards the start of the millennium has put paid to those imaginings,and we have all suffered thousands,if not millions of stories about the spices since,posh being the worst offender,with the rest of her colleagues not too far behind.it was recently announced that there will be a reunion tour soon,which is baffling as they have never gone away and they certainly don't require any additions to their swelling bank accounts.maybe it's because two of them are struggling single mothers,perhaps?<br /><br />good,it's soon time for becks' adventures on a revelatory documentary next,i can hardly wait.............<br /><br />rating:2 out of 10.
