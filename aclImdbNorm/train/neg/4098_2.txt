although this is "better" than the first mulva (which doesn't say much anyways, i would rather watch paint dry) it still sucks. do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these low budget pictures guys. i was suckered into buying a few dvds to support some indy filmmakers and boy did i regret it. some haven't even been officially "released" yet (not bootlegs-bought from the filmmakers themselves) and i can't even list how bad they all are. avoid anything with teen ape or bonejack in them as they do pop up in other small indy films that they are friends with. if you are friends of these guys, chances are you were in their movies and had fun making them. but for those that had to watch them? no way. bad video, bad audio, bad acting, bad plot...etc etc. these aren't even funny. i gave this one a 2 only because debbie rochon is in it and that is about it. maybe it doesn't even deserve the 2. about a 1 1/16th star to show it was slightly better than the first (which i wish i could have rated in the negatives). if you want a decent no budget film, go pick up something from lbp's "friends" over at freak productions like marty jenkins or even raising the stakes. those are actually decent.
