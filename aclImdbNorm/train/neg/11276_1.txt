i shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad. that has been done in great detail already, many times over. the 'plot' started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide-boy/gangster-by-numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles. anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves. it is now 7 or 8 years since i watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled, yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film i have ever seen.<br /><br />i am only making these comments, and indeed the only reason i went to see the film, is because of the amusing fact that my brother eddie appeared in it as the second 'heavy' in the pub scene. it was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards rhys ifan's face in the bar in 'russia' (it was actually filmed at the former butlins holiday camp at barry island). my brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever - he had recently joined an extras' agency and this was his first part. having seen the film, it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever.<br /><br />i remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and this was just a couple of days after it had been released. i have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast - and rightly so. in case you were thinking of renting this film on dvd, i would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red-hot, then jam them into your eye sockets. this will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film.
