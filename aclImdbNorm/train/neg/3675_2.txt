really, everybody in this movie looks like they want to be someplace else! no wonder, the casting is done not with the left hand, but rather not at all. i haven't seen anything worse than natascha mcelhone impersonating some sort of agent, carrying a gun. you don't use a spoiled city-brat-look in such a role. the only worse thing i can imagine is casting doris day as a prostitute. the rest of the cast is likewise awful, possibly with hurt as the sole exception, sometimes you can see him trying, but suffering. oh, did i mention that it is a completely insane story? jeopardizing many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family? well, it must be because the guy (weller) is german?<br /><br />2/10, because the photography could be worse.
