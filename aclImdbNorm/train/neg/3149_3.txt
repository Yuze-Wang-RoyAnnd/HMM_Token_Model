being an independent filmmaker and a huge fan of edward d. wood jr. i purchased this documentary believing that this would finally set the record straight on how gifted and brilliant ed wood actually was. <br /><br />what i got was a disappointing self-centered, conflictive, contradictory compilation of bitter self-aggrandizing has-beens. <br /><br />where people do remember ed wood jr., do people actually remember the second cousin of the guy with the duct tape who knew someone who was in plan nine from outer space? <br /><br />it appears as though, the very minute there is a renewed interest in ed wood, these people come out of the "wood"work! only to take mean spirited swipes at someone who actually gave them a chance when no-one else would! after 50 years i would suggest that many of these people should let go of the fact that they didn't get the $75 they were promised!<br /><br />ed wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain. in-fact that was all he lived for. you may giggle when you see ed's films, but somehow you are aware that you are laughing with him, and not at him. <br /><br />but, i digress... back to the film at hand. if you are expecting a film about edward d. wood jr., you won't get it here. if you want a film about cranky bitter old actors, this is the film for you!
