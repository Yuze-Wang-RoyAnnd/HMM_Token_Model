cedric kahn's films have been character-based, rather than action-based (i'm thinking of l'ennui and feux rouges) so it is jarring to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some plodding attempts to give character to succo. i don't find stefano cassetti to be an interesting actor; he reminds me of pro athletes who are coaxed into movies, like bret favre. that blank stare looks like a really vicious deer caught in the headlights. a real actor would have forced us to reflect more on succo's personality, rather than admiring his skill at carjacking.<br /><br />the little acting there is comes mainly from isild le besco as the needy schoolgirl succo takes by storm. the interview at the police office is a marvel of bland obstinacy with a little fear of the future blended in. le besco apart, there is little to recommend this film.
