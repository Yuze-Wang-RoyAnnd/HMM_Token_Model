the plot sounded like it had promise. to be honest i did not watch the entire movie. after about an hour into the movie i had to make a decision. is this movie worth watching until it conclusion? the answer was clearly no! it was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from a different species without rejecting it. nor the premise that he was being chased by secret government authorities for an human / wolf transplant. it was because the movie was badly written, acting lacked emotion and i did not understand the several dream sequences with the wolves and buffaloes. when he was running to the zoo with a dog pack and leaving them at the front of the zoo gate the saying "if you can't run with the big dogs don't leave the porch" kept running through my bored mind. save yourself the time and skip this movie. i can guarantee if you do dare to watch it you will sit there slack jawed as i did wondering why anyone waste money, time, energy and effort to make this insulting outrage to american cinema.
