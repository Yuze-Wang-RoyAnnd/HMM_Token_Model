this was among the stupidest and preachiest of the anti-nuke films out of the 1980s.<br /><br />the idea that a kid and a basketball star could "change the world" is pretty far-fetched, given how many "children's peace marches" and "celebrity protests" there were and are.<br /><br />but the idea that the soviet union would agree to a total nuclear disarmament, because some apparatchik kids learned of a "silent protest" in the west, is ludicrous.<br /><br />what ended the cold war? america's tough, dare i say "reaganesque" stance and the internal failures of socialism. it was not the peace marches, the "die-ins" or films like "amazing grace & chuck", "miracle mile", or "testament".
