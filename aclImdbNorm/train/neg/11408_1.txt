this was just plain terrible. i read this book for school, i made as on all of the tests, and to see it like this! my teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it, and it was worse than leonard part 6, plan 9 from outer space, and hudson hawk put together. the thing that made this film so terrible was enough reasons to want to kill yourself over. first of all, it was made on hallmark. second, the acting was terrible. third, it was like completely different from the book. literally, it was so bad i asked myself to be excused. basically, i would rather watch basic instinct 2 than watch this. take my advice, don't watch this film. no one would want to watch this. it was horrible. horrible!
