shiri appleby is the cutest little embodiment of evil turned good girl demon-kicking buffy clone, elle. but i'm getting ahead of myself, you see lilith was the first woman made by god as a companion to adam. but she got all uppity evil feminist so god banished her from eden. a clandestine order known as the fath captures her but doesn't kill her, so now with amnesia (which is not really explained that well) lilith (now elle) is free to become the aforementioned buffy-clone who has to battle with a mad scientist who got an injection of lilith's blood. <br /><br />if the previous paragraph sounded hideously convoluted, that's because it is. the movie is also dull, generic, and for a film with a plot steeped in theology it doesn't seem to know a lick about it. this bargain basement lousy-cgied movie was apparently a failed series pilot. all i can say to the fact that it didn't get picked up is a resounding amen.<br /><br />my grade: d-<br /><br />dvd extras: commentary by writer/director bill platt and co-writer chris regina; and stills gallery; video effects samples: before & after (it also has an "also available" selection that you would think would lead you to some trailers, but nope on dvd covers for other films, which is a stupid idea)<br /><br />dvd-rom extras: final shooting script and deleted scenes transcript both in pdf format
