this show was laughably bad. the writing sucked, the dialog sucked. the guy who played craig couldn't act his way out of a paper sack. being it was on thursday night, this was definitely great to watch with some beers. cool music, bad acting, poor writing, all came together for my entertainment.<br /><br />it was a drama/unintentional comedy. i don't care what happened to any of the characters, they were all boring and stupid. the first five episodes were the worst, since they couldn't reveal who the victim was, they had to write the dialog around it, which was terrible. i mean, the eulogy at the funeral was ridiculous. actually, all the scenes that occurred in the present were utterly horrible.<br /><br />so, let's review. everything happening in present time sucked. the flashback scenes, only the writing, dialog and craig's acting sucked. the music ruled though.
