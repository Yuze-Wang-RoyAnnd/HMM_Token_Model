"dracula ii:ascension" is the story of a group of medical students who come across the body of dracula.when a mysterious stranger appears and offers the students $30 million to harvest the body and steal its blood for auction,it's an offer they can hardly refuse.soon the students also find themselves relentlessly pursued by a vampire killer from the vatican!"dracula ii:ascension" is a slightly entertaining horror film that has many flaws.the characters are one-dimensional and the acting is pretty average.there are some good gore effects like really cool double decapitation scene,but there is not enough violence for my liking.the film becomes quickly boring and forgettable and there is absolutely no suspense.so if you like modern vampire flicks give it a look.i prefer atmospheric vampire chillers from 60's and early 70's like "lips of blood","the brides of dracula" or "lemora:a child's tale of supernatural" to name only a few.4 out of 10.
