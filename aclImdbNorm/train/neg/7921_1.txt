the plot of corpse grinders 2 is very much similar to the original corpse grinders, what is left that is different from the other film consists of weird aliens.<br /><br />it is my belief that this film would be the #1 worst film on imdb - if anyone had actually watched it. the plot is disconnected and, in several (way too many) instances, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. the real wonder here is why in the world was this sequel created to such an unsuccessful and horrendous (but still somewhat better) film.<br /><br />i would highly recommend this film if you enjoy watching terrible movies for a good laugh.
