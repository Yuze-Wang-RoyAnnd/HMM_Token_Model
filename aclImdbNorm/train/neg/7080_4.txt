this movie could had been an interesting character study and could had given some insight on its subject but real problem with this movie is that it doesn't have any of this in it. it doesn't give any insight-, or solutions to the problem. it's just the portrayal of 'old' male sex addict and the problems this is creating for his every day normal life and family. why would you want to watch this? it's all so totally pointless and meaningless.<br /><br />it also really doesn't help that the main character is some wrinkly 50+ year old male. you'll have a hard time identifying yourself- and sympathize for him. he just seems like a dirty old playboy, who is an a constant hunt for woman and sex. he has all kinds of sexual intercourse's about 3 times a day with different woman and not just only with prostitutes.<br /><br />it also doesn't have a bad visual style, though it all feels a bit forced. but nevertheless it's all better looking than most other direct-to-video productions. who knows, if the film-makers had been given better material to work with, the movie would had deserved a better faith.<br /><br />the story really gets ridicules at times. there are really some pointless plot-lines that are often more laughable than they were obviously supposed to be. i'm talking about for instance the whole ordell plot-line. things get worse once they movie starts heading toward the ending. also the whole way the story is being told, cutting back and forth between the events that happened and the main character's sessions with his psychiatrist feels a bit cheap and simple.<br /><br />but as far as bad movies are concerned, this just isn't one of them. it's not really any better or worse than any other random straight-to-video flick, with similar concepts.<br /><br />still seems weird and quite amazing that they managed to cast nastassja kinski and ed begley jr. in such a simple small insignificant production as this one is. guess they were really desperate for work and money.<br /><br />4/10
