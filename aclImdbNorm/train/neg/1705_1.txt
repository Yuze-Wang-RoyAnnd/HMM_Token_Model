a terrible amateur movie director (no, not todd sheets), his new friend and sister explore a cave. the friend and sister fall in and get rescued. meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their 'turf'. whatever the heck that means. this film and i use the term very loosely is so bad that it's.. well bad. the humor is painfully unfunny, the "action" merely sad. now i've seen some atrociously awful 'horror' films in my time & failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low-budget films, yet i still weep openly for anyone who choose to sit through this. only for the most hardened maschocists amongst you. but the rest run away fast!!<br /><br />my grade: f
