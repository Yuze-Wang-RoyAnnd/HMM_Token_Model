it was a good story, but not very well told. i liked the themes and the main story line, which wasn't as clear as it could have been. maybe there was too much going on and a lack of ability to reign it all in. the acting was okay to cheesy, some were stronger than others and even the stronger actors had their moments of lesser quality acting. it took me a couple of months to get through the entire movie because it didn't keep my attention and the flow was just bad. i only just finished watching it and i'm glad i did as the movie finally gets moving and has some continuity toward the end. again, a good story, but the delivery was sub par. would recommend it for the story line and maybe a little eye candy, and i do mean, a little.
