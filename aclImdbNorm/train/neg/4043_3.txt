the film begins with promise, but lingers too long in a sepia world of distance and alienation. we are left hanging, but with nothing much else save languid shots of grave and pensive male faces to savour. certainly no rope up the wall to help us climb over. it's a shame, because the concept is not without merit.<br /><br />we are left wondering why a loving couple - a father and son no less - should be so estranged from the real world that their own world is preferable when claustrophobic beyond all imagining. this loss of presence in the real world is, rather too obviously and unnecessarily, contrasted with the son having enlisted in the armed forces. why not the circus, so we can at least appreciate some colour? we are left with a gnawing sense of loss, but sadly no enlightenment, which is bewildering given the film is apparently about some form of attainment not available to us all.
