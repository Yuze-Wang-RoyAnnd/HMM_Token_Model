my girlfriend has the habit of going to blockbuster and choosing movies no-one has ever heard anything about. admittedly, at times, it has led to some fun discoveries. often times, the best that can be said is they definitely run an hour and a half.<br /><br />she brought home "advice from a caterpillar." she was excited because the box said it was funny. lucky for us, the propaganda on the boxes never lie.<br /><br />this movie was an exercise in patience. this is one of those movies where, unless you are a pretentious and shallow person who likes watching movies about yourself, you will hate every character in the movie. until the introduction of the one nice character. which the lead annoying pretentious character will fall in love with and act in such a way that, in the real world, would drive anyone away.<br /><br />mild spoilers from here on<br /><br />so a bunch of emotionally vapid, stuck-up, pretentious artists swear off love and find success in their careers. then, they meet a nice, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving character (an almost perfect guy). we then watch the woman, the annoyingly pretentious artist (in her 30's?) freak out as she falls in love. so she tries to flee from the nice, intelligent, emotionally mature man and stay with the married man with whom she's been having great but empty sex. she is rude to the man and does everything in her power to drive him away. in the real world, she would have been quite successful. i certainly wanted to flee from her and i wasn't even in a relationship with her!<br /><br />although its nice that the man 'fought for his love', i never wanted her to have him. (nor did my girlfriend) she didn't deserve him. and, why i wonder, did the director think that the 'almost perfect guy' should be punished by having to win a relationship with her? when the artist was asking the 'almost perfect guy' to leave, we were screaming for him to leave too. there's a problem with a movie when the heroine of the film is so annoying, childish and stupid that you want her to fail.<br /><br />beyond that, let me say that andy dick made me laugh a few times even though his character was also pretentious to the point of annoyance. regarding the other characters, they were well acted, morally bankrupt and annoying characters.<br /><br />it is a comedy and i can say i did laugh a few times in the film. unfortunately, not much laughing happened until the last 10 minutes or so. but by the time i had those laughs, i had been praying for the movie to end for far too long. i needed to get these vapid characters out of my life.<br /><br />if you want to watch people you hate struggle with a love for people they don't deserve, then this is the movie for you.
