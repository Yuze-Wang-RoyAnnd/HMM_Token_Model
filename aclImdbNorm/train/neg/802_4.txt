like so many media experiments, this amateurish effort contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary. in the 5+ years since it was released, the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in software development, and i found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason, i imagine... the director clearly is a fan of hitchcock, and it's too bad that the film was not better executed, but in fact, it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction, including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention. one can almost see the exclamation points and capital letters on a yellowing page.<br /><br />i have to admit i found it rather entertaining for all these reasons and more. sometimes the slick has less to offer us, and i would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for education purposes. oh yes--and even though the seams showed and it creaked a lot, my heart rate went up, and i was reluctant to get up and take a break.
