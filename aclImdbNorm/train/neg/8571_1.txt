penn takes the time to develop his characters, and we almost care about them. however there are some real problems with the story here, we see no real motivation for the evil brother's behavior, and the time line is screwed up. supposedly set in 1963, the music is late 60s/early 70s. the references and dialogue is 70s/80s. the potential for a powerful climax presents itself, and penn allows it to slip away. but even with all these difficulties it is worth the watch, but not great.
