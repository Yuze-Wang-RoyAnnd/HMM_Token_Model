a famous show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend. suddenly, she kills him and runs away while an old lady gets a heart attack. the name of the female assassin is sawa. she is still going to school and works for an vicious criminal, akai, who is sleeping with her. one day sawa finds out he killed her parents..<br /><br />------- <br /><br />even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this vicious action thriller is an disappointing gore fest. "kite" has style, but it is still trash. the weird plot about a teenage girl that kills people as an assassin tried to be scary and touching at the same time, only causing the story to fall flat on it's face. one of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good/bad heroine sawa is falling together with a bodyguard from a building, yet the dramatic structure isn't nearly as good orchestrated and the director yasoumi umetsu's weird and grotesque animation of the character's faces is awful. not only that, the intercourse sequences are just simply creepy.<br /><br />grade: 3/10
