do not see this movie if you value your mind. at the end of our collective viewing, me and my friends estimated that we each lost 5% of our brains during its course. the only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designer.<br /><br />most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth. i realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion, this movie has bred a deep hatred within me. i hate this movie so very, very much.<br /><br />some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously. if only it didn't take itself seriously. but it does. the plot is a warmed over version of blade runner-esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies. the dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless but often literally painful. whoopee goldberg isn't even trying, but george newbern as the voice of theodore rex is like fingernails on the soul. and whether its juliet landua with her off again on again british accent or richard roundtree (aka shaft) as the blustering commissioner, you will sink into an ever increasing sense of incredulity and disillusionment.<br /><br />i recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall.
