a typical lanza flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify lanza's mgm contract at the time.<br /><br />as reported by member lastliberal (above) grayson could not stand lanza because of his obscene advances towards her off (and sometimes on) camera. in addition, his gutter mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were intolerable. after doing their second (and last) film together, "toast of new orleans", the normally quiet grayson stormed into louie b. mayer's office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with lanza again
