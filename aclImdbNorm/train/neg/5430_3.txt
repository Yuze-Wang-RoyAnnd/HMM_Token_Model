priyadarshan- whenever a person heard his name, his first thought would be 'comedy'. that is what this man is known for, or rather, was known for. after giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like hungama, hera pheri and hunchul, his train derailed slowly with movies like chupke chupke and a few others whose names i can't recollect for now. now with hideous films like dhol, the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be- 'torture'.<br /><br />dhol is a mixture of bad, unfunny toilet jokes, somewhat of drama, poor suspense and idiocracy. the only good thing about dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny, though not witty, and secondly, except for kunal khemu and the hysterical grandma, the acting was decent. <br /><br />speaking of the acting, i felt that rajpal yadav and sharman joshi were at the top (if you compare them with the others in the movie), then came tusshar kapoor, then tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above. the flaw in kunal khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting. the grandma, firstly resembled a ghost, plus she was not funny at all but rather silly.<br /><br />the plot was the same, seen before one. four boys behind girls and in need of money, but with a few twists. there is a 'bad' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb. and at last, the good wins over the bad and everything is fine. the idea of having a dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty.<br /><br />the worst thing about the movie is its length. after an hour or so, you get exhausted and want to leave the theater. but being a critic, it is my responsibility to tolerated the whole two and half hours of the movie. the movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated again and again and the situations are perennial just at a different place.<br /><br />if your mother-in-law has arrived to your house and starts mocking you at everything, then send her for this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10.
