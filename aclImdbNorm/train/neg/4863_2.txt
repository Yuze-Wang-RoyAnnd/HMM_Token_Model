why oh why don't blockbuster movies simply stick to their selling point? everyone in the cinema, young and old, was there to see talking animals make jokes, and whilst they did that we were all happy... and then, as with lost in space, came the two killer blows - plot and sentiment. who really cared what happened to the tiger or whether eddie murphy made up with his daughter? not me, that's for sure.
