poorly structured, badly written, loaded with cliches and flat dialogue. not a single scene shines. the actors struggle with a painfully dull scenario that manages to completely avoid any surprises, plot twists or conflict. you know from the first ten minutes where it's going.<br /><br />for a movie set in ny, it has almost no feeling for the city. there are a dozen other indie movies that manage to make it seem magical on a small budget. this one seems like it was shot in toronto.<br /><br />if you cast natasha henstridge, why dress her in baggy sweaters? why make vartan look boring and drab? where's the attraction? i felt like i was watching a sub-par christian movie of the week it was so asexual and moralizing.<br /><br />steven feder's big success is that he convinced people to make this bland movie.
