this programme bugs me! there is no humour to it and is far too serious to be called "fun"! it's just far too educational for my liking! the characters are very stereotyped and unappealing. the plots are redundant and the morals are just repeated over and over again. where's the fun in it? also i feel this has been on the bbc for far too long and is broadcast way too much. does it really need to have a slot on t.v every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes? i think it's time that the bbc starting bringing back some of their older shows like: inspector gadget, bananaman, the smurfs, snorks, moomins, the raccoons and count duckula other than continually giving contracts to these newer shows! i thought the bbc where bring back danger mouse, so what's going on with that?! 3/10
