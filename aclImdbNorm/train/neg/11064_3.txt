well, it is hard to add comment after reading what is already here but i feel i must say something. i wasn't exactly looking for 'a splatterfest' as someone puts it or even 'blood and guts/gore'. i have some respect for the victims relatives although i really felt the filmaker didn't. -they were nameless, faceless and meaningless. just a vessel for dahmers sexual antics.<br /><br />i watched this film with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think 'what makes a guy be a serial killer?' as well as wondering the specifics about the dahmer story, of which i know very little. people here seem to think that the movie didn't have to cover the events of the dahmer story.. i.e. his history, what happened when he got caught, the aftermath, etc but it is important! you see, i assume if you are american you will know all of this. we do not all live in america. to tell this story about such a man as he obviously was, requires that at least some of the history and actual events are told/shown. this doesn't mean blood and guts, there are ways of showing horrific things in a movie by implication or clever filming without resorting to gore. without even touching upon some of what he did (i found out more about him reading the user comments on this site!), the movie felt like a void. a moment in time with very little substance. i would like to know if there is a film about the real dahmer because with its lack of direction, very slow pace that never changes, strange portrayal of homosexuality and the very unfortunate lack of any attempt at an ending, this movie is poor. i would not recommend to anyone that they waste the time it takes to watch it. a definite 1 out of 10 (for the acting!)
