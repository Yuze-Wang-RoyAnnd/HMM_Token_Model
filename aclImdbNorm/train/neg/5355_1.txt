now i don't hate cheap movies. i just don't see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad's camcorder. if i rent a movie, i want it to be a movie, not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some minidv - tapes.<br /><br />maybe i hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great, and it wasn't. maybe i hate it because it's cheap, has the dumbest plot ever, the most unrealistic characters ever and the really, really, really worst showdown in the history of films ever. even tom savini can't save this.<br /><br />seriously, this one is a complete waste of time.
