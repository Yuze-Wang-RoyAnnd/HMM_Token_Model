i think jason lee has huge potential, but this was the wrong vehicle in which to attempt to break out as a star. the plot is awful, the comedy is awful. i laughed twice, i think for relief, because in retrospect, they were fairly lame jokes. i found myself scared for the future of fletch, and had to console myself that it was the film that was flawed, not lee.<br /><br />julia stiles and selma blair are hot, but i recommend looking at the still photos on this website to figure that out, instead of this film. save your time. 1 star.
