i sat through this at gencon only because it was quiet and i could nap. what a waste of time. beverly d'angelo and william katt? wtf? were the lady who played flo and abe vigoda busy or something?<br /><br />truly, a piece of unfunny garbage. the characters were stereotypical without meaning to (i think...) and wooden, most of them seemed like they were on autopilot. the so-called "hilarious" situations described in some of the other so-called reviews were so hackneyed, i weeped for the writers.<br /><br />i'm confused as to how anyone can find this worth their time, seriously. i'm only giving it 3 out of 10 because in order to be a 2 or 1, it would need to be either five-hours long or feature more kelly lebrock.
