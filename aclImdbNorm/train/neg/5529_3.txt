revolt of the zombies starts with armand louque (dean jagger) trying to convince general duval (george cleveland) that his mate tsiang (william crowell) is a priest who has the power to hypnotise people & render them under his control turning them into mindless zombies (a bit like the people i work with really). anyway, tsiang is murdered by colonel mazovia (roy d'arcy) but fails to gain the knowledge of turning people into zombies. an expedition has been set up by general duval to hunt for the secret since tsiang ain't going to tell them much anymore. general duval heads the expedition along with his daughter claire (dorothy stone) who is engaged to louque who also comes along. during the expedition claire dumps louque for his mate clifford grayson (robert noland) at which louque isn't too pleased about. in a way that could only happen in a film louque finds the secret to turning people into zombies by himself & starts to use his new found power to gain revenge on claire & clifford... co-written & directed by victor halperin revolt of the zombies has a bad reputation & after watching it i can see why. the script by halperin, howard higgin & rollo lloyd all uncredited, has a good central idea but is killed stone cold dead by being dull & as exciting as watching paint dry. nothing much happens for ages & then nothing much happens afterwards either. how halperin depicts his zombies is different to that which most modern audiences would consider to be a zombie, these zombies are just brainwashed people & filmgoing audiences would have to wait over thirty years before george a.romero would define what a zombie is now thought as in night of the living dead (1968). at only about an hour in length revolt of the zombies still feels too long. technically the film is ok considering it was made 70 years ago, the black & white cinematography is adequate although some of the scenes look like they were shot against a photo of the background location. the acting is wooden & largely unimpressive. revolt of the zombies might have been hot stuff in 1936 but it hasn't dated well & in 2005 it's an absolute chore to sit through. i believe the film is now public domain as it turns up on lots of ultra cheap dvd compilations & budget labels, but it's still not worth watching no matter how cheap you can get it for.
