i rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend or myself had ever seen it, even though we had heard from a mutual friend how "great it was".<br /><br />now, i am pretty conservative in my views, but i knew going in it would be pretty liberal given who directed it. i figured before the movie started michael douglas would play a compassionate popular liberal beloved by the masses, and there would be a stodgy conservative opponent as his antagonist. but i thought thats where the political statement would begin and end.<br /><br />ok, the plot was solid: single president falls for a lobbyist. ok, this has potential i thought to be pretty entertaining, since the plot was unique. but then the movie turned into a liberal infomercial. the movie became more about gun control and environmental issues than it did about the relationship between the president and sydney(annette bening).<br /><br />there were several ridiculous premises in this movie: 1) the character sydney playing this six figure lobbyist who is a "closer". could she have been more flighty? she was constantly disorganized and seemed in awe of everything. hardly a "closer". i am an sales, and she could not "close" selling a glass of water to a man dying of thirst.<br /><br />2) secondly, is there anything more ridiculous than richard dreyfuss playing a right wing fanatic? this is the most liberal man in hollywood and her is playing some right wing ideologue. give me a break. i liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible.<br /><br />3) the speech at the end was simply ludicrous. the line about "i am a proud card carrying member of the aclu" was a joke. first, no president would ever admit something like that, being an active member of an ultra fringe group. second, why even bring something like that up. you just alienated off over half the movie going audience who is moderate or conservative.<br /><br />i thought the plot was great and unique. i thought michael douglas was a good choice as president. but the movie went from being a "movie" to a left wing political statement, which is why the movie failed.<br /><br />its a shame to see a great plot ruined by hollywood having to force their political views on the audience
