man oh man! what a piece of crummy film-making! but this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though i hate to admit it. they showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time. where i grew up in san jose, california (right on the border of cupertino) we had this thing called the g channel on our cable system. and they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again. wanda nevada was one of those movies. i fell in lust and love with the young brooke shields and loved her dopey adventures in the grand canyon in the 1940s. the script makes almost no sense, the direction is poor, the few highlights are that henry fonda makes an appearance, a lot of dialog that's so bad it's good and a nice carole king song played over the end credits. maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick. and hey, everybody knows there ain't no gold in the grand canyon!
