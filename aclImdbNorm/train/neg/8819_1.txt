this is without a doubt the worst most idiotic horrible piece o' crap i have ever watched.<br /><br />this movies plot is that some guy goes crazy and dresses up as santa claus and kills people because he saw his mother give his father oral sex while he was dressed as santa clause. that is why he went insane? is it just me or is that the worst damn reason for someone to go insane like ever? and that's not the only thing. i'm being serious when i say nothing happens in this damn movie. nothing until like 1 hour and 15 minutes of it have gone by.<br /><br />there's an entire friggin scene where he glues a friggin santa beard on to him. it's a friggin minute long. who the hell wants to see that? however i must say the ending of this movie made me crap myself laughing at it. so if you see this movie on tv or something come back in like 1 hour and 20 minutes just to watch without a doubt the worst ending in all of cinematic history. and i'm serious about that.<br /><br />it's not even so good its bad, it's tedious, it's idiotic, it made me want to break the vcr. it's just not worth your time also i'm sure every other review mentioned this but the actress who played the mother on home improvement was in this movie for a split second. you want to know how bad this movie is? i'd rather watch home improvement for sixty six hours then even look at this movies cover ever again.
