by now you should already know about this film, the jessica simpson "bomb" that pretty much went straight to video (limited, anemic theatrical run). basically, ms. simpson's katie travels from a small town in oklahoma to visit her boyfriend, to surprise him, only to find him in bed with another woman. she is stranded, but has one friend (rachel leigh cook, whom i wish we saw more often in film), who lets her stay. katie ends up getting a job via two conniving co-workers (penelope ann miller and the always amusing andy dick) who are just using katie to get the president of the firm (larry miller) ousted. this is strictly a b movie, its not meant to be profound. jessica simpson is not a great actress by any means, but she is pretty much beautiful and never truly annoying. the film is watchable in that its not an abomination, but its throwaway fluff. in a cameo, penny marshall is funny (a subtle in-joke about milwaukee made me chuckle), and there is a funny scene involving norwegian priests (don't read too much into this). so, not horrible, but easy to skip. your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does. again, not good, but not a profound disaster.
