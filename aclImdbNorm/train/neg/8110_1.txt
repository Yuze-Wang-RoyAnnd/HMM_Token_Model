i think phillip kaufman read the cliff's notes version of the kundera novel and then set about making this film. okay, of course it won't have the punch of the original. kundera's novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept, his ability to step in and out of stories he constructs. this film does not even try! the one dream sequence of tereza's, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever. also, and this is perhaps a lesser point, daniel day-lewis looks a lot like ben stiller in this (i know it's not really a valid complaint, but hey). a perfect example of the hollywood-izing of otherwise fine literature.
