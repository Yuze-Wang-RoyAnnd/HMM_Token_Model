this is a badly made, poor remake of bimalda's classic parineeta. the story is based on sarat chandra's book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original. well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but not sham creativity. the acting by everyone is affected and the entire movie is a sham. shekar's father's choice of words in abusing lolita ( balan ) sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. again the scene where shekhar ( saif ) slaps lolita is quite out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters, is quite jarring to the senses, and could have been easily avoided. similarly the sex scene between saif and balan is quite unbecoming the movie and a cheap gimmick to attract the audience. when a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys it's spirit, the work falls apart. the song "piyu bole" is quite ok. another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father. this is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit. on these counts this movie deserves 3 stars. the song and dance by rekha smacks of artifice and it is a put on. the song is tuneful but i remember having heard it somewhere before and if iam not mistaken the tune appears to have been plagiarized. <br /><br />well, agreed the times have changed from then to now. but then this movie is not even reflective of the modern times.<br /><br />this is what happens when the modern bollywood film makers get increasingly obsessed with impressing the nris and grabbing the lucrative nri entertainment market. such movies end up neither belonging to india nor to any other part of the world.
