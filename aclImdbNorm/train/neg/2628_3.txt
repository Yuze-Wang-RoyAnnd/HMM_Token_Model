the director sidney j. furie has created in hollow point a post-modern absurdist masterpiece that challenges and constantly surprises the audience. <br /><br />sidney j. furie dares to ask the question of what happens to the tired conventional traditionalist paradigms of 'plot' and 'characterisation' when you remove the crutches of 'motivation' and 'reason'. <br /><br />the result leads me to say that my opinion of him could not possibly get any higher.<br /><br />one and a half stars.<br /><br />p.s. nothing in this movie makes any sense, the law enforcement agents are flat out unlikeable and the organised criminals are full on insane.
