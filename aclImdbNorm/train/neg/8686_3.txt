i am marking this as a "spoiler" only because of some of my comments of the show's content, not to the content itself.<br /><br />as i read the comments it is apparent that those republicans somehow tolerate the show, but disdain it, while the democrats seems to relish in its so called truthfulness. one reader even (so it seems) actually indicates that he believes these events did or could have happened when bush was in grade school.<br /><br />but as to the content as i see it, trying to be neutral, is that the group that made this series must actually be really bush haters. in the episode that i saw last, s02e03, it showed that the program must have been put together long before mccain became the front runner for the nomination; because, the other former front runners are all featured.<br /><br />another thing that caught my attention, was the use of add in closets. i thought that the series must have been made in europe of for sure not in the u.s.a., because i know of no home the u.s.a. that does not have built in closets, and most likely in the homes of the artists.<br /><br />as i watch the show, yes i do get caught up in it, i am amazed to see what must be a terrific desire of the writers to do what they can to embarrass our president. sure there are problems as most american will agree, but that is no reason to be so hateful in public displays seen around the world. perhaps the trend has now been set by this show and network, so that if obama or hillary got in, would they continue to produce and air the same sort of "humor" about them?<br /><br />just one more comment on a commentator's remarks. if there had been some sort of change in the election back in 2000, according to that writer, he was so sure that there would be a completely different acceptable president. wow, wishful thinking on his part. as far as 911 events, i do believe that it was set in motion back when clinton was president, and i can't see how if gore was president anything would be much different.
