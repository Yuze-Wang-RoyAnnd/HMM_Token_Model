oh, man, how low serials had fallen as by 1952! this dull thing is precisely the kind of serial that annoyed annie wilkes (from misery). not only the heroes escape the traps by adding scenes that weren't there in the previous chapter (and that couldn't possibly be there - tell me that when the baddies blow up the plain in episode 7 to 8 they wouldn't see the characters jump), but i think this serial has the world's record of stock footage. i mean, most of it is stock footage! and not just from another serials (apparently all the flying sequences come from king of the rocket men, and the cool "molten rocks" scenes of episode 2 to 3 is from adventures of captain marvel), but from itself! the whole "trip to the moon" sequence (which is probably the shortest ever, it's 30 seconds long and the characters never seem to leave earth's atmosphere) from episode 1 is repeated in episode 8! and episode 10 is all scenes from previous episodes! (ever wondered why mst3k never did episodes 10, 11 and 12? well, they had to stop after 9 so they didn't have to do the whole thing again!).<br /><br />don't get me started on the science factor. prepare to see the sunniest moon ever! and moon men that can not breathe on their own world? what were they smoking? <br /><br />and if this is not enough, it's too talky and the stunts (usually the best thing in serials) are few and far. visually-wise, am i the only one who thinks that commando cody's bullet-shaped (or is it lemon-shaped) helmet is totally ridiculous-looking? the rocketeer's was way cooler, no matter how bad that movie was (and man, was it awful). the tank-like vehicle isn't much better, it looks like a bunch of kids made it for halloween. the only positive thing i can think of about it is that the actor who plays the hero is homely instead of the usual muscular hunk (hey, everybody has the right to be an hero!), but then he's so unappealing...<br /><br />not even worth watching for nostalgia's sake. see captain marvel instead. 2/10.<br /><br />(btw, check out the memorable quotes section for a real women's lib pearl).
