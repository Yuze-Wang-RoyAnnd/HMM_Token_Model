it's curious that the two stars of meet the people were a pair of movie stars who went into the new medium of television and became even bigger successes and who both went into the production end of things and enjoyed tycoon status on the small screen. lucille ball however was not a major star, that would come with television. as for dick powell he desperately wanted to get out of doing films like meet the people and his career salvation would be coming in his next film.<br /><br />i think the only reason that dick powell did the film was because a young player from mgm was cast in a specialty number and he was seeing her at the time. his private time with june allyson was far better than what we see on the screen. powell looks crashingly bored and can't summon up any kind of emotion at all.<br /><br />he was probably tired of doing these musicals with silly plots, the kind he ran from warner brothers from. the original show meet the people was not a book show, it was a revue and it ran in the 1940-41 season on broadway for 160 performances. when mgm bought it, they scrapped everything but the title and the title song. the rest of the score was patched together from various and sundry songwriters, none of the songs is memorable. odd when you consider some of the source material is from burton lane, e.y. harburg, harold arlen, and rodgers&hart. these guys just must have emptied the trunk for material.<br /><br />the plot is sillier than even most of the musical propaganda pieces of the time. powell is the writer of a revue called meet the people and he's a shipyard worker who wins a lottery date with movie star lucille ball. she's interested, he's interested, they're both interested in the revue, but creative differences keep them apart of course until the finale. that's the film in a nutshell.<br /><br />mgm did give powell and ball some good musical acts which are the main reason for watching meet the people. the big bands of vaughn monroe and spike jones are here and the highlight of the film for me is bert lahr dressed in a commodore's suit like lou costello had in the dream sequence in in the navy. the song heave ho is written by arlen and harburg who wrote for lahr, the courage number from the wizard of oz. and as just about everyone in the world has seen that film, you have an idea of heave ho is like.<br /><br />dick powell's next film was murder my sweet in which he finally bid a not so fond adieu to musicals. and lucy would have to wait for television before the world got to see what she really could do.
