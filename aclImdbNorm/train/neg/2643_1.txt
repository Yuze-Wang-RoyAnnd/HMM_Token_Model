this, for lack of a better term, movie is lousy. where do i start......<br /><br />cinemaphotography - this was, perhaps, the worst i've seen this year. it looked like the camera was being tossed from camera man to camera man. maybe they only had one camera. it gives you the sensation of being a volleyball.<br /><br />there are a bunch of scenes, haphazardly, thrown in with no continuity at all. when they did the 'split screen', it was absurd. everything was squished flat, it looked ridiculous.<br /><br />the color tones were way off. these people need to learn how to balance a camera. this 'movie' is poorly made, and poorly done.<br /><br />the plot - you got to be kidding. if i was an ss agent, i'd sue the producers. looked like the marks brothers with radios and guns. sutherland was in his '24' mode - i can see this for free. eva longoria would have been better with a little less on, and a lot more showing. as an action bimbo she wasn't much.<br /><br />i couldn't see a real plot, other than douglas boinking the presidents wife. never did say why the mercenaries were trying to kill the pres. i just don't see the president of the united states running for his life in the utility tunnels of a building, like a rat in a maze. p-l-e-a-s-e.<br /><br />hollywood is dead. this movie is the proof. i like 'the big screen'. have since i was a kid. many more 'movies' like this and i'll quit going. whats the matter hollywood, made so many chick flicks, forget how to make a real movie? if i owned a theater, i'd start running the old movies. the one with real actors, good story lines - and good cinemaphotography.<br /><br />this 'movie' is a dog. don't waste your time or money on it. i rate this 'movie' a zero! douglas isn't suited for this role. i can over look his age, but his just is to much of a wimp to carry this off.
