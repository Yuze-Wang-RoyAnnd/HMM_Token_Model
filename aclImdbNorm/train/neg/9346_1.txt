this film was a yawn from titles to credits, it's boring to the point of tedium and the acting is wooden and stilted! admittedly this was director richard jobson directing debut, but who on earth green-lit a script as poorly developed as this one? looks like another money down the drain government project (scottish screen are credited surprise, surprise). i nearly fell asleep three times and my review will unfortunately have to be more restrained than this one. please, please mister jobson what ever you've been doing prior to directing this sedative of a film, go back to it!
