this show is unbelievable in that . . . what it represents and what it focuses on and . . . words cannot describe how insane et is. they will report anything. if a celebrity is even remotely indirectly connected to the story et will report on it. if a dog poop in the tom cruise's yard they will report on it. if a celebrity dies . . . they will talk about it for weeks on end to the point where the public envy that celebrity. if a celebrity is on trial . . . et will report it for months on end. there is no end to what this show will reports and no time frame that dictates how long they will focus on a story. is it even considered legitimates reporting? the reports are so dang annoying too, with harsh rambling voices and end with an unnecessary pause to convey a sense of important. i cannot watch this show without questioning humanity's existence. et is one big reason i avoid pre-evening shows in general. i regret that imdb can only allow a minimum of one star rating and not zero or even in the negatives. for this show deserve -10 stars.
