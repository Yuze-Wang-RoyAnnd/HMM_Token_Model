spoilers throughout: <br /><br />the gettaway is mostly an action movie. and what action there is to!! shootouts, chases, dumpsters and much much more. it stars kim bassenger and alec baldwin as the mc coy's.<br /><br />this is a remake and i have not seen the original but really didn't care for this one at all although bassenger and baldwin have some nice screen chemistry. but the movie itself didn't do it for me.<br /><br />the gettaway became really tiresome really quickly. the plot is overshadowed by one fight/chase after another and as the violence keeps piling up, bassenger and baldwin retain their great looks no matter what perils they maybe in. in fact, by the end of the movie they almost look better then in the beginning. i don't think bassenger's eye makeup moves once during the whole picture.<br /><br />this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen, certainly not, but it isn't very good and unless one is an action movie purist i can't see really enjoying this movie because there's just not a lot here. the gettaway isn't terribly original either, and goes every way from unnecessarily brutal to rather dull. it really could have been better i think.<br /><br />bassenger and baldwin give ok performances but they don't have a lot to do except get chased and run for their lives. sometimes less is more, after seeing the same thing over and over again it gets stale. didn't enjoy this one to much.
