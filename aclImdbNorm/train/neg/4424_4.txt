uh oh! another gay film. this time it's showing the black side. bet your last dollar it's gonna have an unhappy ending! but why? with only less than a half dozen exceptions, all gay films have to end in death or an "addio" finale. it's like all the european film noir releases in the 40's, 50's, 60's, and 70's. the lead...male or female must die or ride off alone into oblivion. why in god's name must writers, directors, and producers have the audience leave the theatre feeling depressed? after all, it's supposed to be gay...not glum. maybe the category should be changed to a 'glum' film. a large percentage of gay relationships do last and the couples do ride off together into the sunset! no matter who writes or produces, he only shows the down side of gay life and gives the incorrect impression of gay lifestyle. this movie just proves my point. if you rent the dvd, take an antidepressant, for here comes another 'gay' film! this is wrong!
