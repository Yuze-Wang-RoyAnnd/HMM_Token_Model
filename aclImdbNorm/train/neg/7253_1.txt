we rented the dvd hoping for a good western. the film was pretty and the scenes reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. here are my problems with the film.<br /><br />in the first part, why exactly did the bad guy kill the mine owner? not really connected to the movie except to establish how bad he was and to have a hideout.<br /><br />the bank employee gone bad just acts too poorly to convincingly decide to hire killers to off his employers. at least keep us guessing. no character developed at all for the bank owners or the bank employee.<br /><br />very long delay in much of anything happening.<br /><br />absurd premise that martin still needed to see the judge after the gang confessed to killing the in-laws. even more absurd that he confesses to judge and judge will not listen to the sheriff guy. even more ridiculous that martin his hung and rope breaks then the sheriff takes him at gunpoint to finally head back to his town and save his wife from the bad bank employee. wouldn't he just return after the quick dispatch of the gang to save wife and arrest bad bank guy? just send the judge a note that gang confessed before being killed on trail????!!! overall, very sad acting and no point to movie.
