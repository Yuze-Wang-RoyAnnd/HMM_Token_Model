i read the book celestine prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie. be advised that the movie is loosely based on the book. many of the book's most interesting points do not even come out in the movie. it is a "b" movie at best. many events, characters, how the character interact and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur. the flow of events that in the book are very smooth, are choppy and fed to the view as though you a child. the character development is very poor. personnallities of the characters differ from those in the book. the direction is similar to a "b" horror flick. i understand that it would take six hours in film to present all that is in the book, but they screen play base missed many points. the casting was very good.
