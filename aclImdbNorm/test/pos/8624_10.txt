with what they had. john and carolyn were very private so the writers had to put together what they could. i really liked portia de rossi as carolyn, but jacqueline bisset's voice grated on my nerves. she should have used her regular voice. i would have preferred that the whole movie focus on john and carolyn instead of rehashing stuff we already know about john.
