"all men are guilty," says the chief of the police. "they're born innocent but it doesn't last." add this bit of nihilism to jean-pierre melville's fascination with the idea of the crook's code of honor and you have le cercle rouge. this code of honor among crooks, however, is not simply a clich'e; it's a figment of the imagination even when film moralists -- realistic moralists by their viewpoint, romantic moralists by most others' -- began to make movies on the subject. their theme is that it isn't what one does, but how one does it. we most often wind up with stories all about experienced men with their own sense of honor, stories where fate, fatalism and the code run things. <br /><br />for most of humanity, except screen writers and movie directors, this would seriously get in the way of living one's life, raising one's children and being a good friend. this mannered fatalism is something of a self-indulgent notion. le cercle rouge is, in my view, a classic film for people who may secretly enjoy the adventure of just missing the last bus home. but where melville's le samourai - criterion collection, in my opinion, is style dominating story, le cercle rouge manages the great trick of combining style with a strong story and with compelling actors. the point of the movie, in my view, is nonsense...but the movie itself is a first-class experience. <br /><br />melville's hopeless tale of three crooks -- cory (alain delon), vogel (gian-maria volonte) and jansen (yves montand) - is based on a bit of wisdom which is, maybe, attributed to the buddha: that all men who are destined to meet, will...along with their destiny they cannot change. maybe, because some believe melville himself came up with the wording if not the thought. either way, we know right at the start that this movie will not end happily, will depend upon fate and coincidence to set things up for us, and will leave us recalling the nihilistic philosophies we discovered and loved when we were in high school. once corey and vogel meet and then gather in the unique talents of jansen, we are off on a one-way ride to rob an exclusive, heavily protected jewelry story on the place vendome. the tension arises because we not only know the french police are after vogel, we also realize that some determined crooks are after corey. <br /><br />the great pleasure of the movie, for me, came from admiring the work that delon, volonte and montand brought to their characters, and the intelligent ruthlessness that andre bouvril brought to his character, the police captain mattei. melville hooked me as he developed these characters and their own situations; he built me up emotionally and then released me when he brought me to appreciate their probable fate and let me see see it happen. melville establishes his set pieces -- the escape from the train, the escape from the woods, the later shootout in the woods, the meetings with mattei and a man who refuses to inform -- with intriguing possibilities. he builds tension in all these cases by taking his time; a rare trait in movie making and an even rarer trait now. and melville takes the time to build up mattei as an individual. mattei is a rueful, experienced man. he's a loner. he has a set routine when he returns to his apartment -- he greets his three cats affectionately, he draws his bath and while the tub is filling he sets out food for them. i don't know who mattei is destined to meet, but i hope it's someone who likes cats. <br /><br />nihilism is always fashionable among some creative people and some critics. in most cases, i think it's a much harder task to set nihilism aside and to simply live one's life without damaging too many people. (and that's even more challenging to show compellingly in a film.) le cercle rouge is a movie which, for me, tells me little, but it is in its own way, i think, a beautifully put together film.
