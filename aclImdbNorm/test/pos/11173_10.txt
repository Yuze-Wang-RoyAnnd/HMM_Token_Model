by now, the game's stale, right?<br /><br />the jokes have been done. its all over. the creative genius which drove this game for the first two games was gone, after all.<br /><br />wrong.<br /><br />the game is still intact, the jokes are here, folks. sure, they're all rehash, but so was monkey island 2. and 1, for that matter.<br /><br />the difficulty is well placed, somewhere between the slightly easy 1 and the ridiculously hard 2. the ship fighting sub-game is badly innappropriate, in the tradition of sub-games. and this game has the best joke of the whole series. when asked for your membership card to an exclusive beach, always select "you don't need to see my identification." its worth the price of the game by itself.
