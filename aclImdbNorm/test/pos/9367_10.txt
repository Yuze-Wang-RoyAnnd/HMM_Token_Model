the real best picture of 1947 also deals with anti-semitism and is superior to elia kazan's gentlemen's agreement (the eventual winner at that year's academy awards) in practically every department. edmard dmytryk's near-perfect direction, john paxton's terse script and j. roy hunt's expert expressionist lighting are wonderfully abetted by a superb ensemble cast. although robert young (playing an easy-going, methodical and very likable cop) and robert mitchum (who actually does have the occasional throwaway witty remark) are the nominal stars of the film, it's oscar nominees robert ryan and gloria grahame - as well as paul kelly, in the small but pivotal role of grahame's pathetic husband - who give the film's most memorable characterizations; ryan proved so convincing as a homicidal racist that he was eventually typecast for a while, excelling in equally villainous roles in such films as act of violence (1948), caught (1948), the racket (1951), clash by night (1952), the naked spur (1953) and bad day at black rock (1955). the film is also notable for its atypical structure in that ryan's "flashback" sequence, a complete fabrication, is shot in a straightforward manner while the actual truth emerges from the hazy, distorted recollections of the real protagonist of the film who, furthermore, isn't even played by any of the film's stars! also, crossfire was originally to have treated homosexuality (as per richard brooks' original source novel, "the brick foxhole") but this taboo subject was unacceptable to the hays office at the time - a far cry from the situation we have today when (at least) 3 gay-themed films are in the running for this years' major oscars!<br /><br />the print utilized for warners' dvd transfer shows some regrettable signs of wear-and-tear at times but the audio commentary by noir experts, james ursini and alain silver, is a good one, even though i don't happen to share their opinion that dmytryk's career declined steadily after his huac troubles, as such excellent pictures as the sniper (1952), the caine mutiny (1954), broken lance (1954), the young lions (1958), warlock (1959) and mirage (1965) amply prove; having said that his collaborations at rko with producer adrian scott and screenwriter john paxton - murder, my sweet (1944), cornered (1945; hopefully this will be part of the next film noir box set from warners) and crossfire - do constitute his best work. in any case, in my opinion, the latter is not only one of the key films of the 1940s but also one of the finest noirs ever made, period.
