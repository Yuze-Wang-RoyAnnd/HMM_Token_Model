look...i've come to expect this level of acting from william macy...the guy just keeps putting in terrific performances...but meat loaf? just when did his loafness decide to leave jim steinman behind and throw his decidedly lower weight around in the wonderful world of stanislavsky? well...what can i say? i'm duly impressed. to paraphrase an old adage: "it ain't the meat, it's the emotion"...and the loaf is quietly buffing up his acting chops of late..<br /><br />laura dern carries off the 40's look perfectly here...great job by the costume and hair departments...david paymer is typecast but right on the money. solid camera work throughout the flick. the plot line is reminiscent of "gentleman's agreement" (post-wwii anti-semitism). well worth your time...particularly for the growing legions of bill macy acolytes.<br /><br />
