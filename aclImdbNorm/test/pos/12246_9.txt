movie watchers often say great movies must have 3 memorable<br /><br />scenes to be considered truly great. broadcast news doesn't have<br /><br />three, it has twice that. this movie is extremely well written by<br /><br />james brooks. holly hunter and albert brooks have never been<br /><br />better. i love this movie for many reasons. it is great because it<br /><br />makes you laugh and it makes you cry. albert brooks has several<br /><br />great lines and many unforgettable scenes: # 1(laughed) "i can<br /><br />sing and read, i am singing while i read," with midnight train to<br /><br />georgia playing in the background. # 2(laughed) telling the<br /><br />william hurt character that "you really blew the lid off of nookie,"<br /><br />after watching hurt's report on date-rape. #3 (cried) when aaron<br /><br />(a. brooks) finally tells jayne (hunter) that he loves her and she<br /><br />can't end up with hurt's character because he represents<br /><br />everything about journalism jayne finds dispicable. finally, #4 (laughed) who can forget the scene where aaron<br /><br />anchors the weekend news....hilarious. this movie should have won an oscar! it has everything i love in<br /><br />movies, great acting, intelligent script, and even a jack nicholson<br /><br />cameo!
