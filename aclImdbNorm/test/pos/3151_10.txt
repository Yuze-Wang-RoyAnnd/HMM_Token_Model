the reader is a perfect example of what a short film should be. a poignant story, told simply through well written dialog, beautifully painted images, a score that seamlessly weaves it's way through the narrative, and characters portrayed with thoughtfulness and grace.<br /><br />i saw this film at a festival where other interesting films and ideas were screened. but none of the other shorts had all the elements of great film-making coming together in one film as the reader did. the reader commanded the attention of every festival-goer in the room and for 10 minutes took us into the emotional lives of the characters.<br /><br />duncan rogers has created a beautiful film and i hope to see more from this director be it more shorts or perhaps a feature length film.
