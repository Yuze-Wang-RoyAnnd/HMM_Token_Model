this film is an excellent example of what an independent film can be. the director does an excellent job of riding the line between emotional and physical violence. but in the end, he remembers what so many indie-films forget - he tells a good story. when watching this film i was reminded of how timid and mundane most big-budget hollywood films really have become.<br /><br />especially notable, is an exceptionally strong performance by the film's lead - jorge cordova. as an villainous thug (on his way to the top of the crime heap) cordova plays a conniving, brutal, conceited, devious, and sleazy s.o.b., but he is so likable that he keeps you entertained the whole time. <br /><br />i read somewhere that these guys were part of the new wave of latino filmmakers in los angeles - called la nueva obra, or something like that. either way, this film makes you look forward to seeing more of their work.<br /><br />
