this movie was hilarious! it occasionally went too far, but isn't that what we expect from them? the theater roared with laughter and ooooooed at all the incredibly crazy stunts. it's rude, crude, and occasionally frighteningly intense. the whole gang is back and even more out of their minds, which in turn provides for some great entertainment. i don't want to give anything away, but the little snippets of clips going around the net are nothing compared to what comes after. <br /><br />this is a great movie to go see with friends. try to see it with a big crowd. you will not be disappointed. just don't go with anyone who can't take it (see above). it will not go over well, you can be sure of that. but that's pretty obvious in the first place. if you enjoyed the first one, you will loooooove this one.
