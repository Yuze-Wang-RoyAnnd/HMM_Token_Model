forget about donnie darko. i open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews i have read on the box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to darko. it isn't that i disagree with that necessarily, i just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. there are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. in darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential. in the box, the driving force of the narrative stems from a moral dilemma. believe me when i say that i understand the inclination to compare an innovative filmmakers'movies by looking for trends and patterns, but for me it is more important to approach each new film as a self contained entity first, and then broaden my gaze afterwards. <br /><br />the box is one of those films you get mixed feelings about because it seems to be in some sort of identity crisis. it isn't always sure what it wants to be. the twists are numerous, but easy to follow if not to predict. james marsden and cameron diaz play a relatively believable pair of newlyweds who are in financial straits. a box containing a "button unit" arrives on their doorstep and they are informed by a horribly burned man that if pushed the button will cause the death of one person whom they don't know, and they will receive one million dollars. one of the things the box achieves is to conjure up this invisible fear that somewhere out there our actions have moral consequences. before the button is pushed it has an eerie and seductive quality, alluring yet sinister. once it has been pushed, events are set in motion that make the two leads question their own morality and deeply regret their fateful decision. <br /><br />the notion that the box is an experiment is interesting because for me it provides the movie with a paradox. if there are external beings developing an "altruism coefficient" based on data gathered by couples pushing and not pushing the button, then as the conspiracy unravels, we notice that ultimately it is a forced altruism: be selfless or the species will be wiped out. i suppose the couples don't know the consequences of their actions when they are faced with making the decision, but they have no reason to suspect that the box can do anything, so why would they choose altruistically? is altruism devalued by the fact that we only care about it when presented with a problem in our own lives? <br /><br />the psychological hurdles in this movie are everywhere. push the button or don't, it's likely someone is messing with you. take the money or don't, no one gives anything away for free. search for the truth, the answers you find slowly reveal your demise. <br /><br />i propose that the box is an ironic work because it offers the false choice of free will while revealing that we are trapped in many metaphorical boxes. you can only choose to be free at the expense of another's life, is that freedom? no, it is only another box because then you become trapped in the consequences of your own morality. there is no escape for us because we live on earth and that is another box. this is precisely why the external beings in the film are ultimately antagonists. they demand we conform to moral standards which rob us of our freedom. we made it to mars, and we were burned for it and turned into slaves in a sick game. <br /><br />the references to jean paul sartre illustrate this point rather well. "you can only enter the final chamber free, or not free." sure, but no matter the form in which we enter the chamber, it is a chamber nonetheless. <br /><br />trevor nemeth
