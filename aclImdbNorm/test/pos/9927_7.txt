no matter how much it hurts me to say this,the movie is not as good as it could have been.maybe i was misled by the countless exaggerated reviews here on imdb,but i expected so much more...<br /><br />sure,the idea is a good one,the violent scenes and the camera-work are outstanding,the imagination of genius dario is breathtaking, but the movie is "soiled" by a couple of mistakes that i find unforgivable. first of all, am i one of the few people who feel that the heavy metal music played in the most intense scenes simply rips the atmosphere apart??? with a different kind of music (goblin????) during the "needle" scenes,it would have been soooo intense!... instead,the soundtrack destroys any chance for tension... secondly, the final killing scene and the last few moments of the movie are simply silly and uninspired. i don't want to say "amateurish", cause i love argento's movies.the ending left me feeling empty.talk about a final impression! this is hardly what happens in most of dario's films! though,admittedly,suspiria also suffers from a rushed finale (even if most of it is brilliant)....<br /><br />in short,watch this movie,try to make the most of its good points,but be prepared for some bad ones as well. this is not a perfect movie by any means.
