this is a story of a long and awkward love. the daily life of a woman of 50 years old and some people around her is depicted. her daily life is so ordinary and routine that i doubted who was the real lead character in the beginning. then the audiences know that the woman and a man who was her high-school class mate had very tiny connection. the woman has been doing the same job - a milk-woman and a supermarket casher - so long. there are so many slopes that delivering milk bottles is a very hard job. the man had married another woman, who is now dying of cancer. he works at the city hall and devotedly cares her at home. they never look straight nor talk each other, but they never forget each other. <br /><br />the original japanese title means "at some time the days you read books". but of course when the man said "now i want to do what i've always wanted to do", it was to hug her and make love with her. she writes to a radio disk jockey that "if god gives us time to talk, we need at least a whole day". dreaming of that day, she has been sublimating the desire in hard work and book reading. i personally know a woman who has loved a man for long years, even after he married another woman and died for an accident. therefore the story setting is not that special. rather, this movie well portrays unspoken romances in many ordinary men and women. through this movie, you will recall your romance that is lost long ago. this is a movie with lasting effect.
