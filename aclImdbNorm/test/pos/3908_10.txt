this excellent movie starring elizabeth montgomery is long overdue for release in dvd form. the same can be said for her earlier, also excellent movie, a case of rape. i can only hope that my comments spur some enterprising soul into placing both elizabeth montgomery movies on one dvd to be made available to her many fans. i for one believe this excellent actress's role was unfortunately stereotyped by her role on bewitched and, as a result, more serious acting roles were not made available to her. i am confident that if these two movies, perhaps even a trilogy with the legend of lizzie borden, were released in dvd form, her fans would set the record straight on how highly they regard her serious acting abilities.
