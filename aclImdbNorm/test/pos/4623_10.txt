first of all, i must say i really enjoy watching this movie. the way we follow the different people at the same time works perfectly, and its one of those movies that really makes you think.<br /><br />spoiler!!!!<br /><br />the fact that the the girls who kills herself, is the one you don't notice, that fact made me wonder abit, since thats why she commits suicide in the movie.. the director impressed me with that, making a movie that shows the plot to the audience and also deliver the message that not a lot of people would have seen it coming. some people might start talking about why no one did anything to stop it before she did it, but no one noticed her, just like no one who watched the movie did either... don't know about you, but i did not guess that it would be her who committed suicide.. did you ??<br /><br />regards jan
