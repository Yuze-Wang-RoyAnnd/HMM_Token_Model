this film gets off to a bad start. an incredibly corny monologue is followed immediately by a brilliantly-done, truly amazing spaceship crash. then things go downhill again, as you realize that the survivors are all a) bad actors (apart from the docking pilot and the psychopath) and b) almost all of them fit too nicely into the role of monster-fodder. hell, half of them don't even speak english, preventing the audience from getting to know the characters at all. you feel as if you were watching "deep blue sea" meets "silence of the lambs", minus the good bits. and unfortunately, the entire thing tries to hard to be "crashed on a desert planet with hannibal lecter" during the daylight scenes. vin diesel is a great actor - but he is no anthony hopkins, and he frankly annoys as the smart hyper-cool psycho. there is at least one very good scene involving an unexpected survivor - but apart from that you could just as well have cut out the first thirty minutes or so...<br /><br />but then things take a turn. i can't exactly pinpoint the moment, but soon the movie gets a lot better. it also feels less chopped - the scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narrative, and vin diesel becomes much less annoying and soon he is a show-stealer. by the time the first monsters appear, the film is actually quite enjoyable. by the time night falls, it is great. thrilling, horrifying and exciting. and even the character development of most main characters is well-done. if you can just sit through the poor bits at the start you're in for some great entertainment. <br /><br />besides, the visuals are eye-candy, and i honestly admit: i love the colour and the tone of this movie. <br /><br />7/10 (could have been 9/10, if only....)
