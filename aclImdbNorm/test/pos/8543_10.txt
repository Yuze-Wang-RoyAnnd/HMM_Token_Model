i first saw this movie in papua new guinea in 1967 and have remembered it since, although i have never seen it since that first time.<br /><br />just how easily good people's lives can be destroyed by the pure evil that existed then and still does is a memory that will haunt me forever.<br /><br />the movie is funny and immensely sad at the same time and the role played by anthony quinn is superb.<br /><br />this movie should be in all college studies about man's inhumanity to man.
