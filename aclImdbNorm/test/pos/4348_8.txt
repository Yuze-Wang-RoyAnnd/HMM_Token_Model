<br /><br />oh my word!! i have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! michael winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gung-ho troth world of deep and damaged execution. not only does he spoon feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the moustached bronson, but he also shows us the spoon he's feeding us with and says "look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question: are you enjoying this?" and even though you'll tell yourself no it can't be!!!! you'll know that deep down inside you'll know...it's a masterpiece
