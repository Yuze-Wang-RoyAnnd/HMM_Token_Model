i first saw this film in the mid 60's when i was a teenager, and it moved me so much, in fact the end scene where han suyin hears of mark's death, and then rushes to the hill in disbelief, where you then hear mark's voice saying "give me your hand", and then the image of him disappears, the butterfly with it's superstitious meaning, the music, the shattered emotions of love of han suyin, just left me sobbing my heart out. i was outwardly crying bitterly, my mother and sister looked up and were shocked at my reaction. i just left the room to be on my own. fortunately i do not react like that any more but i always cry at the end. i love everything about the film, the music mostly, the costumes of han suyin, and location. the beauty of jennifer jones and the handsome william holden, they were both at their best. i have the vhs and dvd of this wonderful movie. i also have two versions of the music & lyrics by arthur newman and sammy fain. i also have the book a many splendored thing by han suyin. i recommend this film 100%
