waco: rules of engagement does a very good job of not drawing conclusions for its viewers. it simply presents interviews, footage from the standoff, footage of the congressional hearings, phone conversations, expert testimony, etc. and allows you to draw your own conclusion.<br /><br />i hardly intend to imply that the data presented here was done with 100% objectivity but it is very convincing. you won't like koresh any more after you see this than you did before, but i tend to think that you will come to believe, as i now do, there is much that we were not told about what happened before and during the standoff.
