i never dreamed when i started watching this dvd that i would be totally mesmerized by it within minutes. the story was completely absorbing and entertaining. the acting was superb. the biggest surprise of all was how i would be so completely enchanted by the love these two young women radiated across the screen. their initial physical encounter for me was by far the most tender, romantic, delightful, vicariously enthralling love scenes i have ever witnessed on film. i literally stopped breathing. i could not believe the chemistry between the two actresses. with no nudity or graphic sex, they conveyed more passion and titillation than any american production could ever hope to evince. bravo to the author, the screenwriter, the director and the cast.
