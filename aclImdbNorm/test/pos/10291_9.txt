apartmente'l is one of the most interesting movies that i have ever seen. i experienced extreme frustration while watching this movie as i was gunning for the two leads to reunite. that never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end. but the ending lends an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical movie. it is not a movie which people are likely to rewatch but one watch itself will have a deep impact on people. as of now i haven't rewatched the movie and i don't think i will.<br /><br />the story follows the experiences of a man, max, who is engaged to be married to muriel. he remembers his old girlfriend lisa(he considers this the love of his life) as he listens, by accident, to lisa talking on the telephone. thus he tries to find lisa. here starts his extremely frustrating search for lisa. there are many layers to this movie. there are undercurrents of jealousy, vouyeurism and so on. there is also another character called alice who is involved in the whole confusion. the movie then moves through a whole range of twists and finally leads to an ending which could be interpreted in many ways. it is fascinating how this movie has only four main characters but the clever writing makes it interesting and unique. what i love about the fact is that a movie about obsession, jealousy is done in such a light hearted manner. it has a very fast pace which is probably the reason why it can appeal to a large audience. the main character, max, has shades of grey and i felt the ending was perfect. i don't think he is supposed to be a clean character considering the fact he is searching for his long lost love while he is engaged and he also has a fling with alice.<br /><br />the character of alice is even worse. her manipulation and her compulsive lying can really irritate viewers(that is the point, i guess). the scene where she breaks down in front of lucien really shows another facet of her character. it shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all the lying and the games and she wants to lead a normal life. in the end, she understands that she needs to get away from it all. the ending lends a cynical touch. because it seems as if max's love for alice is temporary and fake. it is as if to say that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose the safe option(i.e muriel) than to pursue something that is so fleeting(i.e lisa or alice). in many ways this is not really a romantic movie but a satire about romance(in a way).<br /><br />the performances deserve high praise. vincent cassel as max gives a great performance. he perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not really sure about his engagement. his geeky looks are an added advantage as it fits the character perfectly. but the real star of the movie is romane bohringer as alice. her nuanced portrayal of a woman who is jealous of alice and is in love with max. the scene where she screams "i am a nutcase too" really shows her desperation and her yearning to live a normal life with a man who loves her.<br /><br />btw i also thought lesbianism is another interpretation that can be drawn from this movie. alice's actions can be explained in many ways. and her unreasonable obsession with lisa may also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire. it may be far-fetched considering she encourages lisa to forgive her current boyfriend. but i got the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time. she also avoids questions from lisa regarding a boyfriend. she spends a whole lot of time with lisa and she is happy during that time. that may lead many to question her sexual orientation.<br /><br />overall i would give it a 9/10. i think it deserves it but i subtracted one because of the rewatchability factor. i think it is a perfect movie otherwise.
