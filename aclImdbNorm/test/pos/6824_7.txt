the problem with the film is quite simply this, conrad's prose is powerfully verbose and cannot be adapted to a movie. marlow's narration in the novella captivates you from the first sentence and you only "see" what conrad writes about. in movie, it's different, you see the visual, but the description and reflection that really makes the novel, is frightfully missing. but as far as an unadaptable book has been adapted, it is of good standard. there are the exact same scenes, which are pinpointed quite geniously, but they never have the same affect as in the novel. the plot in the movie has been enhanced, and it works very well to make it more interesting. the references to ancient egypt were thoughtfully inserted. my tip, read the book, and keep it that way, there are better movies out there.
