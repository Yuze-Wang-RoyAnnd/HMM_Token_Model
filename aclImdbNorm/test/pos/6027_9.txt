i was fortunate enough to see the last stop here where i live at the moving pictures film festival (for those of you that don't know, the moving pictures film festival is a tour of canadian made film in canada). i was told just before the movie started that it was the world premiere and that it was on the verge of getting an american distribution deal which added to my excitement.<br /><br />i'm a big horror movie fan, and yes, i love the scream trilogy as well. so when i found out that rose mcgowan was doing a ten little indians type of movie i knew that i was in for a treat. rose mcgowan was the biggest name actor/actress at the entire festival.<br /><br />the best way i can describe it without giving away too much of the plot is that it's not quite like scream. and it certainly is worth seeing. it's set in the middle of a snowstorm (it was filmed in vancouver, b.c., canada) at a mountaintop motel, which adds to the suspense. rose mcgowan puts in a great performance as the-girl-next-door(?!) along with the rest of the cast. and as for what happens at the end, well, the only thing i'll say is that you'll never guess the ending.<br /><br />sadly, it probably won't make it into mainstream north american theatres because the only decent money maker in it is rose mcgowan. but if you get the chance to see it i would recommend you do. and if worse comes to worst, there's always video.<br /><br />i gave it a 9 out of 10.
