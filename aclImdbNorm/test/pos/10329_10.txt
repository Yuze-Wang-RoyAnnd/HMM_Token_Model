bug juice changed my life. i know it sounds strange, odd , weird. but it did. i am from england, bug juice never aired there but five years ago i went on vacation with my family and saw it on the disney channel. once i saw this tv series i was hooked i wanted to go.it took a lot of convincing to my parents to allow my brother and i to go to waziyatah. i have been going since i was 12 and it was my forth year this summer. if you are a teenager reading this come to this camp it changes your life. you make life long friends at wazi. it doesn't matter who you are or if someone at home doesn't like you everyone likes you at camp. you have so much fun. if you want to have a look go on to www.wazi.com and check it out for yourself. it is so much fun i love it there it is my home away from home
