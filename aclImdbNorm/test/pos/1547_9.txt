one of the best of the 'kitchen-sinks'. fantastic views of london and invaluable snippets of working class life of the 60's. loach's eye seems to capture everything, yet makes no judgment - a taste of things to come. as with 'kes', 'riff-raff' and 'sweet sixteen', it serves as a cinematic social history of britain. carol white is completely convincing, you love her, fancy her, want to take care of her, but hold your head at her self-destructive decisions and still follow her in some vain hope. well backed up by terence stamp, ( fresh off 'the collector', also catch 'the hit' ) and a plethora of english faces ( all looking very young ). pefectly set to donovan's dulcet tones. stamp sings 'yellow is the color', in a lovely scene, ending with him saying, " getting better, ain't i " ( song also used in 'the rules of attraction' - i think ) watch carol whites screen mum getting ready to 'go out and get a bloke', putting on her false eye-lashes to the sound of 'rosie' on the radio - priceless. a treasure for anyone who was around at the time and a reminder of how good life is now in england. incidentally soderburgh used clips from 'poor cow' in 'the limey'.
