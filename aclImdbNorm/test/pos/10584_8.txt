i bought this movie just to see bam because i was really loving him, but after seeing this i don't like him much. i mean, his acting was good and everything i guess, but whenever it showed the totally unnecessary skate scenes i was just saying to myself, "alright, we know you're a professional skateboarder, now can we get back to ryan dunn?" dunn, rake, and brandon really made the movie in my perspective.<br /><br />i noticed that jenn rivell, (obviously), and missy rothstein were both in haggard, but who bam was dating at the time? anyways, i actually enjoyed haggard and i think it's really like no other movie i've ever seen. it's sort of in it's own category.
