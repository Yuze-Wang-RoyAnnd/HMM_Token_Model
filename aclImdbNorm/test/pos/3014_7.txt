the cell fascinated me at first glance. i was a bit surprised about that fact, because the story of that movie is absolutely boring. if it had no story, the film would be better. bunuels "un chien andalou" comes to my mind- a film without story, but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images. but the cell is at first a hollywood-movie, and only second a piece of art. i'm very interested in tarsem's next project. hamlet on indian could be very interesting, especially when it has the same looks as the cell.<br /><br />for film music enthusiasts: howard shore's score for the cell is absolutely marvelous, but a hard listening experience, because of its very modernistic style.
