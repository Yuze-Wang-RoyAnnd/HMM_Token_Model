ok, so in any wile e. coyote-road runner cartoons, we know that wec is going to set up all sorts of traps for rr, but always maim himself in various ways. that certainly happens in "beep, beep". predictable? i guess that it is, but when you think about it, these cartoons show how the more you try to harm someone else, the more you get harmed; sort of like how daffy duck always tries to undermine bugs bunny's integrity but bugs sees around it.<br /><br />overall, this is another classic from the termite terrace crowd. sometimes, i think that if we really had wanted to ease cold war tensions, we could have just let the soviet union see looney tunes cartoons; i'm sure that they would have loved them. another great one.<br /><br />ps: i learned on "jeopardy!" that wile e. coyote's middle name is ethelbert.
