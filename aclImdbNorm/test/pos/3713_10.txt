two soldiers is an excellent example of fine film-making. the director and producer took a heart-warming story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast, excellent cinematography, and very creative artistry.<br /><br />the relaxed back-woods lifestyle of the brothers was depicted with great details, and contrasted sharply with the militaristic lifestyle that they were thrust into. the interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears, as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the back-woods of north carolina and an even harder life of war.<br /><br />the acting was great, particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen (played by jonathan furr), to the older brother (played by ben allison) and the powerful performance by the colonel (played by ron perlman). the performance was extremely well cast.<br /><br />it was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of two soldiers, and i heartily recommend it to audiences of all ages.
