having watched the show for about four weeks, which is enough to get a feel for the show, i think it shows potential. whilst much is borrowed from other shows (what sci-fi doesn't these days), and the characters are stereotyped, i like what they are doing with the stories. there is some continuity with plot development and character interaction/relationship building, despite the essentially modular nature of each episode. there have been some science related topics explored as well as character secret/weakness revelations. these have also added some comedy to the show, something i would gladly see more of in "serious" sci-fi. in all, this makes for good balance, such that can appeal to larger groups of people, unlike the star trek vs babylon 5 debates i've been numerous participant and witness to. the visual aspects of the show are more than adequate, and well budgeted for a first season. the acting is acceptable, and i am curious to see how well the actors manage to grow their characters out of their scripted stereotypes. i see enough positives and potential to remain interested in seeing where the show wants to go...
