i can't imagine why it hasn't been theatrically released yet. it's got a great ensemble cast, with sutherland, lane, and especially chris evans doing spectacular work. wake up, studio execs!<br /><br />the story is based upon the experiences of the author/screenwriter, growing up as the "poor kid" in an extremely affluent community, where class is everything, and makes a difference in every aspect of life, from clothing to justice.<br /><br />during the film's q&a, the author was asked about his experiences, and particularly what we don't know about the ultra-rich. he said they aren't stupid, they're very smart (as opposed to how they may portray themselves), they've got plans, and they are a threat!<br /><br />in many ways, this film is extremely timely.
