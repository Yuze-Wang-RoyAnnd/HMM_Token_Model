britain and france declared war on germany in 1939, but by then, almost all of europe had fallen under the advance of the nazi war machine. entering the war, britain virtually started from scratch, with scarce supplies and with an air force that was outnumbered by germany ten to one. but the will of the brits was firm, emboldened by their new prime minister winston churchill who declared - "we shall never go under".<br /><br />on august 8, 1940, the battle for britain was on. however for the first time since hitler's declared stance to conquer the world, he hit a wall. though massively outnumbered, the british royal air force went on the offensive, and in the span of twenty eight days in september and october of 1940, german luftwaffe casualties climbed to two thousand three hundred seventy five lost planes and crew. hitler's rage was seething, but he had to call a momentary time out. responding later in the year, hitler launched a massive fire bombing of london on christmas day of 1940. when i say that there has never been a disaster movie to rival the real live footage of london in flames during this assault would be an understatement. perhaps the most surreal effect of this chapter in the "why we fight" series would be seeing british citizens emerge from their underground shelters following the bombing raids to resume what was left of their life above ground. even as you watch, there is no way to comprehend the living horror these people must have gone through, as the city of london was left in virtual ruin.<br /><br />yet the nazis were stunned and stymied as well. everything hitler wanted to believe about freedom and democracy was now turned on it's head. instead of being weak willed and complacent like the french, the british were not going to give up without a fight. and fight they did, taking the air battle to germany and responding in kind with attacks on the german homeland. it was a turning point, forcing hitler to rethink his strategy.
