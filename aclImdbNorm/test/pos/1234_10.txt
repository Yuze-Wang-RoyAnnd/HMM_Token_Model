heya denver fans! the animation is a cartoon's classic & one of my favorite too (and yes, it was broadcast in europe as well. including my tiny central-european country, slovenia! =:) oh, how i miss the 80's cartoons!! honestly, they were way better than today's children shows. more imaginative, creative, full of fun with good morals, more substance, great storyline and excellent character voices. computer animated shows of today lack all of these features. so all of you, who agree and want to bring back all the shows so that the kids of today's generation would see the entertainment that these cartoons brought to us, please log on the side posted bellow and sign a petition for a rerun of the 80's best cartoons! <br /><br />http://www.thepetitionsite.com /1/we-want-an-80s-child-cartoon-kids-show-channel<br /><br />carpe denver! =) <br /><br />lejla
