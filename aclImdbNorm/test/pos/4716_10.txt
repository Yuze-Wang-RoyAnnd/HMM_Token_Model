i saw beyond rangoon about 20 times, it was that good. at first when i watched it, i saw the story of laura bowman, but later, after multiple showings, i realised that this also was a parallel documentary. it came to be in my mind, a story about aung san suu kyi, and the struggles of women to remain strong in the face of uncertainty, danger, and sadness. i also would put history, and politics on the list after further viewing, since i did learn a lot about burma's past, and present, and could only guess at it's future. this movie is not only one you will want to see, it's also one you will definitely want to own a copy of. it's a movie that could easily been seen by the whole family, although not for children under thirteen. however, the educational benefits of this movie can not, and should not be understated.
