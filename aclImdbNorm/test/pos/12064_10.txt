i'm not from usa i'm from central europe and i think the show is amazingly good. it can be easily compared with married with..children. my title says that it isn't show for conservative public. i mean i'm not so liberal but it may be slight difference between european conservatism and us cons. anyway, show is starting to be very popular in our area and it's very bad that it contains only two seasons. last episode opens many continuous and funny moments. anyway i and many peoples would be glad if that would continue playing. the last thing i'm thrilled about this is some moral education very nice packed into humorous scenes. i mean i have seen many comedies that has over two and even more minutes of very sad in tragic scenes that absolutely don't fit into comedy. war doesn't contain something like that and is made for laughing. it's like the simpsons and married whose also don't have any sad or even unfunny moments. i'm apologizing for my awful knowledge of english but i still hope that you will understand what i meant.
