monkey is surely one of the best shows to have ever been shown on tv. i remember when i was a kid, i'd go to my grandma's house every saturday morning and i'd turn on the tv so i could watch monkey. i loved it. it had kickass action scenes, cool special effects, a great story, a fantastic theme song that was guaranteed to never leave your head and hilarious dubbing. but it is kind of weird that it's set in china and the actors are japanese and filmed in japan, but that is no stop towards making this tv show lovable.<br /><br />monkey is about the adventures of three people: pigsy (toshiyuki nishida), sandy (shir^o kishibe) and of course, the unforgettable and most lovable character, monkey (masaaki sakai) who travel from china to india to get a bunch of holy scrolls in order to save the world.<br /><br />monkey is great fun and it's magic.
