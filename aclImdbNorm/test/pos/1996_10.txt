this film is the most impressing turkish film that i have ever seen. probably "okul" is the first turkish horror film. i must say that i were excited while watching the movie because of some reasons, the first reason is that the story is impressive, i mean that at the end of the film you realised all the details about movie, this makes the film attractive and the other reason is that no turkish man made such a movie like that before. this shows that turkish film improves itself by time. although the first trial to make a horror movie, it was really successful. i advice all of you not to miss this movie...
