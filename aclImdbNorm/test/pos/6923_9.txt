this film is a joy to watch and should do well on dvd and video. i suppose you really have to be irish to appreciate the some of the subtlties such as accent, colloquialisms and the dress sense of some of the characters but let me assure you that when dylan moran impersonates 'barreler' the impersonation is quite familiar to most people from dublin because we have many characters in our fine city that look, act and talk like that! the sheer simple comedy employed and michael caines genius acting alone are worth the money but on top of this the plot is great, the script is fantastic and the dialogue fast moving and catchy. a perfect light entertainment movie without the madcap humour of jim carrey.
