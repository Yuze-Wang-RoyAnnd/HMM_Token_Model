"boy next door" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. in just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. kudos to travis davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. he's the funniest nebbish since woody allen. and what a treat to see richard moll back again. if you thought all he could do was play "bull" the bailiff on "night court", think again. this gem of a film showcases the brilliantly funny writing of stephen garvey. remember that name. forget charlie kaufman, steve garvey is the true current king of quirky comedy.
