this documentary is as unique as it's subject. and while d'amato's staple was erotica, the film manages to show some decent clips of the films you may remember from old time, late night cinemax... one problem... joe did hardcore porno at times mixed with softcore erotica, even mixed in his gore films. the gore films are cult classics, going for like $20 a pop for a dubbed copy on the net (not peanuts for 20 year old films, folks.) i want to see why those are cult classics. also, as sweet as joe seems (he did seem more elegant than one might expect,) the dude liked to shock. both "caligula: the untold story" and "emanuelle in america" show us hardcore rape, snuff, and beastiality (in both, you'd be suprised how far he goes in "caligula ii" with that one, if you can track down an uncut print.) although these scenes may be disconforting in a documentary of a persons career, hey, he did it... also, i would have liked to see more interviews of people joe worked with... maybe that's just me wanting to see what laura gemser looks like these days... i still think she's a goddess and one of the sexiest women ever to grace the genre.
