the problem with other actors cast in the r^ole of dorian gray is that they either looked too old for the part (hurd hatfield, helmut berger, josh duhamel, david gallagher, ben barnes) or that they were unable to pull off the english aristocratic manner without being stilted. dorian is the perpetual 19-year-old (or so), all milky skin and honey'd locks, as described by wilde, so the challenge is finding an actor that has the maturity and range for the part (i.e., who can portray the naivit'e, callousness, and manipulativeness), but at the same time looks like someone in his late teens. and peter firth pulls it all off in this excellent british tv adaptation.<br /><br />gielgud as henry wotton, while considerably older than what wilde had in mind, does wonders with his scenes--wilde's aphorisms have never sounded so natural and unforced. especially george sanders in the 1945 version was pretty feeble by comparison (and his costume didn't fit).<br /><br />finally, jeremy bratt plays basil as the most masculine and at the same time the most gay of the trio, again a fitting interpretation. in general, the film includes enough gay subtext without turning dorian himself gay--he's all things to all people and supposedly there's no drug or sexual perversion he hasn't tried in the 18 years covered by the story, but that makes him more narcist than homosexual. he seems to equally wreak havoc on both sexes here, as he should according to the novel.<br /><br />of course the budget of this production was not very large, so everything feels a little stagey. particularly dorian's encounter with sybil's brother suffers from the obvious studio look. also, the final shot of dorian (a puppet i suppose) in his white toad-like make-up is more hilarious than convincing and basil's death scene is inadvertently funny. (also, as far as i recall, basil should have been killed seated at the table.)<br /><br />but all in all, this is a very worthy adaptation. i'm sure wilde would have liked it. the only thing missing is the sensual side. not so much sex scenes, but wilde's decadent world of fragrant flowers, luxurious cloths, and precious gems isn't really explored here, i.e. the aestheticism is completely missing. but like "i, claudius", the excellent acting makes one easily forget these shortcomings of production values.
