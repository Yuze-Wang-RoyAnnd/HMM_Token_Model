i must have seen a different version than the first person on the user comments section.<br /><br />it's really, really good...steve zahn and karl urban are great together. val kilmer's character is much like he was in the novel, although the emphasis is on gus and call and the comanches. we get to see what happened with call and newt's mother as well. i won't spoil it, but it gives a lot of insight into call's character.<br /><br />all the actors did a really convincing job. steve zahn had the biggest challenge, i thought, to follow robert duvall! there's a lot of action, humor, tragedy. it's got something for everyone. i can't wait until it airs, my family are all jealous i got to see it early!
