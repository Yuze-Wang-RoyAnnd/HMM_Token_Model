my friend made me sit down and watch this film. this is out there material. "god the devil, heaven hell... and a restaurant thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />four guys and a prick. who dies? when and how?is that's the story. you'll never guess the ending for this one. a skillfully realized little gem of aussie cinema. hats of to the team that made this one.<br /><br />10 out of 10.
