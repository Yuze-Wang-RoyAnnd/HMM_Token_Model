thus starts "one crazy summer", the evil twin of "better off dead..". how can any movie be bad when the opening lines are sung by david lee roth?<br /><br />this movie is a total blast. pairing again john cusack with curtis armstrong, but this time adding bobcat goldwaith to the mix has great, funny results. hyperactive bobcat grates the nerve of everyone around, curtis "ak ak" is the son of a deranged military with pacifist tendencies, and demi moore (with natural breasts... wow!) as the love interest of, once again, chronically depressed cusack.<br /><br />the story is, well, simple enough. the laughs are there, but both savage steve holland films have a certain quality to them... they are funny, but they are also sweet. the scene where curtis finds a blown up doll in the target practice beach, and begins musing about how a little girl won't be able to sleep was dumb, funny and touching. the animation used throughout is quite surreal. "the boat" is hysterical (complete with watsamatta u. sail and odie plush doll). overall, a fun film, though not as good as "better off dead..."
