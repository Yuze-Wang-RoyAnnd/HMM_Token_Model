reasonably effective horror/science-fiction a la "alien" is fairly well done given its limited ambitions. some nice special effects and well paced action sequences adequately patch the cracks in the rather tiresome dialogue. when a space craft crash lands on a remote planet the survivors soon become aware that a hideous terror awaits them in the dark of the upcoming total eclipse.
