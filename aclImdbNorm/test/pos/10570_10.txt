this tv adaptation of sarah waters' novel was so lovingly done i can hardly find the words to appreciate it. not since "tipping the velvet" (also highly recommended) have i seen such a performance by the lead actresses, this time by sally hawkins and elaine cassidy. they acted with their souls, and this is what gets across to the audience! the supporting actors were well chosen, too, they made a great ensemble.<br /><br />for those who think the story is just about a lesbian relationship - no, this is only one part. the other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love. and the plot has some further surprising twists. so the movie should be interesting for straight people or guys like me as well.
