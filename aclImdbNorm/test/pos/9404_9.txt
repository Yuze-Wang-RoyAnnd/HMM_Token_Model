i was quite impressed with the narration by martha and how it pulled on the emotional heartstrings of the audience as well as how it must have impacted the family. the forward-backward motion of the storyline was well-done, and normally i don't enjoy movies with the flash-back/flash-forward effects. i felt during the whole evolution of the movie that "surely tommy did it". it leaves you with a sense of how these people lived their lives almost totally devoid of each other and the consequences of not having any desire to answer the question, "it's 10 o'clock. do you know where your children are?" and furthermore, "what the heck are they doing?"!! or "do i care?"!! rich, spoiled brats literally getting away with murder. or so they thought.......
