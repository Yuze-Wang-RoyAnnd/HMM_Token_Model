this movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a christian environment and learned that appearance is everything. she and her son, who just recently returned from vietnam collide in some very tense issues. the relationship has no connections intimately and is a great accurate portrayal of what it is like to live with someone who is false and only looks at the surface of issues. kathy bates does an excellent job of portraying a woman of false faith who is either oblivious to her cruelty, forgetful or just doesn't want to be confronted. jeremy's wrath is never feared and it leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about his fathers love for him. this is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event leads one to despair.
