(possible ?? spoilers included, but nothing critical given away.)<br /><br />i just watched this classic low budget movie on video, and was knocked out by the level of energy present on screen. all the actors do themselves proud, especially john daniels, must see another of his films. not only does this movie boast great performances, but manages stylish sequences, like when the baron throws someone out of a window and we see shards of glass falling into a swimming pool which erupts from the impact of the fallen man, i love the way slow-motion photography was used in 70's cinema, dreamy and hypnotic. cool and witty black dudes spout great one liners while slimy seedy lumps of white trash come to unpleasant ends. i love it, my rating 10 / 10. if this ever comes out on dvd, count me in for a purchase.
