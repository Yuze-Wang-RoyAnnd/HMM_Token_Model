michael jackson is amazing. this short film displays the absolute highest standard in music video and no-one will ever be able to out-beat this 'king of pop' masterpiece! it shows michael turning into a zombie and dancing in the street with some spectacular choreography. the story is great, the scenes are marvelous, the music is fantastic and overall the clip is fun, eye-popping, spooky and is a real spectacle. today everybody is still doing the same thing in music video with dancing and film-based story-lines which he innovated. this ground-breaking video is the toast of mtv and will forever be remembered for what is the greatest music video of all time!!
