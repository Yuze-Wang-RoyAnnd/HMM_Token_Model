i had my reservations about watching the return to lonesome dove after seeing and enjoying the original so much. without tommy lee jones reprising his role as woodrow call or anjelica huston as clara, i figured it just wouldn't seem authentic enough. upon viewing 'return' i can honestly say it's a worthy successor. the actors really make the show with jon voight, rick schroder, and oliver reed all preforming at their very best. i admit the story might not be quite as engrossing as the first, but 'return' definitely has it's share of excitement and captures the romance of the old west in a way that few other films have. anyone who still has reservations can rest assured that the return to lonesome dove succeeds in capturing the 'feel' of the original and will not disappoint. do yourself a favor and check it out, ol' gus would be proud!
