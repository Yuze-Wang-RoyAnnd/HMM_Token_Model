a lot has already been written about the film itself, so instead of adding to the noise i just want to say a few words on the two female actors.<br /><br />it has to be a daunting prospect for any actress to star, in a sense, versus the spectacular monica bellucci, but romane bohringer pulls it off to sensational ends. a film starring monica bellucci where i fall in love with the other girl?? that's not supposed to happen.<br /><br />it's been said a thousand times, but monica bellucci strikes the saddest figure in modern cinema. i have never before seen such innate sadness. she would not be out of place breaking lon chaney's heart.
