dragon ma (jackie chan)is back, having rid the seas of the dreaded pirate lo. back on land, he is assigned to the police force, where he is to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb. along the way, he is caught up in the fate of several chinese patriots attempting to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause. the chinese manchu government is after these revolutionaries, and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble, even if they are in the police force. i had big expectations for this movie after i saw project a. but sadly i was a little disappointed. there is just too little action compared to the first film. there is just one good fight scene until the big ending. that fight scene is in the "gangsters place" and its good, a lot of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are throw. jackie chan and his stunt team don't disappoint here at all. the ending is very entertaining, jackie chan shows us why he is the best stuntman in the world. really exciting stuff! the only bad thing with the ending, is that the fights are too short and forgettable. conclusion: many funny moments, good acting and crazy stunts. but not enough fighting for a top rating.
