i personally found the film to be great. i had it on pre-order for a month and watched it twice the day i got it in the mail, and several time since.. yes, the time lapses may be a bit much, but the rest of the movie clearly compensates for it. all amature cast, yet the acting was right on for each part. the plot itself is just... haggard! there's no other way to describe it. who makes a movie about someone getting f**gered!??? bam, thats who. genius. simply genius. two thumbs up. i would be honored to work with him any day, any time, on any thing.
