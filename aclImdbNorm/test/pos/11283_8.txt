there have been many (well, more than a few in any case) attempts over the past 30 years to create film that has an "otherworldly" appearance. supposing that this is a film director's wish to distance himself from other movies, or simply to gloss over the low-budget and shabby look, "begotten" is on the top echelon of this pile.<br /><br />apart from the peerless "eraserhead", anyway.<br /><br />merhige's painstaking process of artificially degrading his film changes it's structure completely (imagine what this film would have looked like in glorious, standard technicolour) - it can almost be envisaged as an artifact from another, unknown culture. some images are so far removed from what we expect to see on the screen, they disturb mainly as they are dislocated. this is not "last house on the left" disturbance, more like leaving-your-cave-for-the-first-time-and-seeing-the-sun disturbance.<br /><br />watch this fever-dream if you get the chance, and relish. remember, they make other, more standard films every day. they can wait.
