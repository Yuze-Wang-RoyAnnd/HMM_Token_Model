almost four years after the iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever. that's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the american way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? you bet it is. this movie said so from the beginning. it is kind of freaky how much the film,or should i say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. it is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future. there was a point when i felt the hairs standing up on the back of my neck as gw announced that 'major combat operations are over" on top of a visual of a broken down rv being towed away with the american flag waving in the rear-view mirror. you have to see it to understand what i mean. but even if you are apolitical or even if you are pro-war, this movie will have some kind of impact on you because it is so embedded in history.
