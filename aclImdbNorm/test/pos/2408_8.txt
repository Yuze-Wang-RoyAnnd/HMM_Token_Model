i've seen this movie more than once and it's worth it. for those of you who like martial arts and overcoming internal conflict, this is a worthy choice. after seeing this movie, i wanted to be a more productive member of society because i could relate to the inner turmoil of a girl looking for acceptance and needing a path to follow. of course, mr. miyagi always provides his sage advice. 2 thumbs up!
