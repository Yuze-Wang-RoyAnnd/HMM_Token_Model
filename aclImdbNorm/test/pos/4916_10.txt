l'homme blesse is not for an impatient, adventure-seeking audience. there are no explosions nor is the drama straightforward. like the films of lynne ramsey, the director is working more deeply with mood than with storytelling in a manner that is effective and incredibly moving. because it does not rely on gratuitous nudity, or superficial pop-cult. story lines, this is quite frankly one of the best gay foreign film i have seen (also, see francois ozon, pedro almodovar). nicolas roeg's "don't look now" gets a lot of bad press because it is sold as a horror film. that film, like l'homme, is more than what the box might lead you to believe. if you are in the mood to sit back and be absorbed by the subtle, transformed powers of cinema, you'll love this movie.
