it's a shame house calls isn't better known. is it perhaps because the romantic leads are middle-aged, shopworn, and gun-shy, rather than oversexed teen-stars? could be. if you're over 35, you'll probably get this comedy. if you're over 45, you're really going to get this comedy. if you're 25, wait until you're older to see it.<br /><br />the unlikely pairing of matthau and jackson works precisely because it is so unlikely. there's a wonderful line of matthau's that sums up what is happening between the two of them--"i like old broads because you don't have to explain who ronald coleman is." (if that's not the exact line, it's close...)<br /><br />the premise of a sub-par hospital run by incompetents rings true. art carney's portrayal of a senile head surgeon is absolutely brilliant. it is impossible not to laugh out loud at his delivery. subplots, if you can call them that, are fun too, like between matthau and jackson's teenage son. everything hits just exactly the right tone. <br /><br />okay, there's the bit where matthau has to wear women's clothing that's a bit over-the-top and an easy mark. but, still--it's walter matthau in drag! it's funny!
