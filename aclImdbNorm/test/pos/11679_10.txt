i love this film. it was made just before the la punk scene changed for the worse. it perfectly preserves the mood and attitude of that time and place. i feel really lucky to have been present at the filming of four of the bands at the fleetwood that night. the only part that doesn't fit in too well is the sections with catholic disipline and their socio-political commentary. i didn't see too many people who were into that at all. the rest of the film shows attitudes that i witnessed a lot; people dealing with hard lives, or taking a swing at the music industry and/or lousy hippies. i don't think i've seen a documentary that captures so authentically and personally the subject matter being covered.
