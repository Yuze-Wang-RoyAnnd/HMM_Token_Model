hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. a cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. lorelai gilmore (lauren graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. rory gilmore (alexis bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both. with the help of luke danes(scott patterson) and sookie st.james(melissa mccarthy) and an enormous variety of other hilarious characters, this show easily remains one of my favorites. what really puts the show over the top is the complex yet, incredible and witty writing often using references from pop culture to the mink dynasty.
