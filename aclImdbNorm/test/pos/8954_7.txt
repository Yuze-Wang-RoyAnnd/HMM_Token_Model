watched this flick on saturday afternoon cable. man, did it drag. i got the metaphors, symbolism, and all that stuff. no, i didn't care one way or another about the sexuality of the characters. but, the pacing of the story and the scripting almost put me to sleep.<br /><br />that is..... until ruth marshall got naked. if you're a breast-man who is not homo-phobic, you may want to rent it. ruth has a lesbian sex scene that's pretty hot, and then a hetero sex scene that is a notch higher than most standard movie fare. her jiggly d-cups made the film worth the watch.<br /><br />--the mighty avatar
