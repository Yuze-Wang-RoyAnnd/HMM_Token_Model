this short, a formative cartoon featuring pepe le pew, concerns a cat who thinks he'll solve all his problems by pretending to be a skunk. trouble is, he attracts the most unwelcome attention of an honest and for truly skunk (our hero, pepe, entering stage left) being decidedly more attentive, shall we say, than m. cat would like. every great plan has its drawbacks, but this one's a corker! i wonder if jack warner got a call from the hays office over the fact that pepe and the object of his adoration were both male. after all, betty boop was in part responsible for the production code coming into existance. subsequent "conquests" were clearly and most definitely female. very good cartoon, but pepe is a character who works better as the focal point, rather than supporting. well worth watching. recommended.
