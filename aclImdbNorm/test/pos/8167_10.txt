this was truly a deeply moving movie in every sense of the word. i myself was a mormon missionary and i know first hand the wanting to complete my mission but at the same time hiding the fact that i was gay. like the character aaron, i was sent home for being found out and excommunicated, but being the only mormon in a family of catholics wasn't as big a shame as it was for the lead character. this movie really took me back to those days and helped me to realize, years later, how fortunate i was to have a family that accepted me and understood what i was going through. i found myself applauding the end of a movie when aaron and christian find each other again by shear chance at lila's restaurant. i was truly moved to tears. i highly recommend this movie to all who read this review and also declare it a must buy.
