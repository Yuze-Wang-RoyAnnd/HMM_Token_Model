the hookers was to me a great everyday people story, like someone you might have known. just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. then life's little temptations creep in, the spoiler, stumbled again. how much, can your love take, and give, to the guy who's really not so bad, after all, just human. i liked it, i was also a paid extra in the movie. played the drums in the bar shots, with the band, did several walking shots, my green 66' corvette was in the motel party shots. wonderful cast and crew, first rate people, down to earth movie. i had lunch with james coburn, on mother's day, what a wonderful man, just like i've known him for years, i'll never forget him. my father spent the day with slim pickens, and swapped horse stories, slim also was really down to earth, love those guys, we really miss them. real people making movies about real people, thanks levy, gardner, and laven.
