first of all, around the time i wrote this comment, i had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. this is a video game and not an actual movie. i mean, i myself would choose a good deniro movie or playing a video game any day. but, dude, what are you talking about? now that i have that out of the way, let's move on, shall we? the video game adaption of crouching tiger, hidden dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name. what's stranger is that this was released three years after the film was released. whether that's due to a slow development time or just plain laziness, no one really knows. at least, i don't.<br /><br />the game allows the player to play as the four main characters of the movie: jen, shu lien, li-mu-bi, and dark cloud (whose story is a secret bonus that is unlocked for separate gameplay.) all four of these characters have fighting styles based on how they fought in the movie. however, the real eye candy is the evasion moves that allow each character to avoid the blows of an enemy's attack in the most impossible and gravity defying ways that were first showcased in the movie.<br /><br />the story is obviously based on the story told in the movie. the story in the game is told using cg movies and spoken in a subtitled mandarin language (a nice little touch, considering i preferred the foreign language track of the film over the dubbed one.) the story goes to expand on what might've happened to the other characters during the film and even (no real surprise since pretty much all video game movie adaptions have done this) alters what officially happened in the movie to make the game have more action. i never thought jade fox would go so far as to actually go and get hired goons.<br /><br />the real bonus for the story is the ability to decide how the game ends. what if jen had all the ingredients to cure li-mu-bi in her possession? what if jen had not gotten back her comb? what if li-mu-bi had not gotten the green destiny back for the second time? your actions will decide the outcome of these scenarios and the destiny of the characters in this game. this is truly the best feature of the game.<br /><br />yet, for all it's strengths, it also showcases some flaws. the enemies often tend to become a nuisance after a while and the camera angle tends to be fixed on the most unhelpful of spots. not even the special features (which are unlocked after beating the game) are good enough to even forgive such hardships that are forced upon the player.<br /><br />if you loved the movie, you may enjoy the game. however, this game is the only way you're going to be able to immerse yourself into a playable version of such a beautiful and amazing movie.<br /><br />of course, you could have just picked a deniro movie instead.
