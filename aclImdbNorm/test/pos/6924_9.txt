if you are going to watch this film because michael caine or michael gambon are in it then don't bother, it's not their typical role although i found gambon fantastic. instead watch it for dylan moran i am a fan of everything i have seen him in and this is no exception, i didn't even realise he could act but even the characters which he has to pass himself off as i found completely believable, which is impressive considering the audience knows they are fake.<br /><br />the plot is genius and although it is not constant laughs all the way through it has plenty of other charms. a great film for people with a sense of humour.
