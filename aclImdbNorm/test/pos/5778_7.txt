well someone who enjoys traveling down the highway at 120kmph, eating mcdonalds, and running the air conditioner twenty four seven, and watching fox news non-stop, i found this documentary interesting. one thing i picked up, when they being they talk about north america, i assume this documentary was fabrique au canadie. for the canadian bashing i will leave that to bill o'reilly.<br /><br />the consequence of the depletion of oil will affect everyone, especially those who live in big countries of australia, canada and the united states. i am sure that green peace are cheering no more gas, means no more suvs, without realizing people who live in the sub zero temperatures could starve to death. <br /><br />as someone who has studied economics, i know for a fact we are living in a world of finite resources. i will give the documentary props for trying to present a balanced point of view about the depletion of oil. however i am studying a degree in journalism, this documentary is full of loaded messages - republican as warmongers. what the democrats didn't send troops to vietnam? <br /><br />if you are going to present a documentary about economics and resources, it is best to leave the political bashing to one side, because it could cause a potential audience member to totally shut down. concentrate on the issue of finite resources. at the end of the day, it is best to open the minds of the mainstream, as it is no good preaching to the minuscule choir. <br /><br />i really do enjoy watching documentaries such as fahrenheit 911, and end of suburbia not for their political bias, because they do remind us the world isn't so safe. sure i like to shop, and consumer junk food like there is no tomorrow, but if the world is going to end tomorrow i would rather die rich and consume the living beep out of it. <br /><br />for the potential documentary makers out there, just give the people facts, and let the viewers make up their own minds. if you are trying package your political views as a balanced documentary the people are going to smell a rat a mile away.
