many people remember the waco standoff that occurred a long time ago. what most people probably have ingrained in their minds is the "cult leader" david koresh and the images of the compound burning to the ground after a long standoff. a lot of people have the belief that koresh was some kind of madman who thought he was god. he was accused of being a child molester and was credited for the breakdown and deaths of his followers. furthermore, many people feel the cult committed mass suicide when the fbi stormed mount carmel center and when the building was burning. most people feel the cult was at fault for not agreeing with the fbi on reasonable terms. most people feel the cult was brainwashed by koresh and followed along with everything that he said. nothing could be farther from the truth, because of strong evidence after the nightmare was over, and this one-of -a- kind documentary pretty much proves it!! <br /><br />this documentary is one of the most balanced examinations at the situation that occurred. it is much more thorough and highly detailed than anything most people have received in the mainstream media. to the shock of many people, this documentary will reveal that is was the atf, the fbi, and the higher levels of the united states government who were the ones who were unjust, cruel, and deceptive, and not david koresh and his followers. what korseh and davidians were doing was just protecting their constitutional rights, and the higher powers completely violated and raped those rights. the aft had no grounds to storm the compound; it was the aft that shot first and they shot from the helicopters from above at unarmed men, women, and children!! what is even more shocking is the actions of the fbi when they entered the mount carmel. watch it for yourselves and you will develop and new perspective on the u.s. government. there is infrared footage that clearly shows the fbi was shooting with machine guns at the men, women, and children in the burning compound. it will make your blood boil. it will make you really angry. it will make you wonder as to what kind of people run this country. finally, it will make you wonder as to what you are being told on the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. this video is frightening and i highly recommend it if one can find it. this documentary does not need to be purchased; it can be watched for free on google video!
