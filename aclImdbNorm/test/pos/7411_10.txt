"pharaoh's army" defies formula. instead of selling out for cliches and big stars, it relies completely on the excellent acting from a strong cast, the strength of a well written script, and a fascinating and bitter story. the result is a raw and realistic film that moves along fast, with a heavy emotional current. one of the best i've ever seen about the civil war, and i think it can owe that to the pleasure of being an independent film (if you like this film, try to see the similarly brilliant indie civil war film "wicked spring" as well).<br /><br />"pharaoh" simply tells the true story of a small expedition/forage team of union men who ride into a confederate farm to take provisions, but end up stuck there because of an accident of one of the men. tensions broil and relationships are made and broken. nothing happens the way hollywood would write it; this movie comes from the mind of someone who actually cares about quality film and the telling of history. superb dialogue and plot exposition move along a film that looks highly professional, but often doesn't feel like you're watching a movie, more along the lines of hearing a story.<br /><br />the film boasts an incredible performance from chris cooper who shows an amazing versatility in the exploration of his role. he transforms, but is always at the height of believability and is easy to emotionally relate to. patricia clarkson is equally as stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses would crumble in. she shares an interesting chemistry with cooper's character and where she's the more severe of the characters, is still as easy to identify with. the rest of the cast is quite capable, and fill their roles in well.<br /><br />the art design and the set are wonderful, and personally i love the cinematography. it all has the feel of a civil war period photograph with the camera presenting strong contrasting colors and shadows and a tin-like metalic tint, but always keeping the naturalistic look of the rustic setting. they seem to have used natural lighting, but whatever they used works beautifully. everything looks like it belongs where it is, it feels period, something i find rare in american period films. the actors act 19th century, not like 20th century people in old clothes.<br /><br />above all, this film is very personal. i think that as an indie it can afford it. the film is nearly flawless with an outstanding script that effortlessly creates and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and lets them grow in a situation, as bad as it is. it doesn't fail in getting it's point across, and it gets it's point across without the usual and overused techniques that are used in all war films these days. it's brave. it relies on it's characters, a fantastic script, human emotion, and in the cold hard fact that the civil war wasn't all cgi, big stars, and hoop skirts.
