i think every critic who panned "tommy boy" when it was released in 1995 ought to go back and watch it and learn it is not a bad film at all. every critic panned chris farley and david spade's movies. yes "coneheads" was funny but kind of had a one joke premise and "black sheep" i agreed with the critics is one of the worst movies ever made. but "tommy boy" does not fall in the category of "coneheads" which could have been a little funnier and "black sheep" which is a piece of tripe. it is very funny and entertaining. i do agree with the critics that chris farley was no john belushi or john candy as he claimed to have idolized those guys and those guys had a genius for comedy but chris farley was very funny and i wish he were around longer to prove to critics that yes he was no john belushi, or john candy but he was very funny. the scenes between farley and spade as nemesis are side-splitting hilarious and the premise is also laugh out loud hilarious. it is very sad that chris farley is no longer here to make us laugh but we have movies like "tommy boy" to remember how truly funny he was. "tommy boy" is one of the 1990's best comedies.
