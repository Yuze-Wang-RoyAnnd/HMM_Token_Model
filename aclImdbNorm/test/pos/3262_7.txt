this aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an ok job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in kings cross, sydney. the plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. very well acted by heath ledger and bryan brown. the plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. the setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. eg. when one crim is searching for bullets for his gun. i personally have a dislike for gratuitous violence in movies, and in this regard, the movie did not offend. it attempted and succeeded in showing us the human side of the baddies such as bryan brown. the rest of the cast did an ok job, without any real stand-outs that i remember. the direction was very good in succeeding in making a believable movie that provided good entertainment. the main overriding feature that makes this a good movie is the acting and direction of heath ledger and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes stupid mistakes for short-term gratification, thinking he is indestructible and not realizing that there are sinister people waiting to pounce on any mistake. the director, gregor jordan, deserves special mention. rating in my book - 7 (of 10).
