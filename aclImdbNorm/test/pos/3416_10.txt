we saw this film in toronto at the film festival last year. it was a truly moving experience. i had heard of the truth and reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. this film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. archbishop tutu and the others involved in developing the t & r process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions. seeing this film gave me hope for the human race. if we can do t & r, we just might not destroy ourselves. people will look back at t and r as the first step out of human adolescence and toward maturity.<br /><br />as a film, of course there were flaws. i did not notice any major problems in acting, directing, or writing - but for the first time in years i was totally lost in a film, so perhaps i did not notice.<br /><br />see this film. the audience in toronto would not give up the stage for the next film, we had so many questions and comments for the stars and director. tom hooper, jamie bartlett, and chiwetel ejiofor went outside to the sidewalk to continue the conversation. people came by just to shake their hands and thank them for the film. it moved us all.
