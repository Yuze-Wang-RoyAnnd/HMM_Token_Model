duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in paris. when the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. so he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. when the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. a street wise cat named thomas o'malley meets up with them and offers to help them. when edgar sees them arriving home, he is furious, and starts to mail them to timbucktu. but thomas' friends arrive to help save the day. the wealthy lady decides to leave her home for every alley cat in paris.<br /><br />this is a charming film. the songs, including "everybody wants to be a cat", are lively and upbeat. the voice cast is excellent, with eva gabor(who would later play miss bianca in disney's the rescuers films) as duchess, phil harris(baloo in the jungle book, little john in robin hood) as thomas, giving interesting personalities to their characters. supposedly walt disney, before he died in 1966, gave the go-ahead to this film. recommended for disney fans or cat lovers everywhere! 10/10.
