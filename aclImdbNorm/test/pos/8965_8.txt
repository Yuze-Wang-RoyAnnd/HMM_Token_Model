... with a single act.<br /><br />charlie wilson, congressman, a real character. during the 90s, when the communism on ussr, the wall of berlin and the war on afhganistan (with the soviets) broke over. he did it, a single denial for money, and everything went down. he should be remembered, so here it is. his memorial.<br /><br />back to the movie. funny, dramatic, snob, politic or just boring. anyways, it's a smart movie about politic life, about ruling the world and about, above all, a lesson to the world. a lesson to every politic out there, a critical point of view referring to countries who support wars with money, guns and words.<br /><br />lesson learned - world isn't a nice place to live in
