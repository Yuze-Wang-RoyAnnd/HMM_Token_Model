this film is a classic seventies cop flick that for some reason has been sadly overlooked. it is basically french connection meets bullit.<br /><br />roy scheider plays the head of an elite group of detectives, known as the "seven ups" <br /><br />one of their men is discovered during an undercover op and is killed.<br /><br />scheider and his team must find his killers. they become involved in a battle with the mob.<br /><br />the highlight of the film has to be the car chase, obviously included to cash in on the success of bullit. however, this car chase outshines bullitt due to its length, speed and sheer excitement.it's a breathtaking roller-coaster ride that ends rather unexpectedly and spectacularly. don't miss this little gem !!
