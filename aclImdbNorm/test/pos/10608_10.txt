i just finished watching marigold today and i'll begin by saying that i found this dvd on the shelves of blockbuster. while strolling around looking for something new and good to watch, the picture of ali larter caught my attention.<br /><br />after drooling over ali larter, i picked up the cover and continued to glance around the cover. from the looks of it, i thought the costumes were a bit over the top. and then i saw the other indians on the cover and figured this was some kind of spoof film or something like that.<br /><br />when i flipped over the the synopsis part and saw salman khan, i did a double take. salman khan in an american film with ali larter in a dvd at blockbuster? because salman khan is to bollywood films like mel gibson is to hollywood films, i had very high expectations for this film: it had to be good! i am very pleased to say that marigold is a phenomenal film! it far exceeded any and all of my personal expectations!<br /><br />i suppose a film like this is what happens when you have a decent script, a talented, experienced, knowledgeable and goal oriented director, two incredible actors playing the lead roles and just a very hard working supporting cast and crew! khan and larter appear to have really great chemistry together and both shine on the big screen: they look really good together. the musical numbers weren't bad at all, which was surprising, considering how cheesy and long indian films' musicals are these days. and you'll be happy to know that the indian costumes are very far from being cheesy as you'll get.<br /><br />the beginning of the film was kind of slow, the middle was really good, the scenes leading to the climax were pretty dramatic, but the ending was just awesome! i have a few gripes and complaints about the dvd, however. while i loved the widescreen aspect ratio of the dvd, i didn't like the fact that several other things were left out of the dvd. for starters, there are no subtitles. now english being my first language, it's not a problem. however, when some of the indian actors and actresses spoke, it was (at times) difficult to understand what they were saying; captioning would have helped.<br /><br />another thing that i would have appreciated on the dvd would be a blooper reel or some kind of collection of outtakes. and lastly, how about a menu feature that would allow us to skip right to the musical numbers? man, some of those songs were really good! on the flip side, i throughly enjoyed watching the making of marigold.<br /><br />i have tons more to say regarding the awesomeness of this film and how much i liked it, but i don't have the time nor do i want to keep on writing why i enjoyed it so much. i hope that salman khan does more english films in addition to his hindi films and i certainly hope this hindi film will not be ali larter's last bollywood film. and i encourage the director to continue making bollywood film hybrids featuring salman khan, ali larter and other big name actors - just make sure the scripts are original and good.<br /><br />10/10 - this is just a great love story film that your entire family can enjoy!
