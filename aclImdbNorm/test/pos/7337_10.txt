this movie was beautiful and touching. it touched a place deep inside me and i'm not sure why. i am a happily married woman and i've never had lesbian tendencies, but my, this movie almost made it something i crave. the choreography, the storyline, the dialog... the movie was a work of art. <br /><br />the synopsis without spoilers is that a woman gymnast unsatisfied with her life and looking for... something, anything. she is with a man who does not want a baby, but she does. he's not mean to her, but he doesn't treat her the way a woman should be treated either... i guess he doesn't really appreciate her. all these years she has stayed in shape and decides to go back to the gym. she meets another woman during her acrobatic training and an intimate and beautiful relationship unfolds. throughout the movie she has another woman friend that she trained with in her younger years, and they have stayed close friends.<br /><br />the relationship that unfolds is.. i don't know quite the word, but very understanding, comfortable, intimate but sexy... something that could only exist between two women. the kind of relationship that could really bring meaning back into your life. someone that makes you feel special, exciting, beautiful, confused even.<br /><br />the relationship with her close friend is beautiful in an equally different way. they have a close and intimate relationship. her friend showed me what a true friend really is. someone who is understanding, easy going, real, fun to be with, someone who is there for you no matter what. someone who is supportive, and you can huddle with and tell your deepest secrets. someone who shares your past but does not share your secrets. <br /><br />the story is simple in the fact that it was not overdone, but not underdone in any way. it leaves a lot of sensual imagery to capture it's moments. the dancing and choreography was stunning. i could watch it over and over. the way the artist captured the main character's feelings and emotions was. the dancing and the imagery was very dazzling and mesmerizing to watch. what a cozy a wonderful story! i fell in love with this movie. if you have a chance, rent this and watch it!!
