i am a glutton for b-movies. i love the old drive-in fare like this movie. this film, made for very little money it seems, does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail. it is cheezy. it is gory. it has no real plot, but it entertained me for an hour and a half. i was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock. there are a few great effects like a shot from inside a guy's mouth when he gets stabbed in the chin by a knife and it pokes up through his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth, and one gross-out with a guy getting his eyeballs yanked out. but there is also loads of zombies, and some psycho killers patterned after texas chainsaw massacre, and a demon possessed scarecrow. i loved the dialogue that the killers spout as they torture and kill people. it has great camera work, and some cool editing tricks. this one is more original than the first bloodbath, and the undead look better, but it is still patterned after those dubbed trashy zombie movies of the 70's and 80's and it still has a cheeze factor that ranks mighty high. don't expect romero, just second-rate fulci. i would say that horror fans will like it, and it is funny and cheezy and a fast ride through b-movie land.
