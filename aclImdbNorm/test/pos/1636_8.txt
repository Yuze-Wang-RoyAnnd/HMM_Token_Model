yeah, i know my title sucks. i couldn't think of any other title. x] ice is a brilliant first season episode. very interesting idea and good acting as well. the whole worm-looking-thing was really creepy in my opinion. i've never been a fan of insects, so all the insect episodes are creepy to me. x] anyway, lets go on to the good and bad things about this episode,<br /><br />the good: the parasite thing. awesome!<br /><br />scully finally trusting mulder. awww... <33<br /><br />it was a good idea to put another parasite in the ear. though if someone told me they had to put that thing in my ear... i think the whole cabin would be dead.<br /><br />the bad: how did the dog stay alive for so long?<br /><br />how didn't huffman get those black spots? or maybe she did, but no-one saw it...<br /><br />conclusion: very good episode, especially for season 1. 8/10
