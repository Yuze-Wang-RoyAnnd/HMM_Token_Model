yes, i watch this show. because my girlfriend watches it, of course. well, at least, that's what i tell my friends. but as nobody here ever known me, i can say this; i love it! that's excellent trash tv. <br /><br />first, there's the panel; tyra herself, who doesn't miss a single opportunity to talk about herself, yet she is to be taken seriously, as she is quite the businesswoman. then there's jay manuel, a sober gay guy, very serious and amazingly professional, and miss jay, an extroverted one, "queen" of the catwalk and a damn funny guy, and nigel, self-styled as the only man on the panel.<br /><br />second, the show is an in-depth look at a shallow industry, and we've got to give it to the producers for showing us the inside view, which can be informative as well as entertaining.<br /><br />finally, the edition is great; there is just the right mix of everything; the girls living together in the ego-house, their impressions on sets, the competitions themselves and the judging. all of this slides smoothly with just the right beat. there are no lenghts.<br /><br />of course, there must be other factors that led to eliminations that we don't see in the shows; the panel is made up of capricious divas, extroverted and quick on the bitching; woe to those who offends them! but that being said, as long as one contestant does not step on their toes, their judgment is usually fair - i think.<br /><br />so, give your brain a break; if you can't beat them, join them, and have a good time watching this bit of reality tv with your loved ones. it will make crave for more, somehow.
