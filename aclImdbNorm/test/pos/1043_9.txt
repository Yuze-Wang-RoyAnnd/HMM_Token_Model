while it's not "perfect", it's close. love barbara stanwyck, sz sakall, sidney greenstreet, dennis morgan, robert shayne (superman's police chief), the housekeeper, the waiter at restaurant felix, and the judge......i can go on and on. this movie has been part of my family's holiday tradition since i was a youngster, and my children grew up with it, too! "the baby swallowed the watch" was always my son's favorite line.<br /><br />sexy barbara stanwyck in pants and gowns stole the show along with the cuddly, funny s. z. sakall. dennis morgan has a few great songs, too.<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the remake (blah).
