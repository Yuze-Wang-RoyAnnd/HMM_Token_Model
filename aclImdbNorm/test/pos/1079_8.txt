i saw this at the london film festival last night, apparently the shorter version. james mcnally's summary of the content of the film is very good. nossiter very deftly blends his investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation, homogenisation, the effect of the mass media, the power of capital and the need for diversity.<br /><br />the film is shot on hand-held dv which some might find offputting, but which does enable nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment.<br /><br />despite the sprawling feel of the film, the editing is very sharp, not only giving us a parade of the world's dogs, but also undercutting a number of interviewees' comments with somewhat contradictory visual images, and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves. to a degree this evoked michael moore's recent work (although nossiter operates in a more subtle way), but probably the roots of the film go back to marcel ophuls' "the sorrow and the pity", both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of 'salt of the earth' french peasants as the stars. de montille pere et fils were present at the lff screening and answered questions afterwards. we do indeed all need a little disorder - bravo hubert!<br /><br />overall an excellent film with implications that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves as people, and organise our world.
