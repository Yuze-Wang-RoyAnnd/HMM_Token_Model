at first glance a film like northfork, a town set to be flooded in 1955 and a group of 6 characters who are sent out to evacuate the remaining townspeople, could be just an ordinary film. as we soon meet a remaining priest taking care of a sick child, a greedy land owner, we could be set up for a simple story we could all easily digest. however, when one is first introduced to this film, you notice the amazing wide open cinematography and a scene involving a church hall missing a wall that opens up to the pastures and scenic view of the mountains with cattle grazing. it soon becomes clear that after this scene and a few of the towns peoples introduction, that this is no ordinary film and no ordinary story, it is something very special and unique.<br /><br />at first glance things are not as clear, but the cinematography and landscape that the viewer is witness to is stunning, and the characters that inhabit this small soon to be extinct area are just in word amazing. it's what can either draw you in closer to this qwerky film, or either have you bored sitting there waiting for something to happen.<br /><br />the films deep spiritual and dream like qualities, give it a slow and methodical approach which i am sure will bore some viewers, but if you are patient with it and see the bigger picture, the film is great to witness.<br /><br />rating 8 out of 10
