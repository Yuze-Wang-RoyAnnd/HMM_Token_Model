this is a film that in no way reflects the real world. nothing in this film makes any real world sense or has any real world logic. it operates entirely in its own little world and your ability to accept it or not will determine your love or hate for this film.<br /><br />i love the film.<br /><br />somewhere at the very beginning i bought into the completely unreal premise of the hit woman regaining her memory as the past comes back to haunt her. there was a moment early on where i remember accepting that this was going to be one of those movies where the heroine was going to know nothing until it was needed, despite all logic that it wouldn't happen that way. "oh its one of those films" i said to myself and was hooked as the film took off on a wild two hour chase.<br /><br />this is an action film with brain and brawn as things follow there own internal logic and you actually have to pay attention to follow some of the twists and turns. i like this a great deal and am pleasantly surprised when i bump into people who feel the same way too. people either love it or hate it, if they've ever heard of it at all.<br /><br />if you like action films this is a film to definitely try. you may not like it, but it certainly worth the effort to find out<br /><br />and as always, leave reality at the door.
