i haven't seen every single movie that burt reynolds has ever made, but this one (which i've just finished watching, for the third time) may very well be his best! it suffers only from some slow stretches; burt perhaps tried to make it more "arty" than it should have been. on the other hand, he managed to avoid many of the usual cliches in the presentation of the "tough cop" role he plays (notice, for example, the scene in which he attempts to kiss rachel ward for the first time, or the fear he expresses just before the final showdown with the indestructible henry silva). in fact, silva and those two ninja assassins are three of the most memorable villains of cop thrillers of the 80s. the film also has some offbeat touches, a surprising amount of humor, a brutal and gripping fistfight and many well-directed shots.
