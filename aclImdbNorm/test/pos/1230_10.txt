this is a haunting short film. both james franco and rachel miner deliver performances that hurt, ring true and stay with you. since this is called a tragic story this isn't much of a spoiler. but i wanted to change the outcome, even though it is right for the story, because i had already come to care about these people. i can only think of a few short films that have had that effect on me. beautifully shot, acted, edited. high caliber work all around, even to the use of just the right sound and/or music to advance the story. the end credit song finished the job, wringing even more emotion from me. this is first rate from beginning to end. kudos to the writer/director and all involved.<br /><br />this is my first review of a film in the comments section. i promised to do so in exchange for a copy of the dvd. the review could be good or bad, just my honest opinion. this is it and it's the least i can do. i am so glad i got to see it.
