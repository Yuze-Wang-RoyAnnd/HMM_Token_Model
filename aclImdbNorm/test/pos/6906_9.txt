i just saw this at siff, and i absolutely loved it. there were parts where i laughed so hard i couldn't catch my breath. the script and direction by glenn mcquaid are fantastic. i can't wait to see more from this talented young man. the performances make the movie. larry fessenden and dominic monaghan are just delightful as the graverobber willy and his apprentice arthur. ron perlman turns in a fantastic performance (as usual) as a less-than-sympathetic jailhouse priest. bonus: angus scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor! as always, he balances menace and humor perfectly.<br /><br />this is a style of horror comedy that really hasn't been seen since vincent price did "comedy of terrors," "the raven," and "theater of blood." the movie is genuinely scary in places, then it'll suddenly flip back into hilarious mode, keeping you totally off balance. some parts are scary and funny at the same time.<br /><br />i can only afford to see three movies at siff this year, but even if the other two are awful, "i sell the dead" was worth the price of all three. i'm going to be looking for more movies from larry fessenden's glass eye pix. he's giving the horror genre a much-needed kick in the butt.
