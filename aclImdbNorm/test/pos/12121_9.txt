great film about an american g.i. who quits the army to marry a german girl who saved his life in the last days of the war. she accepts, but does she do it because she really likes him, or because he can support her with easier access to food and such? meanwhile, her brother and an old friend form an anti-american terrorist group called the werewolves, their purpose to drive away the occupants (you might remember the same group playing a major part in lars von trier's film europa (zentropa)). james best, best known for his role as roscoe p. coltrane in the 1980s television show the dukes of hazzard, is shockingly excellent as the american. he should have become a big movie star
