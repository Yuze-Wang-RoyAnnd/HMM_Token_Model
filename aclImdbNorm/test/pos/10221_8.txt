i experienced nightbreed for the first time on television a year ago and i was pleasantly surprised with the results.<br /><br />clive barker is said to have revitalised horror with hellraiser but this is a film that effectively stalled his cinema career somewhat. what an unfortunate thing to happen because, like the inhabitants of midian, this film seems to be misunderstood.<br /><br />barker has created a cross-breed of genre staples in this story - it begins as a traditional horror film but soon becomes a fable regarding mans inhumanity to man. evoking sympathy for the devil is tough at the best of times but when the characters are as visually demonic as they are in this film it becomes nigh on impossible (cue the child!). the practically klan-like human insurgence (pitchforks and holy wrath!) at the films conclusion becomes doubly upsetting in the face of what has gone before. as a parable of ethnic tension and white supremacy this film can be quite evocative.<br /><br />i pity those who will not see the film from this angle and think of it as barker's fantastical indulgence gone too far. we have a genuine forgotten gem here and the sooner the studio and mr barker make nice and devote some time to it - the better.
