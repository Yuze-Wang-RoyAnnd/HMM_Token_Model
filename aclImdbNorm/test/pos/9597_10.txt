this is a true gem of a tv film. based on a completely untrue story, it follows the course of the down-and-out football league club through their course in the english fa cup, where mayhem ensues and the players all sport seventies styles. the ending is unexpected, the performances are great, and nick hancock shows that he can do something other than host sports shows. my only regret is that i didn't tape it.
