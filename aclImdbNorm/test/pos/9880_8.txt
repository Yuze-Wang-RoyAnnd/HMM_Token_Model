i loved this movie when i was younger, and i have actually been looking for it again!! i would love to watch it again!! the information is all correct, but the cover doesn't look like it would match - i can't say for sure though. from what i remember, the movie was about these kids (alyssa milano, tina yothers, etc.) in a driving class, and it also shows the mischief they get into outside the class. edie mcclurg was alyssa milano's mother in the movie. i remember i really liked it so if anyone knows where i can get a copy (preferably dvd) of the movie listed above (with those stars in it) i would love to know. thank-you :)
