... the reason i like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has. it's a genial summer camp movie, so the jokes aren't mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character the permanent butt of ridicule. pranks do take place, but you get the feeling that the respective fall-guys would be able to look back and laugh, having been dopey enough to fall for them - and without being too cheesy, it's actually kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in the end!<br /><br />it's an extra special bonus when the ringmaster of all these jolly japes is bill murray. for me, he's still looked upon as the comedy god without peer when he gets a chance to cut loose. no one's better at generating a sense of freewheeling wacky anarchy without really hurting anyone. the tone of the entire film has the same style as its leading man, established with a great opening scene showing the murray way of getting ready for the day. everything's silly, yes, but more important than behaving like an adult is to have a whole lot of good-natured fun. "meatballs" promises such and ultimately delivers a nourishing watch.
