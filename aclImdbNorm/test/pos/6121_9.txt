more entertaining than all the gay orgies in "300" combined. more heartbreaking than a shakespearian tragedy. more poetic than even the most melodramatic poems about lost love and blah blah blah. and on top of all that, the greatest trash ever made.<br /><br />a black comedy testing the limits of the human senses, john waters's cult movie "pink flamingos" is a story about the conflict between two families that ends in humiliation, death and of course the eating of dog feces (yeah by the way that is not actually the humiliating part). no no, this is not about the impossible love, there are no romeos or juliets on these 90 or so minutes. this movie is about the battle for prestige if you could call it that. the battle for the title - filthiest person alive.<br /><br />on one side we have divine (played by the cross-dressing waters regular... umm... divine) a caring daughter, good mother, cannibal, murderer, pervert and current owner of said title. she loves her son crackers a bit way too much. crackers himself sports a sexual attraction to both chickens and young ladies sometimes mixing them up in threesomes. family friend and loyal accomplice cotton gets her satisfaction from watching crackers during some of his... acts involving the mentioned earlier objects of attraction. last but not least divine's mother and grandmother to crackers, edie. a 400 hundred pound woman, sleeping, eating and basically living in a baby cradle. she is addicted to eggs and loves the egg-man (the man who brings the eggs...lol).<br /><br />the four of them live peacefully in a caravan outside the city until the moment when they become a target for the marbles. exhibitionists, manipulators, cheaters, very evil people actually. their main source of income comes from the kidnapping and impregnating of young women. for the impregnating part they use their trusted and loyal cross-dressing butler to provide the semen. after that they sale the birthed child to the highest bidder.<br /><br />it was the marbles's envy towards divine and her title that will lead to an inevitable confrontation between the two families. an epic battle of filth, perversion and violence.<br /><br />"pink flamingos" is an unsurpassed masterpiece in the trash-movie genre. loaded with oddities and strange acts, john waters's movie is loathed and hated by traditionalists, critics and the average movie-going audience. but for the few that remain unscratched by these generalizations the flamingos is an unforgettable experience. funny and sick, violent and poetic. it truly is an exercise in poor taste
