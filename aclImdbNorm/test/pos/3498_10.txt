i don't see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor. you need to get your head out of your up-tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious! if this isn't your "cup of tea", so to speak, then look at it for what it truly is- a damn funny movie. maybe they did set out to make yet another drugs/t&a movie, but in this case, they've truly hit the spot. it's especially funny for the ali g fans, because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him. so i say big ups to ali g, and if it's not your thing, don't whine- batty boy!
