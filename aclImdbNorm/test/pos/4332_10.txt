this movie is true action at its finest, it doesn't get any better then this. this is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this. my favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a tv or something and he goes right up to them and yells "i will come in here anytime i like!!!" and right before he jumps out the window he yells "anytime!!!" i mean this is just classic stuff all the way around so you got a choice, you can watch that crappy will smith try to go an action film or you can watch one of the masters charles bronson!!!!
