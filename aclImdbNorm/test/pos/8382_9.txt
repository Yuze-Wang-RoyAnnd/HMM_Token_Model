brad pitt sticks his index finger in diane kruger's leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants. funny, horribly so. the invented yarn takes "the dirty dozen" for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies. lots of fun. even "paris when it sizzles" is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog. i was thrilled by christoph waltzer's character and by his sensational performance. brad pitt creates a true original. i love the actor's lack of vanity. there's a quirk in the character that is pure brad pitt. tarantino visits a new universe but. fortunately, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible all over the place.
