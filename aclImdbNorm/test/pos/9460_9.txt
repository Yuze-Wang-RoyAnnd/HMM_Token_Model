i caught this movie right in my eye when i was passing by a hall of posters in the nearby cinema. the tag line was sort of confusing and immediately after reading it, i thought of the possibility of it being similar to national lampoon's dorm daze. i liked that movie, aside from having a huge collection of such genres, i decided to hit it to the cinemas right after my exams for a tension releaser.<br /><br />delightfully, i came out smiling from cheek to cheek and had an equally great amount of laughter at bits and points of the movie. amanda bynes definitely kicked it off better than keira knightley in bend it like beckham. being both a male and female actor is definitely not that kind of easy especially having to face the similarities of life, coupled together with the reactions that the actress have to respond to. this movie requires a great deal of confusion to confuse themselves and us viewers at the same time. the only way of pulling it off is through this movie.<br /><br />the principal is obviously sickly hilarious in a serious manner, the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and so are the actors. i'd recommend this movie to all who needs a weekend relaxation and don't worry, you will get laughs throughout the movie. it is a definite guarantee.
