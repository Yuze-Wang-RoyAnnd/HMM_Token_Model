one of the better movies to come out of the 1980's, this based-on-fact movie tells the story of a disturbed high school student who murders his girlfriend, leaves her naked body on a river bank, and brags about it later to his friends. what is just as bad is their inability to feel anything about it.<br /><br />disturbing but incredibly compelling look at aimless and apathetic kids who have no respect for their parents or any sort of authority, who seem almost doomed to live lives of rebellion and recklessness. this drama hits hard and is impossible to forget. the young cast does a creditable job - even keanu reeves, in one of his earliest roles, is better than usual. of course, there's no reason for the character of layne (crispin glover) to be as crazed and off-the-wall as he is, but that's just glover being himself. veteran dennis hopper has an especially good role as a loner who despite his own sordid past is saddened by the attitudes of this group of kids. i would like to point out the chilling performance by daniel roebuck as the young murderer; he's an under-rated actor and aside from hopper, his is probably the best performance in the film.<br /><br />i saw "river's edge" for the first time a long time ago when it first started being shown on cable tv movie channels; however, i didn't catch all of it; i saw it in its entirety for the first time a number of years later, and now i've seen it again for what is probably the definitive time.<br /><br />some potently affecting moments include madeleine's (constance forslund) breakdown where she wails that maybe she should leave her children just like their worthless father did. i also liked the scenes where matt (reeves) faces off with his disturbed younger brother (joshua miller) and when the teacher, mr. burkewaite (jim metzler) deplores the fact that the girl has died and that none of his students seem to care.<br /><br />i will never forget this film, not as long as i live. it's too saddening for that.<br /><br />10/10
