this movie was a pleasant surprise because i didn't expect much. i didn't know that some of the actors have since become bigger stars in major pix. while moving on to the matrix is not a plus in my book (hated it), i'm sure it's a career plus for hugo. james purefoy is great in this and jennifer ehle sweet and wonderful. it seemed sometimes like a carnaby street romp 30 years later but i enjoyed the thrift shop janis joplin clothes mixed up with the modern mindsets of sexual and gender blur. the real estate agent who has an erotic relationship with his listings is loads of fun. the iron john mens' group meetings are a bit dated but i still loved them. it's a social satire sex comedy in the best way and reminds me a bit of the old "carry on" movies. the british know how to do sex comedy and it's an old tradition, unlike the united states which is too prudish to really understand that sex is funny.
