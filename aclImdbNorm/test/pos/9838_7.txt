this is not a 'real' james cagney vehicle since his screen time is unusually slim. frankie darro plays tough kid jimmy smith, the leader of a gang of street thugs that is sent to reform school with a few of his hoodlum friends. cagney plays patsy gargan, a gang leader himself, who is given a token position as a deputy commissioner. when he finds out first hand of the brutal treatment dished out at the reform school, he is compelled to make some major changes with the help of the reformatory nurse(madge evans). <br /><br />the mayor of hell is fast paced and is still entertaining after all these years. the cast is well rounded featuring: dudley digges, arthur bryon, 'farina' hoskins, g. pat collins and allen jenkins.
