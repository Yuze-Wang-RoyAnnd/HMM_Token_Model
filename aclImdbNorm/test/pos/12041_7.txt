darr was a super hit film, which was loved by many peoples. it tells the story of shahrukh khans innocent obsession for juhi, who loves sunny deol. honestly it was a entertaining movie, but if you look carefully its not too realistic. shahrukh khan keeps phoning juhi and tells her that he loves her too bits. he gives an announcement in college that he loves her, and gives her some nice surprises like beautiful photos of her. unfortunately, instead of being flattered that a guy loves her too bits, she gets very very scared. i personally know 100s of people that get pranked by someone, and these people enjoy it, cos they play a long. yash chopra gives us a good film that does entertain, widely because of shah rukh khan's character. sunny deol is suppose to be the main actor, but darr belongs to shah rukh khan delivering a superb performance. shah rukh khan is literally the villain of the movie, but i would of been happy if he got the girl, because he loves her so dearly. sunny deol gives a decent performance, but he beats up all those guys on his own, and survives a brutal knife attack. juhi chawla is cute as ever in a fairly good performance. some good songs including tu mere samne being the best.
