i was laughing so hard most of the time i had people glaring at me because they couldn't hear over my laughter. i literally fell out of my seat at a specific point.<br /><br />i'm a bartender and bouncer for a living in the real world (note my use of the term real world, sadly it always has to come first), and whenever i tell someone i play rpg's, it's usually followed by one of two questions: 1. what, like d&d? i played that back in junior high.<br /><br />2. really? i've been looking or a group forever! have room for another? very rarely do people not know what d&d and gaming are.<br /><br />that having been said almost every person who watches this movie can get something out of it. even if you aren't a gamer, chances are there is something in your life you "geek out" about that can be made fun of in a light hearted way, and that alone means you can relate to the hijinx in this flick. it's just light hearted happiness in an hour and a half.
