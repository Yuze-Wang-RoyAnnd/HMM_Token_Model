playwright john osborne's (look back in anger, the entertainer) dramatisation of oscar wilde's only novel positively revels in the homosexual subtext of the original, perhaps too much so. nonetheless, the dialogue, the acting, with a cast headed by sir john gielgud & jeremy brett, and the brilliantly cerebral production (marred only by a "too quick" ending) make this worth the while of any lover of theater, with a capital "t".
