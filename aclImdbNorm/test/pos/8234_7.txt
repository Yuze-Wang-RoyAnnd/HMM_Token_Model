note the wide release date of aug 8, 1945 - about a week before japan surrendered in wwii, so there will probably be a message for us in "over 21". irene dunne (it happened one night, the 1939 version of love affair) is paula wharton, who goes to live on an army base while her newspaper editor husband is in training school. alexander knox ( the longest day) is her hubby max. look for charles coburn (monkey business, gentlemen prefer blondes) as the stuffy, commanding, newspaper boss. also look for cora witherspoon as mrs. gates, from the women, bank dick, libeled lady. war story written for the wives' point of view, which wasn't too common in those days. fun commentary on the shabby condition of the "married housing"; irene's wardrobe in this film certainly wasn't at all shabby.. since they never had to leave their little cottage, it appears the whole movie budget was spent on her always-exquisite dresses and hats.
