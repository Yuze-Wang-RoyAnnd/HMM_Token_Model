this movie is just about as good as the first jackass, but with slightly more disgusting skits. i wouldn't say this was as good as the first, but it came very close. jackass fans will not be disappointed, but if you didn't like the first movie, you will hate this one. there are scenes that will be seen as jackass classics (the elderly suits with "additions", the "cab ride", and many others), and those that you will wish you never watched (eating crap, drinking semen, etc...) overall this movie was a good watch, and i am glad i got to see it. i'm sure this movie will not have the best rating due to critics that rate it (i sat in the press section and most of the older viewers seemed disgusted), but don't let that stop you from enjoying it.
