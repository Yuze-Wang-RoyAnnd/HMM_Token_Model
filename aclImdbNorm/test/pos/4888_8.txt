whether you're a fan of the series which inspired it or not, there's no denying this is a patchy piece of work. but in the best possible sense. keen to get away from the trappings of old sitcoms which made an uneasy transition to the big screen, messrs pemberton, dyson, shearmsith and gatiss have gone down a different road, addressing the problems of dealing with their success along with adding other creations and, inevitably, rehashing some of their best-loved characters. it's a pity they didn't stick to just a more consistent league of gents movie because as inventive as including themselves in the screenplay is, it weakens the finished movie. well worth renting though.
