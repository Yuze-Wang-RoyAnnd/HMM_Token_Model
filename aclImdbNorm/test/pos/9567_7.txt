well in to 2002 i've got some catching up to do. and looking back on a lacklustre year, best in show shone. no great storyline. little action. just a cavalcade of magnificent characters. particular reference to fred willard and jim piddock as a rattling pair of tv commentators. well done. well worth the effort.<br /><br />ron (viewed 24mar2001)
