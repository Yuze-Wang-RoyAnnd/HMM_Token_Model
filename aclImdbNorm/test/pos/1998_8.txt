okul is the first of its kind in turkish cinema, and it's way better than i expected. those people who say it's neither scary nor funny have a point, it's not all that great indeed. but it must be kept in mind that everyone involved with the movie is rather amateur, so it's basically a maiden voyage. and comparing this one to sinan cetin's other films such as the 1st class garbage "propaganda", this movie is pretty damn good.<br /><br />one thing that must be said: it deals with the highschool students' life in turkey very realistically! that's exactly how it goes! the scenes that are meant to scare are somewhat cheap, and hollywoodish. most of them even if not all. but that religion lesson scene made me laugh in tears, and emre k'ynay performs the best acting of this flick as a religion teacher.<br /><br />it's not a waste of your time, go and watch it! you'll find it rather amusing especially if you know turkey enough to relate to turkish youngsters' school lives.
