being a fan of time travel stories i was surprised that there was no 'device' that sent russell johnson's character through time. he just appeared in 1865. it was a disappointing part of the episode. i enjoyed the premise of the dangers of 'altering' the future by changing the past. other twilight zone episodes about time travel such as "no time like the past", "once upon a time", etc. were more to my liking because of the uses of time travel 'devices'. perhaps if russell johnson's character had been the same character he played in "execution" it would have been more acceptable to fans like myself. as sci-fi fans know, no characters really ever have to 'die' in time travel episodes. all sorts of plot 'twists' can be applied in these types of stories. that was the only flaw i could comment on for this episode.
