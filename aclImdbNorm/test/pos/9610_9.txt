the undoubted highlight of this movie is peter o'toole's performance. in turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic. does anybody do it better than o'toole? i don't think so. what a great face that man has!<br /><br />the story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts (especially toward the end) but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels. however, i felt the film basically revolved around peter o'toole's luminous performance and i'm sure i wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it.
