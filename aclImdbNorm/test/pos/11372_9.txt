i believe it has been over 40 years since i saw this series, yet memory of it hasn't faded a bit. this would be a natural for dvd re-issue, it seems to me. many of the performers have gone on to greater fame (robert hardy, sean connery, to name a couple); though it was a smallish role, i still remember judy dench, then in her 20's, as katherine of france (henry v). she was very lovely then as now.<br /><br />there is a hint on this site that the series was filmed in color - is this so? who of us would know - virtually no color tv in those days. mores the pity, no vcr's; if so, some might have recorded it. as a way of teaching english history, this series made it come alive in ways few class room teachers can manage.<br /><br />what a fine re-issue this would be!
