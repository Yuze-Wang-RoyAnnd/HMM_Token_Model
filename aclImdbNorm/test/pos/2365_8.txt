great 1980s comic strip comedy set in the south west of england. it is a tale of sex, drugs, cream teas and murder by the seaside. adrian edmondson, french and saunders, nigel planer (hilarious in drag) and robbie coltrane play a part. dennis (edmondson) tries to impress girlfriend by boasting he is involved in a multi-million pounds drug deal. this leads to complications with hilarious results. i am trying to find out the original picture ratio for this film but it does not appear under 'technical aspects' of the imdb site. i spotted the dvd in the shop and it appears to be in 1.33:1 (full screen) format. was the film shot in this ratio or was it originally a widescreen film with a pan and scan dvd? it would be useful to know as i hate pan and scan films. so come on imdb. could you find out for us?
