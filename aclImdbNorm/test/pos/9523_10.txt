for all of us american deneuve fans, this little gem is a little tough to get ahold of. fortunately, i found myself so wrapped up in the short bits that i saw previewed on youtube.com that i was willing to go to any lengths. i found it on ebay.com, ordered it directly from france, and changed my laptop so it would play region 2 dvds. let me tell you that it was well worth it. be warned - there are no subtitles (unforunately, pathe shouldn't have released this on dvd, koch lorber should've - they're good about the subtitles). i don't speak a word of french. i can utter a syllable here and there, order a drink and whatnot. that having been said, this film was a treat anyway. i couldn't fully appreciate the supposed "bawdy" humor or the witty dialogue. watching deneuve and her cohorts was enough for me. i understood what was going on without need of the dialogue. it really says something about a film when those who can't speak the language enjoy it. <br /><br />the cinematography is wonderful. london is adorable as the smitten son-on-law. loved the lesbian mom. and, of course, what can i possibly say about our dear mademoiselle deneuve. she is one of a kind. those eyes, that smile. i could watch her films all day. she really goes beyond beauty. people always say she's gorgeous. well, yes, she is. but she is also very talented. i believed her every second of the way. her conversation about chocolate and vanilla with london is too sweet. her character even gets arrested for smoking dope with some 15 year old in the street. not to be missed! fly to france and buy this if you have to. great. 10
