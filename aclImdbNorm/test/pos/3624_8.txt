i hope, from his seat on heaven's comedic throne, spike milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as terence ryan and ken tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it "nearly turned me mad" into a joy to watch.<br /><br />the film tells the story of the irish town of puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between northern ireland and the republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard. this causes some deceased, buried in the catholic churchyard, to now be in the protestant north - and so the local priest, assisted by a wide variety of eccentric locals, aims to move the bodies back undercover of darkness, and so avoiding the bureaucratic british border guards.<br /><br />it was inspired work to cast the irish comedian and poet sean hughes to play the part of madigan. he brings an innocence to the part, especially in his to-camera pieces (which is normally where he interacts with the voiceover of richard attenborough, playing supposedly the writer/director of the film). daragh o'malley playing father rudden is also worthy of considerable praise; and the rest of the cast, from the household names like elliott gould and griff rhys jones to people with what would normally be called 'bit parts' - such as spike's daughter jane who plays madigan's wife give 100% the credit for this goes, in no small part, to the wonderful characterisations given by spike in the original book.<br /><br />i could argue that the film is slightly too long, or that elliott gould's irish accent left a little to be desired, but those would be only minor points and take nothing away from the excellence of this film.
