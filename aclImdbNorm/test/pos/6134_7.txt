yeah i watched this mini series with my mom and dad as a kid. it was one of the few mini series that my 9 year old mind actually could follow. i recall it was very well done, and didn't necessarily have the feel of the typical crap mini series. it was more or less an original concept that really grabbed your attention. i would recommend this miniseries to anyone who is a fan of history and plot twists. although most twists in this movie are either spelled out or predictable, it is still worth the time. i haven't checked to see if you can get it through netflix yet however. i would imagine not. they should play it on the history channel or something.
