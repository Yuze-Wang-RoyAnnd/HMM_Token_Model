most movies from hollywood seem to follow one of a few pre-formulated and very predictable plots. this film does not and is a perfect example of what i watch ifc for.<br /><br />there's a guy, michael, and his girlfriend left him with out a word. he wants to know what happened. is she ok ? can he say goodbye ? perhaps get some closure. he hasn't been able to contact grace and in an effort to find her he has made a film asking for your help.<br /><br />michael figures we might need a reason to help him, so he tells us his story by reliving his relationship with the help of a friend ( nadia ) to play the role of grace ( the girlfriend who left) <br /><br />hind sight is 20/20 and it is no different for michael. by telling his story, and getting feedback from his friends, he realizes his mistakes and just how much he values what he has lost. this is unfortunately a lesson we all have had to learn ( or need to learn ) and is easy to identify with. that is what makes you want to hear more of michael's story and wanting to know if he finds grace.
