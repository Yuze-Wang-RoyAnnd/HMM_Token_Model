the mountainous woods, young happy campers, a warning by a park ranger and a lurking figure. the ingredients are there for a horror delight, and director/co-writer jeff lieberman does an adequate job at achieving it. it's formulaic woodland horror, but for most part the execution is at the top the game and the story (which is quite basic in a trimmed sense) is effectively told in certain realism. maybe a little more exposition wouldn't have gone astray, but lieberman's craftsmanship makes up for the material's flaws and typical details with rising tension, moody visuals and a smothering atmosphere created by brad fiedel's very ominously lingering score. whenever that very creepy whistling was cued in, it painted a truly unnerving sense that settled in with the beautiful backdrop. cinematographers dean m. and joel king do a striking job too. there's plenty of style abound, even with its minimal scope and the build-up is slow grinding. at times the pacing can become a stop-and-go affair. it's not particularly violent, but there's still a mean-streak evident even if some of it happens of screen. the latter chase scenes and escalating fear is well done, as it has the darkness coming alive with its burly killer/s and you get actor george kennedy riding his white horse in a slight, but wonderful turn. there's a likable bunch of performances; deborah benson makes for a strong, dashing heroine. gregg henry, chris lemmon ralph seymour, jamie rose, mike kellin and katie powell round off a modest cast of believable deliveries. the final climax is rather twisted, but the ending is one of those types that leave you thinking
