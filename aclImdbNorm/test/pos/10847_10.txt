both the book and the film are excellent in their own right. they do differ slightly but that enhances and not detracts from what is an excellent script and acting. the historical atmosphere, the young girl looking for love, the amazing background of music hall and the voyage into the lesbian world of london early twentieth century make this an exceptional movie. andrew davies as the scriptwriter excels himself as he writes this lesbian love story with such sensitivity. rachael sterling and keeley hawes are both excellent actresses and give these parts their best. the rest of the cast are very good. if there was higher than 10 out of 10 i would give it!
