i have to agree with the previous author's comments about the excellent performances and plot. started watching this movie by accident...(lazy sunday afternoon clicking channels to see if anything good was on)...and was mesmerized by martin sheen and emilio estevez. wow! gut wrenching! kudos to everyone (have always admired martin sheen) but was particularly impressed with emilio! excellent job of acting and directing...simply superb! so why have i never heard of this movie before? i'll have to spread the news.
