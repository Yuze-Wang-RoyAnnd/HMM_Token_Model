personally, i loved tris movie! my best friend told me about it so i rented it out a watched it. it's amazing! the music, the acting, the story lines the emotion, everything...... well except for one minor fact. absolutely no loyalty to the books at all. i saw this movie before interview with the vampire and before i even knew the books existed, so i was shocked to find how many people actually hated the movie. i picked up quickly that the book fans weren't at all happy with the unfaithfulness, not wanting to be hypocritical (i hate the harry potter movies due to lack of book loyalty)i stayed silent. eventually i picked up "the vampire lestat" and understood immediately why everyone hated it. it is completely different (the movie queen of the damned is a combination of "the vampire lestat" and "the queen of the damned"). but i still loved the movie from when i saw it before reading any of the books. so if you haven't seen this movie or read the book watch the movie first or you'll hate it. if you have read the book then you have every right to hate this movie.
