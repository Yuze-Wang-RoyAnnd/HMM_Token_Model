up and coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the black culture. the focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people, and hope for change. i advise this selection for every american household to experience the struggle, and the reward. the show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle-class blacks becoming business owners of their own. the issue's were so compatible with real life situation's that impacted the lives of so many. i sincerely hope that the entire volume can be restored, and put on dvd for americans to enjoy with their families.<br /><br />thanks.
