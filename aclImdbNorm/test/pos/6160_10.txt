nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film. the fact that you keep seeking and hoping for more flying sequences, tells you that they have just enough. the acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid.............<br /><br />a must rent, view, or see.<br /><br />don't be afraid of subtitles........<br /><br />its worth a little aversion therapy<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />
