this movie was really funny. the people that were expecting to see an oscar worthy comedy, should get over themselves. this was a fun movie to see with interesting and funny characters, plot lines, dialog quotes and catch phrases. i rate a movie a 10 if i have bought the dvd, or in this case, the videotape, and have watched it many times, and in this case, still laugh out loud. i have about 12 movies in my collection with a rating of 10 and about half don't have anything do do with the oscars. again, this was just a fun, light-hearted movie. i hope this comes out on dvd. i highly suggest checking this movie out, if you are in the mood for a wacky comedy.
