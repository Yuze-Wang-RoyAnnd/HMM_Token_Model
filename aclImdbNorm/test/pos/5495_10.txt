a great performance by clint eastwood and particularly john malkovich in my opinion his finest one to date. malkovich had this one nailed right down to the floor it's incredible. eastwood is agent mike horrigan, an aged and cynical secret service agent who is finishing out his career busting counterfeiters and chasing down routine assignments. but one assignment which appears to be run of the mill at first turns complicated and deadly serious. horrigan and his new partner al are sent to investigate a threat on the president by a "wacko". as fate would have it horrigan has stumbled not upon a delusional nut but a professional lone wolf who has a big bone to pick with the white house. as horrigan dives deeper into "booth's" world he attracts the bad guy's unwanted attention and unbridled admiration for him. horrigan was jfk's top agent and present in dallas, texas when he was assassinated and blames himself for what happened. now he feels it's up to him to stop the current head of state from joining the list of dead presidents. but this killer has turned the tables on horrigan and now he's the hunted one in a life or death cat and mouse game. who will win? who will die? it's a race against time to save the pres from a chameleon-like enemy who can get to anyone. my favorite secret service movie and as good a nail biter as any.
