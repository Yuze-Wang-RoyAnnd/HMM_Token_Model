brett piper again makes a very good film that is trashed by the so called film "experts." it is low budget, but fun, and the leading lady is very sexy. i wish i could see more of irene joseph. good viewing fun. i bought the dvd and enjoyed it. the special effects are stop motion animation, and much better than the computer generated crap they call effects today. i always enjoy brett piper movies, and if you liked this i recommend bite me, screaming dead and anything else he has done. i look forward to seeing more of his work and well as more of ms. joseph. i simply cannot see why this woman hasn't been in more movies, as her acting is excellent.
