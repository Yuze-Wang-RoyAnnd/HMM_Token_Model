so forgive the *really* lame game-play scene, cardboard background and studio like stadium. for this part i should have give the movie 5 instead of 7, but read on...<br /><br />from the premise to plot there is a lot similarities with "the replacements". some say this movie rip off "the replacements", while some say this script wrote before it. <br /><br />both movies require some sort of "suspension of disbelief on the basic premise, and this is especially difficult for "second string" since it has nfl license team and all the history behind it. food poison excuse may sound too lame for some people, and not to mention in "second string" bills has to overcome big scores again and again, with the limit budget in shooting the game play scene, this make it look even bad. <br /><br />in "replacements", the premise and the league is fictional yet you know it happen in real life. i believe it is easier to accept fictional story and setting with real event ("oh yeah, this happen before!", rather than real setting/background with fictional scenario ("there is no way bill can win a superbowl!"; some of the scene were actually shoot in pre season game of raven games, real stadium, real audience and some nfl match alike shooting angle.<br /><br />but let say both movies came out on the same day, and we erase the budget factor (thus forgive the game play action scene): overall, i like "second string" over "replacements", not by much, but i like this more. <br /><br />it has "relatively better" character development. in "replacements", keanu character is too "out sync with the world", and all he care is maybe, get a girl? in second string you see the struggle of the qb from getting the job back, and deal with his past with coach. or the fumble guy problem. this "hold the ball all day long" solution of course is not new, but we see progression in fixing it.<br /><br />how about those trick play? i think it is "relatively realistic" than "replacements". the "dan marino" like fake knee pass, flea-flicker, wild cat full back rush, all real, except sometimes this look a bit too easy. but for me it is better than "replacement"'s center catch and rushing for 50 yards call, or how a 60 yards field goal look too easy. oh btw, i am glad they didn't force the te kicker made his shot....<br /><br />of course ---if you objectively review this movie over other football movies all there, this could easily be a 5 out of 10 movie. but some say this is the worse football movie? try "the comebacks".
