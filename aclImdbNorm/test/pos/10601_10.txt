i loved this movie and i watch it everyday. i think that although the acting isn't all that great, it's really just a bunch of guys having fun with a script. i had been looking all over for this movie, for almost a year, and when i found it for thirty dollars, i just had to get it. it is now, by far my favorite movie of all time. it deals with relationship failure, and at the same time making a joke of it. i loved all the parts with don vito, especially the one where valo asks him for a grape when they're sitting on the porch, and he tells him to eat the one rolling down the porch. it really portrays him as he really is. the part in the "making of" really touched me, when they adressed brandon novak's addiction to heroin, and how much his friends and family were trying to help him. a new movie that's in the making, called "dreamseller," is in production, which is about the story of novak's dreams, shattered by his addiction.
