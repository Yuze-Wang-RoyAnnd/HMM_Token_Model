this review contains mild spoilers, but not enough to spoil the story...<br /><br />watched nihon chinbotsu (sinking of japan or japan sinks, depending on where you live) recently, a remake of the 1970's movie of the same name, which itself was based on sakyo komatsu's best-selling novel. this movie is a gem of japanese film-making. it appears that japan is sinking due to a subduction of a tectonic plate to the west. the americans predict that it would happen in the period of 40 years, but according to dr.tadokoro (a seemingly 'mad' scientist), it will happen in less than a year. the japanese government isn't that convinced but sets up a disaster evacuation plan as well as form a new d1 team to handle the crisis. while on a trip to china to negotiate evacuation plans, the japanese prime minister was killed, and sends the cabinet into a state of panic. the d1 team is left to handle most matters, and led by the newly elected minister of crisis management, saoro takamori (dr.tadokoro's ex-wife). she turns instead to dr.tadokoro for advice, and he has plans to blow astronomically huge holes under japan to avert the process of sinking.<br /><br />japan would soon have to negotiate with various countries and persuade them to adopt japanese refugees. soon, it seems that a lot of countries are reluctant to accept any more due to the sudden influx of japanese in their country and the chaos that follows (if this ever happens, touch-wood, i hope ito misaki will be safe... she can always stay at my place... hee hee). the scenes of evacuations are really well done, showing the havoc, suffering and desperation civilians have to face in such disastrous times. and the many faces of human beings surface, arrogance, selfishness, bribery, bravery, cowardry...<br /><br />this is a really well-made film. the storytelling is solid, with an engaging storyline and wonderful acting. dr.tadokoro (played by toyokawa etsushi) was done really well, portraying a divorced and often mad scientist who kicks and bashes up stuff. his frustration and concerns were very visible and that's a really good thing. reiko (played by gorgeous shibasaki kou) was also played rather well, and has the most memorable line in the entire movie (go watch it to find out) and i fancy that she has a nice acting voice. she plays the love interest of toshio onodera (played by tsuyoshi kusanagi of smap). oh, i almost forgot... she has really, really long hair~ and there's also a subtle but background love story, which is well written and if there's something the japanese do really well, it's love stories...<br /><br />one thing that makes this movie interesting is the technical explanations of the events that occur, and if you're interested in geography, you'll have a really good time (i know i did... hehe). i can see that they went to great lengths to make this movie's theory believable, and the first few graphical displays and explanation were done rather well (although you'll have to excuse the japanese's famous "engrish".<br /><br />ok, now about the effects (it's all about the effects, isn't it?). after watching the movie with pure awe, i must say that this movie has special effects that are on par (or even better) with some hollywood productions. the volcanic eruptions... the massive earthquakes... destruction... tsunamis... explosions... all done splendidly. the opening scene is so cool, the 1st earthquake catches you by surprise, mountains fall, the destruction due to volcanic eruptions makes you cringe... to actually watch mount fuji heat up is a marvel... then you see shibuya fall to the ground... it's so sad!!! however, what i felt was one of the best scenes was the giant tsunami scene, which sees rescue operations fail and people left with nowhere to run and no hope to hold on to... the ending scene also deserves a mention... wonderful stuff. if you like effects, you'll love this movie.<br /><br />oh ya... every good movie has a great song behind it. the seriously addictive "keep holding u" sung by the super-cute and adorable sunmin is a duet with kubota, and it's simply lovely. i feel it suits the movie really well and it shows that no matter what disasters hit us, our love and strength would keep us holding on. the disaster scenes are handled with orchestra music and at times silence (a japanese specialty) and really gives a sense of chaos to the destruction on screen. oh, and did i mention it's a really, really, really wide screen? okla, been going on and on about this movie. yeah, i loved it, and hoping to watch again... it does have plot holes, but it's all excusable because it was just a wonderful popcorn movie. not perfect, but really well-made. i'd give it a 9 out of 10. i'm glad to say that the most expensive movie in japanese history is also one of their best. if you haven't watched it, you really should today... it is a must watch!
