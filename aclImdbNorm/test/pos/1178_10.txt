jack lemmon and walter matthau have got to be one of the best buddies ever to work together. they have made lots of movies together, i think they are both fantastic when they do work together in a movie. out to sea is a fantastic comedy movie i think to watch. i give the movie 10 out of 10. jack lemmon and walter matthau will be remembered when the movies they did together will be on tv. they will be sadly missed. god bless you both.
