i'm going to make this short and sweet. it's not surprising that you had no use for this film. this is a story about the power, beauty and possibilities inherent in a meaningful education. based on your pathetically composed comments i can see that your own education has been woefully neglected... or worse... completely wasted. your comments are those of a truly ignorant person. i would advise you to do something about this condition... but in your case i feel it's probably too late. my hope is that you yourself don't intend to go into the teaching profession ( especially in film studies) because you could only do damage. oh... one last bit of advice. in the future, if you intend to write more opinion pieces, you should really proofread your work. it will make people take you more seriously.
