bobby and mikey are two little boys who move across the country with their divorced mother to start a new life. soon after the family settles in, their mom marries "the king" who ends up being an abusive stepfather, especially to bobby. so bobby decides that he will "fly away" from the abuse in his birthday present.<br /><br />this movie was difficult to watch, especially the abuse scenes. it was hard to watch an innocent, playful little boy become abused and turn into a sullen scared, and withdrawn young man. the acting is excellent.<br /><br />i cried throughout the last half of the movie. there were some funny scenes in it too like the monster brew and the dog that finds the pop bottles.<br /><br />i wouldn't suggest letting little kids watch it. it was a movie that was painful to watch and yet it really really flew away.
