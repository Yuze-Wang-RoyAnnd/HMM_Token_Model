as a long-time fan of studio ghibli and especially hayao miyazaki films, i went to the film right on the opening day. when i went out of the theater i had this strange feeling that something was missing, this "magical" feeling i was experiencing in all miyazaki films before, but i couldn't say why it failed this time. after i thought about the other ghibli movies, i may know the reason: this film had most of the elements of a great miyazaki anime: cute characters, wonderful key animation, a great soundtrack composed by joe hisaishi and the warm story telling giving you the feeling of watching a high quality japanese animation film. however, two elements were lacking: a deep story and dramaturgy. the purpose of this film was obviously to entertain small children with a simple story line as in case of "totoro", so a complicated story as been told in "spirited away" or "princess mononoke" is not really necessary, but on the other hand, this story was simply too superficial. i could not connect to the main characters, because there was no character development, dramatic scenes were only limited and did not last very long. i really hate to give only 7 stars for a miyazaki film, because i would give 10 stars to all previous movies right away, but this time it was simply not this wonderful "ghibli experience".
