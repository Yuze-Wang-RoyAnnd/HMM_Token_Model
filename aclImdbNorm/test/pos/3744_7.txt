dr. paul flanner (richard gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited james franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. adrienne willis (diane lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. they both need to get away. she watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in rodanthe at the same time he books a room. they're all alone together. you can pretty much figure out the rest.<br /><br />this is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film. it's beautifully shot with a romantic setting and lots of quiet scenes. there's tragedy, romance, more tragedy and an uplifting ending (sort of). the great acting by gere and lane helps disguise the fact that this film isn't really about much. every single bit of the plot is predictable. i rolled my eyes a lot at some of the events. also it's far too short--i didn't believe the romance between gere and lane for a second. if comes out of nowhere and moves very quickly. still the movie does work. the inn itself is absolutely gorgeous and i was in tears by the end along with most of the audience. so it's a predictable but gorgeous movie with some wonderful acting. it doesn't deserve all the criticism it's getting. i give it a 7.
