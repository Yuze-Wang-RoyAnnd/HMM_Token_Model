if there's one theme of this film, it's that people can cope with hardship by having a good imagination. this family is poor, their father works graveyard, and their mother works double-shifts, and peter is constantly picked on for a variety of reasons, and becomes increasingly frustrated that he is often mistaken for a girl. he is just starting to approach that age of 10 or 11 where your perceptions start to change, and thinks like your appearance start to matter. the backdrop of this story is the 1967 world's fair and the centennial of canada. the film's greatest moments come during the various fantasy sequences where we see just how they cope. watch the flim, and if you've ever had a childhood friend that you dreamt with, and then for some reason, lost, you'll really like this film. perhaps kids will like this film, but only adults will truly appreciate it, including its references to bolshevik's and what parent's will do for their children.
