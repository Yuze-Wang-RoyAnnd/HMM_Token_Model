i absolutely adored this movie as a child and still do as an adult. to say that is even an understatement. my sister, brother and i watched it one year at our grandparents' house during christmas vacation. they had taped it from tv. our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. not so! we became mesmerized. they could not have unglued us if they tried. it became a cherished yearly tradition. we loved everything about it: the time, the romance, the battle scenes, the villains etc.<br /><br />come on, who can resist hating that psycho bent with his constant sir!? classic! moreover, who can resist cheering wildly when justin falls off the balcony?! what a triumphant moment! i always had a special place in my heart for orry and madelaine. they were so romantic. the theme song alone can get me to tear up a little. this movie is incredibly moving and i challenge anyone to stick with it until the very end. it's worth it!!
