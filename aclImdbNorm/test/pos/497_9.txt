i loved it. in fact, i watched it over and over and over, and i could watch it again. this movie doesn't get boring.<br /><br />the vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie. it's a job well done, great for today's generation.<br /><br />wesley snipes was born for this role. stephen dorff was an ideal vampire. arly jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has. donal logue provides great comical relief.<br /><br />this vampire movie is like no other. i can't wait for blade 2.
