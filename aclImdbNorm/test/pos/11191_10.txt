first time i ever saw this was at a friends house. it ended up in his parents hands by a fluke; some videostore/bicycle repair shop!! went bankrupt and treats like this was up for grabs. we saw it two times in a row and almost wet are pants how hard we laughed. <br /><br />i've seen historical documents like ninja mission and plan 9 from outer space, and they still remain good runners-up in comparison to this one. <br /><br />almost 15 years after first contact it is now considered the best cult movie of all times (in my circles); i've showed it to all my friends... we now have a tradition of searching for movies in the same category: the un-rateable one.<br /><br />it can't be explained or reviewed in any normal way because every scene, every take, every move, contains at least one mistake regarding editing, dialouge, directing etc.<br /><br />for any cult-movie buff this is the ultimate prize, the gem of all gems.<br /><br />raiting: as for craft it can't be rated, because it would even be an insult to homemade videos of birthdays and weddings.<br /><br />as for pure amusement it is the funniest movie i have ever seen; funnier than any comedy ever made past or present. anything less than a 10/10 should be regarded as an insult to good sense of hum our.
