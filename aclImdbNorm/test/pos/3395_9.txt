having just watched this with my mother (who got it for christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. all of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. the cast is amazing, my personal favourites being james read and lesley-anne down, as george hazard and madeline fabray/lamotte/main. the whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.
