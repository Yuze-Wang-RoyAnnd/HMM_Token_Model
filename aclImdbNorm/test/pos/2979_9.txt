great movie! the sound track is awesome! very relaxing sound. elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. lewis gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! the movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. the sound tracks written by sir elton complimented the movie to a t. rex morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song "honey roll" and poem "i meant to do my work today" by richard le gallienne was incredible! kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film! it was no surprise that a lot of the people involved with this movie went on to become the best in their field.
