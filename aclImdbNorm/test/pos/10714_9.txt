what can i say about kramer vs. kramer? on the surface it's rather simple but underneath it deals with emotions greater than life itself. it delivers many fantastic moments, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry. you sympathize with the characters and you care about them. many films fail at this, kramer vs. kramer is a success.<br /><br />i think everyone would agree the acting is superb. once you watch kramer vs. kramer, for some time the acting in most other films starts to feel plastic and unemotional. the actors seem to get along well with their roles and the characters really live on the screen. there's some beautiful chemistry between them. i think the best performance in the film comes from the young justin henry. he's different from any other child actor i've ever seen. he's amazingly natural.<br /><br />also, there's some kind of neurotic beauty in meryl streep. and dustin hoffman delivers one of the best performances of his career! the story is very well written. it's simple but complicated at the same time. the concept is the simple part, the feelings associated is the complicated part of it.<br /><br />if you haven't seen this film yet, you're definitely missing out! see it now!
