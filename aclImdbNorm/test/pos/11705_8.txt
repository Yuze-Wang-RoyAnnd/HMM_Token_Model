this is the first feature film from australian comedian mick molloy. mick wrote the film with his brother richard with help from john clarke, another comedian and actor. mick & john also have starring roles along with several other iconic australian actors - bill hunter, frank wilson et al. the basic premise of the movie is that slimy jack simpson (mick molloy) has become a member of a lawn bowls club for the sole purpose of getting a free car park near his work. the club is in dire financial straits and calls on jack to help. john clarke plays the clubs arch nemesis - he is trying to take the club over and turn it into a "poker machine slum" jack and the other club members band together to try and save the club with many funny twists and turns and jacks eventual redemption. this is quite a clever little movie. it is well above mick molloys usual gutter humor. it is pretty well written and well acted. the older aussie actors are brilliant (bill hunter, frank wilson monica maughan and ors) the film meanders along rather then going at break neck pace, but that adds to the charm of the movie. there is low level coarse language.
