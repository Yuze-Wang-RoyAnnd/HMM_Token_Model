i absolutely love promised land. the first episode that i saw, was while i was on my mission from 2003-2005. i really loved the rich family background portrayed in the show. here was a family with struggles of their own, but instead of dwelling on them; they would reach out with love to others who may have had the same problems, in an effort to forget themselves, and go to work. this is what caused me to fall in love with the show. all of the actors; especially gerald mcraney; had demonstrated the true meaning of "family" which has left an indelible mark on my life. i have been down the same road they have, but it has taken allot of time for me to develop that kind of character. i love this show so much, that i have wanted to share it with friends; but i was really stunned when i had heard that it was taken off the air. i thought and still think they should bring it back! so many lives can benefit from heaven inspired media. i honestly believe that this show was divinely inspired; because it brings the spirit every time i see just one episode. this show really (in my book) has truly defined what a "promised land" is. it is the love that you hold in your heart for others; which brings you to a higher destination. the spirit of love, is one of the most potent messages in this series, and all i can say is, bring it back. -robert
