i saw this movie by accident while in paris. i went into the wrong theater by accident and by the time i realized it wasn't a preview or a short film, i was hooked. <br /><br />paulina does a phenomenal job of holding your attention with her acting. i can't say enough how impressed i was with her portrayal of this real femme fatal. the rest of the cast performs very well too. don't get me wrong, this is not the greatest film ever made but given i knew nothing about it i was left with a lasting and very positive impression.<br /><br />finally, not speaking french in france paid off for once! i didn't stop talking about this film for 3 weeks after seeing it.
