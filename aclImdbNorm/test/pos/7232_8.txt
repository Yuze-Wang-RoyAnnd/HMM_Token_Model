once upon a time, troma, the company that brought us cinema classics such as: the toxic avenger, rabid grannies, poultrygeist, redneck zombies and surf nazis must die, decided long ago to adapt shakespeare's famous play, 'romeo and juliet.' this adaptation decided to spice up the story by adding kinky sex, extreme violence, genital monsters, body piercing and incest and it succeeded in creating a bizarre yet hilarious film. anyone going into a troma production should know what to expect, and that is irreverent and perverse comedy with plenty of political incorrectness. expect plenty of nods to other troma films and plenty of re-used gags (flipping cars and head squashing). many may think it sounds like utter crap that only morons would find funny...they may be right, but at the same time they may need to lighten up and enjoy the insanity and mind-numbingness that is tromeo and juliet.<br /><br />with a great cast, a funny script (by james gunn and lloyd kaufman), a fitting soundtrack and plenty of great visual gags, kaufman has yet again succeeded in turning what is right upside down and grossing the hell out of everyone. get some popcorn, grab a beer, invite your friends over and enjoy tromeo and juliet for what it is, a shakespeare adaptation with plenty of balls. the end.<br /><br />4/5
