supercarrier was my favorite movie in the later part of the 80's when it came out. my dad taped it for me & i watched it all the time until my step-mom taped oprah over it & my heart was torn. i would love to know if or where i can get it from. i have been looking for it. i believe they even came out w/ a supercarrier 2. it wasn't as great as the 1st, but i would like to have all of them if i could find them. i do not think @ all that it was a bad movie. it was a very interesting movie with a lot of action yet it had somewhat of a love story plot to it. the actors/actresses in the movie were great. it also helped me to understand that this is not just a man's world, but it is also a woman's world & many women can do the same things if not more than what a man can do & women deserve much respect for their duties as well.
