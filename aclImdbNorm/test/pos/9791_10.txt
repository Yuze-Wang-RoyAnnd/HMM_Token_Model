this is just my all time favorite movie. nothing special. it's just so incredibly detailed. makes me cry just thinking about it. geronimo bill is the nicest guy i can imagine. money is not important. bamboo spears are important. you don't need money to get what you need. if you need something it will just come to you. if people would realize that the world would be a much better place. whatever you do, don't do it for the money.
