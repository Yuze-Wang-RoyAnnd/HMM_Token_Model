dee snider was inspired to do a two part song by a horror movie. this movie he wrote/directed/produced and starred in details the subjects from those songs (horror-terria,from twistedsister/ stay hungry). people have commented he must have a sick mind to put something like this out. i don't hear anybody making comments like that about stephen king, wes craven,dean koontz,or in his own time alfred hitchcock. the movie profiles a modern psychotic created by current trends in society. personally i thought it was pretty well done from sheer imagination and inspiration,also without the benefit of a large budget and interviews with actual victims/criminals. this movie is perfect if you want something to give you nightmares and make you cringe about the possible and probable. it could happen!!
