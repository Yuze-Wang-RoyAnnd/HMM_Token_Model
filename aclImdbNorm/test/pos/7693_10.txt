this was/is an incredible movie, with incredible cast, music, singing, story, etc. it is a tragedy that some arrogant families (the gerswhins or premingers) can keep it from being available to generation after generation. i have wanted to see it again all of my life. i just found this site and read why it has not been available. shame on these families for their pettiness. my wife is from germany and she has never seen the movie. neither have my step-children or my grandchildren. it is very sad that a movie of this depth and quality is not available for them to see. where do these families get off making such a conceited, self-important, egotistical, condescending decision to prohibit generations from enjoying this film, these stars, these performances, this music! release the video and let them world judge and enjoy!
