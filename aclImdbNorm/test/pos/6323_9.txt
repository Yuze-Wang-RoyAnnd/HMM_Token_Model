'sleight of hand' is my favorite rockford files episode of the entire series. this episode shows a side of jim rockford that is usually ignored. to wit, jim is genuinely in love with a beautiful woman and is shown as a father figure to her young daughter. the woman is recently divorced and she and jim have recently returned from a weekend getaway along with the youngster. through a strange turn of events, the woman is discovered missing after they return to her home.<br /><br />rockford's recounting to his father, rocky, of the events leading up to the woman's disappearance is reminiscent of mickey spillane's mike hammer series from an earlier era. after much brooding and reflection and with rocky's encouragement, jim stumbles upon the clue that sends him off investigating the disappearance with his usual steadfastness.<br /><br />unfortunately, jim's girlfriend, karen, unwittingly witnessed some mafia activity while they stayed at the buena vista inn. the crime bosses responded by killing karen and substituting another woman into jim's car. the imposter, ostensibly asleep in the back seat, made her exit immediately upon arrival at the home. a couple of cover up murders ensue and jim proceeds to their solution while under suspicion of the l.a. police department even as warrants are issued for his arrest.<br /><br />this episode evokes more emotional reaction than all other rockford files episodes combined. james garner as jim rockford is seen at his most vulnerable moment and yet he retains the presence of mind to pursue the case. this is personal for jim rockford. in this case, he is not hired to do a job but he is trying to recover his lost love to save her life. unfortunately, this is not possible but jim tries hard to sort out his feelings but it is apparent that he will not soon get over his hurt.<br /><br />despite the appeal of the main story line, many key questions are raised but never answered in this episode. (1) what becomes of the young daughter of jim's girlfriend? (2) what did karen actually see at the hotel that made the mafia kill her? (3) how could jim drive for hours with an imposter in his back seat without noticing this? (4) the daughter stated that "mommy didn't come back with us". so why didn't the girl scream or cry when she noticed that her mother was absent for the hours long car ride? regardless of these ambiguities, 'sleight of hand" is the rockford files episode which comes closest to being a tear jerker. the suspense is compelling and the story is told in a sensitive and vulnerable style which makes us feel rockford's pain.
