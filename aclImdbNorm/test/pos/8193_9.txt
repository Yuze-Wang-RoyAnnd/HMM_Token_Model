the emperor and the assassin (w/english subtitles) at 161 minutes is long, but the time is packed with a story that barely fits into it. golden hued palace scenes and dusty yellow panoramas of chinese landscapes background a true story of china's unifying king, circa 300 bce. an intricate plot with a myriad twists and turns is played out with excellent portrayals by the cast. king qin's simple wish for a unified empire for his common people is fulfilled, but not without treachery, plots and counter plots and oh yes, bodies. lots of bodies. this epic story of china's beginnings is a great way for westerners to glimpse little known asian history. emperor qin's legacies include the thousands of life-size terra-cotta figures which are still being excavated today. as an historical person, this film makes it clear that emperor qin should be regarded along with george washington, napoleon bonaparte, alexander the great, genghis khan and julius caesar, to name a few of the world's greatest conquerors/statesmen. i highly recommend seeing the emperor and the assassin, especially on the big screen.
