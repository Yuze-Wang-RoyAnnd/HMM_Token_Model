it has been almost 50 years since i saw "jennifer" for the first and only time. i did not know the name of this movie until i looked it up on this web site, but i have told many people (especially my grandchildren) how movies do not have to include graphic details in order to frighten you and leave powerful impact. the story skillfully introduces you to concepts which if true put ida lupino in a very dangerous situation. each time miss lupino discovers a new "fact" she draws the viewer into her confusion and fear.<br /><br />this movie has such impact on me that almost 50 years later i still list it as one of the most frightening movies that i have ever seen. yet this movie does not contain the blood and gore which became popular shortly after this movie was made. it's amazing what impact a good story and great actors can make.
