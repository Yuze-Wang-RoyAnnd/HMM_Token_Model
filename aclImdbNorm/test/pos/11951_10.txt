i seem to notice that a lot of people have never seen this movie, and those that have usually dismiss it as garbage... that's pretty bad really.<br /><br />the first time i saw this movie, i admittedly was almost one of those people... thank god i'm patient, otherwise i would have never found such a classic.<br /><br />as goofy as this movie is, it's also a must have for anyone who is either a fan of 80's movies, or just happens to have a sense of humor.<br /><br />i know that there are a lot of people out there that will tell you that this movie is sort of derivative of better off dead... so what if it is? they were both excellent movies!<br /><br />i can honestly say that savage steve holland is a genius! 10/10
