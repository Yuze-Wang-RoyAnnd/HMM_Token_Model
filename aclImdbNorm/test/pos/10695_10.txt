excellent plot line makes this movie one of the classic, cult ninja flicks of all time. the plot being that this woman's soul is possessed by an evil ninja spirit. i mean to be honest if i could obtain ninja ability through possession i would. furthermore, for being in the 80's and such the fact that the ninja aspect was far greater in this particular decade is evident and despite all that, ninja 3 the domination manages to keep it original from the american ninja cookie cutter molds that plagued the 80's for so long. this chick is definitely michael dudikoff on steroids.... i mean the first american ninja was great but let's get real folks it has nothing on ninja 3
