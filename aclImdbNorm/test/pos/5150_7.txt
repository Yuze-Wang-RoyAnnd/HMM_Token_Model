i enjoy the national anthem. i enjoy the national anthem if for nothing else then, just before the midnight news, i imagine i'm playing the cymbals in the band. not as easy as you may think! one, two, three, four; one, two three, four; but then what? so i have sympathy with the practising bass drum player in roy andersson's wonderful film, patiently waiting for his cue listening to a very 70s cassette player.<br /><br />the 70s motif seems to continue throughout, with some classic, soulless furniture. moreover, every scene has an eerie jade wash which emphasises the minute nuances of the subtlest of acting.<br /><br />which brings me to jessika lundberg's outstanding purple boots. boots which otherwise would have inspired a silk cult advertising campaign.<br /><br />but then the difficult bit. someone asked me what it was about. well there is a scene where the opening line as "i don't have that length in green" brilliant. straight out of a gary larson carton.<br /><br />i can't say what it's about. go see yourself.<br /><br />ron plasma<br /><br />hmm. larson! sounds swedish<br /><br />(viewed 15apr08)
