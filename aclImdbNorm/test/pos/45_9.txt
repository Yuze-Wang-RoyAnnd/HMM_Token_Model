just a great soundtrack. really enjoyable music. outstanding cast, great lead performance. worth watching.<br /><br />doesn't really explain what happened to the neighborhood. you are left feeling that integration is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood disintegrated.<br /><br />this movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted. i especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like jeffrey wright.<br /><br />the cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively, engaging and desirable experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music, food, drink, dancing, gambling and sex.
