um, hello.. rainbow brite.. the name alone is hard to take it seriously, like she could be the cousin of strawberry shortcake.. but when you're a kid, this is definitely serious stuff.<br /><br />so, there's this vile, snotty, spoiled girl and she wants rainbow brites belt, amongst other things, ie the light of the whole universe, and rainbow brite and her friend cris are bound and determined to stop her. as i remember, murky and lurky had a minor role in this production. maybe they wanted too much money?<br /><br />so anyway, snotty, evil girl has a powerful jewel and she channels it's power to take rainbow's belt.. imagine? but somehow, rainbow gets her belt back and re-energizes it with "star sprinkles" and kicks the bad girls' butt with the help of cris and his prism bracelet, and they also save the whole universe in the process.<br /><br />so good triumphs over evil, niceness triumphs over rudeness, and rainbow brite and the color kids are once again safe to spread color and joy for all mankind.
