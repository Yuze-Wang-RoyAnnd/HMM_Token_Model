pretty darn good for a french film. i have not seen any of catherine breillat's previous films, and so have no opinions about this compared to her previous work. french cinema usually sticks to the ultimately arty films, and leaves the shoot-em-ups and star vehicles to hollywood. that is probably a good business strategy, as no other nation's film industry will likely have the resources to compete on those sorts of projects. films about film-making are often a bore, as it has little resonance for people not in the business. but this one held my interest much more than i thought it would. in spite of the title, (oddly in english) it really isn't much of a comedy, in spite of a few droll moments. i've only seen a few of anne parillaud's films, but she shows a generous amount of talent and range, from the action/psychological drama of "la femme nikita" to the wry comedy of "innocent blood". this film also extends her range as she plays a more or less ordinary woman, yet is still compelling on the screen. kudos also to roxane mesquida, with whom i was unfamiliar. she plays a very inexpressive actress for most of the film, whose talent is drawn out at the end. if you don't have to have car chases and explosions to be entertained, check this one out.
