i saw this in a preview and it seems to have not been released in the u.s. nonetheless, it was one of the more enjoyable little comedies. it concerns the rivalry between two funeral directors in a small british town. the plot [of the movie] gets a little out of hand in the third act but the characters are very enjoyable and memorable.<br /><br />the acting is great across the board. sure to be overlooked in the crunch of blockbusters, this is a movie worth looking out for. i know i will try to catch this in the theaters again and/or buy the video.
