this light-heated (for cassavetes)love story is pleasantly conveyed by two wonderful performances by gena rowlands and seymour cassell. rowlands was never more beautiful as a repressed, damaged mid-30's woman who meets her match in seymour. cassell is a powderkeg of energy and romantic notions (on his terms). <br /><br />there is a great supporting performance by val avery as zelmo swift and an unusual (as always) timothy carey that's worth the price of admission. made between husbands and a woman under the influence this is cass' most accessible film that should touch the heart of anyone (especially the cassavetes haters) who claim his films are too long and ponderously heavy at times. made my top ten that year and not seen by enough people. an 8 out of 10.
