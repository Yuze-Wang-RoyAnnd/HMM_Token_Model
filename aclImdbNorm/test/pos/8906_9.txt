since the last horrid ast'erix film and the fact that we only get the swiss german version in cinemas, here, i went to watch it with quite a bit of trepidation... unfounded, as i was happy to discover ^____^<br /><br />the film is funny and modern, has good gags, a good animation, an amusing character interaction, a good voice cast (note: i can only speak for the swiss german one!) except for the viking chief's daughter abba (her name is great, despite the not very inspired voice actress)...<br /><br />i especially liked the character justforkix (goudurix in french, grautvornix in german. he's the young man who is supposed to be put in shape...). he's a very amusing portrayal of a mollycoddled, urban teenager; but he's very likable, despite the teenage mannerisms... xd the interaction between ast'erix & ob'elix and their young charge is fantastic and thoroughly entertaining.<br /><br />it shouldn't be compared to the old films, since this one is quite different... which surprisingly doesn't make it bad. on the contrary. when they tried to modernize the last film (twelve years ago), they completely blew it. this film, however, proved that it can be done just fine... ^-^<br /><br />i came out of the theater cheerful... always a good sign ^_~
