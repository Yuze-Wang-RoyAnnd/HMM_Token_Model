this movie is great from start to finish about a group of med students that get together and literally kill each other by stopping their hearts and then revive themselves. they then research what happens from the "near death" experiences. as each one goes through the experience, they become haunted by their deepest fears that seem to materialize as reality. this ranges from dead kids with hockey sticks to dead fathers that seem to be upstairs.<br /><br />the cast is first rate and oliver platt is hilarious in one of the best roles of his career. i am not a big keifer sutherland fan but even he does an excellent job. this is a movie that i can watch over and over!
