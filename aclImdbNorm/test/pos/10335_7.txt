"summer of my german soldier" was one of the many tv movies that became a staple of the small screen in the 1970s (others were "brian's song", "sybil" and "someone's watching me!"). it portrays a jewish girl (kristy mcnichol) befriending a german pow (bruce davison) in wwii-era georgia. one of the things that the movie shows is that many of the german soldiers weren't really nazis, but were just drafted. watching the movie, i got a real sense of how things must have been in the south back then; i mean, can you imagine being a jewish person accused of supporting the enemy? <br /><br />so, i certainly recommend this movie. i believe that it's always important to show the things portrayed here. occasional overacting keeps the movie from being a full-scale masterpiece, but they usually do quite well. i hope that the movie eventually comes out on dvd. also starring esther rolle and michael constantine (the "my big fat greek wedding" patriarch).
