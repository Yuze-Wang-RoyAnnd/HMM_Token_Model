i have noticed that people have asked if anyone has this show. i have all 26 episodes that aired in the u.s. and will be willing to share these with anyone interested. all i require is that you supply the vhs tapes or blank dvd's i have them on both formats and pay for shipping. my email is creator67@pipinternet.net, just send me an email and your request and i will notify you and we can make the arrangements. the quality is very good and they are very enjoyable to watch especially if you have not been able to see them since they aired in the 60's. it was one of my favorite shows as a child and hold a very special place in my heart because it brings back a lot of memories of my childhood as well as other shows like ultraman and astroboy.<br /><br />peter
