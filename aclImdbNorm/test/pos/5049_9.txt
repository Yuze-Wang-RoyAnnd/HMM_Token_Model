to qualify my use of "realistic" in the summary, not many old folks i know go around pretending to be famous maestros, blind people, etc. -- nor have i ever been elderly. those minor issues out of the way, the relationships between the characters in this film and the emotions expressed therein were completely realistic and genuine. in fact, though we're not yet 30, i could see many characteristics of my relationship with my wife in the interactions between the main character and his wife. for those that don't die young (there's a great line in the movie about this, when the two best friends are talking about dying young, and one of them says--and i'm paraphrasing, we missed our chance--we'll just have to stick it out), we'll all be where these characters are some day. i know many movie-goers would prefer to be swept *away* from reality as opposed to being *faced* with it, but even they might enjoy the sweet reminder of our mortality--and the importance of living life to the fullest--that this film is.
