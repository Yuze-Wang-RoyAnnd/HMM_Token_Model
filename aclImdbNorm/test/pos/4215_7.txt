i will be honest, i rented this movie solely on the fact it was part of the "child's play" series. i was expecting a boring dull 4th part too the series, but i was surprised. this movie was surprisingly good, and i found it to be quite funny. there was a lot of dark humor, and the idea to have two dolls was a good way to spice things up. the two dolls worked well together and added a bonnie and clyde type fell to the movie. overall it was very good for a 4th movie in the series, with some gruesome death scenes (just watch the marilyn manson type get killed at the beginning, not to mention john ritter getting a face full of nails). applauds to the writers for spicing things up, and the ending although i found it a bit strange leaves room for yet another sequel...maybe "son of chucky"!!!
