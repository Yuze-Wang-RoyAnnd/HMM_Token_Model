this film is utterly amazing. from the performances of huppert, girardot, and magimel, to haneke's screenplay and direction there is not a single misstep. the film may put some people off with it's hard sexual subject matter and with it's slower pace, but it really is a masterful piece of cinema... so do not let it's challenging ways keep you away!<br /><br />powerful, and deserving every award it won in cannes!
