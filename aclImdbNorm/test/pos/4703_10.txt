i went into a screening of "sister helen" at the sundance film festival and did not know what to expect.<br /><br />i was riveted by the people in this documentary. sister helen is an incredible character!!! the filmmakers captured the essence of sister helen's amazing soul and took me into a world unknown. i was thoroughly satisfied by the journey and was completely caught off guard by this film's ending.<br /><br />this film speaks to those who desire a second chance at life.
