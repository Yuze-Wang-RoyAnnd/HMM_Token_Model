i always wanted to see this film and when i finally got to i knew i was in for a nice surprise when john boorman's name appeared on the screen. known mostly for his epic films (he directed the first conan and wrote apocalypse now) put together in the classic hollywood structure, this one fits nicely with his catalog.<br /><br />i also can't express how perfect the timing was considering that myanmar (burma) is once again experiencing an uprising by monks and students against the military "junta" run government which is the very same one (there has been a change of leadership since but it's essentially the same) depicted in the movie from 1988. now more than ever this film needs to be aired on television (caught it on ifc) because of recent events.
