my first 'columbo'. rather enjoyed it. great format, and peter falk's character extremely good...wonderfully quirky, he can take his place next to poirot, miss marple, and also the likes of marlowe and rick diamond. i can see why this series has such a following. <br /><br />as a professional musician, i have to say a few things. first of all, a conductor who merely produces these pedestrian performances of the most basic examples of the repertoire (eine kleine nachtmusik, strauss waltzes, beethoven...) is never going to have a house like that or fame like that or cars like that, much less be called a genius. and the conducting that the actor does is so bad as to be laughable. no orchestra would take him seriously. <br /><br />there are several little things too, such as his rehearsal of eine kleine nachtmusik (why rehearse it when they've just performed it for tv? any orchestral musician would be able to play it in his or her sleep anyway...). his instructions to the ensemble are downright nonsensical, and when columbo asks blythe danner what 'quasi fantasia' means, she says it's 'latin'. it's italian, as are the vast majority of musical instructions. <br /><br />and finally, no two great musicians would ever have the following interchange: "play something." "what should i play?" "chopin". music is their job and passion, they know it well. something far more specific would be asked for, and offered! <br /><br />i know. i should get out more...
