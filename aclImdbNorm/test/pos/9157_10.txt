hey, you are not alone! i remember nichols! i was just 17 when it was on. i remember james garner was one of the coolest actors, and nichols was such a great show. i couldn't believe it was on such a short time, wish i could remember the last episode, i probably didn't see it...there were no vcr's back then so it when it was on you saw it, and if you missed an episode it was gone forever unless it came back on summer reruns. anyway, sure would be great if it came out on dvd, but i don't think that many people even knew about it. what a shame.<br /><br />garner would hit it big a few years later with rockford files, and he brought along his buddy stuart margolin from nichols to play his sidekick angel.
