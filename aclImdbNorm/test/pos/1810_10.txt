what can i say?? this movie has it all...romance, break-ups, rich kids, punks and preps. this is my all time favorite movie that i can recite line for line....i remember when it first came out, i was 14 and couldn't get in....so finally got to see it on cable... i was hooked! wanted to move to california and be a valley girl.. (hey, i even remember the song by moon zappa, do you?) tried in vain for years to get the never produced soundtrack...now you can find it on rhino records....
