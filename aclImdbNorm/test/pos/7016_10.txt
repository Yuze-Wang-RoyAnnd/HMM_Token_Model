i first heard of this film from a friend. she loved it and always watched it. when she told me about it and said how old it was, i immediately decided that i wouldn't like it. i was so wrong. dirty dancing was such an amazing film! i love the music and the dancing. i bought the soundtrack and dvd immediately after watching it. patrick swayze and jennifer grey were brilliant in it. they captured the emotions and feelings of the characters so well. they were both such good dancers. after watching the film i wished i could dance like them and i'm hopefully going to take up ballroom and latin dancing soon. i've become a fan of that sort of dancing and am now hooked on all films and programs about it. dirty dancing revealed my passion for dancing and music. my favorite parts of the film are when baby goes into the staff's headquarters and sees them dancing and obviously the last scene where baby and johnny dance together in front of everyone. i believe that everyone must watch dirty dancing at least once in their lifetime. if they don't, it's their loss!!
