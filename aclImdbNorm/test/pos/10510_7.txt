now, i've seen many many b-grade films in my 15 years of living, and i must say that this was one of the better ones. i personally enjoyed the real estate and the storyline, but it did suffer from amateur acting (although adrienne barbeau did give a decent performance as lisa grant). joseph bottoms couldn't hold his part well enough to be considered good. the other performance which really fit the film was that of barry hope (barney resnick). it begins with an eager real estate agent taking an asian couple through a house, only to find there's a dead girl in the shower of the showhome. it progresses with detective speculating, and introduces the key characters with reasonable grace. i think that for any person who's in for a giggle at the over-the-top drama the victim realtors provide during the over-the-top gory scenes, this truly is a gem... xd who am i kidding? it's not that great, but worth a watch if you're insanely bored.
