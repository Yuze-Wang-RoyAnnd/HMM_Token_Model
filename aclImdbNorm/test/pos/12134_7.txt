has anyone ever read or heard comments by scorsese or david chase ( soprano's exec. producer) about "death collector/family enforcer"? i bought the dvd after not having seen it for a while on cable (like 20 years), but having seen "goodfellas" and the entire "sopranos" run to date. in retrospect, both guys must have seen death collector/family enforcer and absorbed the flavor ,perhaps inspiring the tone for their masterworks, both of which the polar opposite of the romanticized godfather trilogy. being a jersey guy, it is interesting to see how the jersey meadowlands have evolved since the mid-70's. it is not the swampy dumping ground it used to be although once in a while a body will turn up in a local waterway. also, it's a little bittersweet to seen a newly constructed world trade center in the across the river in the opening and closing scene. who could have imagined?
