after seeing this routine by john leguizamo, i finally realize why he is such a talent. i enjoy great stage work, and this is stage work at its best. i cannot label it as a stand-up routine, because leguizamo is so intense when playing the different characters. the only time he breaks character is when it is necessary for him to complete his part in which he does so coolly, that you cannot help, but appreciate his talents. i wasn't really sure how i felt about him as an actor, but freak solidified my appreciation of him. for those out there that have not had the opportunity to see this show, i feel for you. definitely check it out. it is one of the nest routines i have ever seen. ranks with eddie murphy, bill cosby and chris rock. four stars and more.
