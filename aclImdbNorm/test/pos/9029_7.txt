when it comes to any movie that was made in or about the south,the characters are labeled racist or hillbillies or even worse that awful racist term "rednecks". this movie was a murder mystery, plain & simple. it was a great murder mystery & did demonstrate some of human feelings about each others race. the same type of observations made by black character actors toward whits in todays' movies. before watching this movie, one should get the "mississippi burning" chip off of ones' shoulder & enjoy the plot, wonderful acting, & reminiscent scenes of simpler times that while are gone, they will not be forgotten. mr.faulkner did his hometown of oxford,miss. justice by having this movie shot there. the producer noted while shooting the movie there, his stereotypical perception of whites were misconcieved & that he observed white & black townspeople & locals getting along with each other in the same way. so, sit back & enjoy one of mr faulkner's great classics & try to figure out who the killer really is...
