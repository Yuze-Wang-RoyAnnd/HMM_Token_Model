a great animation movie that really gets up to the level of oldies like "the lion king" . <br /><br />i went to see this with one of my best belgian friends who also watched the series on tv . i was lucky because i didn't know people in belgium were aware of "wallace and gromit" . <br /><br />when it started and that good old theme started it started to bring back memories of me watching it when i was 5 .<br /><br />the humor itself was very funny . some nice sitcom style scenes , some wordplay or just plain jokes . the animation isn't as impressive if you have know the series but it is still fun to watch is you realize how it gets done. <br /><br />my conclusion : not only can it keep my happy and entertained , some of the humor can easily appeal to older people so i say : go and watch "curse of the were-rabbit" as soon as you can .
