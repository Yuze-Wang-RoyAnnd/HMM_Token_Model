my take on the ending. bobby died at the hands of his step father. mike had tried as he may to get bobby out. only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly. bobby died.... mike as a child survived by creating an alternative ending in his mind...on how bobby left....mike made a plane that flew bobby out. children who are sexually and violent abused often create whole other worlds in their minds to survive.<br /><br />was also great seeing my old housing area. we called it san jose boulevard and i lived right around where these house were filmed. it was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses...not studios... it was my kitchen, bedroom and living room. and those hills...we use to hike them as kids....looking down on our little valley....seeing glimpses of the bay. was a real nostalgia trip for me.
