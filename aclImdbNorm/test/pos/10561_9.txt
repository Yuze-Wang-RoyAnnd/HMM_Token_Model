after watching tipping the velvet by sarah waters i decided to watch fingersmith, the characters were just as good in both performances, though missing rachael stirling in the adaptation of fingersmith.<br /><br />the story line overall was of a good choice, the twisting and the unravelling of the characters were amazing! excellent watch only missing rachael stirling!<br /><br />if you do enjoy the romance of two girls this isn't one of the best films to watch. <br /><br />it takes on a different spin from tipping the velvet but just as good. <br /><br />would recommend it to everyone!
