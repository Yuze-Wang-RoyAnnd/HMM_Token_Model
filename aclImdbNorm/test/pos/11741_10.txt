it stars war correspondent william holden separated, who falls in love with a stunning eurasian doctor jessica jones set against the stunning backdrop of hong kong. the cinematography is magnificent as they rendezvous on a hill overlooking hong kong. the story deals with racial tensions, society frowning on mixed relations and extra marital affairs. but what i love about it is the strong character of the heroine portrayed by jessica jones, who is a eurasian doctor, who stays humble and steadfast in her altruistic mission and stays loyal to her love. despite that, she gets sacked at her hospital for cavorting with a married man by gossipping high rankers. one day william holden is called to the korean war which he covers and then that ill fated day, she gets the news of his demise. the end, of course is tragic, i cried when she went to their hill. it was a very sweet ill fated love affair. it defeats all the odds, the fact that she got fired from her job, how his wife would not grant him a divorce yet their great love persevered--they experienced a great love despite it all. i personally do not believe in extramarital affairs, and think he should have not started something when he was bound to someone else and she should not have allowed herself to let it happen, but despite that a truly magnificent movie. i think the heroine overshadowed the hero. jessica jones is sultry and gave a magnificent performance although i thought it strange they didn't not hire a real asian actress or someone with asian blood. i agree with one review, jessica jones oozes sexuality when she lays on the ground and looks up at william holden speaking calmly but her eyes say come take me now.<br /><br />i find it a pity most great films were made before i was born, it seems many hollywood movies are lacking in depth, great acting and depend entirely on stunts and heavy sex scenes. this is truly one of the greatest ill-fated love stories in movies.
