i agree with vince, this movie paved the way for goodfellas. the scene where pesci was throwing peanuts at the piano player reminded me of his "how am i funny?" routine in goodfellas. this is a highly underrated film and deserves some attention. as with many other mob films, the theme of the death collector rings true: always respect the don.
