this time, the lovable dimwit gets summoned for jury duty, where a corrupt attorney notices that he looks like a jailbird who wants to break out, so the two get switched. of course, most of the movie is a series of gags; in "ernest goes to jail", most of the gags relate to electricity. i really liked the whole vacuum cleaner sequence early on. overall, the point of the movie is just to have fun, and i'm sure that you will. this is possibly the ultimate movie that you watch with a bud. it's quite safe to say that jim varney will truly be missed. knowwhaddamean? fyi: the only other cast member whom i recognized was randall "tex" cobb, who played lyle. you've surely seen him somewhere.
