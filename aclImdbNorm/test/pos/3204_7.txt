usually, alan alda plays characters that are too "soft" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. this time, he fits the character. though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.<br /><br />the 1971 attica prison riot and the state of new york's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. only a few journalists have told the true story. this film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the attica riot/revolt. attica had a major impact on this country. maybe the movie will stimulate someone to research the history.<br /><br />i can't remember a feature movie made from the perspective of the prisoners -- though there is a great pbs piece with the actual attica survivors/participants. the perspective of the guards held hostage is explored in "against the wall" with kyle maclachlan, samuel l. jackson, clarence williams iii, and frederic forrest.<br /><br />back in the day, we shouted, "attica! attica!" it was nice to hear it in the movie. brought back memories.<br /><br />the worst part of the movie are the natural wigs morris chestnut and the other african americans must wear. it would have been easy for these people to grow a 'fro.
