...this one. what came to my mind immediately was loving annabelle, as it has this same kind of mature mood and distanced dealing with the subject. we simply observe as the story unfolds, without taking sides, or having to confront any "moral" issues (or of course we are, but are not spoon-fed them). sure, there were some difficult facts to face, and choices to make, but it just flowed. basically it was just like any other love story, in any other life, with any other sexes.<br /><br />i personally found the girls having a good chemistry, and had fun with them on their night outs. the only thing i could really pinpoint as a problem would be it just felt kind of...retained. held back. it's not about the sex scenes (or those missing), but given that i felt the film at its liveliest during the moments they were together having a good time, it kind of contrasted with the rest. lowkey is good, but it just never quite sizzled like loving annabelle, nor touched me quite as much.<br /><br />this said, i heartily recommend it, it's by no means a waste of ones precious time, on the contrary...<br /><br />7/10
