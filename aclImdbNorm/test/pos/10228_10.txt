i'd love to see some tie-in between nightbreed, the fury, and the x-men series, sort of the way the second outer limit's series would tie-in particular stories and plot-lines after the fact, to create a story arc although one was never intended. i'd also like know if some more information - anecdotal or otherwise, exists anywhere about the relationship and/or collaboration between clive barker and david cronenberg. i simply can't get my mind around the fact that david cronenberg appeared as a mere actor in a clive barker film. does any additional information on the subject actually exist? finally, it's been 17 years since the film was released, and i had hoped there would've been a sequel by now. does anyone out there know if there were any plans in the making that never came to fruition, or if in fact there are plans even now for a sequel?
