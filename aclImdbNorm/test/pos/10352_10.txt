when i saw this on tv i was nervous...whats if they messed it up? millions of families like mine that live with a brain damaged man, in my case my dad, would be let down. i watched it with my mum and we both ended up crying, it was so accurate and captured how the family feels as well as the person having suffered the brain injury. the actors were all wonderful and i had no complaints, my mums told me she hasn't been able to stop thinking about it. i hope this program made many people aware of what it's like living with brain damage and what it's like for the families. more programs like this should be made, i was surprised at how good it was and it's really shook me up emotionally.
