certainly when i saw this movie at hbo, i was bit erratic in following the plot, but it catches my attention when seeing dustin hoffman in it. honestly i'm not enthralled watching old movies, but then in the long run it changes my point of view. seeing this stirring film made me experience once again couching at my seat not noticing my tears suddenly roll down my cheek, and then after, let loose a heavy sigh in realizing the impact of what i've just witness. kramer vs kramer was indeed one of the best classical drama movies i've witnessed for a long time that even i, myself couldn't imagine how it touched me. the story was strongly emotional, but is not saturated with such. the characters weren't unrealistic for their roles; they possess qualities that make viewers like them whatever position they have in the film, like the role of meryl streep, she was a mother who honestly concede her mistakes at the past but then she's confident to stand up her emotional motives to get what she desires in a fair and square battle. dustin hoffman was way too outstanding, i can't even fathom how this guy could play seriously difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role which is completely different, then performed it well. even though i have already seen the movies a lot of times, when i seat back and lounge at my home scanning worth movies to peer and buy a time for it, catching a glimpse for kramer vs kramer will make my experience another worthwhile moment.
