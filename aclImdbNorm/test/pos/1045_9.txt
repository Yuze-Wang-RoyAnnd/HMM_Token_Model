barbara stanwyck probably didn't think of it, but it is a relief to see her in a more becoming dark hairstyle (if it wasn't a wig) than the one she had to wear in "double indemnity" the year before. that film, while the premiere "film noir" and an all-around great film, gave her a great role, but oh, that hair. here, she is more chic and certainly no femme fatal, but she is certainly a 40's woman. she has gotten used to life without men since most of them are off at war, and as a successful martha stewart like columnist, she writes a homey column in which she describes her country home as the camera pans over what it really is. we meet her boss, sydney greenstreet, who has no idea that she is living a lie, and when he pushes his way in for a christmas away at her supposed connecticut home, she has to come up with a husband (reginald gardiner) and baby before we can say "jingle bells". hungarian chef s.z. sakall steps in to help and ends up in a cutsey pie one-on-one with irish una o'connor. "it's not goulash, it's irish stew". sakall simply takes the paprika, pours most of it in, and says, "now it's goulash", totally changing what she has prepared for lunch. then, when it comes to the flapjacks, he flips and she scoops. for years, a few friends of mine and i will use that line every time pancakes come up in a conversation. "i don't flip. i scoop!". she won't even flip just one for greenstreet, saying "i've never flipped in me life." o'connor can get on the nerves when she screeches over and over in some films, but here, she is delightfully lovable, and her pairing with sakall is very charming.<br /><br />it is obvious in the romance department that reginald gardiner is not barbara stanwyck's cup of tea, especially when she meets handsome dennis morgan, who is a bit dimwitted when bathing the baby, which eats soap, causing stanwyck to get a bit alarmed. he should suspect something instantly, but doesn't. but it doesn't matter. the film is so charming with the country setting filled with snow, an abundance of rocking chairs, and a dog running towards them as the sleigh comes up. living in new york city after 25 years in los angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of new york state made me miss this kind of christmas. while central park is beautiful after a first snow and the christmas tree at rockefeller center is exsquisit too, there is something about looking out at a snow-covered field of trees, and catch an occasional glimpse of deer, rabbits, or other wild life.<br /><br />this is a great holiday film that can also bring on the christmas spirit out of season, and makes a great pairing with another barbara stanwyck country christmas film, "remember the night", an underrated gem. add on the big city christmas of "meet john doe", and you've found perhaps one of the busiest stars of holiday films around.
