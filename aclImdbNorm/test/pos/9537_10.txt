perhaps once in a generation a film comes along that is perfection. for me, "the railway children" is that film - a timeless classic that was directed and performed most beautifully. it depicts all that is worthwhile in humanity and climaxes in the conquest of love and faith over cruel injustice. every performance is a gem, though bobbie stands out and, like judy garland as dorothy before her, jenny agutter makes it impossible for us to imagine anyone else in the role.<br /><br />the world is all the better for this film and the children of today would be much the better for watching it.<br /><br />of course, like so many young men of my generation, i fell hopelessly in love with jenny agutter and her hold was as strong when i had the great good fortune to meet her a few days ago - the bewitching smile and voice like dripping honey were still there to send me weak at the knees as they first did all those years ago!
