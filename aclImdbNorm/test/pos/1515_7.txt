well, this is new...famous italian horror director lucio fulci shoots a film about a famous italian horror director called...lucio fulci. after years and years of witnessing gruesome horror sequences, it becomes hard for lucio to separate reality from fiction and he often hallucinates about committing violent murders. he quickly descends further into a seemly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable venom. even the dedicated psychiatrist can't seem to keep fulci on the right track... now, when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value, cat in the brain certainly is one of fulci's most pleasant films. the gore is overpowering and copious, to say the least. the amount of filthy massacres is impossible to describe, especially when you manage to get your hands on the fully uncut version (referred to with the aka:"nightmare concert"). decapitations all around, victims ' intestines are spread on all sides of the screen and the chainsaws are working overtime! the film also becomes unintentionally funny quite soon (since it's so exaggerated) and a perfect experience to watch with a group of friends when there's beer in the fridge. of course, from a more professional viewpoint, this production can't exactly be called a masterpiece! there's not the least bit of tension or atmosphere to detect and the characters are completely empty-headed. in order to make more room for the gore, characters are just being introduced for 5 seconds and subsequently die a horrible death. especially compared with fulci's highlights - like "the beyond" or "don't torture a duckling" - this film looks like a quickly warmed up snack. the best way to interpret "cat in the brain" is like a personal statement made by fulci and a direct attack towards censorship. perhaps after seeing so many of his films
