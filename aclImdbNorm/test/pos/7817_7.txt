there are a number of reviews that comment on the cast of this film. suffice it to say that alex cord plays a strong lead opposite robert ryan and arthur kennedy. what concerns me is that many of you may not be aware of the (at least) two existing versions of this film. in the u.s. version clay mccord gains amnesty from governor lem carter and then rides out of town redeemed. i agree that ending is less than satisfying. however, in the original italian cut clay mccord rides out of town (weaponless as he has turned in his pistols to the governor) and is bushwhacked by the bounty hunters that have been slowly depopulating the bandit town of escondido. the bounty killers are excited at the prospect of splitting the $10,000 reward but are disappointed to find mccord's amnesty agreement in the corpses pocket. as they ride away one is heard to comment,"if this amnesty keeps up i'm gonna start hunting buffalo !" . this alone takes a minute to pray...a second to die and places it on an even playing field with movies like keoma and the big gundown. as the end credits say in the italian cut "fine".
