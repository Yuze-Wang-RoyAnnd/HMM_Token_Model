a wonderfully thoughtful and involving movie that leaves an imprint well beyond it's initial liftoff. based on a true story , one of the many "small" stories prior to ww ii , that lend an understanding to the mindsets of the majority of common man cultures, impacted by others perceived as former enemies and perhaps future foes, with the darkening of war clouds on the horizon. viewed at the stony brook film festival, the film was enthusiastically received . well written and expertly cast. the characters were most believable and drew one in to experience their trials and tribulations.
