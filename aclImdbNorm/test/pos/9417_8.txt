sherlock holmes films from the classic universal era tend to range in quality. this range goes from very good to above average, with none of their output being abysmal, or astoundingly brilliant. sherlock holmes and the secret weapon fits snugly into the middle ground quality-wise, and, as ever, it's an enjoyable outing that fans of the series, like myself, will enjoy very much. this film sees holmes in the middle of a world war 2 plot by the evil nazi's to steal a swiss scientist's invention, which could turn out to be a key element on the battlefield. the world war 2 sherlock holmes films don't tend to be as good as the ones such as the scarlet claw where holmes is conducting private investigations, as they're usually dogged by too much propaganda or a plot that is more to do with the war than the mystery. this one, however, pretty much stays away from both and by putting the focus on holmes and his investigation, the film works much better. perhaps universal saw what brought down the earlier voice of terror and changed the focus because of that.<br /><br />basil rathbone once again puts in an excellent maverick performance as the ace detective and while nigel bruce doesn't feature as much as normal, it's nice to see him when he does. the two don't spent much time together, which is disappointing because their chemistry is always one of the best things about holmes films; but this does allow more time for holmes to showboat in various disguises, which is always lots of fun. dennis hoey's lestrade is definitely my favourite of the secondary characters, and while he's not as funny as usual; his facial expressions are great, and his presence helps to emphasise how great holmes is. his scene with watson in a car following paint drops on the road is my favourite moment of the film. it's good to see holmes' nemesis, professor moriarty return, even if it does seem like he's just been thrown in for the hell of it. lionel atwill's performance isn't as good as george zucco's in the adventures of sherlock holmes, as he never really convinces that he is indeed a brilliant mind; but seeing him lock horns with the protagonist is fun and it's nice to see him in the film to offset the world war 2 themes, which are never as interesting as holmes himself. the film starts off as more of a thriller than a mystery flick; but once it gets going, it's hard to put down and this is a more than solid entry in universal's oeuvre.
