i love the other reviews of this movie. they mirror my attitude. i am a 70's sort of guy, minus disco and "star wars" childishness. there was nothing great about this movie, except for a chase scene. that is why it was good, because it was tough, basic and economical. roy scheider carried the movie, which was based on the crew, the 7 ups, that backed up gene hackman in the "french connection". the people in it were believable and average, who burned themselves pouring coffee, showed fear in chase scene and almost lost it after a close call crash.<br /><br />maybe it would be easier to tell you what it lacked. there was no fancy weapons, just basic revolvers and crude sawed off shotguns. there was no tough guy philosophizing, ala tarantino. there was no kung fu or samurai nonsense and no fancy trick shooting either. there was no clever guy who carries out some complicated scheme based on hundreds of things going just the way he planned including everyone else's reactions. the criminals were bad guys but they didn't shoot people for the hell of it. as a matter of fact, there was a body count of just three. something that the average movie these days would pass in the opening credits. it could be a g movie today! no bus load of orphan school children were kidnapped nor were terrorists threatening to kill half of the city. there were no high tech hijinks, nor were the crimes themselves very moving or ingenious, the highest tech thing i saw was a touch tone att wall phone. it had no subplots or amusing character developments. also, no sex or women, except for one mobster's wife who did some screaming as the buddy our hero had her menaced.<br /><br />it was some little undertaker who exploited his connections with the local mob and the police to kidnap local mobsters for some easy payoffs. the undertakers. vito, was played by tony lo bianco who did a great job, as good as roy schneider, buddy the head of 7 ups cop, whom he informed and exploited. what ever happened to tony lo bianco, he seemed like a pacino shoe in, good looking and talented? what it did have was a great nyc backdrop to a simple crime story. locations that were bleak and dehumanizing without being a sociological study. it had a simple plot that involved this kidnapping scheme where one of buddy's cop got accidentally involved, literally accidentally dragged in then accidentally shot dead. since buddy and his 7 ups are a hot dogs unit, both the nypd brass and mobsters thought he was involved, since the kidnappers masqueraded as plain clothes cops to lure the mobsters into compliance. obviously the mobsters figured they had lawyers and rights to protect them from normal police. even the mobsters were plain, old and ugly, no godfather royalty or soprano hipness here.<br /><br />it is a good basic movie with a standout chase scene between two 70's d pontiacs. even the cars were plain and economical, not even a gto or a trans am, like the acting and the story. in the days of batman uber-hype or "24" levels of intensity doomsday scenarios, this movie reminds us that less is better. it should be shown to movie screen writers and directors as a caveat not to dazzle, amuse then ultimately insult us with stunts, gadgets and clown psychotic behavior galore.
