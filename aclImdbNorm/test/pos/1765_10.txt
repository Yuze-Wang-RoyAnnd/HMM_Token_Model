in this approximately 34-second thomas edison-produced short, we see annabelle moore performing the loie fuller-choreographed "serpentine dance" in two different fantastical, flowing robes.<br /><br />moore was one of the bigger stars of the late victorian era. she was featured in a number of edison company shorts, including this one, which was among the first kinetoscope films shown in london in 1894.<br /><br />loie fuller had actually patented the serpentine dance, which moore performs here in robes (as well as entire frames) that are frequently hand tinted in the film, presaging one of the more common symbolic devices of the silent era. supposedly, the moore films were popular enough to have to be frequently redone (including refilming). the version available to us now may be a later version/remake. moore became even more popular when it was rumored that she would appear naked at a private party at a restaurant in new york city. she later went on to star as the "gibson bathing girl" in the ziegfeld follies in 1907. she appeared there until 1912.<br /><br />the short is notable for its framing of motion, which, especially during the "second half", becomes almost abstract. it somewhat resembles a morris louis painting, even though this is almost 60 years before louis' relevant work.<br /><br />you should be able to find this short on dvd on a number of different anthologies of early films.
