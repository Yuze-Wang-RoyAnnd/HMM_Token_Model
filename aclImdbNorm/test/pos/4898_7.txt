there are two ways to turn a tv series into a film.<br /><br />the first, most common, and least successful, is to basically make a feature-length tv episode- see the disasters of the steptoe & son movie. the second is to do something else- something quite different, `a la monty python.<br /><br />thankfully, the creators of the cult tv series have gone for the second option, and they've come up with something unique, clever and funny- it couldn't feel less like a tv episode.<br /><br />try to get your head around this- the writers, playing themselves, are confronted by their royston vasey alter-egos, played, of course, by them, and told to continue writing the series, otherwise apocalypse will befall the village.<br /><br />high-concept, contrived and easy to screw up? yes, but somehow they managed to pull it off. not for every taste, perhaps, and the ending does drag, but fans will be delighted, and it might even win over the uninitiated.
