this is a profound and moving work about the creation of art, that which is uniquely human and cannot be produced by nature, the cost of genius and the search for transcendence and what in the end constitutes family, i.e, all of us. i was very much moved by the family discussion that nathaniel had with his sisters about the shortcomings of their father as it was set in a beautiful home that seemed to radiate warmth that lou had created. and although esther seems so cold in her discussion about lou's inability to make money you can appreciate how she at many points in his life must have been a counter-weight to his impulses. nathaniel did a great job of showing how all of the people in lou's life fit in and completed it and became as much a part of his work as his own genius. yes even, or maybe especially, our failures make us who we are. and of course there are the buildings. i had only known lou kahn by name and did not really connect his name to his work, they are evidence of grace. perhaps someday there will be a building where we will all fit, and it will certainly resemble a lou kahn building, perhaps the unbuilt temple in jerusalem. perhaps there is salvation
