"distant" is a slice-of-turkish-life flick which follows the mundane activities of two adult male cousins; one a photographer and the other an unemployed underachiever. there's little doubt that auteur nuri bilge ceylan is a work in progress with considerable talent. however, this little foreign minimalistic arty dramady is so full of empty filler and so devoid of story or anything engaging or provocative that it will likely appeal to only the most avid devotees of cinema and mainstream audiences should look elsewhere. i personally grew quickly bored with the slow pace of the film and found myself fast-forwarding through the empty spaces - and there are many - between dialogue, plot development, and denouement. "distant" is a very nicely done bit of esoterica. (b-)
