i knew nothing about this film until i watched it... my brother in fact suggested i take a look. normally, his suggestions aren't much cop however, but i was stuck for something to watch so i watched it.<br /><br />well, to cut a long story short, i give it 10/10.<br /><br />the film centers around two people, that meet whilst lodging at the same place. one is initially very dependant upon the institution around him, the other is a rebel. one does what he likes, the other as he's told.<br /><br />from the first moments of the film we quickly see the friendship between the two building, and see how they rub off a little on each other. it's a remarkable piece of work, that manages to tell a good story without twist upon twist, people leaping out of bath tubs, or superheros coming to save the day.<br /><br />there's a fair amount of grit and reality in there, not everything can ever go just right - not all gulfs can ever be spanned - and this film delightfully shows the lot.<br /><br />if you watch this film, and are not impressed..... i'd suggest that you don't watch anything again.
