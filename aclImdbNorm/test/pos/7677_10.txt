i saw this movie when i was very young. it is my all time favorite. i had been unable to obtain a copy until recently and viewing it brought back so many fond memories. i loved sidney poiter's portrayal of porgy, he his character with such strength and courage. pearl bailey's part, although small, was not unlike many of our own family members. my favorite songs were and still are "bess you is my women," "porgy,don't let him handle me" and of course "summertime." according to the guidelines, if i'm interpreting them correctly i'm unable to post where i was able to obtain my copy, sorry. that is why i registered so that i might be able to share this info. before registering the guidelines are not posted.<br /><br />phone numbers, mail addresses, urls. availability, price, or ordering/shipping information.
