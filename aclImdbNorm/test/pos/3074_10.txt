i don't think i have ever seen a better movie parody. mel brooks is insane. every time i watch it i find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. cary elwes is perfect for the role of robin hood. it has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. every character is great from little john and will to maid marian and broomhilde. i laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. watch it!!<br /><br />if you liked cary elwes in this movie, you must definitely see the princess bride.
