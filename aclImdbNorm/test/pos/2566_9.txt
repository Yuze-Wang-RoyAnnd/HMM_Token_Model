then you will be a big fan of this movie. its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. i'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, i had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but i am a big fan of samuel l. jackson and i enjoyed hustle & flow so i thought i would give it a chance.<br /><br />i'm very glad that i did. it turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man. the story had heart, and was very influential.<br /><br />the music in this movie also added a nice touch. craig brewer mixed his style from hustle & flow into this movie, except took a new spin and used the blues. his musical scenes are still at the top of the charts as far as performance scenes go by. he also has very interesting flashback scenes and just gives you an overall crazy feel during some of the more controversial scenes.<br /><br />no doubt, if you liked hustle & flow, you will love this movie, and if you are a fan of the blues you should definitely go an see this. i give it a 9 out of 10, very interesting film, and it is extremely under rated. shame.<br /><br />go out and rent this movie.
