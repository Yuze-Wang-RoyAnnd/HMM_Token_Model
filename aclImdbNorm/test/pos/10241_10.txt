this movie was really well written and was very entertaining.there was great acting in it too. luke perry did a very convincing job. (like he always does)if you are looking for a eventful movie to watch this should be at the top of your list. there is a mixture of comedy, drama, and action. you can literally feel what the actors are feeling at points. i was very impressed by this movie. the special effects were very well done. the whole movie was very convincing. this movie is one of my favorites. what happens is north america could be torn apart and jack and his team have to try and to stop an eruption by destroying north america. it was a very cool and creative idea. i loved this movie and i know you will too.
