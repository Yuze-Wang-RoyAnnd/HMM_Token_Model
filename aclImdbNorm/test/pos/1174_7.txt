this is the kind of movie that people of a certain age will say of "i didn't think they made movies like that anymore". walter matthau gives his usual over-the-top performance, but instead of leaving teeth marks all over the scenery, leaves endearing grease stains. he is like that great uncle we all know that still wears plaid polyester and embarrasses everyone, but we still love anyway.<br /><br />jack lemmon's performance reminds us why he had more golden globe nominations than anyone else (22). he gives a true-to-life performance of the basically 'good, ordinary man', even in the milieu of a farce.<br /><br />this film will probably not appeal to people who prefer blunt humor designed to confront or offend, but will appeal to people who appreciate broad farce played with a straight face.<br /><br />the entire supporting cast is excellent in their ability to play such absurd characters while maintaining the reality of each character.<br /><br />brent spiner gives a marvelous performance as a professional version of a lounge lizard. anyone who has known professional hosts in real life will immediately recognize the type he is playing. he nails the type perfectly. his rendition of 'slime' merits study as a perfect example of the contrast between absurd and pathetic.<br /><br />the plot is rather a straight-forward 'let's marry rich' theme that has the usual results. just because a plot theme has been done a thousand times does not mean that it is dated, but rather that it is a timeless theme.<br /><br />the rest of the supporting cast shows what can happen when professionals exhibit their skills in the roles that are written for them, instead of vying for the spotlight. in this film even the second tier actors shine. it is also obvious that they enjoyed making this film.<br /><br />the plot may be standard and thin, but it allows the performers to shine.<br /><br />this film is a true treat for people who want to see professional actors engaging in their craft. the plot falls away and the performers shine.
