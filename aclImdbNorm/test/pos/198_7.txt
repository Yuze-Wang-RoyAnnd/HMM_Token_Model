russian actress tatiana samoilova reminds me so much of the young audrey hepburn and the camera in the cranes are flying seems to love her just as much. she is the focal point of a bittersweet war romance against the background of world war ii in moscow.<br /><br />the film is almost poetic in its gorgeous b&w cinematography which was the main reason for watching the film in the first place, since i had never heard of it and decided to give it a try when it aired on tcm.<br /><br />it's a very moving love story about a girl's deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by his role as a soldier drafted in wartime russia. she's unable to forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him, but inexplicably marries someone else who has forced himself on her, a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear from. their marriage is a troubled one because she can't let go of her remembrance of a happier time with her soldier sweetheart.<br /><br />by the end of the story, she accepts the idea that he's never going to return and is able to face reality and cope with the situation. there's a very poignant final scene at a train station where arriving soldiers are greeting their loved ones and the tearful girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers by giving some flowers from her bouquet to the joyous families.<br /><br />the stylish and striking camera-work is what carries the film, as well as the honestly played story.<br /><br />tastefully done, but perhaps the english subtitles didn't tell the whole tale because some of the plot elements seemed a bit blurred to me as if they had been glossed over.<br /><br />summing up: easy to see why it won awards at the cannes film festival. reminded me, in style, of another great russian film, ballad of a soldier.
