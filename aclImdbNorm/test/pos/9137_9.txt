everyone likes the coolly created, memorable heist movie. alain delon provides the antihero, melville provides the cool, and a handful of other great talent (yves montand, gian maria volonte, and andre bourvil, mostly) arrives to add a crisp engaging movie...<br /><br />...with very little dialog. this is great, because one certain aspect of the genre tends to be a lot of dialog involving the quick-witted and their various repartees. this movie, however, could be watched with the sound completely off and not too terribly much would be missed. not to say the sound is bad, oh no, the jazzy soundtrack and the crisp audio catching the little movements makes the slow, patient deliberation of the patients very compelling.<br /><br />what's also really neat about this film is that the color cinematography is pretty fantastic. usually when it comes to cinematography, black and white movies tend to stick out in my mind, but this film has some very strong and beautiful imagery that makes the movie pure visual pleasure to observe.<br /><br />--polarisdib
