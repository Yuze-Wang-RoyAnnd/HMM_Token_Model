especially considering i can count on one hand the romantic comedy films i have ever enjoyed.<br /><br />minnie driver is very good as the heart transplant patient, who has a mysterious connection to duchovny's recently deceased wife. (i can think of several awful films which have used this story line- i think there was an lmn movie with jane seymour) this film, however, is a keeper.<br /><br />duchovny is sympathetic, and the scenes with his dog are cute and sad- the dog misses his deceased wife. all of his friends want him to find a replacement, and there is an amusing scene where he is on a blind date and driver is the waitress. his date is horrible, and he finds himself intrigued by minnie driver.<br /><br />caroll o'connor is also good in one of his last roles, as the curmudgeonly grandfather. bonnie hunt and james belushi (this is the only film i have liked him in) round out the comedy aspect of the film.<br /><br />this is a good film because the story works, it is not overly romantic, and does not insult the audience's intelligence. highly recommended 9/10.
