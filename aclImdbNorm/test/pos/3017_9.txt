the cell (2000) rating: 8/10<br /><br />the cell, like antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. the first time i saw this film i thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, i decided i had to rent it again. i did, and i found the film to be much more likeable. the cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched. the film's script can be clunky at times, as can the acting, but the visuals are ingenious and bring the engaging story to an exotic and intriguing life. the oscar nominated makeup is also daring and careful, while the beautiful costumes and utterly brilliant set decoration went unnoticed. tarsem singh who has also directed music videos, goes totally crazy with his direction and it results well. he has major talent and this film has a lot of potential if you give it a chance. overall, the cell is a powerful, disturbing and avoids being too tacky which makes it a great, pleasurable watch.
