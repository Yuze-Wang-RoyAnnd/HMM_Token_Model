it seems there are two kinds of people in the world: those who think that "five characters" is one of the best episodes in the series and those who are so cool that they know it sucked because they were so clever and already predicted the "lame" twist at the end (which apparently, in their small minds, is the only reason the twilight zone exists: to come up with twists).<br /><br />there are plenty of lame episodes in the series and i'm not one to rate all tz episodes ten. but this one is certainly one of those that merit such a rating. it is claustrophobic and colorful. the suspense is built up and we cannot wait for the reveal of the secret at the end. but whatever that secret is, what these people are, it doesn't really matter. most of the beauty of the episode is to lead up to that. it would be just as powerful if we never find out what these strangers in a strange place really are.
