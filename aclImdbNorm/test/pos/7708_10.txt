this is one of nine shorts on the anime disk, "the animatrix." it is my favorite. the artwork is amazing. the black-and-white, somewhat grainy texture perfectly captures the mood that the segment is trying to portray. the story is tight, and the ending is true to film noir.<br /><br />overall, i gave the animatrix a "7", but this particular segment deserves a "10."
