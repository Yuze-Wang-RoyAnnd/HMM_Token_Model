i just watched this film this morning and i found it to be a great showing of the richness of faith. babette gave them another way to look at life; not a replacement, but an enhancement. she shared all that she had with those who gave what little they had to her. i see the story of god in here. he sent his only son to man. man could not possibly give anything that would equal that. so, for our small sacrifice, we are given an ultimate treasure and are transformed because of it. in this film the bickering townspeople have so consumed themselves with a small interpretation of god. babette showed them that life and god can indeed be beautiful in it's fullest sense. the love that god's son showed to man is the love we should show to one another and our lives will be the richer for it. even the film is a metaphor. it seems slow in the beginning, but the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end. it was truly a feast.
