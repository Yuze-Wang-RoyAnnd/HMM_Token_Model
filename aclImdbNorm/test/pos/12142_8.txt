i've only seen about a half dozen films starring lino ventura, but this one seems very much like the others. he plays a laconic criminal--one who is short on words and subdued yet occasionally explosive. given his quiet persona in such films as army of shadows and second breath, i've noticed that his minimalist style of acting is extremely effective. in other words, because he is so quiet and mannered, when he does bad things you tend to notice. and, like these other films, he also has a very strong, though twisted, moral code.<br /><br />abel davos (ventura) and his partner, lilane, are both living in italy and are career criminals. both grew up in france and eventually had to flea due to their criminal activities. now in italy as the film begins, they continue to live the life of thugs and the heat is on to catch them. oddly, instead of running to yet a third country, they decide to go back to france--even though davos has been tried and convicted in absentia--and if he's caught it could mean a life in prison or the death penalty. much of the first third of the film concerns their covert return.<br /><br />unfortunately for davos, the return doesn't go perfectly and now it seems as if every cop in france is looking for him. additionally, the reaction of his old compatriots in crime is not at all what he'd expect. in fact, their tepid response to his return ends up unleashing a series of terrible events towards the end of the film.<br /><br />along the way, davos meets and is taken in my a stranger, eric stark (jean-paul belmondo). despite davos seemingly having no friends, stark and his lady friend try their best to make his return successful. what throws another monkey wrench into this, though, is davos' two very young sons--what is davos to do with them--keep them with him in his hiding place? <br /><br />overall, this is a very good crime film--sort of like french film noir. unlike american noir, the many french versions i have seen have a more realistic as well as bleak outlook to them. fatalism reigns supreme, that's for sure! the acting is first-rate (especially from ventura and belmondo), the direction very sure and the writing very nice, though i am sure many won't like the ending. it just seems to be tacked on--like an afterthought. i understood why they did it this way, but can also see how it might leave many unsatisfied. as for me, it did leave me a tad flat. otherwise, an exceptional film.
