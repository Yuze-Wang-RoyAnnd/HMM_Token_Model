i loved it. i had just sat through half of "the glass house" (turned it off...god what a morass of predictable plot and bad acting) and then i saw this movie. i thought it was terrific. loved both cameron diaz and jordana brewster in it. i liked the escapism of the whole setting, the traveling around europe in the 60's thing - yet they made it more realistic by showing the dark side and all of the bad things that could happen. it held my attention completely, even if i did think that parts were unbelievable.
