the brilliant chuck jones, master of warner bros. cartoon comedy, brings us the first (?) pepe lepew cartoon. an alley cat, tired of being pushed around, paints himself in the colors of a skunk, and with a healthy dose of limburger, turns the tables on his tormentors. then along comes pepe, and you know the rest. many of pepe's famous gags were born here, including his chase/hop, in which he hops casually along while his prey runs himself to exhaustion.<br /><br />in my opinion, warner bros. cartoons became less inventive and more ho-hum in the 50s. this 1947 'toon is one of the few examples of mel blanc putting his absolutely crazy voice into pepe's mouth. but the kicker is the ending, where pepe is revealed to be an american "wolf in skunk's clothing"! a must see! classic warner bros...
