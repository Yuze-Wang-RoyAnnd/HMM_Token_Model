believe me when i say this show is just plain hilarious. the basic story is about kintaro oe who travels from town to town taking part time jobs, chasing women, and learning all he can about life. kintaro has to be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever made. he takes everything to the extreme, and it's just laugh out loud funny every time. from his constant never ending quest to study life, to tiny things he instantly blows up into life or death matters.<br /><br />one of the funniest things about this show is simply kintaro's constantly extremely over the top expressions and reactions. he spends a great amount of time in various super deformed modes like dragon half or trigun. other times in less then 0.1 seconds his face will turn not just serious, but manga-fighter-style life or death expressions like a weight lifter trying to benchpress a new record. it's hilarious.<br /><br />if that wasn't enough, the writing is superb and the english voice acting couldn't possibly be better. kintaro's english va is just perfect and will have you rolling around when he's not even really saying anything. the one thing to mention though is this is without a doubt an ecchi series. it practically defines the word. if you're an adult anime fan who can get a laugh out of movies like american pie, you'll love this.<br /><br />- rirath_com
