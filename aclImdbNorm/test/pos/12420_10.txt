just got around to seeing monster man yesterday. it had been a long wait and after lots of anticipation and build up, i'm glad to say that it came through and met my expectations on every level. true, you really can't expect too much from hearing the plot rundown, but after reading some of the reviews for it, i was ecstatic. i mean, what trash fan wouldn't want to see a gore flick about a deranged inbred hick mowing people down with his make-shift monster truck? i went in expecting a cross between road trip and the hills have eyes and got so much more. this was a horror comedy that actually worked. the film makers got it right when it came to making you squirm and making you howl with laughter at the same time. kudos to michael davis for going all out with the gore and pushing the envelope with the sickass humor. let me list just a few reasons why i love this movie so much: first off is the story. it's been done to death in so many other flicks. a college guy gets wind that his childhood crush is getting married. he, being the 25 year old virgin that he is, hops in his vista cruiser and decides to take the road trip to confess his love, hoping that she will fall head over hills and all that good jive. hidden in the backseat of his station wagon, is good buddy harley. harley is the loudmouth, former friend, who laughs and talks just like jack black in high fidelity. you can't help but like the guy, but if he was your friend in real life, you'd have to keep a whiffle ball bat handy(laugh all you want, but have you ever been hit with one?) to keep him in check. so, he's a little on the obnoxious side, to say the least, but you can tell that he's a loyal friend, deep down...anyway, they're on the road and when they stop in a bar, they aggravate the locals. now they're being stalked by a leatherface clone in a monster truck. that's it. yeah, along the way they pick up a gorgeous hitchhiker but i'm too lazy and hungover to go into that right now... so just watch the damn movie.<br /><br />second thing i love was the humor. this one had some of the sickest laughs of any movie since cabin fever. just how messed up is it? well, i won't even go into the whole cat scene and as for the "corpse burrito" thing, i'll leave that to your virgin eyes as well. the bar full of amputees was somewhat disturbing and that guy who looked like john turturro bothered me too. harley, although a totally obnoxious frat-boy type, can really sling off the one liners. love the clogs, by the way. i need a new pair..<br /><br />the gore. this one pours it on heavy. while the first hour plays out as a demented road comedy, the last third is all about blood and guts. if the movie hadn't kept such a light tone throughout, it would have been a little disturbing, but seeing how it was all played for laughs, there is no way possible that you will be bothered by it. if you're still in your seat by the time it comes, you'll probably see the humor in it too, but seriously, there were buckets and buckets of the red stuff. there was a big plot turn that i didn't see coming and when the credits rolled, i was completely satisfied. i had gotten exactly what i came for and i'm really glad that i bought it. much like cabin fever, it's going to get a lot of replay.<br /><br />the look of the movie was outstanding. there was this deliberately cheap look that made the whole thing scream late 80s and i loved the exaggerated colors. it's obvious that monster man was done on a relatively low budget, but much like cabin fever (sorry i keep comparing the two) it actually works in the movie's favor. cabin fever was an ode to the 70s greats, this was the 80s answer to that. so take that for what it's worth. no cgi here. this is what we all needed. i'm not exactly sure why it didn't get a theatrical release because this is everything that jeepers creepers should have been. thank god for lions gate.
