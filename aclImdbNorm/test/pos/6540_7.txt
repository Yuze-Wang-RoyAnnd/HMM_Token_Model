whenever this film gets a mention, usually the discussion begins and ends with the wonderful collection of cars and drag scenes, often overlooked are the at times eclectic characters that populate the film around the three central characters<br /><br />one character that stands out is rebel played by the great veteran australian actor max cullen. rebel is a blind drag racer, who nearly runs down the hero and his group in the middle of the night because he is not using any headlights.<br /><br />in the back story we discover that rebel master builder of street racing cars, and he and his wife seem locked in a time warp of the 1950's. rebel goes on to play a small but pivotal role in teaching mike, played by terry serio, the almost spiritual truth about street drag racing. it is not speed, reaction times that make a great racer. it is the one who feels the car best who will become the greatest<br /><br />this is best exemplified as rebel explains to mike after a test drive "you got all the agony, just missing the style"<br /><br />graham bond, is another well credited actor lending his talents as a crooked police officer looking to get in on some of the financial action being generated by the street racing. the confrontation between bond and fox played by richard moir adds tension to the story. bond not only expects results but also fox to drum up racing business<br /><br />for most of the movie fox displays a real manipulative and evil side, yet in the climax he presents a sense of honor that turns the final few minutes into an extremely tense and memorable ending. it is almost as if the film is refocusing on its true intention, to show us the culture of street racing rather than the day to day activities of people<br /><br />one of the major complaints about the film is the script. although it is nothing exciting, i believe the complete lack of any chemistry between mikes girlfriend played by deborah conway and his mechanic played by vangelis mourikis has more to do with the problem. any scene in which these two interact simply should have been cut<br /><br />lastly in terms of the actors, one truly standout performance is delivered by kristoffer greaves, who plays a deaf and crippled member of fox's inner circle. his back story is never explored, was he injured in a race, born that way, what is it that fox sees value in to keep him around <br /><br />the reality of the film is simple, it is about street racing, and the culture behind it. when the cars are flying and action sequences are in motion it is the only time director john clark and his writer barry tomblin seem really comfortable with what they are doing.<br /><br />so if you are looking for an in depth exploration of human relationships, moments of life defining drama, then this film is not for you. if your pulse races at the thought of a blown 57 chev or the iconic gto phase 3 blazing away on the streets of sydney, then you wont find much better than this film
