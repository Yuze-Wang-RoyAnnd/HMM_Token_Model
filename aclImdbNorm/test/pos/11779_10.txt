i caught this little gem totally by accident back in 1980 or '81. i was at a revival theatre to see two old silly sci-fi movies. the theatre was packed full and (with no warning) they showed a bunch of sci-fi short spoofs (to get us in the mood). most were somewhat amusing but this came on and, within seconds, the audience was in hysterics! the biggest laugh came when they showed "princess laia" having huge cinnamon buns instead of hair on her head. she looks at the camera, gives a grim smile and nods. that made it even funnier! you gotta see "chewabacca" played by what looks like a muppet! it was extremely silly and stupid...but i couldn't stop laughing. most of the dialogue was drowned out because of all the laughter. also if you know "star wars" pretty well it's even funnier--they deliberately poke fun at some of the dialogue. this really works with an audience! a definite 10!
