this movie used to be played constantly on the disney channel when i was a bit younger, and i really remember liking it. however, i didn't have great taste back then (not to say that i do now) so i can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. the movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so i gave it an extra point. yeah, worth watching. i know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash. the song is "play a love song" by the jaguars and it is very hard to find and obtain. in fact, this movie is, too. i can't find it anywhere online or on dvd or on vhs. i'd like to see it again so i can gauge if it was actually a good movie. oh well.
