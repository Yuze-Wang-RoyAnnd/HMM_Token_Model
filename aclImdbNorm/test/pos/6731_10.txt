being cornish and brought up with the history of tin mining, this film is quite special to me. filmed in and around various locations in cornwall, it depicts the story of two your children who get trapped down a mine with a group of miners.<br /><br />the 'haunters' of the title refers to the 'spriggins' - ghosts of child miners who reside in the mine and are said to bring evil to all that mine there. events take place with an american wanting to invest in local tin mining, but when the young local kid josh is plagued by sightings of the ghost of a young boy, he and his american 'girlfriend' set out to unravel the mystery behind his death, climaxing in the rescue of themselves and several miners from almost certain death when a new shaft is opened and the spiggins save them.<br /><br />top film, albeit low budget and short, but worth a look if you're from cornwall and/or into tin mining!
