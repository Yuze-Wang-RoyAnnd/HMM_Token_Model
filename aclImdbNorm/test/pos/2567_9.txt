i must admit, i didn't expect this to be as good as it was. i also didn't expect samuel l. jackson to play slide and sing blue either.<br /><br />cinemark of beaver county pa does this frequently. they advertise movies in the lobby, get you all excited about seeing it, and then disappoint you by not showing it...<br /><br />i expected that with such a great cast of jackson and ricci and even a former n'syncer (timberlake), that this movie would at least have shown for a week. but nay, at that time if i remember correctly mi3 was showing on 3 screens (that or some other type of supposed blockbuster).<br /><br />like blues brothers, and crossroads, this movie incorporates the mystic and legend of what blues music is all about. passion, and hard times. religion and sex. hell hounds of the past. redemption. i mean so many elements go into the blues to make it work.<br /><br />this was just a good all around story. of course, not many people will see it cause it doesn't have pirates or swinging spiders. but it does have samuel l. jackson...<br /><br />think of what happens to jacksons character from pulp fiction after he walks the earth and settles down and that essentially describes him to a "t".<br /><br />great and underrated, but aren't all the good ones like that anyway?
