this game is not exactly the best n64 game ever. sure, it's good, but only when there's 4 players. without 4 players, the only fun thing to do is take remote mines and see how many people you can kill. but half of this game are levels where you have to save natalya, so you'll have to limit your use of remote mines in those levels, and that gets quite boring. the graphics don't exactly reach the level of super mario 64 or even mario kart 64. and if you're talking a great multiplayer in a 1st-person shooter, you'll have to go with perfect dark. at least you can play "multiplayer" by yourself.
