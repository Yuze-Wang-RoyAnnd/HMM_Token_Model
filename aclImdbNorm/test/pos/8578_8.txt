i love this film. there is something for everyone. it if funny, saddening, passionate and dramatic. the mixture of two completely different cultures creates a whole new world that the viewer cannot help but want to be a part of. i must admit that i am slightly biased, as colin firth is my favourite actor and so nothing that he does is wrong in my eyes (!), but in this film his tremendous acting talent is apparent and it is furthered even more by the beautiful acting of his co-star nia long. the problems that their love affair suffers makes it, ironically, more believable and the simple features like the contrast between the colours of matthew's and nimi's clothes alone, makes this film all the more enchanting. i defy anyone that cannot be moved by this story. i find it enchanting and have watched it at least ten times since i bought the film a week ago!
