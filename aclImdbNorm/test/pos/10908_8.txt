the first, and far better, of kevin kline's two gay roles. (the second is the dreary "de-lovely" in which he played cole porter.) inspired by tom hanks' emotional acceptance speech for "philadelphia" in which he outed his high school drama teacher, the nominated film in this version was obviously more "forrest gump" than "philadelphia". here the hanks character is played by matt dillon.<br /><br />the reaction scenes in most of the film are very funny and, as has been often pointed out, are especially effective as done by kevin himself, debbie reynolds, tom selleck (a brave move since he was himself the target of such rumors, which he denied!), bob newhart and joan cusack as the eventually jilted bride-to-be.<br /><br />tom hanks' actual teacher criticized the graduation scene saying people don't act that way in real life. but this is a farce and not real life. that being said, it is not as effective as it might be and the misdirection of the final "wedding scene" which makes it look like tom and kevin are about to get hitched i found rather pointless, annoying and a cop out.<br /><br />the highlight of the film for me is, of course, kevin's scene with the how-to-be-a-real-man audio tape and it is hilarious but certainly not at all realistic when the tape reacts to kevin's actions.<br /><br />on the whole, a hoot!
