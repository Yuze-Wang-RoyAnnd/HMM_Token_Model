it is the best movie released in bollywood upto date. the best comedy, the best acting and the best direction till now! rajkumar santoshi's writing and direction proved that he is one of the best directors in the industry. aamir khan was absolutely amazing, salman khan looked good the way he acted. shakti kapoor was good, but jagdeep over acted as usual! this comedy is still copied by people and no other writers and directors have been able to make this thing again! even rajkumar santoshi hasn't been able to make this cult classic again! this movie was a flop when it released but it has been a cult classic since it released and loved by all kinds of people.<br /><br />star.<br /><br />acting 10/10.<br /><br />dialogues 10/10.<br /><br />screenplay 10/10.<br /><br />direction 10/10.<br /><br />music 9/10.<br /><br />lyrics 9/10.<br /><br />overall, this movie is strongly recommended. if you didn't watch it till now, you missed something big! it is a laugh riot and the best comedy i have seen till date! classic films like hera pheri, golmaal and jaane bhi do jaaro are not even half as funny as this.<br /><br />great movie, hats off!!!!
