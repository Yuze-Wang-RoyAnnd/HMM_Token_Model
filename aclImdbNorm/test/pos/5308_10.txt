the united states of leland was an amazing movie. i kept passing it on the guide on my tv not knowing what it was and never having the chance to sit there and get into it. then one morning when i woke up early, i saw that it was just about to start. so i decided to watch it. i had the time and interest to watch it. when i saw that ryan gosling was in the movie and then that he was the main character, i was immediately sucked in and could not move from my couch. the struggle that leland goes through is such an inspiring story. everyone has to deal with the same type of thoughts throughout sometime in their life whether it be a small minor detail or something as big as what he's going through. i have to sit and watch the movie again just to catch all the stuff that i may have missed the first time around. as a general comment... i would recommend this movie to anyone who is a gosling fan or anyone who just likes a good movie with a real good story. the fact that there are so many other big stars who all also had great performances is just an added bonus! so do what you can to take the time to check out this movie, i can almost be sure it won't be a waste of time.
