certainly the highlight of this film is it's cast.<br /><br />diana rigg, george c. scott, bernard hughes to mention a few.<br /><br />i have accumulated more time in hospitals and with doctors over the years than i care to think about.<br /><br />this comedy attacks the pomp and pretension in all aspects of our society, through the setting of one of it's "most haughty" institutions... the medical profession.<br /><br />the idea that such goings on could be possible, might be a shock to some, but is a delight to anyone with the perspective of experience.<br /><br />dr brock (scott) undergoes a mid-life crisis of monumental proportions before our eyes as we, and he, become enamored with the prospect of his involvement with miss drummond (rigg).<br /><br />the thread of the absurd is woven into this wonderful mix in the form of the irony that the hospital appears to be killing it's own workers as they mismanage their affairs in it.<br /><br />the climax is unpredictable (unless you've seen it) and made even more hilarious if you happen to guess.<br /><br />it's not everyone's brand of humor, to be sure, and has uproariously funny "dark moments" if you're open to them.<br /><br />i loved every minute, and was delighted to see it out on dvd.
