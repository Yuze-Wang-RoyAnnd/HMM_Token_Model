i'm guessing that we all, no matter if we are fans of cars, luv the sound of a dodge challenger as it growls along the road, the noise a 57 chevy make as it screams with ecstasy when it tears round a corner and, most of all, the blast of sound as a classic vehicle bursts into flames as it explodes. i'm not the biggest car enthusiast by any stretch of the imagination, but any of the above really does rev my engine! there's no denying the importance of transport on cinema. it has even been said that the invention of the train was one of the biggest influences on early cinema (looking out a window almost like a moving picture and the idea of being transported to a different time/space). but the car remains the most popular and most luved, it's even got its own genre: the carsploitation genre. a genre that focuses purely on the beauty of cars. in effect, it's just porn! car porn! and i'm not talking about that rather nasty documentary on channel 4 in which men actually had sexual intercourse with cars. whatever floats your...car, i guess. moving on... whilst running on empty isn't quite as pornographic as vanishing point (richard c. sarafian, 1971) for instance, with its close ups of the car in motion, all it's bumps and curves (!), this doesn't mean that the car isn't the main focus of this film. in fact, the cars themselves become characters (more on that later). they're objectified and fetishised as much as the women, in fact, maybe even more. and holy holy, are these cars something! every car in this film (besides the ones in the background) are simply beautiful
