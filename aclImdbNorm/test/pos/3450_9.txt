pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. what a sad life he must lead!<br /><br />this movie has more to say about life and relationships than most i've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the "ordinary people" type of film. it is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.<br /><br />the whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps shakespear's "midsummer nights' dream." beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.<br /><br />i look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable. it's like re-reading a favorite, treasured book.
