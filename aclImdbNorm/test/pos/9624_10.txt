this was the very first kung fu movie that i have ever seen. the dubbing is not the greatest but alot better than some that i had seen. the plot is much better than some that are made today. it is gory at times but that is what gives it that special push. academy award material is it not. but if you like to watch fights and a decent story backround, this is for you!
