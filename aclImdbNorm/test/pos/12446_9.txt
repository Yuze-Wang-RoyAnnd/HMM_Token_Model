i did it too. when i first saw the band, i dismissed them straight away without even listening to the music. then one day, out of sheer curiosity, i bought the cd and fell in love with it. so i bought the video. hold onto your lunch kids, this isnt going to be pretty! the video was excellent - a great opportunity to hear the music, see some of the promo videos, and meet the band...although i *still* dont know how they can cope with wearing those masks all the time! a must for all fans of the band, and fans of alternative music in general
