after some further thought about this film, i find it's far too easy to dismiss this as the boy's dream. i have actually received some spiritual strength from northfork.......angels do exist....we definitely are entertained by angels....most of the time we aren't even aware of it..... at a point of spiritual and emotional turbidity in my life, i personally really needed this film. yes, as i wrote before, it speaks to so many......can't wait to get to heaven...<br /><br />"being so sick of all of the fx and formula stuff, i found this film to be genuine cinema. all i can say is it touched me in so many ways, that i still am sorting it all out. north fork is a wonderful film. one that brings the viewer's mind out of the gutter and into the heart. the spiritual aspect is so very intriguing to me. pay attention, as you'll need to use the brain and heart god gave you to follow the story. i think it's possibly a bit over the heads of some, but i feel those are the individuals it speaks to most importantly. i want to view it several more times, just so i can take it all in!<br /><br />the industry needs to study this film to realize we do exist.<br /><br />my thanks to all involved in the making of this film."
