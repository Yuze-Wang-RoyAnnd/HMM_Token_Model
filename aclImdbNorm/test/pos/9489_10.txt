zeppelin is my favorite band, so when i heard that this double dvd was coming out, i was understandably excited. i'll just cut to the chase here, and say that if you are any kind of zeppelin fan, you must run out and buy this right away! it's absolutely spectacular! it blows 'the song remains the same' completely out of the water. why this material was never released before is beyond me. the footage presented here really shows zep at the peak of their game, which i never really felt that 'song' quite did. jimmy page is the best ever without a doubt, and these performances make jimi hendrix look like a chump! be on the lookout for the live jam 'white summer'... whew!<br /><br />viva jimmy page!<br /><br />viva led zeppelin!<br /><br />11 out of 10
