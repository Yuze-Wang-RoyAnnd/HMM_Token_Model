it is great to see a new batch of puppets creating havoc in this series. i found this chapter a lot of fun. in fact, it would probably be my second favorite in the series. this movie has very little violence and is only rated pg-13. this is notably different from the other r-rated puppet master movies which were loaded with gore and violent mayhem. the lack of violence does not diminish the fun though. this film also has notably better special effects than the last movie in this series. good.
