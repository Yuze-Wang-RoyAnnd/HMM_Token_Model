when i first watched this movie i thought it was a very strange movie. but i know that the director almost always has a purpose when he makes a movie. so i decided to watch it one more time. the second time i watched it i realised that albert puyn is a very talented and a very original film maker. in the beginning the viewer was told that the movie took place a decade after the fall of the communism in the eastern europe. but they had clothes and cars with a design typical for the 1950's. they had plutonium which i think is a symbol for the futuristic trade. i think that it means that the movie's real time is not specified. the music in the movie is creating a long music video which tells some parts of the actual story in the lyrics, specially for the intro and the outro.<br /><br />albert puyn is using red and blue back-color when he's showing the symbols for communism (red) and the capitalism and western world (blue). one can notice that ice-t, has the name mao (communism) and that when he's in focus the back-color is red. the american cop, starring burt reynolds, is always filmed with blue back-color. the club where mao and his gang hang out is also with red back-color. crazy six is pendling between the red and the blue color.<br /><br />the white little dog that mao had in the beginning symbolize, i think, the controlling force. mao had the dog in the beginning but the cop took it in the end. that symbolize, i guess, the fall of communism and the replacement of the capitalistic way of thinking from the western world in eastern europe.<br /><br />i think crazy six is a very well-made movie. albert puyn creates an sci-fi/action movie with a politicial depth. it's a different but a very special movie about the communism fall in the eastern europe.<br /><br />i'm looking forward to watch another spectacular movie of albert puyn.
