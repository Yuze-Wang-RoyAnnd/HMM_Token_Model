hello again, i have been thinking about this movie all my life. i saw it when i was 5 years old in los angeles, california in 1942. what a wonderful story of being good to one another, kindness, and charity. you forget it is the bugs relating to one another. it was just as if they were people. i love this movie and so do my adult children. such beautiful color in this movie.i need to see this movie again. there is a story about an envelope in the movie, that i just can't remember the "why" of it.<br /><br />thanks for listening.
