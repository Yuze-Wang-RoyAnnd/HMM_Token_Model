(***minor spoilers***)<br /><br />if there's something in the world of silent clowns that puzzles me, it is that charley chase never got his well deserved "break through" in the movies. oh well, maybe it isn't that strange, really, inasmuch as he never starred in any full-length features. but when i think of it, such an explanation makes it all only more mysterious -- because why the heck didn't chase get any offers to play the leading lead in features? one explanation is that his character, no matter how amusing, was simply too realistic to suit a longer story; without the burlesque elements that chaplin, keaton, lloyd, langdon and other comedians possessed, it can be assumed that the comedy he made and which worked so well for twenty minutes would get repetitive after a few more reels. i don't quite buy this, though, as chase's gag construction is magnificent and could, i believe, at its best maintain the interest of viewers alone for a longer period; at least i am tempted to think so when mighty like a moose runs the show.<br /><br />mr. moose isn't extraordinary handsome, and mrs. moose is hardly a "classic beauty;" he possesses the truly biggest front teeth of any human being on the planet, and she has a remarkably large nose. both of them takes plastic surgery without the other's knowledge, and when they meet by accident just a little later, he doesn't recognize his wife and she doesn't recognize her husband. a number of hilarious misunderstandings begin, with many clever gags all the way through. i don't think i'll reveal anything further, to make the viewing more enjoyable for you. because if you're a fan of silent comedies, or even if you aren't, mighty like a moose offers so many memorable moments within such a short time that i would look upon it as a downright shame not to see it; silly indeed, but no less extremely funny.
