anyone who has seen the trailer for this film would be forgiven for thinking this film is an out and out comedy. in actual fact it's a light-hearted, though not overly funny, romp about a couple of highwaymen.<br /><br />there are numerous faults in the film. the script and plot are weak and the love aspect of the story is strangely dull. yet despite all this it is quite enjoyable, thanks largely to the two leads robert carlyle and jonny lee miller. these two fine actors, carlyle in particular, are always good to watch and here there exists a good chemistry between them.<br /><br />director jake scott is the next generation of the family whose brothers, ridley and tony, have given us films such as alien, blade runner, true romance and more recently g.i. jane and enemy of the state. his debut is directed with energy and enthusiasm, which keeps the film fizzling along, although without the strong cast he assembled the results might not have worked as well.<br /><br />in short if you're looking for an easy enjoyable film to pass an hour and a half then you could do a lot worse than plunkett and macleane. if on the other hand you fancy something subtle, historically accurate and thought provoking, go elsewhere. 7/10.
