can't believe that bostock's cup isn't available on a proper video or dvd yet. i've only seen it once, on a dodgy copy taken off the tv and despite not being a footy fan (at all,) thought it was one of the funniest things i've ever seen.<br /><br />the famous sloping pitch of wherever it was, the clueless coach driver ("ponty-this, ponty-that", "i'll take the next exit"), the pointless plot; it all added up to aching sides.<br /><br />being stuck in the us i'm desperate for some good british humour but not quite enough to spend the amount that the production company are asking for. c'mon, get it out on kosher dvd pronto.
