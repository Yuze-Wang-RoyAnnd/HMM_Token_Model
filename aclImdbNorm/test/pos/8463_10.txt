ever wonder where that episode, "tuttle," came from in the middle of the first season of m*a*s*h? well now the cat's out of the bag: they got it from this soviet film, a satire on how dumb the tsar is, due to the slip of a pen (rendering the phrase "the lieutenants, though ..." into "lieutenant kizhe" which has no meaning) and nobody being honest or gutsy enough to contradict him and just tell him the truth -- kizhe doesn't exist and never did. so they make up an imaginary life for him and eventually kill him off. and 40 years later, david ketchum and bruce shelly borrowed this zany plot and gave us essentially the same story, only on the other side of what had become the cold war, proving that people in high positions can be equally dumb no matter what their loyalties may be!
