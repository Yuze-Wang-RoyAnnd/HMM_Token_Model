this is not so much of a review as it is a testament that it has been proven, yet again, that the academy rewards money, not artistic accomplishment. and i must say i am saddened that this usually artistic and intelligent band of imbd members have left this off the top 250. boogie nights is powerful, raw, and gutsy through script, direction and acting. very few movies can claim this triple crown.
