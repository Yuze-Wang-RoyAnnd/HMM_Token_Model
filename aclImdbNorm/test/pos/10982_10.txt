at a time when hollywood thinks that louder, faster, and bloodier are better, manna from heaven is comedic and touching look at something we've all thought about: what would i do if a load of money fell from the sky.<br /><br />interestingly, it took the characters many years to realize that the money hadn't made a single difference in their lives. they all become what they were destined to be. unfortunately, in most cases, what they became was unhappy, in spite of their good fortune all those years ago.<br /><br />while manna offers the familiar hollywood storyline of good vs. evil, or in the case, generosity vs greed, what sets this film apart is that good wins out by converting evil, not by crushing it.<br /><br />i think the important message of this film is that you can change the world... even if you do it one person at a time.
