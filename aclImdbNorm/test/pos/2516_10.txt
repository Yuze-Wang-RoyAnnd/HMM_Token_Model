cool action - yeah the premise has been done - but not this way - that's the trick. hey folks - shock - it's an x-file.<br /><br />to me - it's cool that scully/mulder have almost no scenes together -- they have to adapt, rely on each other's intrinsic sense about what's really going on - and each other's adaptation skills. they read into each other's moves and get the job done.... (sort of).<br /><br />oh yeah --- really good acting -- do these people get paid to do this? or- a slow day when the convenience store doesn't call them into work. (hey - duchovny - where's the day-old donuts?? malcolm - get to school...)
