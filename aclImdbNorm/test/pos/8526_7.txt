when i first saw this on tape, about 10 years after it had been released, i thought it was one of the better james bond movies. however, after seeing it again around the turn of the century, i was disappointed.<br /><br />i think it's a bit overrated only because critics were so happy to see sean connery end his 12-year hiatus from playing bond that they didn't dare criticize the film. i guess what disappointed me was the ending. after investing two hours into the film, you expect a less-hokey, more satisfying ending. and, it may be nitpicking, but i was disappointed in not seeing the regular actors in the supporting roles such as miss moneypenny, q, felix leiter, etc.<br /><br />on the positive side, there was plenty of unique action scenes, particularly early on, and the two villains were interesting. i thought klaus maria brandauer was the more intriguing of the two because he was so low-key and looked the "nice guy next door." he wasn't your normal bond villain.<br /><br />this had plenty of "skin," for a pg movie, especially with kim basinger starring, never being an actress known for hiding her figure. the language was very tame, but most bond movies are pretty good in that department.<br /><br />all in all, it's a "fair" bond and nothing else. just because connery is in it, it doesn't mean it's automatically good. roger moore and pierce brosnan have proved they could play the role well, too.
