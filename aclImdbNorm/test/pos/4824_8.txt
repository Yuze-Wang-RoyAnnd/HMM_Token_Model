i saw part of this film on the sci-fi channel, but missed the ending. i bought the dvd to see the whole movie, and i'm glad i did.<br /><br />a young mother and her two daughters move into a house out in a backwoods area that they inherited from the husband, who died from an illness. it's very run down, but the three women make the best of it. the teen daughter (scout taylor-compton) is warned by a local boy about the zombies that come out at night. she ignores him, but since he has a cute friend, she joins his group. meanwhile, the younger daughter (chloe grace moretz) makes a friend in a zombie girl her age named mary. it turns out that mary and several other kids died in a mine in 1913 while working as child labor. now that they are zombies, they attack and kill anyone who's not a blood relative. <br /><br />this movie was directed by j.s. cardone, whose previous films include the slayer (1981) and shadowzone (1990), two movies i didn't like in the slightest bit. this is why i was surprised that i actually enjoyed this movie. the film is deliberately paced, which i liked. this allows you to get to know the main characters, most of whom are likable. child zombies have been used at least since george romero's 1968 classic night of the living dead. still, i found the tool-using child zombies in this movie interesting. it would seem that cardone finally found the right script and cast. only the stereotypical scenes of the teens smoking, drinking and making out in a parked car were boring to me.<br /><br />taylor-compton also appears in the halloween remake. moretz appeared in the amityville horror (2005) and the horror film room 6 (2006).
