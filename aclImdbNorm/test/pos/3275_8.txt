ok, maybe posse can't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. but that's because it didn't have the funding those movies had. obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on african american historical involvement (and no, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), hollywood isn't going to be too supportive. and believe me they weren't. the producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make "posse", just so that the story could be told. i think that alone is commendable. posse may not be oscar material (and they don't like black media too much either), but it is a start. it is entertaining, and it introduces us to the black cowboy, a character most of us are unfamiliar with.
