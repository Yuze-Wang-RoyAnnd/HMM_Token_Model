often when tv series are transferred to the big screen, they lose their appeal. not in this case! the historical accuracy in costumes, equipment and general art direction, like the tv series, is outstanding. a good example of comedy and farce, with excellent script and comedy actors in the right parts. based on a classic tv series that stands alone in british tv comedy history.
