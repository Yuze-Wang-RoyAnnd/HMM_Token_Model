andreas arrives in a strange, inhuman place, where everything seems perfect. he's given a good work, everyone is kind to him and to everyone, and he really doesn't trouble too much even in finding a beautiful girlfriend. but in this no-named city andreas finds soon that a perfect commercials-type world is really not a paradise. really one of the better movies i've seen this year. the attractive plot is perfectly supported by a smart direction where every single component (cool desaturated photography; cold symmetrical design; unemotional acting; slow, highly controlled camera movements) helps in building an unique weird atmosphere that will keep the audience suspended until the end. a sarcastic, ironic, bitter comedy that made me laugh ant think, as only best films are able to do. nothing new, probably, in the analysis of the modern de-humanizer civilization, but really a smart work with great surprising ideas that will hardly be forgotten from whom had the luck to see it. simply beautiful the amazing scene in the metro underground.
