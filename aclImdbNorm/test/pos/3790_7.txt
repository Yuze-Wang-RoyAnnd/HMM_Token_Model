the big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort, and charlie chaplin was no exception. this patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution, although the war was nearly over by the time of its release. the tramp goes to war, humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the kaiser in the bum. it's a very funny film, although i don't think it nearly one of his best. it's with 'a dog's life' as his better output for first national before he made his early masterpiece 'the kid.' they are his first three-reelers, which contain sustained, more elaborate gags than he could usually orchestrate in his two-reel shorts at mutual.<br /><br />it can be difficult to balance a pro-war message with slapstick antics and scenes of burlesque on the front, but one wouldn't think so watching 'shoulder arms.' it's also preferable in many respects to a "more serious," dramatic work with a similar message, such as griffith's 'hearts of the world.' chaplin had become a true virtuoso of screen comedy by this time; he makes it look effortless. he knew very well by now that a film with fewer gags--with more elaboration, refinement and careful timing--could be better than any knockabout, keystone-type farce with a dozen pratfalls a minute. the sequence where chaplin is disguised as a tree is a pertinent example. even with wars raging, chaplin can lift the spirits of millions.
