i went to see this movie not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the teaming of robert de niro and eddie murphy. it was a fast paced movie and the hour and a half went by fast. this one certainly won't win any academy awards but it was a change of pace for mr. de niro. he is good in comedy. overall i enjoyed it.
