a powerful debut film from murali k. thalluri that explores events in the life of a group of high school students, each of them in crisis in one way or another. the film starts with the discovery of the body of one of the students, then traces the lives of the group over the previous hours, leaving the audience in suspense until the last minutes as to the identity of the deceased. each of the main characters is facing major stressors which we could see as potentially precipitating a suicide. the cast of unknowns provide performances full of power and emotion. fantastically well done, especially considering the youth of the writer/director who was 19 years old when he wrote the script.
