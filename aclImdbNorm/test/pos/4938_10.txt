this is a great movie to watch with a good friend, boy/girl friend or family. basically one of those feel good movies you want to share with your loved ones....without all the girlie crap you find in a lot of american feel good movies. this movie is light hearted but makes you think, and will make you laugh. <br /><br />just a really simple but universal plot. would think most people could relate in some way to this movie. the characters in the movie are amazing and the actors do a great job in sucking you into the movie. and the movie is topped off all along the way with hilarious true to life jewish humor. i watched the movie for the first time last night, and now i want to own it. :)
