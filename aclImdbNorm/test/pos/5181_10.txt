i just watched the movie tonight and i found it brilliant. it doesn't have special effects that blow your mind, and it's not violent or bloody, no terrorist or aliens but it's brilliant. it's just plain nice, sweet and it brought me to a whole different time, a much simpler time, where people could take their time to walk down the street and look out at the ocean. i think it was beautiful and i for one recommend it. nick was a great character and his friendship with harry was one of the highlights of the movie. everyone is entitled to their opinion, but i believe everyone should watch this, mostly when they feel down, or when they want to share something nice with their friends.
