i first saw the couch trip (1988)on late night television years ago and instantly fell in love with it. the funny thing is i usually catch all the comedies made but have never even heard of this one until i saw it. dan ackroyd is plain and simpley hillarious period. he has made a couple great movies with belushi and don't forget saturday night live. but i think the couch trip is probably his best and funniest. with a good supporting cast of charles grodin, david clennon, and walter matthau this piece of cinema shines with comic gold. ackroyd's wife donna dixxon even does a fine job here. my favorite moments of the film involve ackroyd and david clennon's charachter lawrence baird. those two played well off each other. so if you haven't seen a good comedy in awile take a trip back to 1988 and rent or buy the couch trip. i just did, amazon 78 cents. what a bargain, too bad i got hit with a 2.50 shipping fee. oh well still well worth it. any guy will love this flick check it out.
