... but it is also minnie's and pete's too! yes, the grumpy captain may not look like pete, but it is! mickey and minnie are the best characters, both of them are very sweet and likable. interestingly, minnie is more of a lady in this than what she usually is today and mickey is less than considerate in this than he is now. pete is still the same old meanie, but he looks a bit different. <br /><br />in this famous episode, on board a little steamboat, mickey, minnie and some side characters have a great deal of fun and a great deal of annoyances. even in their first appearances, the three main characters are very developed. <br /><br />i quite like this episode, although overall i prefer the mickey mouse in the future. i like the animation, the steamboat and music theme, the clever gags - and of course, mickey and minnie! <br /><br />like many early cartoons, this is very random, walt came up with a very basic plot and just added gags to "gear" it along. there is also a parrot side character who is very annoying and rather unnecessary. these are the things i do not like about it. <br /><br />another interesting thing about this episode, that a colour version has not been made for it (or if it has, i've never heard about it)! <br /><br />anyone who just enjoys mickey mouse and disney will enjoy this.
