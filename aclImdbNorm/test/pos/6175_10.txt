i was "turned on" to this movie by my flight instructor and now i wonder how the heck it was out there for nearly five years before i finally discovered it. if you have any love of flying at all, especially an attachment to the planes of wwii, this is an absolute must see, vastly superior to the pathetic "pearl harbor" and up there in rivalry with the famed "battle of britain" filmed more than thirty years ago. there are moments when you feel as if you are flying wingman, literally dodging the shell casings of your leader as you roll in on a me 109 or he 111. <br /><br />as an historian this film deeply touched me as well for it is about the plight endured by tens of thousands of gallant poles, hungarians, slovaks and czechs who in 1939-1940 fled their homelands, made it to england, fought with utmost bravery for the survival of western civilization, and then were so callously abandoned by "us" after the war when they were arrested by the communists upon their return to their native lands. i have stood atop monte cassino in italy and was moved to tears by the cemetery for the polish troops that stormed that mountain that british and americans could not take. i have traveled as well to prague (the most beautiful of cities) and studied their history. their story of abandonment, i believe, should be a lesson to us even today about obligations to gallant allies. <br /><br />but back to the film. if you love flying, see this. if you are interested in the aircraft of wwii most definitely see it. without doubt the most brutal, direct, and frightfully swift air combat scenes ever replicated for film. and yes, if you even are seeking a touching romance, there is that as well in heartbreaking detail.<br /><br />bill forstchen professor of history co-owner of a wwii replica "warbird" p-51 mustang "gloria ann"
