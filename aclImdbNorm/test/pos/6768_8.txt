of adam's apple and with your permission. i didn't know until looking it up just now. also the errrrrrmmmmm 'wilbur wants to kill himself' i prefer this very focused deadpan ...drama over adam's apple's over the top comedic zeal. but with your permission is much more layered and subtle, but that's another director.<br /><br />once the 'meaty' part of the story takes place i felt the dread of coming back to the shop again and again. a bit claustrophobic .. maybe that is intentional. it builds on the atmosphere. you dread the rediscovery and again and again until the 'kick in the shin'.<br /><br />this is some funny stuff.
