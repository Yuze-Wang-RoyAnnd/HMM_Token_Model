what a crazy film!it lasts 12(!) hours and you don't understand who these people are and what are they doing!the main plot is about a bunch of clueless actors trying to bring on scene "prometheus",but there are lots of sub-plots,like the disappearing of thomas and a crazy guy looking for monsieur warok....what's the meaning of all this???
