in 1965 producer kevin mclory -who owns a part of the bond cinematic rights- associate with eon productions (harry saltzman and albert broccoli) for making "thunderball", the fourth film of the 007 franchise. the star is sean connery, of course.<br /><br />in 1982 mclory wins a legal battle and can produce an "independent" bond film. "never say never again" (nsna) is one of the two "unofficial" 007 films made outside eon (the other is the 1967 comedy spoof "casino royale"). nsna is a remake of "thunderball" and stars the original bond, sean connery -who comes back to the role after many years of absence.<br /><br />the film is released some months after "octopussy" with roger moore, the 13th episode of the eon series. at the time press calls it "war of the bonds"... both films are a big success in 1983, even if "octopussy" earns more money at the box office.<br /><br />nsna is a luxurious film made by excellent technicians -director irvin kershner who led "the empire strikes back", douglas slocombe -cinematographer of "raiders of the lost ark"-, and screenwriter lorenzo semple jr -who wrote "the three days of the condor"- among others...<br /><br />the cast is excellent with connery, a then relatively unknown kim basinger, barbara carrera, klaus maria brandauer, max von sydow, edward fox...<br /><br />although all that the film remains inferior to the original "thunderball". it lacks many fundamental ingredients for being a real bond movie: there's not the traditional gun barrel sequence, there's not the "james bond theme", m and q are not played by the traditional actors... it's a copyright reason: eon only is allowed to use these elements. briefly, nsna lacks the classic cinematic 007 atmosphere.<br /><br />on the other hand the film is exciting and enjoyable. brandauer is a very good villain and the women (basinger and carrera) are sensual and gorgeous. but the main highlight is sean connery! he's once again wonderful in the role, he's older but looks fitter and nicer here than in "diamonds are forever", his last performance in the role of the british super-spy before nsna.
