a lot of the comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie, but i feel this is only secondary. it's really about living in japan, and it really succeeds.<br /><br />i spent a few years living in japan, and i suppose the reason that this movie didn't do too well is that you sort of have to have experienced japan to get it. i was watching this with a well-travelled friend who's never been to japan, and he noted that many of the events in the movie were so ludicrous that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief. my reply was that those events were the absolute unvarnished truth about life in japan!<br /><br />i think that this movie is definitely worth watching, especially if you've lived in japan or are interested in it.
