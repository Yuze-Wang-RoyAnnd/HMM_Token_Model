i agree that this is one of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of mark lenard as the romulan commander. my reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know mr. lenard as sarek, spock's father. and for the 2nd generation trekkie (or trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all. there are excellent points made by both sides about the cost of war vs.the price of peace and certainly does remind one of some of the best of the wwii and later era movies. those are not my favorite genre but i certainly would recommend a fan of such to view this episode through that filter. you'll see it holds up. i'll never understand why sci-fi gets so little respect--the best drama comes out of placing ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.
