this film is not at all as bad as some people on here are saying. i think it has got a decent horror plot and the acting seem normal to me. people are way over-exagerating what was wrong with this. it is simply classic horror, the type without a plot that we have to think about forever and forever. we can just sit back, relax, and be scared.
