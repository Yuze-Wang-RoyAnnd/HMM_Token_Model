ponyo is a beautiful animated film with some dark undertones. it features a kid-sized story of longing and love with ecological implications, but it is not preachy. hayao miyazaki has fused andersen's little mermaid with japan's native myths and his trademark steam punk flights of fancy, and the result is very rewarding. there are some scary moments of oceanside storms and flooding, but they are thrilling, not horrific.<br /><br />if you've ever wanted to run with the waves along the shore, ride on a jellyfish as an elevator, completely transform yourself, or make a friend for life, ponyo is a fable for you.
