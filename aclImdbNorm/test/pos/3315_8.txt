i watched the first few moments on tcm a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. i saw it listed on the schedule at the stanford theatre in palo alto, and i vowed i would make the 40 minute drive. the stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut yes, they have curtains. they opened as the fox logo fanfare began to play. when "the best of everything" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the new york city skyline, i knew i was right for waiting.<br /><br />i lapped this movie up. there were so many little moments that added to the look and feel of the movie: when hope lange walks into the publishing office for the first time, the titles of the magazines published there are etched on the glass (the teenager and elegance); joan crawford's swanky apron that she wore so she could serve her guests at her party without mussing her outfit; the way the camera tilted to indicate how crazy suzy parker was becoming (it was almost sideways at one point); how hope lange kept living at that dumpy flat she shared with the others even though she obviously was making a lot more money than at the beginning of the film (guess it was too scandalous for a single gal to live alone).<br /><br />hope lange was so beautiful; so was suzy parker. and how about mark goddard in a non-speaking role. i fell in love with him when i was a kid watching lost in space.<br /><br />seeing this gem on the big screen prompted me to plan another trek down to the stanford to see the old dark house. incidentally, i bought a small soda and popcorn at the concession stand, and i was taken aback when the worker asked me for two bucks.
