...there was "broadcast news," and what a good thing it was. this one just plain stands up and sounds its barbaric yawp in a manner that resonates two decades later.<br /><br />there are moments -- especially with respect to the cutesy score -- when this film becomes a bit too eighties, or a bit too "sleepless in seattle." fortunately, they're few and far between.<br /><br />one-third social satire, one-third romantic comedy, one-third drama, with three flawed but endearing people at its core, it's smart and moving and almost impossibly funny. holly hunter in particular may never have been more fun to watch in a comedic role. (and yes, i'm including "raising arizona," her other star turn from that era, in this assessment.)<br /><br />a legitimate classic.
