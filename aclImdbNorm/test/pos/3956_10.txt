i had the chance to watch blind spot in barcelona and i enjoyed it tremendously. i thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that i'd seen for a long time. one of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. the three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. they are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the dop's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time. the mood of the desert floods everywhere and even the scenes filmed in the streets of los angeles or san francisaco seem to be a natural extension of it. the story rides you smoothly through all these beautiful settings to lead you to a bitter-sweet ending, being the perfect climax for this perfect journey. the construction of the film itself is a master craft. the skilled use of innovative resources (like stills stitching danny's memories into the film) will compare to those hand-made pieces of work so rare and so enjoyable. blind spot achieves to capture the essence of the desert taking you to an universal common ground where anyone of us can feel being both discoverer and native.
