this movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. this movie was great because it took the serious robin hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. i first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. this movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, "by order of the kings financial secretary h and r blockhead?"<br /><br />everyone needs a little cary elwes(robin hood)in life, whether or not its liar liar with the "claw" or saw. <br /><br />this movie is worth watching
