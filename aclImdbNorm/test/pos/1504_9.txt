this is an interesting movie. i think it's very humorous, although the humor is very black. fulci is good and funny acting himself, it's a really funny and truly crazy "self-portrait" of an artist ("i make horror films. if i would make love films, no-one would buy tickets..."). and it's really sexy movie also: almost all the time there is some "action" or tension going on; and many sexy girls/women... maybe it goes to the core of why anyone starts to do movies/art in the first place... it's a real psychedelic trip, maybe best seen a little drunk or some similar state of mind. there is some really nasty gore scenes also, of course, because it's lucio fulci. as a matter of fact some of those scenes are quite disgusting. anyway it's one of the three best and most complete fulci films i've seen (the others are house by the cemetery & zombi.haven't seen the beyond). actually, the script is overally, to my opinion, quite ingenious. you could see this movie as a portrait of an extreme neurotic, or a person who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder (fashionable words): the character has a compulsive need to confess "crimes" or bad thoughts; especially crimes he hasn't even done. and he questions himself all the time: what if i have done it? what if i want to do it? have i done it? do i want to do it? he overreacts and exaggerates his thoughts. i'm sure fulci has been interested of psychology, and maybe even read something of the area; in his "house by the cemetery"-movie for example there is a character named freudstein. this is maybe the most concentrated and straightly personal movie fulci did. i also like the simplicity of the photography/pictures in this film. only thing that disturbs me a little bit is the sadism, especially towards women; i don't quite understand why? is it entertainment? is it art? is it horror? anyways and overall, this is really interesting and well made movie, definitely recommended classic film at least for fans or anyone interested of this genre. for the others it may be too much.
