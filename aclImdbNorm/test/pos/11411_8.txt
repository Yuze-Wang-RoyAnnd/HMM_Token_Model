the movie is about a girl who's not going to a bonfire only because she's baby-sitting that night. nothing weird about that, right? until ... the phone rings. until ... the phone rings again. and again ... and again. those are not some stupid prank calls. this is for real. if you wanna see how the girl reacts, just watch the movie.<br /><br />great atmosphere filled with scary sounds. very well performed by young camilla belle who got the lead role. i see in her some great potential to become a good actress. this is more than only a decent thriller, i have no idea why it's so underrated. anyway, on my opinion this movie deserves more than only 4/10. 24% of all voters rated the movie with 1. get serious, people. you couldn't get a better thriller for a title like this.
