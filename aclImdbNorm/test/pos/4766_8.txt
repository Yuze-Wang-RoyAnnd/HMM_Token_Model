one of my favorites. as a child, growing up in the ny metro area in the late 60s and early 70s, i was often afforded the opportunity to visit nyc with my grandfather or father, as they conducted business there. the gritty, bustling, human, reality of that city, particularly in winter, have stayed with me. <br /><br />this film very aptly captures the stark, cold, matter-of-fact feel of the nyc winter season, while keenly exposing the underbelly of the region's infamous underworld of crime and policing. a great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture. <br /><br />and the car chase is simply amazing. at least on par with the one in "bullitt", and surpassing the chase in "the french connection". i can watch, time and again, as the suspension comes unstuck on that plymouth fury police cruiser barreling toward the gw bridge in pursuit, as it lurches into that sharp right curve, bouncing and scraping into oncoming traffic. the stunt driving coordinator for that scene did "bullitt" and "the french connection" as well as many other noatable movie chases. good acting, too, and a decent plot line. the musical score is edgy and compelling, and the cinematography and direction are top notch. a great, if underrated 1970s cop drama. a keeper. not out on dvd yet, though.<br /><br />comparable in style and content to: the french connection and super fly. early 1970's cop dramas set in the bleak nyc winter months.
