a very funny look at some of australia's current affairs and political goings-on. the chaser boys really seem to have fun with this show, and what i enjoy is that they all have their strengths; some are brilliant (chas) at making complete idiots of themselves, whereas julian can pull off the whole "i'm interviewing a famous politician and i'm about to suggest that he disguise himself as a pot of jam" type of humour.<br /><br />they have great segments in the show taking the mick out of all sorts of aspects of australian culture such as our current affairs shows, our adverts and early morning tv programmes. some material is a bit tired and predictable, but overall it's a lot of fun to watch, and will leave you with a smile on your face.
