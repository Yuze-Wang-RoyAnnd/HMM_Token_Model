first of all, this is an art film and a good one at that. i loved the presentation and way it was shot. very cool. certain scenes were some of the more graphic horror sequences i've ever seen. this film did scare me, not because of suspense or shock, but because i was deathly afraid that i'd soon see something really appalling. that did happen in a few places, but mostly at the beginning. this film also dragged and the 74 minutes seemed long. however, if you're into film you have to see this. to date, i've seen nothing like it. 8/10
