many people are making fun out of steven seagals acting abilities. and i really see why if i remember fire down below. well...ok his other films are acceptable (regarding to his acting!). <br /><br />after reading reviews about the patriot i didn't expect anything from this film. i barely came through fire down below and i read a lot that the patriot was even worse. so i was really surprised about this one. in my opinion it is one of his very best movies. if it had have more action sequences and a couple more fighting scenes it would be the best. i liked the story the directing and the actors. cammilla belle was just incredible. she will have a great movie-career in the future. the few action scenes were very well made. and steven seagal was very believable in his unusual role.
