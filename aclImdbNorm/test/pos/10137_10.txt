excuse me!!! helloooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!! cuba gooding,jr. should have won an oscar for his portrayal in this film!!! he was the film! while the film may be lacking in some areas, cuba was awesome... and for me, this is the best role that he has ever played! the scene in the movie where he finds out that his mother has died made me break down and cry in the theater!! i guess i could really relate to this film because i saw the same treatment of people just like that at my own school growing up... what a tragedy! getting to see the "real" radio and coach at the end of the movie was really special too! if you can watch this movie and not be moved to tears, you need a heart check! if you liked "simon birch" and "the mighty", you'll love "radio" too! i wish they made more movies like this...radio is the real deal!
