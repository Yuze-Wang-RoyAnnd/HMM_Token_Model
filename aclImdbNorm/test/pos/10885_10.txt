ever since i first played it in 1998, goldeneye has been one of my favourite video games. in fact, i recently bought an n64 purely so that i could own it and play it more often! the game is pretty much near-perfect: the single-player mode does a fantastic job of immersing yourself in bond's shoes, with varied mission objectives, convincing weapons, and great level design. even though the enemies' artificial intelligence is pretty basic by today's standards, that only adds to goldeneye's appeal. the method of obtaining cheats (completing levels within a strict time limit) was also innovative when the title was released, and even now i still haven't cracked some of them!<br /><br />the game comes with a wonderful multiplayer mode for up to four players, and while this isn't as advanced as the combat simulator in the game's sequel "perfect dark", it is still incredibly satisfying to blast your opponents to smithereens with a barrage of rc-p90 fire! ;-)
