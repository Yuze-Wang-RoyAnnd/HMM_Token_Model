the name "lucio fulci" congers up images of graphic death and mutilation in the minds of may fans. thanks to movies like "zombi 2", "city of the living dead", "the beyond" and "the new york ripper", fulci has a reputation for being one of the goriest directors in history. and although many of his later movies certainly justify his reputation until the release of "zombi 2" in 1979 fulci's films did not contain anywhere near the amount of blood and guts he's know for, in fact they were for the most part gore free, instead relying on more traditional shocks and disturbing imagery to work. "don't torture a duckling" hardly contains any gore, yet ranks as his best.<br /><br />"don't torture a duckling" is set in a small sicilian town where superstition rules instead of logic. the townsfolk are very distrustful of outsiders as well as anyone different, often shunning them. after a series of child murders though many people descend upon the town, including andrea martelli (thomas milan) who tries to uncover the truth about the murders while they continue to happen.<br /><br />this is a remarkable film. it's very well made with an excellent cast filled with many favorites of italian exploitation cinema. it also contains a solid score as well as many creative camera movement courtesy or lucio fulci. but the real draw of "don't torture a duckling" is the disturbing nature of the movie. little kids, around twelve years old are shown mocking retarded people, visiting prostitutes and being propositioned sex by an older woman. it also contains some very biting commentary on the middle class and the catholic church. it is for reasons like this that "don't torture a duckling" was blacklisted throughout europe when it was first released and never was shown in the united states. still, "don't torture a duckling" stands as a monumental achievement in giallo cinema as well as lucio fulci's best work. i really can't recommend this one enough, check it out.
