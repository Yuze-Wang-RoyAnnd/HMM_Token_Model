combining the conventions of both western and gothic horror, and often directed as if it were an art movie, this is one of siegel and eastwood's best collaborations. <br /><br />eastwood plays a yankee soldier who, after being wounded during the civil war, takes refuge in an isolated southern seminary for young women. shut away from the world, the women project their romantic fantasies on to him, and he responds with callous, male manipulation. but jealousy and resentment raise their heads, and he finds himself in a world of brutal revenge. and boy is the revenge brutal.<br /><br />beautifully shot by bruce surtees, and carefully paced, "the beguiled" is a haunting, elegant work that seems to have influenced the troubled sexuality of eastwood's own "play misty for me" and "tightrope". <br /><br />the film is a gripping depiction of a fierce battle of the sexes and oozes a dreamlike mix of horror and sexuality. all the characters are ambiguous, displaying traits of both good and evil, leaving it up to us to choose whom we should root for.<br /><br />don siegel left quite a legacy of fine films behind. everything from "invation of the body snatchers" to "dirty harry". but though his early black and white pictures have aged well, the majority of his colour films seem grainy, dated and badly shot. his gritty "realism" must have seemed fresh and kinetic 40 years ago, but when viewed today, i just don't think they've stood the test of time.<br /><br />"the beguiled", however, is in a different league. mature, ambiguous and starkly shot, it's a shame it isn't more widely known. while evolving technology and technique have rendered the majority of siegel's tough, masculine action thrillers obsolete, "the beguiled" still entrances audiences today due to it's surreal atmosphere and unique subject matter.<br /><br />8.5/10 - better than the similarly themed "black narcissus", this is, in my opinion, siegel's best film. part horror, part drama, part sexual odyssey, "the beguiled" is a surprisingly arty film (especially when considering that siegel viewed his films to be, quote, 'meaningless'). a large part of the film's artistry is due to clint eastwood, who would, from this point onwards, make an effort to choose mature material.
