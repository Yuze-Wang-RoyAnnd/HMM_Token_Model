i watched this series after tipping the velvet, for which i gave 10/10 grade. i had read user comments on this and i expected an equally good series, or if possible, even better. at this point i must emphasize that this series is good, and it definitely captured me throughout it and thus worth watching. however, i didn't enjoy it as much as tipping the velvet, for the following reasons: <br /><br />1. less passion, love, and related sexual content. there were surprisingly little emphasis in these elements, which i held integral for a love story. fingersmith felt like a watered down version of tipping the velvet.<br /><br />2. similarly, as in tipping the velvet, the story had three parts: the beginning, a shocking second part, and the ending. the second part should have been the climax of the story (as in tipping the velvet), but instead it was almost totally skipped, perhaps due to inability to make shocking but believable asylum content. the series should have been in three parts, featuring two cliffhangers, with a lot more focus on the second part.<br /><br />3. almost no weight was given to what fingersmiths were and how it affected their personalities. i found it rather annoying that the series did not properly address such central topic. <br /><br />4. the ending was much more hasty than in tipping the velvet. fingersmith left several interesting plot lines open.<br /><br />despite these shortcomings, fingersmith is a good series, and well worth 7/10. however, it is not a classic like tipping the velvet.
