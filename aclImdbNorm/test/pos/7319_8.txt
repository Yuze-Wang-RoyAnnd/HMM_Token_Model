though not a huge fan, i am a three stooges purist. i believe that their best work, by far, was with curly as the third stooge and their earliest films are generally their best. that's because after a while, they began remaking their films and the gags started to get stale. here, in 1934, they were still rather fresh (in more ways than one) and funny.<br /><br />here they boys play very improbably roles--respected doctors in a hospital! the three run amok acting silly, hitting each other and scaring the pants off anyone who expects to get better. the non-stop energy and freshness make this one a must-see for fans.<br /><br />by the way, although i liked this film, i strongly recommend you try to find a much lesser known short from tiny educational pictures. nifty nurses is much like men in black but manages to be funnier and is about the best hospital comedy of the era--better even than laurel & hardy's county hospital.
