i happen to love this show. its a refreshing take on some older sci-fi feels and styles. they aren't afraid to shoot, and when they do people tend to die. far too many show's are afraid of this and end up just pointing the guns and then having it be a standoff. farscape also comes complete with a large amount of heartwarming characters. they all grow on you till the point where it confuses you to hear them discuss taking some of the animatronic ones out of their box's to make the mini-series. from beginning to end farscape leaves you with a feeling of hope, and dispair, as new and unexpected things happen and then people live and die, surprising you every time. worth a watch even if you don't have the time.
