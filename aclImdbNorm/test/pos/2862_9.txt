honestly, when i went to see this movie at the rave theater in plainfield indiana, i did not expect much. i went to this movie only because i figured hey, it's a wwe movie it'll be good for a laugh. then i sat down and watched it and saw why they chose glen jacobs (kane) to play jacob goodnight. he is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than freddy or jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie. it shows jacob goodnight as someone who is human. he has a heart, no matter how twisted and creepy it is. he feels pain, something that jason never does or appears to show. he feels sorrow and pleasure, though again both of them insane which you will notice if you see the movie. all in all, a different experience in my opinion than many slashers, and it surprised me in a few ways, as in who lived in the end.
