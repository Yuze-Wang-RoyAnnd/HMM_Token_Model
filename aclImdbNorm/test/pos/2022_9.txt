i watched this movie the other night, and i have to admit, it was quite possibly the best film of this generation. turns out i wasn't born until 1988, but i can relate to this motion picture like cary grant can relate to having an std, or burt reynolds to being a burnout. marky mark did not decline in awesomeness after his brief stint in new kids on the block, which i will from here on refer to as "the best band in the world (aka bbw). like, it's totally a morality tale about fargin' trannies an' poop, so pay attention! i love all y'all, and continue to support marky msrk because he needs us now more than ever. he's the only boyee who survived the de-sharted.
