julie andrews plays a german spy who falls in love with an american pilot rock hudson, while on an assignment for germany.<br /><br />the songs are beautiful. the two are well-paired. julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays. <br /><br />a half-german, half-english girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in ww i, julie sings some endearing mancini songs. <br /><br />i loved the film. some will say it's a "chick-flick," but so what. it's wonderful. <br /><br />supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped. it may not be up to rock's performance in pillow talk, magnificent obsession, or giant.<br /><br />blake edwards shot the film in ireland and authentic ww i -type planes were used in the film. scenery for england and france is absolutely gorgeous.
