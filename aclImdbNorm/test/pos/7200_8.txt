after i read that ''at the time of its release in 2002, its budget of $47 million, or 327,000,000 frf, was said to make it the costliest french film ever. however, ast'erix et ob'elix contre c'esar (1999) had a budget of $48 million, or 274,620,000 frf, which supposedly made it the most expensive french film ever'' i discovered the reason why i found this movie to be one of the most beautiful and colorful of all i have ever seen. i loved the scenarios,the clothes(specially the ones from cleopatra) and the atmosphere of the movie! it's so happy and cheerful! i found the jokes smart and hilarious and i have to consider this movie to be in my favorite comedies of all times!<br /><br />the cast is also excellent, with monica bellucci(who is very beautiful as cleopatra)g'erard depardieu,(great obelix!!christian clavier, jamel debbouze(that i saw for the first time in ''am'elie poulain'') among others!:)<br /><br />i recommend this movie even for people who doesn't know asterix and obelix comics. you are going to have a great amount of fun!:)<br /><br />aka "asterix e obelix: miss~ao cle'opatra" - brazil
