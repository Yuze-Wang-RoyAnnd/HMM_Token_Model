in wwii, america has developed a brand-new huge bomber plane. lois lane and clark kent go to cover the story when the plane is going on its first mission. lois stows away on the plane before it takes off. there are also some japanese saboteurs on board who have every intention of flying the bomber to tokyo. will lois be able to warn superman? what do you think?<br /><br />fast-moving, colorful cartoon. the animation is a little jerky but much better than anything we see today. the color and sound have been beautifully restored. just two problems--the lousy music score and the racism (especially in the title). that aside this is pretty good. an 8.
