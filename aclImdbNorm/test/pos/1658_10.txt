to start with, i have done some further research on the film. firslty, jules dassin directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different film noir crime film. secondly, this was a very low budget film, created in the rennaissance of the prime moment of film noir. thirdly, the jewelers where the robbery was attempted is an actual jewelers. the producers of rififi asked them to film their, surprisingly, (i quote jules dassin in a recent interview on the subject, "surprisingly, for some not very obvious reason, they were delighted at the idea of a crime film being set in their shop). <br /><br />it's impeccable characters and plot fit in so beautifully with their surroundings. to add on to my praise i will say this; some might say that this was a typical hollywood film, on the contrary, this set the base for the regular plot of a hollywood crime film. <br /><br />laslty, i would like to say that i support this fresh idea of a film where not only one side wins, and that side doesn't always have to be the good one. for once, i can say that a film is not predictable! ten stars!
