francis ford coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married woman's flight from her husband--and the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger years are behind her. we learn little about this woman's marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late; she's also recently learned she's pregnant, which has further complicated her heart (she doesn't want to be a complacent wifey, despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone). she meets two men on her journey: a former college football hero who--after an accident during a game--has been left with permanent brain damage, and a sexy, strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life. the clear, clean landscapes (as photographed by the very talented wilmer butler) are astutely realized, as are the characters. shirley knight, james caan, and robert duvall each deliver strong, gripping performances, most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms. some scenes (such as knight's first call home from a pay-phone, or her first night alone with caan where they play 'simon says') are almost too intimate to watch. coppola toys with reality, turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we've been made privy to. he allows scenes to play out, yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy (there are at least two or three very frisky moments). it's a heady endeavor--so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later. some may shun coppola's unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony, however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings. *** from ****
