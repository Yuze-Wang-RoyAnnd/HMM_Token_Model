came across this film recently after so long hearing about it. it is an excellent not pretentious movie for people who loves film noir literature and films. not "camp" but humorous. <br /><br />great cast! from the magnificent carla gugino and emma thompson to german superstar til schweiger, this movie is a feast for the eyes. alan rickman is very funny as the antagonist of gang. would love to see spin off movie with this character and emma thompson solving cases and arguments between them all the time (much like tracy and hepburn, etc.)<br /><br />intelligent story, nice twists and scope photography (don't watch unless it is scope because compositions are very rich).<br /><br />sexy sexy sexy and very fun time.<br /><br />best use of just like heaven by the cure ever (must see to believe!)<br /><br />********
