i tend to fall in and out of love with anime, as the more you watch the more you notice a lot of shows are just poor copies of the few gems or rehashes of old formulas. but every once in a while one of the true gems comes along and it's originality just blows you away. haruhi is truly one of those shows. many anime series are originally manga and sometimes the translation into an animated show is rather poorly done and doesn't utilize the benefits animation has over static drawings. haruhi is actually based on a series of light novels and fires on all cylinders, beautiful animation, great voice acting, great music and a complete and well paced story. watch it you won't be disappointed, and i'd suggest watching it in broadcast order it works so much better that way.
