fbi agents mulder and scully get assigned to probe the mystery of what happened to an arctic drilling team, in this early 'x-files' episode that david duchovny himself considers one of their first "rockin'" episodes. it pays loving homage to the much lauded john carpenter 1982 theatrical feature "the thing", and one can see the similarities. visually, color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a hellish quality. production design / art direction are especially impressive; the shots of the exterior of the arctic camp are so reminiscent of the earlier film as to automatically create feelings of deja vu for some viewers. naturally, our heroes are threatened by the weather, so the sound design, involving wind, evokes memories of "the thing".<br /><br />the culprit is an ancient worm that had been exposed to the team; once inside a host, it stimulates aggressive behavior. this allows the paranoia aspect to take full hold, and the way the script is set up we can't be too sure of who's infected and who's not. this gives rise to the inevitable scene of testing. this episode certainly works at portraying the way that tensions can cause breakdowns in groups. it even allows mulder and scully to have moments where they're not sure if they can trust each other.<br /><br />guest starring are a good small group of actors: xander berkeley, felicity huffman, and steve hytner as the scientists obliged to accompany mulder and scully on the mission, and jeff kober as the pilot who takes them to the camp. you can also see one time jason voorhees portrayer ken kirzinger as one of the ill-fated original team members.<br /><br />incidentally, there's one direct link between 'ice' and "the thing": art director graeme murray, who worked on both projects.<br /><br />8/10
