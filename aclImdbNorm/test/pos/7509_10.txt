this movie is george c. scott at his very best, bernard hughes at his very best and diana rigg at her most pithy, and of course paddy chaevsky writing at "masterpiece" warp! there are also very brief snippets of future biggies like susan sarandon, stockard channing etc., who have one scene lines that you don't necessarily spot until your fifth or sixth time watching. nancy marchand as a young to middle age nurse supervisor is also superb, as well as practically every "face" in hollywood of 1970.<br /><br />it is one of the few movies that gets better the more times you see it. watch for the "surprise" scene ala "wait until dark"! this is one of the few movies i have ever bought on dvd. it is that superb.
