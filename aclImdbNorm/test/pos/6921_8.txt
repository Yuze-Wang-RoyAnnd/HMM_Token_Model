tell you what that was excellent. dylan moran is simply the funniest actor on screen( and on stage) and with micheal caine as your partner ain't to bad either, both are great to watch in a really funny film. true, not all the gags come off but its worth sticking around for the ones that do, but come on its got micheal caine in a dress in it( the whole admission fees worth that) and every time dylan moran's on screen its more like bernard blacks movie. the story is two actors(moran and caine) who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters by acting out different persona's to fool them all but getting away with it's a different matter. basically "the actors" is a great british comedy that was somehow missed by many, seriously if your a moran fan(or want to see micheal caine in a dress) definitely see this
