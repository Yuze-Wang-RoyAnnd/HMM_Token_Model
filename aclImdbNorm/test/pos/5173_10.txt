my santa lucia choir was chosen to be in this movie. all 100 plus. when it came time to film the movie i was asked to chose just 10. oh my goodness. we had a little gal who went early to have her tonsils out because she wanted to be in the movie. the choices were hard to make. the people of georgetown are just a lovely as the people that they show in the movie. gracious, kind, believers. the town sponsors an annual christmas market the first two weekend in december every year. i was there this year and it was wonderful. the town is lovely and the people work hard to make it magical. the town appears today as it did when the movie was made. much credit goes to the historical society there that work hard to maintain the historical value. the principal of the school that has been turned into a charter school was given an award by the governor of colorado for volunteers.
