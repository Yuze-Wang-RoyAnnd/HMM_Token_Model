my entire family enjoyed this film, including 2 small children. great values without sex, violence, drugs, nudity, or profanity. also no zillion dollar special effects were added to try to misdirect viewers from a poorly written storyline. a simple little family fun movie. we especially like the songs in the movie. but we only got to hear a portion of the songs ... mostly during the end credits... would love to buy a sound track cd from this movie. this is my 4th bill hillman movie and they all have the same guidelines as mentioned above. with all the movies out there that you don't want your kids to watch, this hillman fella has a no risk rating. we love his movies.
