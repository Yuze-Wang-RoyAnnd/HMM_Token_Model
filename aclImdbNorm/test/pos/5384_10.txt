bwana devil is reputedly the first major studio, full length feature filmed entirely in the 3d process. supposedly producer oboler went to africa to shoot a different movie, but after hearing the tale of two man-eating lions, terrorizing railway builders, decided on this one. it's a good story too, almost hemmingway-like; fear, redemption, the great white hunter and all. it's the telling of the story that seems to drag, almost as though filming in the new process was too weighty for the crew. the action scenes are stiff, almost too staged. but these technical problems appear small in light of the film's dramatic conclusion.
