this has to be one of my 3 favorite episodes from the original tv series.<br /><br />what makes it great is the battle of wits between the romulan commander and kirk, as well as the top-notch acting from mark lenard, who later went on to play spock's father in other tv episodes and movies. this is a case where those around rose to the level of the talent around them, and shatner, nimoy, and the whole cast deliver an outstanding performance in this episode.<br /><br />the writing and plot are also excellent, and i love the direct approach used to show us the characters, and the feelings and thoughts of those characters, and how freely they are expressed by the actors. <br /><br />this very entertaining episode ranks 10 out of 10. awesome!! desert-buddha
