wolfgang petersen (das boot, air force one) gives us an exciting film where the accolades go to the supporting actor, john malkovich. his criminal attempting to assassinate the president was first-rate and credible.<br /><br />that is not to diminish the efforts of clint eastwood and rene russo, or even fred dalton thompson, who plays a real jerk of a white house chief of staff. eastwood was great, and i love any film that russo is in.<br /><br />the movie feature original music by five time oscar winner (mal`ena, bugsy, the untouchables, the mission, days of heaven) ennio morricone. that alone makes it worth your time.
