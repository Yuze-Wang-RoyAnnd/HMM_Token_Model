a short review without any spoilers follows.<br /><br />i saw this movie yesterday at the cannes film festival. my initial reaction is one of wonder and happiness. i'm so happy films like this are being made in our age of blockbusters. <br /><br />roy andersson's new movie "you, the living" is nothing less than a complete masterpiece. you, the living is composed by some 50 vignettes filmed with a static camera. i will not give away the content of the scenes here, because i hate when people spoil even the smallest details. but, yes, most of the scenes made the 1000 people in the claude debussy theatre absolutely baffled and amazed. when the film was over we applauded for several minutes, we had no other choice.<br /><br />so what's the score with "you, the living". hm, andersson isn't afraid to take on the heavy questions; history, guilt, gand the holocaust during ww2 are big subjects (and these themes work very well together).<br /><br />the images created are brilliant, the depth sometimes surpasses "songs from the second floor". <br /><br />well, sorry for this ranting, praising review. look out for the flying house in the beginning folks!<br /><br />10/10 stars - a masterpiece (i never throw this grade out).
