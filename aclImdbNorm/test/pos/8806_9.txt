human traffic is a view into an average weekend for a group of friends, it is a fly-on-the-wall view into their lives (and minds) which will show you how this group of friends relate to each other. there are many moments in that every one can relate to, like being out of you skull at parties and talking complete rubbish to strangers. the characters are all people that you can relate to and they are believable in the roles that they play in the movie. the situations that they are in are all situations that we all have found ourselves in, and that is where this film succeeds. the topics of sex and drugs are handled superbly as to no get in the way of the characters relationships with each other. the story to the film is not all that, but that is not a criticism. this is a film about people. this is a well written film, with a sound track to die for. d.j's pete tong has put together an superb selection of tracks for this file which all goes to make this one of the best films that i have seen in 1999. after watching this film i felt like i had been out partying all weekend. fantastic movie! jo brand as the voice of reality - need i say more!<br /><br />
