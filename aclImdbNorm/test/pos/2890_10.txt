rush in rio is simply an amazing dvd. this concert is one of the peak moments of the history of rush and they deliver their music brilliantly and with more power than ever.<br /><br />i was lucky enough to actually be in this concert, and not only that, i was in the very first row grabbing the gate that separated the audience from the stage!! it's the first and only time i've seen a rush concert live and it was a dream come true for me. i have no words to accurately describe this experience but i can tell you it is one of the highlights of my life.<br /><br />some people complain about the sound of this dvd saying it is not very clear and polished, but the sound you listen is real, true to how it was in the concert. it is raw and powerful and so authentic that every time i watch it i go back and re-live that beautiful moment. many artists record live shows and then they make a lot of tweaking, so the final product is far from what the actual concert really was. sure you can achieve a very sophisticated and polished sound this way but you don't get the real thing. this is not the case with rush in rio, this is the real deal!! i admit that i enjoy those fancy sounding concert dvd's, i love music and the sound is a very important aspect, but it's refreshing to listen to a concert that is so honest. you listen to rush just the way they sound in a live performance, no tricks, no tweaks. this is a real live concert dvd.<br /><br />i highly recommend rush in rio, the set-list is fantastic and the performances by geddy, alex and neil are mind-blowing. not to mention the crowd, you can see how much they love rush and sing along to every tune, even yyz which is an instrumental!! i actually appear singing twice; in tom sawyer i sing "always hopeful yet discontent" and in earthshine i sing "only reflect". it's just a few seconds but i simply couldn't believe my eyes when i saw myself in a rush dvd!! awesome!! i hope you enjoy this magnificent concert from the greatest band on earth.
