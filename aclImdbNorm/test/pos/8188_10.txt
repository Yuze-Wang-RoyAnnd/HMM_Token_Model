this movie is beautiful in many ways: the plot, the depth of the characters, the stunning photography and acting, the kolossal-like scenes of battles (no computer graphics here, just thousands of people). someone said the story has something to do with the sheakespearian tragedies. i find some connections with the greek tragedy tradition, too.<br /><br />the emperor, extraordinarily acted, struggles between power and love, but he is forced (for the greater good, for the will of his ancestors) to choose the power (and the loneliness, the hate of his subjects and kins) as his destiny. he, like creon in antigone, was a good guy before becoming emperor. once gained power, he has to be merciless and cruel (with innocent children, his mother, his father, etc.) to defend and expand the empire. entrapped by power he becomes a monster. overall, the qin emperor is a majestic greek tragedy figure.<br /><br />the assassin evolves towards a different direction: from pure evil to heroism and morality. even this character is forced towards his destiny by love and by his new ethics. this character is really unforgettable, too.<br /><br />lady zhao, a wonderful gong li, is the uncorrupted morality, nor by power or love or hate. she is morality against power, somehow like antigone. her conspiracies (for and against the emperor) have always a moral rationale.<br /><br />in conclusion, a wonderful movie. if you love cinema and you want to try chinese movies you can start here.
