this movie would had worked much better if this was the first critters movie, this is a low-budget movie with only two (2) critters shown on-screen. why this looks like a fail is because this is the last critters movie and it's so low-budget that it seems the director made the whole movie with his own pocket money. however, i did like this movie, i compare it mostly with the third movie (which were bad). critters 4 have a more serious tone in it, the first half of the movie (even without seeing one critter yet) you have a scary feeling watching it, too bad they didn't "milk" out the critters, i mean even if they only had two (2) puppets they could still have used them on-screen a lot more. the critters also have different deaths in this movie which made this a little special, especially at the end with the frozen critter. ug has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie which took me by surprise. lastly i liked this one because it also has some kind of conclusion to the series, so at least we won't see a critters 5 anymore. oh, one last thing, i missed one scene in this movie, we never see a critter shoot a spike from its back, maybe these puppets didn't have that feature, but i was very disappointed not seeing that (in critters 3 we see a lot of spike shooting, which was the only good thing i liked about that movie).
