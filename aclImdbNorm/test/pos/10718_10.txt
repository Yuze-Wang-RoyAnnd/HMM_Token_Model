this is a phenomenal movie. truly one of the best movies i have ever watched. i am a serious critic and it takes much to stir me, but this movie had all the right combinations for "stirring". the passion of the actors,without the overacting, the aching for all the characters involved, the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce, all make this a must see movie, despite the fact that it is 1970s. this is definitely not an "old movie", but a classic/vintage movie. i hope you engage with it as i did when you consider how volatile relationships of all kinds can be, when you also consider how deep pain associated with love can be and how the hardest decisions to make will always be the most painful, but once they are made the pain will subside, but only gradually. this movie certainly demonstrates that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that leaving certainly is not synonymous with lost/lack of love. the 'crafting' of this movie certainly emanates from a place deep within someone's heart and mind.
