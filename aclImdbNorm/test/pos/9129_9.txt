just as in rififi, the most compelling scene in the movie is the perfected silence of the jewel heist. the scene is masterful in its execution, each of the robbers having their own specialized job to perform, each one successfully combining their own unique talent towards the objective, and each one, until a month before, complete strangers.<br /><br />many of the scenes play out very slowly. in fact, the opening scene is a long character introduction to both corey and vogel, as we see corey getting released from prison and vogel escaping capture on his way to prison. the two characters are then methodically brought together through fate at a roadside diner as vogel hides inside the trunk of corey's automobile. from this improbable break in, the two strangers agree to become partners to commit a perfected and precise jewel heist.<br /><br />however, to pull of this heist they must include the help of a third man named jansen. jansen is hired as the sure shot gun man. his inclusion into the mix was an interesting and desperate choice. at the time of his hire, jansen is in a full battle with dt's and spent most of his day on his cot hallucinating over lizards, snakes and spiders. his transition from the disheveled and hallucinatory world of a william s. burroughs dream into the steady handed and sober sharp shooter is a very quick one and perhaps the only real false moment of the film, but that's just me being extremely picky.<br /><br />one other mildly false note was that of the police inspector mattei. at times he appeared to be brilliant in the ways of strong arming the right people or gathering information and waiting out for his escaped prisoner to make his move. other times he appeared to be 10 years past retirement, especially at the beginning during vogel's escape through the woods.<br /><br />i wonder if i got too much hidden meaning from the beginning of the movie. at the start of the movie, as the police car is speeding through the city, the first image we see is that of a red stop light. my first thought was that this may be the 'red circle' and that if i am to find a deeper meaning in the movie, perhaps it is that this car, or rather the people inside of it going through the red light, will be the ones who will 'stop' the jewel heist. hmmmm? <br /><br />perhaps the red circle refers to the triumvirate thieving ring? perhaps it was the burning sled? no matter.<br /><br />it's a long movie, but it doesn't feel that way. the ending is a bit of a disappointment. it seemed too hurried for a movie that felt like such a delicious slow burn. 9/10<br /><br />clark richards
