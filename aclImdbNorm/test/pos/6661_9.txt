in cold mountain, north colorado, near to the period of the american civil war, the reverend monroe (donald sutherland) arrives in the small town with his daughter, the shy ada monroe (nicole kidman), due to health reasons. ada meets the also shy inman (jude law), and they fall in love with each other. with the beginning of the war, inman becomes a soldier, and his great support to stay alive is the wish to see ada in cold mountain again. meanwhile, ada meets ruby thewes (ren'ee zellweger), a survivor of the war, who helps her in the farm and becomes her best friend. the story alternates present and past situations, disclosing a beautiful romance. i liked this film a lot. having names such as philip seymour hoffman, natalie portman and giovanni ribisi in the supporting cast, a magnificent direction of anthony minghella and seven indications to the oscar, this movie does not disappoint. my remark is that there are some very important scenes deleted in the story and presented in the dvd. at least one of them, which show what happens with sara, her baby and the three dead bodies in her farm, should not be deleted as it was. my vote is nine.<br /><br />title (brazil): 'cold mountain'
