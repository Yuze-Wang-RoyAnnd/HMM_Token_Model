i went in to this thinking another gross movie with gross humor. telling from my first sentence i don't like that humor and this movie had it's moments but i loved it. justin long has really never done comedy like this, where he's sarcastic and clever and i loved it. lewis black....enough said. the ending i really did love because it had to take itself seriously i mean how else would you end it? yes it's another underdog story but not in your typical format and the movie wasn't their ups and downs, it was people coming together for one common goal, to go to college where they were accepted. the cast was amazing and yes i did laugh at loud when i didn't think i would and the laughter lasted longer then i thought to. the parents and sister played their roles well but their characters are put in when necessary. the movie was not focused around them but at the same time they showed up when you expect and not expect them to. they played in to the story very well, and i loved the familiar faces anthony heald(boston public), jeremy howard (i) (galaxy quest with justin long) ross patterson (the new guy)and sam horrigan (brink). blake lively added her certain something to the movie which made it even more enjoyable, as well as b's friends. i recommend this movie to whoever hated those gross comedies of the last 4 years and really want something with humor and an actually story line!~!
