my buddies and i spent the majority of a saturday afternoon watching a selection of "bad" movies. among the flicks we watched, the strongest contender (for quality bad-movie fare) was easily jack-o. it's ludicrous that movies such as "gigli", "glitter" and "you got served" are listed in imdbs bottom 100. while they're certainly bad movies, they don't belong in the bottom 100. they're robbing "jack-o", and "keeper of time", etc, of the bad movie greatness they so richly deserve.<br /><br />so what makes jack-o so great (in bad movie terms)? for starters, steve latshaw, the director, decided to cast his son, ryan latshaw, in the role of sean kelly. unfortunately for steve, ryan latshaw was dangerously close to being out-acted by a block of wood. the kid, seriously, has no ability to emote whatsoever. the end result: unintentional comic gold. the kid could be listening to a joke, or just moments away from getting his head smashed asunder, and his expression is one of stony "emotionlessness".<br /><br />the other aspect of the movie that we found awesome was the sheer number of "double dreaming" sequences. what is a double-dream? well, it's when a character wakes up from a nightmare, and then something equally nightmarish happens, and then the character wakes up again. basically: they wake up after dreaming about waking up from a nightmare. clever device, no? i believe the character of sean kelly experienced no less than 3 double-dreaming sequences.<br /><br />let's see... what else? oh yeah! this movie has a veritable cast of thousands. it's truly stunning to see how many speaking roles are introduced throughout the course of the movie. best of all: almost none of the characters have anything to do with the story. they're either killed by jack-o, or they serve no purpose whatsoever.<br /><br />jack-o himself was pretty sweet. like most other b-movie monsters, jack-o has the amazing ability to, seemingly, teleport over great distances. he's invariably hanging-out, somewhere in the background, whenever you're dealing with a major character. what's puzzling, however, is that when he's actually chasing someone he moves at a shambling/stumbling speed, and yet he's able to keep up with people who are sprinting.<br /><br />that's all for now. closing remarks: if you're looking for a unintentionally hilarious bad movie, you can't go wrong by renting this beast.<br /><br />bad movie score: 7/10 good movie score: 3.5/10
