not having seen the 1936 version of this story, i cannot offer any comparison there. i can, however, state that stephen sondheim's musical treatment of this story is absolutely genius. only sondheim could come up with music and lyrics that are stellar in their own right, yet perfectly suited to the very bizarre subject matter. if anyone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is, they should see this (and "dr. strangelove" as well). when mrs. lovett goes from having the "worst pies in london" to a booming business with high acclaim, we aren't talking "soylent green," - but the ingredients are similar. particularly brilliant is the song where mrs. lovett pitches her idea to mr. todd. even in the introductory number, the line "...they went to their maker impeccably shaved..." gives a great indication of the premise, the drama, and the comedy to come. outstanding!
