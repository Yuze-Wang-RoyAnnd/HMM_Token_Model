imagine spending the summer without your family or friends from school, and meeting new people. or yet, it's your first time where you're a nobody and the only person you can count on is somebody from camp. "meatballs" packs lots of comedy in this film. in camp, there's a eccentric counselor(bill murray) who knows how the boys and girls can have a good time. enter a kid named rudy(chris makepeace) who has no one to look up to. he doesn't fit in with anyone, only tripper can make him have fun. the rest of the can are just as crazy as tripper. camp northstar is an average camp with an above average team. one the other hand camp mohawk is an elite camp that has them running for their money. in the basketball game, the mohawks got pantsed! and in the olympiad the northstar teal got the revenge they needed when one of the members take out the saboteur. and morty(harvey atkin), this poor soul can never get himself in gear if he tried. a very, very funny comedy, and it's a big keeper i'll say. this movie shows that camp can be fun, if you wanted to be! 5 stars!
