after reading a biography on the last russian tzar (nicholas ii), and his failure to secure the army's support, i decided to give this film a try.<br /><br />i watched it with a completely open mind, not knowing anything about it (except its reputation).<br /><br />these are the things that impressed me the most.<br /><br />1) the shots of battleships, and the soldiers used as extras. more than once i stopped to think "if this was done in this time and place, 80% of this would have been computer-generated".<br /><br />2) the realism in it. from the maggot-infested meat to the shot of the sailor with his candle and the legend "killed for a bowl of soup", this movie makes no concessions to the pc cause (which, thankfully, hadn't been invented yet).<br /><br />3) the slow descent into madness of the odessa steps sequence. from the first shot, when the limbless man appears, you get the idea something might be wrong; since the overall shots are composed, though, you end up feeling comfortable in your surroundings. then an amputee appears, and people start falling in dramatic poses. still, the shots are composed... until the cossacks appear into scene, and the incredible shot juxtapositions appear. this scene is easily worth the price of admission.<br /><br />4) the fact that this movie is 100% unadulterated propaganda. then again, when rambo fought in afghanistan he also was having something to do with "propaganda"; only a different kind.<br /><br />overall: a film marred by a bit of a slow narrative. nevertheless, metropolis, the cabinet of dr. caligari and this movie are perfect examples of inventive, edgy movies that are still remembered for their merits today. they really make modern movies look boring and repetitive.
