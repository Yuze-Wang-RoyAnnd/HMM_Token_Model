river's edge is more than just the story of a murder. it's an indictment of the wave of apathy that has plagued pockets of youth for decades now. our main characters are a group of what my high school would have referred to as "stoners". one of them just decided to strangle his girlfriend because she apparently had the nerve to "talk sh*t" to him. this dangerous young man played by daniel roebuck has an intensity that will startle you. he takes the other kids in the group out to show them his girlfriend's body, and strangely enough, nobody seems really freaked out about it. the balance of the film punctuates the desperate circumstances in which these people live, and how guilt is eventually able to worm its way inside even these apathetic kids.<br /><br />river's edge is certainly not condoning or championing the behavior of its characters. we clearly see the dangers presented by such unchecked apathy and having only the desire to get drunk or high. we are shown the dysfunctional home lives these kids have, and perhaps this is meant to explain their awful behavior. but could it only be unstable homes that lead to this type of destructive living? crispin glover is his usual whacked-out self. he drives around town in a state of complete paranoia after the murder. he tries to sympathize with why his friend had to commit the crime, but clearly he does not understand what could have made the young man do it. dennis hopper plays an older man these kids get their dope from. though he is certainly a rebellious figure, he cannot relate to the apathy and rage of the younger generation. witness his confused reaction as roebuck describes how killing his girlfriend made him feel. as wild as hopper's character is, even he knows this young man should not be walking the face of the earth.<br /><br />what will you think of these kids? well, there is really no way to like their characters. some are less despicable than others, but you cannot help either hating or feeling sorry for them. twenty years later, there is still an apathy alive and well in a great many young people out there. when do these kids get lost? what makes so many of them want to act anti-social? this film, and the questions it poses about teenagers will stick with you for a while. that's a fact.<br /><br />8 of 10 stars.<br /><br />the hound.
