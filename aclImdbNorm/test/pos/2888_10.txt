after searching for 6 months, i finally found this dvd. all i can say is it was damn well worth the wait! "rush in rio" may very well be the greatest rock dvd in existence. i'm not joking. it's incredible! all the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. i find it makes you feel like you're actually in rio watching the concert from the audience. that's one of the reasons i love this dvd. it makes you feel like you're actually there. also, geddy, alex and neil have never been in better form! geddy's vocals are flawless, alex's guitar playing is still incredible, and neil - absolutely no words to say. the camera work on this concert was very good i must say. they gave us a good look at everything that was going on on-stage, and in the audience. kudos to the cameramen! anyways, enough of my raving! go watch "rush in rio" for yourself. you will be amazed. i guarantee it.<br /><br />10/10
