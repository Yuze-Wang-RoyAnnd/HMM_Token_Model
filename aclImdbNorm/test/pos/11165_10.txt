when i first heard that this movie was going to be made, i was very excited to see it. the ideas to make a movie of this caliber, as good as it was, must have been very difficult. i wasn't really sure if anyone could encompass all of the pope's many amazing qualities in a movie, but the movie did his memory justice. in my opinion the most important task was to reveal to the people who the pope started out as. to his days in poland, all the way to his last days in the vatican, this movie followed every aspect of his life. thomas kretschmann, the man who played the pope in his adult life and on, did a very good job at getting the emotion across. overall this movie was educational, but also very entertaining.
