this was a modern tv classic! the story goes like this, bob has a girlfriend named alicia. bob and alicia are in love and want to get married. bob has a bud named owen who he works with. owen is jealous of alicia. he likes hanging around with bob. now owen hangs around with bob and alicia. bob and owen have a secretary named heather. heather is very accident prone. she is also, if you haven't guessed it, is kind of lonely. she too hangs around with bob and alicia, and owen. sometimes alicia wishes bob didn't have any friends.<br /><br />by the end of the first season, it looked like owen finally found himself a real longlasting girlfriend. bob and alicia went driving on the night before their wedding, making out in a tiny car and then getting stuck. way out in the middle of nowhere! what happened next? what about poor heather? did anyone get married?? sorry, series ended.<br /><br />not even a plea from tv guide made fox think twice about putting it back on the air. it was a great show with a great cast. i loved heather too. she looked cool in those glasses and was hilarious. i miss this show a lot. this is like reading a good book with the ending missing......sad.
