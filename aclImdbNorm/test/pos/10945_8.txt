with a film starring the twins, ekin cheng and edison chen, nobody should expect a masterpiece of cinema. what you do get, however, is a fun film which is easy on the eye and the brain. there are loads of hollywood-style vampires (no hopping chinese bloodsuckers here), cute girls, handsome heroes and the occasionally very funny moment. and jackie chan.<br /><br />sure, the kung-fu relies heavily on wire work and cgi. sure, the script reminds you of blade. and sure, the whole affair is instantly forgettable.<br /><br />but for a truly enjoyable piece of cinematic fluff, you would be hard pushed to find better.
