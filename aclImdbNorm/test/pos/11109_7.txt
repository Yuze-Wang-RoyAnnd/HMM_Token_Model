i had always wanted to see this film and the first three-fourths proved i hadn't waited in vain. but what the hell happened in the end? i mean, don't get me wrong, i liked the film. it definitely made me nostalgic of the realistic, unique nyc of the 80s that we have lost thanks to giuliani. but it's missing another half hour!
