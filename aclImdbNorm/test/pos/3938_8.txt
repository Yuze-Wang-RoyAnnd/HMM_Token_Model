i was really surprised to see that unlike most documentaries, this was written, directed and produced by a film critic-- richard schickel. most of the times i know of where film critics had major involvement in films, the films turns out to be bombs (rex reed starring in "myra breckenridge" and roger ebert writing "beyond the valley of the dolls" are prime examples). however, in this case, the critic's powers are used for good and not evil--and the results are better (though this isn't saying much, as the films i just mentioned are among the worst films ever made).<br /><br />as for the documentary, it's narrated by clint eastwood (a pretty good choice) and manages to discuss his long career--from his silent days until his death in the early 1960s. the only negatives, and they are slight, are that the film is awfully short (as are most film documentaries) and there is very little about gary cooper as a human being--you really don't learn all that much about his life. however, as a nice overview of his films, it works very well.
