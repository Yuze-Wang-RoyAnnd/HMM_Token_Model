just before dawn is an excellent horror movie. it is atmospheric, filled with tension made of wonderful shots of wild nature, in which few young people meet their doom, in the shape of two crazed, fat bastards,who slaughter them. jeff lieberman is very talented and intelligent director,who is unfortunately underrated. he achieved to built tension, not with gore,but with showing menacing nature environment. lieberman succeeds to built a tension in a very linear, simplistic way, which is also the best way, not to show to the viewer the gore, but to let him to imagine the worst thing that happen to characters. <br /><br />just before dawn was always compared to texas chainsaw massacre, deliverance and hills have eyes. it is as good looking as deliverance, better than hills, i mean scarier and better crafted,and it is creepy as the texas chainsaw massacre.<br /><br />jbd is one of the best horrors of past few decades, who finally lives on dvd!
