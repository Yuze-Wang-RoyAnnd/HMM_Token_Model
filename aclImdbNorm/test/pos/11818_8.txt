the subject of children being terminally ill is difficult and saddening but 'the cure' successfully portrays the idea that it doesn't have to be all doom and gloom and, if anything, children need to have hope and delight in their lives if they are to find peace before the end. it is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhood.<br /><br />the film sees erik, a dysfunctional adolescent boy with a distant mother, moving into a new area where their next-door neighbour is eleven-year-old dexter, who contracted aids through a blood transfusion. after his initial fears and ignorance over aids are allayed, erik befriends dexter and their almost fraternal friendship sees them embark on a journey down the mississippi to where they have heard about a new orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the disease.<br /><br />the talent from the two young leads of brad renfro and joseph mazzello, who play erik and dexter respectively, is exceptional. brad was able to portray erik's harder edge without comprising the subtle childish innocence inherent to the character while joseph depicts the sense of vulnerability to dexter's character but injects the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and zeal to highlight that his illness doesn't mean he still isn't a child who wants to run and play like any other eleven-year-old boy. the pair's interactions create a feel in the audience that these are two boys who are genuinely close and they carry the film well. annabella sciorra also delivers a touching performance as dexter's mother linda, who adores her son and delights in seeing him thrive with this new friendship to erik and eventually becomes a surrogate mother-figure to the other boy.<br /><br />set against an excellent soundtrack, 'the cure' is a very bittersweet film that manages to flawlessly weave the story of boyhood friendship that survives unflinchingly in the midst of prejudice and terminal illness without resorting to sappiness or unnecessary saccharine sweet scenes. a very interesting reflection in the film is that is it the adults who have the problem with dexter's aids status whereas the children, even the 'bullies', come to accept him as they would any other. what is also very touching is how, despite erik's streetwise nature, he is the more naive one in his determination to cure dexter while the younger boy has this haunting sense that he knows his fate but is swept away by his best friend's enthusiasm for a cure.<br /><br />i highly recommend 'the cure' for it is rare to find a film that is simultaneously sad and uplifting.
