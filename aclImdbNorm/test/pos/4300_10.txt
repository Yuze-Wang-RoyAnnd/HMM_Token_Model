this is a stunning movie. raw and sublimely moving. it felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences. all of the main players are mesmerising. tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike. julian fellowes has triumphed again. he's a national treasure. gosford park, vanity fair, mary poppins... and now this. can he do no wrong?! go and see it! this is a film for real grown-ups.
