i'm sick and tired of people complaining that never say never again is just a weak remake of thunderball. yes, that movie's influence is unmistakable, but the tremendous and almost universal inferiority of re-made films is reserved for such thoughtless and unintelligent films like the 1998 re-make of psycho. while it's true that the opening theme of the twelfth (and connery's last) bond film is one of the worst of the entire series, the film itself still manages to stand on its own, despite many other weaknesses. besides that, even the weak title song is made to blend pretty nicely with the closing dialogue in the film.<br /><br />sure, sean connery was getting a little on in age when this movie was filmed (at least by james bond standards), but there is plenty of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that this was not exactly unknown to the filmmakers. james bond is near retirement before he is handed his assignment, having spent most of recent time teaching, not doing, and there is even the tongue in cheek insistence from m that he pay more attention to his health, dieting and training and getting more exercise and whatnot. besides, this is james bond, remember? this guy is supposed to be some kind of super human, and all of his fans are getting all upset because he's got some gray hairs. when this guy retires at the end of the film, m sends poor `small-fawcett' (in a hilarious cameo from rowan atkinson) to tell bond that without him, he worries about the safety of the free world, and all of you people can't get over the fact that he's not a sprightly young man anymore. come on, sean connery could still play james bond just as good as he ever could, or at least better than anyone else ever has been able to.<br /><br />the majority of the film deals with the elaborate plan to steal nuclear missiles and hold the world hostage (as dr. evil would say, `oh hell, let's just do what we always do
