this is probably one of my favorites so far, although i have the first one and have seen curse, legacy, and vs. demonic toys. the only one better than this one is pm vs. dt. curse is the worst one in the series, than the first one, and then its legacy. i recommend people to see this and vs. dt. those ones who say this stinks are so wrong, the story is well written and it is a sweet movie. this is a classic movie even younger kids can watch and not be as scared when watching the others. well this is my review, you can call me gipdac,( its easy to know where that came from: 101 dalmatians series, you can watch it on toon disney at 4:00 a.m.). oh and don't laugh, i'm a guy, you will see more of my reviews in good time. if you want to know why i watch it? i'm 12! word of advice: have a mental meal, arrrrroooooooooo! i also agree with you motter-1, but why people like the others is because they're more thrilling than horror, and because the puppets are made to look scarier. also, you can call me gipdac.
