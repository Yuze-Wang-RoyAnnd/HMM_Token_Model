"out to sea" is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of jack lemmon and walter matthau. this film is not quite as funny as their "grumpy old men" comedies (which it strongly resembles), but there are many laughs throughout. lemmon and matthau play a couple of in-laws who take a cruise together. once they get on the boat, the thing lemmon doesn't know is that matthau has signed them on as dance hosts so they don't have to pay for the cruise. this infuriates lemmon who's in no mood to dance. what's worse, matthau doesn't even know how to dance. nevertheless, they go along with it and it the process they meet some of their fellow passengers and crew members. here are the crew members: there's the cruise director gil godwyn, played to the hilt by "star trek: the next generation" veteran brent spiner, who acts like an evil dictator. there's two fellow dance hosts, played by "barney miller" star hal linden and veteran movie musical star donald o'connor. there's the ship's owner mrs. carruthers, played by "golden girl" rue mcclanahan. as for the passengers: there's vivian, a widow played by gloria de haven, who falls in love with lemmon. there's liz, played by one of my all-time favorite actresses, dyan cannon, who falls in love with matthau. there's mavis, liz's mother, played by veteran stage actress elaine stritch. and they meet others as well. all these actors are a pleasure to watch as lemmon and matthau play off of them. it's great to see cannon here, see's beautiful as ever; stritch is a hoot; spiner is a funny comic villain who's plays it deadly straight; de haven is wonderful; linden, o'connor, and mcclanahan have a good moment or two; and finally, the two main stars, lemmon and matthau, are fine as usual. a nice little gem of a comedy.<br /><br />*** (out of four)
