this is one of the best movies i have seen in years. i took me to a new time and place. it was as though i was right there with ray through his many trials and triumphs. jamie foxx transformed himself into ray. during the movie he was ray. also, kerry washington, sharon robinson and regina king were superb. the movie was well cast and directed, the music was fantastic.<br /><br />i've seen the movie four (4) times with different people and the last time was just as enjoyable as the first time. i will buy the dvd as soon as it is released. this is a movie that will viewed over and over for years to come.<br /><br />thank you for a great experience.
