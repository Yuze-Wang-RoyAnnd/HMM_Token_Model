a very interesting addition to the scandavian surrealistic collection. recommended viewing for those who like their movies complicated. my interpretation of the 'strange' ending would be that andreas' journey ends in hell. he dislikes the bland consumer-led emptiness of purgatory; a sort of 'living' but not progressing, i.e. not getting anywhere - even the city's metro trains don't stop at the stations. it has a metro system, like you should be able to travel, freedom, escape, but you can never actually board those trains. he is unable to reach fragrant, sensory heaven and winds up continuing his bus journey to its final destination. the old norse version of hell (hades, not hell the terrestrial city) isn't burning hot like the british version, its cold, freezing, the land of niflheim (land of cold and mists). this appears to be where andreas end up, having just failed to access heaven through that tunnel.
