this is the best movie i have ever seen. it has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. and a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.<br /><br />the most splendid casting i have ever seen. patrick swayze and james read were top grade in this movie.<br /><br />if you see part 1 you will want to see it all. some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.<br /><br />i am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. any movie that can get children to learn history is great. i have books i, ii & iii and when the girls come up from florida each year they want to see north & south.
