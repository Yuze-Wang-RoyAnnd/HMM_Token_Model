finally i discovered what i thought i remembered as a four year old. after seeing the 1960 color version on vhs, i kept saying i remembered seeing it in black and white 2 times before. now the imdb has helped me to know the truth, that it was broadcast twice (2 productions) in black and white in 2 successful years, 1955 & 56. these are the ones i remember best as a four year old. i didn't realize the 56 broadcast was not the same as the 55. in 1960, i was 9 and the color production just didn't do it for me. the black and white version was wonderful with just as much awe and wonder impact as the high tech films of today, even without any computer effects. you had to have been there! please comment if you had a similar reaction to the b&w version.
