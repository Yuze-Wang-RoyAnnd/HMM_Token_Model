for those who loved "wayne's world"..."the blues brothers"...and hell, even "raiders of the lost ark," you will find much to like (but probably not love) in "tenacious d: the pick of destiny," a fictional epic about the formation of the jb (jack black)/kg (kyle gass) band. two out-of-work losers with a love for rock n'roll are met with a dilemma when kg's long-supportive mother stops sending him rent checks; jb and kg make tracks for the rock and roll hall of fame after a sage music-store clerk (an inspired ben stiller) tells them about the titular pick (a funny animated-tapestry sequence gives the backstory). along the way, our zeroes encounter a snaggle-toothed stranger (a game tim robbins), sasquatch, stoner security guards, sorority chicks, and satan himself (an ironically-cast dave grohl), in a climactic sequence that has to be seen to be believed (and preferably played at high volume). rarely do i see comedies in the theater, but "pick" is an extremely nice change of pace...it may not go up to 11, but it hums a tune both crude and clever for a good 90 minutes. and the songs are inspired low-brow hilarity. recommended.<br /><br />6.5 out of 10
