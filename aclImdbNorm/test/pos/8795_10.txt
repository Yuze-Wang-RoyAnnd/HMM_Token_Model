the only way to truly understand and relate to the characters in this movie is to have experienced the situations your self. to a lot of people this movie is almost mock-biographical, a sort of snapshot of one weekend in our lives. (i have done about 85 percent of the things in this movie and witnessed the other 15 percent, usually all in the same weekend) for me and others i know it is nice to have this movie to look back on because other than a few pictures of people we sort of remember and nights that are patches and blurs, this movie is our generations "studio 54", a piece to add to our scrap books to look back on and smile. personally i'm glad those days are past but it is great to watch this movie and say "i remember when........." thank you justin for making this mock-biography of one weekend in my life.
