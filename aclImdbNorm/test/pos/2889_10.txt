these guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. the musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where rush exists. future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. get this dvd and you will enjoy it throughly!! i was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in houston, tx and was blown away. i have not missed a show since power windows and i have to say that they are better than ever. everyone should embrace these guys and teach others what real musicianship is! there will never be such a tight and well put together trio again in our lifetime. lets just hope and pray that they do not retire anytime soon!
