it has taken me about a year now after seeing this film to write about it. lord knows i have wanted to, after witnessing it i knew i saw something i hadn't seen before but wasn't sure why. now after reflecting for quite some time i know, it's these characters that even now i still can't stop thinking about.<br /><br />distant briefly and slowly tells the story of a relative (yusuf) who comes from the rurals to live briefly with a well off to do photographer (mahmut) in the city in hopes to find employment. however it becomes clear that after yusuf hypothesizes the idea of being a sailor and his employment prospects dim, that he's really searching for something else, some sort of purpose in his life.<br /><br />through all this soul searching we are taken through seasonal surroundings that are filmed exquisitely. the context in which they happen makes the scenes more powerful in 2 particular ones when a girl yusuf has been following suddenly meets up with her significant other, and the look of yusuf's face as he looks into a basket of fish and the shot and light that reflects off his tortured face. that scene in itself has to be one of the most gorgeously filmed pieces i have witness in i don't know how long.<br /><br />in the end mahmut has his own demons too, but ends up confronting his relative that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave, in a scene that is very simple but has the feeling of true heartbreak.<br /><br />what the viewer is left with is lots of reflecting and pondering for these 2 people who everyone can see a piece of themselves in. you should not be put off by the pace of this film it is truly worth every single breathtaking second.<br /><br />rating 10 out of 10.
