**spoilers** looking for a little more excitement then seeing crocodiles being fed at the local game reserve sisters grace and pat, diana glenn & maeve dermody, together with grace's boyfriend adam, andy rodoreda, decide to take a trip upstream in the desolate and deserted, of human habitation, australian mangrove swamps.<br /><br />with their swamp guide jimmy, ben oxenbuld, at the helm of his motorized boat the four get upended by a giant saltwater crocodile who quickly grabs and drags a terrified jimmy down to the bottom along with him. grace pat & adam end up stranded on a tree in the swamp with pat hanging on for dear life on the capsized boat. the rest of the film has the hungry and determined crocodile play a cat and mouse, or crock' and human, game with the trio that ends in a showdown at a mud bank just where the dead and dismembered body of jimmy finally came to it's rest.<br /><br />both the director and actors in the film take full advantage of the swamp making it at times far more scary then the giant crocodile swimming in it. we get to see the killer crocodile just about a half dozen times in the movie but everyone of them hits you, and jimmy grace pat & adam, right in the gut.<br /><br />alway there were kept in suspense by the giant reptile always doing his damage from beneath that comes so unexpectedly that it, the crock attacks, has far more effect when you don't see them coming then, like in the last ten minutes of the movie, when you do. you wonder right from the start who in the end would survive the crocodile attacks and eventually live to tell about them. the ending with the crocodile vrs human confrontation was about the weakest and most unrealistic part in the film. <br /><br />the crocodile who was both so cagey and effective in the earlier scenes seemed to have punched, or swam, himself out not having either the strength or speed to grab, with his deadly jaws, and finish off the sole survivor of the expedition. in fact the killer crock was so ineffective that even after he gabbed his victim, or victims, he just couldn't hold on to them. this in the end turned out to be fatal on his part.<br /><br />a lot like "jaws" the film "black water" has the killer crocodile, like the great white shark in "jaws", more interested is killing his human prey then eating them. with all the food available in the swamp and rivers that he inhabited the crocodile was only after the quartet, grace pat adam & jimmy, for invading his watery domain that he felt was the grand ruler of. and for daring to do that they were to pay with their lives!
