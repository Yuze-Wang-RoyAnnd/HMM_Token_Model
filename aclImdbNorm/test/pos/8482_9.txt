like almost everyone, i am familiar with the music of ray charles. who hasn't heard "georgia on my mind" and "the mess-around" and some of the other marvelous songs featured in this movie. but about the life of ray charles i was sadly ignorant until watching this. i have to say that jamie foxx brought ray charles to life brilliantly. his performance was powerful, right down to the mannerisms and voice inflections. the movie also offered a no-holds-barred account of some of the trials and tribulations charles dealt with over the course of his life, and with some demons from the past that haunted him well into adulthood. perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie was the heroin withdrawal scene, which was painfully realistic. the movie portrays charles' growing awareness of and involvement with the civil rights movement, culminating in his refusal to play before a segregated audience in georgia, which led to a ban on him performing in the state. his drug addiction and extra marital affairs are also well documented. the movie revolves around a plea from his mother when he was a child: don't let anyone or anything turn you into a cripple." the point is that drugs did just that, and to honour his mother's memory, he had to beat them. there's not much here about his later life and career after breaking his heroin habit but up to that point, this is really powerful stuff. 9/10
