i've always been a fan of jackass, as well as viva la bam and wildboyz. and when you're a fan of something, your expectations are high to whatever your "heroes" might star in. and if there's one thing i've learned about expecting a lot from the people you simply love to watch and listen to, it's never to expect to much, 'cause in 99 out of a 100 times, you'll get disappointed.<br /><br />although, when i heard there was a jackass 2 coming up, i thought "not even i can turn down my expectations for this movie", and as a result of that i sat down today, ready to laugh, but also ready to say in the end "well, it was ok, but i'm a little disappointed". how wrong was i! every single member of the jackass crew brings this movie way over the first one, showing you the one crazy ass stunt after the other, making the whole world see that there's nothing they wont do to try to harm themselves - and that's what we love! i cried my eyes out laughing from the first minute and till the very last second of the movie, at some times even shouted in laughter, not able to control myself! stunt after stunt, prank after prank, and hilarious comments on the flow - it can simply not get any better than this! amazing from start till end, guaranteed to make you laugh your ass off. i've got two things left to say; watch it, and please god, let there be a jackass 3 - these guys clearly has a lot to offer!
