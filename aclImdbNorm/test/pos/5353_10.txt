wallace & gromit: the curse of the were-rabbit (2005) **** (voices: peter salis, ralph fiennes helena bonham carter)<br /><br />fantastic feats of clay: wallace & gromit save the day! crackin' good entertainment!<br /><br />nick park, the creator of the animated team of wallace & gromit, is a genius. his painstaking art in the form of plasitcine claymation is a unique process involving literally thousands of hours (it takes roughly an 8 hour work day to contribute 3 minutes of action to a film; this foray into feature length storytelling took 5 years!) in making his lovable master & loyal dog team take form is finally on the big screen in the duo's first full-length motion picture and it's cracklin' good (to coin a phrase from wallace's usual reply to all things good!) <br /><br />park, who co-directed with steve box and co-wrote with mark burton and bob baker, sends up the horror genre in this rollickingly funny and swift paced action comedy with the geeky inventive wallace (voiced by british vet thespian salis) and his mute yet loyal (and sharper-minded) mutt gromit (all furrowing eyebrows and mouth-less insouciance) have devised a service to their community: pest control ("anti-pesto" as they are known) for the upcoming giant vegetable festival that has the entire town in the mood for all things vegetative a gigante and the biggest pesk are troublesome rabbits eating the crunchy goods. wallace's inventive mind has created a vacuum container that is quick, efficient, and more importantly harmless to the cute vermin that plague the estate of lady campanula tottington (voiced by bonham carter, making a fast-break to be the first lady of stop-motion animation what with her earlier turn in "corpse bride" a few weeks ago), who is housing the competition and is a love interest for the nerdy wallace.<br /><br />the only fly-in-the-ointment is vainglorious, bombastic loud-mouth and jerk victor quartermaine (voiced by fiennes, his first attempt in the animated arts coming across as a patrick stewart lunged braggard with hilarious results), a badly toupeed wearing macho moron who is plotting to marry lady tottington for her riches while he is a chief competitor to w&g's humane attempts by resorting to his trusty guns and nasty bulldog.<br /><br />to add insult to injury the duo are facing a terrible plight in the form of a huge were-rabbit (the titular monster a nice nod to both universal and hammer horror flicks) that is terrorizing the village and devouring every veggie in sight. the two set out to trap and dispose of the creature but there is more than meets the eye as things progress.<br /><br />relentlessly funny and with such amazing elastic, and kinetic energy to his wonderful clay counterparts, park and box have created a truly magical and highly entertaining film with so much amazingly detailed production design to their little world that it may take more than one screening to absorb just how much effort in their blood, sweat and tears have gone into making this instant classic for children of all ages. <br /><br />wallace, the cheese loving balding inventor, could easily be homer simpson's uk cousin with his rotund body and constant knack for getting things wrong while attempting to do the right thing; his heart is in the right place but his head is in the clouds. his sweet crush for lady tottington (resembling a pre-plastic surgery carol burnett) who is a head taller than our hero will perhaps remind those of their first unrequited love with a smile of awkward admission. his rube goldberg-like gift for making the complicated into ease is inspired lunacy that fans will recall from the earlier shorter films "the wrong trousers", "a close shave" and "a grand day out".<br /><br />but it is in my opinion the wise, silent and long-suffering gromit, his poached egg eyes of slow-burns and disbelief at what is transpiring, is one of the best animated characters ever created with such an amazing arsenal of exasperated, mouthless expressions and subtle nuances that most live-action actors would kill to accomplish in the attempt of conveying dismay, concern, grief, genuine surprise and relief. his final chase
