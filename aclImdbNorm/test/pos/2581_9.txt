craig brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom i will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. his debut, hustle and flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. i wasn't quite sure what i would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. the cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. fortunately, black snake moan hits all its marks dead-on. the acting is astonishing, the writing superb, and the editing style, as well as juxtaposed music, riveting the whole way. brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption.<br /><br />the first moment i knew i was in for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning. like he did with hustle and flow, brewer lays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up statically. the 70's aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of cinema's best. from here we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both lazarus and rae, each vignette mirroring the other while they journey to the fateful moment their paths finally cross. the editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose. rae's boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and laz's wife leaves him for his brother. each feels the loneliness and reverts to what they know in that situation
