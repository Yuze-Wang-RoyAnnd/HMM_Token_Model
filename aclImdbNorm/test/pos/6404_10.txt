i am right now watching "the big chill" on dvd. one of its actors is meg tilly. i looked it up on imdb which led me to reading meg's bio which mentioned and reminded me of meg's sister jennifer tilly whose filmography included "key west", which was one of my wife's and my favorite shows. i then read this entire thread of reviews.<br /><br />wow, i really loved that show also and agree with all of the sentiments about the quirkiness and uniqueness of the characters and situations.<br /><br />as most everyone else, i wish it was on dvd or otherwise available.<br /><br />the last reviewer says he watches it on reruns so i wish i knew what network, channel, day, times it is on.<br /><br />so if anyone knows how we can watch episodes of "key west", please let us know.
