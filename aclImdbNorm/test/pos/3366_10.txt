there's nothing left undone about this perry and croft masterpiece - as good as any of the best episodes, thankfully it was still filmed in time before the late james beck sadly passed away to be included in it to show his talent.<br /><br />it shows right from the start, how the platoon is formed from the state of national emergency, showing the boys as inept under captain mainwaring (arthur lowe) and sergeant wilson (john le mesurier) as they usually are through the series.<br /><br />along the way, mainwaring does his usual longing to show authority but the chaps can't help but let him down at every turn, during wargames and suspecting an invasion. they have a chance in the film though to redeem themselves when they actually capture the nazi airmen who take the church congregation hostage.<br /><br />that was a nice finale especially as mainwaring had been able to prove himself to the general, being given one last chance to shape up. a great film, plenty of good lines and laughs, it's another one for the dvd cupboard - i'm glad the bbc is repeating it - and on this day 2.8.08 they deservedly had 'dad's army night'. not to be missed!
