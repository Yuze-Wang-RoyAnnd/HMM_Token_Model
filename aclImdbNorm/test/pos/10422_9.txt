wow, i've sure seen quite a bit of kelli mccarty this summer. i didn't know this woman made so many softcore flicks in the past three years. it's like seeing a future softcore star blossom in front of me, much like michelle hall did a couple of years ago.<br /><br />"passion's peak" is the third quality softcore flick i've seen kelli mccarty in, with "girl for girl" and "house of love" being the others. "desire and deception" was okay, but it wasn't spectacular. there's spoilers in this review, so read only if you want to.<br /><br />the story begins with christina (kelli mccarty) heading out of the big city and to the mountains. she has inherited a house from her dear departed grandmother and plans to turn it into a mountain lodge. before she can even set her things down, some woman named kim (uncredited in this film, but quite the aggressive one) begins booking guests to stay there. now she has to get the house into shape quickly--in comes chip (bobby johnston), a childhood friend, to the rescue. chip helps her get the house in workable condition. she hires two local slackers to work in her lodge--chip's sister bait (samantha mcconnell) and her sex buddy hank.<br /><br />now the guests start coming. the first to arrive are eric and linda (flower), two stereotypical money-first lawyers. linda and eric get into a huge argument during a dinner party halfway through the film which leads to their breakup; sad stuff there. next, there's romance novelist sophia, played by b-movie goddess monique parent. she's using that silly alias scarlet johansing again, and she's got a very professional look this time--with blonde hair, of course. it wouldn't be monique if she didn't have at least one scene where she plays with herself--and she obliges, during one of eric and linda's sex scenes.<br /><br />james and shene (devinn lane--yes, the porn star devinn lane) show up for a little weekend getaway as well. unbeknownst to shene, james and christina have quite a history. james and christina used to date, but christina broke it off to head to this mountain lodge. james comes up to the lodge to get christina back, but his plan backfires. christina spills the beans to shene, which causes shene to walk out on him and down to the local bar to strip for the locals. shene ends up in the sleeping bag of the now-single eric, and they leave together. bait realizes she wants something more than just sex with hank, and christine finds true love with chip, with sophia soaking it all in and writing it into her next romance novel. <br /><br />in fact....if you ask me, this whole movie played out like a romance novel. i don't know if the screenwriter was going for that effect, but i sure got that impression. sophia had some of the best lines in this film, playing up the idea that this is a live-action romance novel. she seems to enjoy all the fighting and backstabbing going on.<br /><br />now to the sex. there was a fair amount of it, and it was the usual bump-and grind stuff. monique did her fair share of moaning in her two sex scenes. this film was tapeworthy, and the story will actually keep the audience somewhat interested in between the sex scenes.<br /><br />women: a- (monique was simply monique. out of all the softcore actresses i've seen over the years, she's the best at acting, in my opinion. she can really act and be sexy, which is why she's holding on to the #1 position in my skinemax top 10. kelli mccarty is better at doing softcore films than she is on the soap opera "passions"; i don't know why she's not doing more of these. flower was merely background scenery for the most part in a limited role. samantha mcconnell continues to impress me, and devinn lane is yet another hardcore actress crossing over into the softcore realm and doing a halfway decent job at it.)<br /><br />sex: b (it was good, but not awe-inspiring spectacular. plenty of moaning. don't watch the r-rated version, trust me....most of the good stuff is taken out. my grade is for the uncut version.)<br /><br />story: b (a solid storyline which throws in a contrived "ooh, the building inspector's gonna shut us down" subplot toward the end which messes up things. the underlying story between christina and james was nice, and sophia's dialogue, full of the metaphors and imagery usually found in romance novels, was a nice touch.)<br /><br />overall: b+ (i found this movie to be quite entertaining. it's not a surefire softcore hall-of-famer like "girl for girl" is, but it's a respectable addition to the skinemax collection.)
