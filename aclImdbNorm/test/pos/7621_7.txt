i'm not sure if these other people saw the movie - some apparently couldn't follow the "complicated plot". he's a billionaire who owns an oil company who also happens to big game hunt - wow - that's really far fetched. any way - his new "drilling machine" happens to break through a glacier and on the other side is a world seperated from our own time where dinosaurs and cavemen wander around. nothing ground breaking about this but it certainly isn't ludicrous. anyway the rest of the movie is about this t-rex they find (which the billionaire, boone, claimed was there) hunting them and them hunting it. look - it's an old made for tv movie - of course the special effects look cheesy - they didn't have cg - they did the best they could and for a mftvm they did a hell of a job for the time. this movie should be remade for the big screen - i'd love it and i'd be the first one in line. seeing that dinosaur with modern day special effects stalking those guys would be great!
