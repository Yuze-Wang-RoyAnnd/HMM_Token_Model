i saw this at the screening at gencon in indy. i had some time to kill and decided to check it out. it played to about 1000 people in a packed standing-room-only ballroom.<br /><br />wow, what a ride! the script was tight. the action tense. the pacing perfect. the character exposition excellent. one thing i really appreciated was that you knew going in that this wasn't a big budget film. yet it soon became obvious that the creators pushed their sets and effects as far as they could despite their limitations. and it was more than enough. <br /><br />it's true that this film was targeted at a certain audience - gamers/tabletop players - the creators make no effort to hide that. but other filmmakers could learn a lot from them. for in going for the jugular in scene after scene and not worrying about if mom who happens to be watching will "get it", they got the biggest laughs time and time again. but there's enough universality there that mom will be laughing too, even if she's not in on every joke. i think too many times i see films that try so hard to lower the bar to the lowest common denominator so that they will appeal to the most people, but the movie just ends up suffering for it.<br /><br />but not this flick. indeed, this film was so solid that it had the audience wrapped around it's finger from the opening credits. and, while the viewers around me *really* wanted to like the film, they weren't pushovers - gamers can be among the most critical niche out there. <br /><br />i'm so glad i got to see this in a big crowd. at least 10 times the audience was having such a good time that they erupted into applause at a joke or scene during the film. how often does that happen at screenings? it should be no surprise that there was a huge standing ovation when the closing credits rolled.<br /><br />for my own part, i can't wait for this to be released. after it ended, one of the producers said they were shooting for a simultaneous tv/dvd release. that date cannot come soon enough.
