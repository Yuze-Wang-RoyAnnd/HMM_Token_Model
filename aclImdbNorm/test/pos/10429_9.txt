i don't understand why more people have not commented on this, other than the fact that perhaps not very many have seen it. it's an amazing cast of characters, one after another after another, all done by the guy who wrote the play. if you don't like filmed plays, you may not like this (after all, plays usually don't look good on tv), but it's a one-man show that will have you paying attention throughout. highly recommended.
