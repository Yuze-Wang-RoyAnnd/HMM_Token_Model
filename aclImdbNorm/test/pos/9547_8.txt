what could ever happen in a dull texan town in summer? well, a bunch of teenagers find out a few things can and do happen.<br /><br />it turns out the mexican werewolf of this story is nothing less than el chupacabra, and the movie, unlike the name would suggest, is not a remake or lookalike of the american werewolf movies, but something completely different.<br /><br />overall, for an obviously low-budget movie, it's not bad! some clever camera work, quite decent looking traditional creature and gore effects, and for once not all-knowing people that can and do make mistakes, like shooting a colleague thinking it's the big bad beast, and are baffled by things they could not possibly know.<br /><br />sit down at this expecting a blockbuster million-dollar production, and you will turn it off in disgust after a short while. sit down at this expecting a bit of entertainment and a relatively simple story, and it's quite good! overall it gets an 8/10 from me for being creative, having ok acting, and pulling off some good work for the budget this movie had.
