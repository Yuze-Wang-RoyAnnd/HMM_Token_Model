i grew up outside of naila germany(where they landed),every detail of the film was 100% authentic,the power lines that they flew over,the nosy neighbors,the grandmother telling the kids that they cant watch west german tv,etc..this movie brings back lots of good memories to those that are european,a great production from disney...the same movie in german has klaus lowitsch and gunter meisner using their own voices for translating the english version into german...for the german version they also use cookoo birds ,a bird that is native to germany as background noise to let you know that you are in germany..i showed this move to many of my german relative and they really liked this movie.(these people made made a prototype balloon which they had to give up because the materials that they used was too porous and the other 2 balloons that they used for the escape.the burner problem was solved when they turned the propane cylinders upside down.)
