i still remember watching satya for the first time. i was completely blown away. here was a movie that was very different so from the other gangster films that i had seen. so realistic, so mumbaiyya and so believable. despite "company" (which was a very good effort) and "vaastav" (more focused on the journey of the protagonist) which came close, no underworld movie could ever live up to satya.<br /><br />when i watched ab tak 56 for the first time, i said to myself "indian cops have their own 'satya' now". the quote by nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film. what strikes you about the "encounter" at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out. there is a cold and scary feel to it cos you realize that it is part of their routine.<br /><br />ab tak 56 is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted. with simple shots and camera angles, director shimit amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie. editing seems non-existent and hence effective. the music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after you've left the movie hall.<br /><br />but for me, what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character. sandeep srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer. if i start listing my favourite dialogues, i'm afraid i'll end up re-writing the entire script of the movie.<br /><br />the movie boasts of some stellar performances. yashpal sharma is detestable as sub-inspector imtiaz siddiqui and so is jeeva as joint commissioner suchak. revathi, hrishita bhatt, mohan agashe and kunal vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection. nakul vaid as the rookie jatin shukla was a revelation. the scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster
