i have a letter from ms. knight, who went to college with my older sister. in it, she tells of the hardships of making this film. she, herself, was pregnant--an interesting conjunction with the movie's plot--and the novice director was unsure, fairly green, and having great difficulties with all the decisions, logistics, etc. they were on the move all the time, and it was a very difficult shoot. <br /><br />the film, however, with a strong debut for james caan, remains effective and affecting. it's a great showcase for the talent that ms. knight has demonstrated her entire career--on television, in movies and on the stage, where she won the tony for "kennedy's children."<br /><br />this film has aged well.
