out of any category, this is one demented and over the edge film, even in todays standards. filmed entirely in crap-o-rama, this film will blow your mind (and something else too!)<br /><br />the amount of hilarious bad taste and sleaze is astonishing. the dialog is breathtakingly fast and campy. you'll either love or hate this film, but give it go. i've seen it 4 times and absolutely love it. divine is in the quest for being the filthiest person alive, but so are her rivals too in this obscene and disgusting (but funny) and stylish little film. <br /><br />divine was phenomenal, and "she" will always be missed greatly. edith massey does the unforgettable performance as the "egglady" and don't forget the energetic mink stole!<br /><br />"uber crazy s**t! <br /><br />recommended also for you sick little puppies;<br /><br />female trouble <br /><br />desperate living <br /><br />polyester
