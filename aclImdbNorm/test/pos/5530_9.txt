that was one of the lines in a trailer about this film and for once the publicists did not exaggerate. all six of the featured players here are on the screen 99% of the time, so they have to be good.<br /><br />it's always fascinating how certain plot premises can be worked for either highballing comedy to a deadly serious situation. mary boland of the ditzy and charlie ruggles of the henpecked play their usual characters who are planning to motor all the way to california. to share expenses they advertise for someone to share the ride. they get burns and allen and a monster of a dog. that same premise was a deadly serious one several generations later in kalifornia.<br /><br />of course if you're traveling with gracie allen you know you're going to be going absolutely nuts trying to figure her monty pythonesque reasoning about the whole world. and if that ain't enough you get to run into w.c. fields, part time sheriff and full time pool hustler who's living in sin with alison skipworth. but back then we didn't delve into such things.<br /><br />a real classic comedy from the thirties, not to be missed.
