the ali g character works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show, but as a movie, it doesn't work in the same way.<br /><br />don't get me wrong - this is a very funny movie, full of biting, witty dialogue, that caricatures the modern british chav wonderfully well, whilst providing the viewer with a hilarious, if unrealistic story.<br /><br />one problem with this film is that the script and content is either fantastically brilliant, or it's embarrassing to watch. when i say embarrassing, i don't mean funny embarrassing a la office or extras, but rather, you'll wish they hadn't included it in the final cut. one example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the film has ended, to the tune of, "this is how we do it." whenever i watch the film, i stop the dvd when it says the end, and leave it at that.<br /><br />overall, ali g indahouse is a good film, worth watching a couple of times. the script is enjoyable to an extent, and there are no issues as far as acting goes. however, refinement is the key word here.<br /><br />ali g is a better television programme. borat is a better film.
