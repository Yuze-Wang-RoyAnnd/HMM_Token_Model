i don't cry easily over movies, but i have to admit, this one brought me to tears. although i am not a ms. streep fan, her performance was excellent. the title defines in a sentence what a mother's love is. for the first hour i didn't like any of the characters, but that changed as the movie went on. the movie also explained why certain marriages last even though there are obstacles. a must see film.
