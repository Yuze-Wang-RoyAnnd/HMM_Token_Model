i am an addict of the tv show, the live shows and everything they do. and this was the last piece of work they have done on tv/film as 'the league of gentlemen'.<br /><br />if you love the series then you will absolutely love the film. it is a nice ending to their tv series. <br /><br />it is clever and funny.<br /><br />although it does not focus on some of the most popular characters, it is still great to see all the characters together and with the writers. a must see for any league of gentlemen fan.<br /><br />watch it!
