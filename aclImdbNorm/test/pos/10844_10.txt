this was one of the most emotional movies i have seen. passion, pleasure, pain, despair, sorrow, healing, cleansing and love.<br /><br />the entire movie was spellbinding. everything was done so well; the adaptation from the book, the actors, the sets, the camera shots.<br /><br />this movie touched me deeply in so many ways. it reminded me of the despair that loosing your love can have, and the time it takes to heal that wound. you may love again, but will always be risking the pain that comes with separation. <br /><br />is this not one of the most important age-old questions?<br /><br />"is it better to have love and lost? <br /><br />than to never have loved before?" <br /><br />-ascension
