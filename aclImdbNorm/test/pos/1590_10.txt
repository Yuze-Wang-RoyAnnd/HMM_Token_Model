relish every moment of this languorous spectacle with music to match (mahler's 5th is gorgeous, but listen to the vocal portion of the 3rd symphony so beautifully utilised in this film). there are many aspects to this film, but the main subject is the overpowering force of beauty, its spontaneous nature, absence of logic for love and adoration. i am also an ardent fan of bogarde and believe he was rarely as wonderful (try him in "the servant" however). note: i recommmend multiple viewings.
