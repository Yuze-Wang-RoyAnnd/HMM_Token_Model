i'm not much for "cop" movies, but this one is supposedly a classic & when i found it cheap i bought it and stuck it on a shelf, only to finally get around to watching it yesterday, and i liked it! now, you can have new york city, but as a setting for a film like this, in the winter months, it's perfect. roy scheider is a member of an elite police task group called the seven ups, which are 5 guys that fight crime undercover. in an opening scene they recover a shoebox full of money from an antique store by distracting the crooks with a "bull in a china shop" routine. but that's only the beginning. seems that there are two guys, posing as cops, that are kidnapping mob types and holding them for ransom. richard lynch happens to be one of these sleaze-bags, and he's as creepy as ever. when one of the seven ups, who is posing as a limo driver at a funeral, gets his cover blown, he's beaten and stuffed into the trunk of a car, which then leads to perhaps one of the most exciting car chases i've seen. amazing though, how light traffic in nyc is for chase scenes, but still this is rather amazing as scheider follows the two kidnappers through what i'm guessing is the bronx and then onto a turnpike and then eventually, scheider's car comes to a screeching halt in one of the most heart-stopping finales to a chase scene that i've ever witnessed. anyway, since the cop ends up dying, scheider and his men are under suspicion because the police commissioner knows so little about their activities he wonders if they're on the make by kidnapping mobsters, so of course this kind of thinking needs to be nipped in the bud & scheider is relentless getting to the bottom of things. overall a decent cop action/drama, not really my thing but i liked this one. look for joe spinell (maniac) in a small role. 7 out of 10.
