"coconut fred's fruit salad island!" is a hilarious show that is on saturday mornings on wb. it stars coconut fred and all of his friends on the island, and every episode is a very funny misadventure of theirs. most of the time, it is because of coconut fred's trouble making antics which makes it funny, and other stuff going on on the island at the same time. the humor is great and nobody on the island is very bright at all, which adds it being as amusing as it is. i don't think this could be funnier. the voice talents of the characters are magnificently superior and are exaggerated, which adds to the show's hilarity. if this is ever on dvd, i'm getting it a.s.a.p!<br /><br />strongly recommended for a good laugh.
