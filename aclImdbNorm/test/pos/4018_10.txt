an interesting movie based on three of jules verne's novels. considering the special effects and computer enhanced animation of today, this movie stands as an historic marker of cinematic resourcefulness and imagination. karel zeman has brought to life the lithographic images of the original jules verne texts. this is a must see for classic science fiction and history buffs.<br /><br />i give this movie 9 out of 10. enjoy!!
