ex-reporter jacob asch (eric roberts) is hired by an acquaintance (raymond j. barry) to find his ex-wife and son. asch heads to palm springs and quickly locates the ex laine (beverly d'angelo) with someone he believes to be the son (a young johnny depp). but things turn out to be a bit more complicated as asch discovers former white trash laine has definitely married up in the form of millionaire simon fleischer (dan hedaya) and her first son is nowhere to be seen.<br /><br />director/writer matthew chapman is channeling body heat here and this mid-80s neo-noir is watchable enough thanks to an all-star cast and nice locations. d'angelo was still looking good around this time, so she makes for a good femme fatale and isn't afraid to show some skin. however, the mystery isn't very compelling in the end. co-starring dennis lipscomb, emily longstreth and henry gibson. chapman made several thrillers in the 80s, but his "biggest" career achievement was co-authoring the screenplay for the infamous color of night.
