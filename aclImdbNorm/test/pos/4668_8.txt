especially after watching the matrix reloaded!! *spoilers*<br /><br />after seeing the matrix with all it's ridiculous fantasy make-believe-robotic characters with their super powers, it was refreshing to see an action movie with real people in situations that involved actual risk! i cared about these people, and even though some of the stunts seemed a bit much, it still left me feeling like "it's possible" verses "what a stupid video game" (like the matrix)<br /><br />this movie isn't brain surgery, it's very straight forward. some things are predictable- like knowing that someone is going to be a back-stabber and that someone early on is going to die. pretty obvious, but so what? the first 15 minutes sets up our reason, our motive, our main objective.<br /><br />i like that theron and walhberg didn't have any make-out scenes. i am glad that they didn't go there. they kept it about funny dialogue especially seth greene. that guy is funny!<br /><br />this is a movie that i would buy when it comes out on dvd. it's fun, fast and entertaining. the only thing (and i guess it's a big thing) is that we are really - rooting for the bad guys. this group of protaganists are already on the wrong side of the law. not a good message for the kiddies - parents, please explain this to them.<br /><br />
