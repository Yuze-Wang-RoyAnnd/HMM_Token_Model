well, first of all - i am a big fanatic of horror movies, but however - i am pretty sick of all those damn american horror movies. they are all about the same thing - blood and violence. it's not even creepy. well, it's nothin wrong with the blood and all that - doesn't even bother me - but that's not what makes a movie creepy! that's why i find this movie entertaining - it's fun to see a satire which is making fun of the koncept "main horror usa". american splatter/gore-movies, they are not suppose to be creepy, only funny. that's ok. but when they're suppose to be "creepy", it mostly gets pathetic. however, there are a few great american horror movies (poltergeist, psycho, birds), but in the end it's all the same thing. that's why this movie came as a relief. evil ed is not just a cult movie - it's a classic! i can't wait untill master director anders jacobsson makes another goddamn splatter movie! untill than i have to watch evil ed again - and again - and again! but i don't care - it is such an outstanding movie!
