still funny after all these years. midnight madness is good entertainment for all ages. it introduces michael j fox as a typical 15 year old trouble maker. melio and blaylak are by far the funniest characters in it and leon is perfectly cast as a wierdo game master. the budding romance between adam and the girl couldn't have been any cheesier. fagabeefe!!!!
