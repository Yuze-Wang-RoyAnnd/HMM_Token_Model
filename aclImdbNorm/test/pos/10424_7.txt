this was a very nice soft-core movie for both men and women. plenty of nudity/sex, but without the overall raunch you'll usually find. they could not have done a better job in casting as the entire ensemble was stunning. trust me guys, if you want to get your woman in the mood, get something with bobby johnston in it! and i'm sure lovely monique parent, samantha mcconnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual male. unfortunately, bobby and monique do not share a scene together and if you are aware of a movie where they do, please pm me! i'd love to know. the photography was much better than usual. so was the story. predictable, but nice, sweet natured and romantic. at the very least it was not one of those annoying predictable murder mysteries full of bottle blonde women with huge fake breasts. i give this 7/10!
