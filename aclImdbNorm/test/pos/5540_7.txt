michelle pfeiffer is ideally cast as the frustrated mob widow in this colourful black comedy. matthew modine plays a clumsy fbi agent who has taken a fancy to her. dean stockwell steals the show as the big shot who keeps on pestering pfeiffer; mercedes ruehl is dynamic as his jealous wife. it's all very eighties, but that just adds to the fun. a nice little flick, though not for every taste.
