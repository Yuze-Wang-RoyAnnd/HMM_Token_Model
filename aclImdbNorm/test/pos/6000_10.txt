gulliver's travels is, at the beginning, a satiric novel written by a great misanthropist called jonathan swift. so it is not recommended to judge of this movie, just by itself. we must go deeper into man's conscience to get to the point where swift would have lead us. gulliver has lived a voyage of truthfulness, of solitude, of apprehension of what may be his true life. we cannot just sit and watch that movie, saying it is so cutie or so boring. the matter is far beyond that and i would like everyone to expect that. this is the greatest movie ever, as far as you can feel the truths that emerge from ted danson's character: the unforgettable lemuel gulliver.
