way too many christian films become centered around the fear of the judgment, and as a result come across as condescending and indeliberately cheesy. "second glance" gets it right. this is a near perfect evangelical tool; it deals with the real reason why so many young people want nothing to do with christianity. it assures viewers that one must give up their sin--not their fun--to succeed in the christian lifestyle. "second glance" even works as a piece of film-making. the filmmakers obviously were working on a very low budget, but they managed to write a script dynamic enough to divert viewers' attention from this obvious fact. this film brought me to my lord and savior, jesus christ, and thanks to christian stations everywhere which show it, it surely has impacted more people than just me.
