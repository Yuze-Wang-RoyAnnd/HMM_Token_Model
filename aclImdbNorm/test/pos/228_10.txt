to say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all. after all, this show is made by the same crew responsible for airplane and other hilarious and brilliant movies. writing is superb. even though the show is built on one-liners, they don't become overbearing or annoying. leslie nielsen is flexing his comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying: you ain't seen nothing yet. the format was definitely polished to introduce naked gun. when watching these movies, notice how many schticks are taken from the tv show. the brilliant part is that they don't have to be changed too much. the show was truly a testing ground for bigger and better versions to come later.
