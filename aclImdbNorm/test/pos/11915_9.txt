i recently rented this movie as part of a nostalgic phase i'm going through. i was born in 1980, and so film from mid-80s to mid-90s has quite an important place in my growing up.<br /><br />this particular movie was one of my favourites, and so i was thrilled when it became available in the uk. it hasn't become worse with time, it is still a great fun film, with plenty of excitement in its own way. sure, it pales in the shadow of bigger, larger budget films, but don't let that stop you enjoying this.<br /><br />worth a rent, or even a purchase at the discount prices you'll find it for.
