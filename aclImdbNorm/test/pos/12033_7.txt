i found parts of this movie rather slow, especially the first part; the second part seemed to go a lot faster, but it's not totally clear to me as to why one part was faster than the other. i somehow managed to find it enjoyable. the acting was good, the writing was good (yet vulgar). there was also another good side to it: it was easier to understand than say, the godfather movies. you knew who was on whose side, etc. all in all, the movie wasn't half-bad.
