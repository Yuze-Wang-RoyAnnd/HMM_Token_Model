the family happiness is crumbling when, the from the beginning rich father ward (michael ontkean), gets poor and cannot support the family any longer. then the mother faye (jaclyn smith) has to take the role as the breadwinner in the family and starts to work in order to support the family and at the same time, periodically alone, has to manage the family life. not always that good, but as good as she can. the family life hardly gets easier when the father learns that the son lionel (joe flanigan "stargate atlantis") is gay and is living together with his lover john (joel gretsch "the 4400") also an old family friend, resulting in that the father makes clear to lionel that he is no longer welcome in the family. lionel is the one who meant the most to his sister anne (leslie horan) during her up-bringing, since the family neglected her. anne cannot stand the fact that their father have cut the cords with lionel and therefore she run away from home. as this wasn't enough, the son greg (brian krause "charmed") enlists in the marines and is sent to war. the storyline in this film can on some occasions feel a bit thin, in spite of that it still has a lot of realism in it, which makes it well worth seeing. since this film illustrates many sensitive relations and situations, i would believe that it is best appreciated by a mature audience even though it wouldn't hurt for teenagers to see it and get something to think about before adulthood.
