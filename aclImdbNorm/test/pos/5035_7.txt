caught this movie on tv and i watched it again. i said to myself, it's been a long time since i watched this movie, so why not. and once again this movie thrilled me. it is so easy, so watchable and so human that i don't know why some people dislike it. <br /><br />john travolta shines as michael (his dance and every move), angel that can hardly be related to this word. he smokes, drinks and he eats like some savage, but he's got big heart. on his way michael helps all people he meets. dorothy winters (andie macdowell) in her singing and finding a right man. frank quinlan (william hurt) in developing himself as a good and decent man. michael even helped dear old pansy milbank (jean stapleton) - that last scene is beautiful when they dance on the street.<br /><br />travolta had great help in other actors. andie macdowell is so beautiful and likable, william hurt is great as usual, late robert pastorelli shows his talent. jean stapleton and teri garr are also good, but my favorite supporting actor in this movie is bob hoskins as the tabloid owner.<br /><br />so we've got here a solid movie about people with a warm story also and attractive cast. just don't take this movie seriously and i can guarantee you'll have fun.
