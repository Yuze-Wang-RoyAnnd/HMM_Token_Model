people talk about how horrible the script was, and how horrible the animation was, but rainbow brite and the star stealer really is a japanese anime aimed towards children. if you look at the anime today it's done in the same style, and it's immensely popular. i don't think this movie was ever intended to be viewed by adults. just as i don't think it was ever intended to be serious. the very things that people seem to hate about this movie are the things that i love. rainbow brite is one of the best cartoon characters ever created in my opinion. she's smart. she's funny. she cares about the enviorment. she cares about her friends. this movie can teach so much to young kids. my little brothers even liked this movie. i have to say this movie taught me a lot when i was a kid. when it came out on dvd i was first in line to buy it. it's a great kids movie. so what if it's not perfect, nothing is really perfect when you look closely enough at it.
