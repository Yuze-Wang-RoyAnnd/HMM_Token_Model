this is the underrated kellie martin's best role. based on a true story, it tells the story of fusia's attempt to save the members of the diamant family and other jews she meets over time. one of my all-time favorite movie scenes involves an heroic act by fusia's little sister. all children should see this scene-role models like this are very few and far between. the movie is well written and acted. i am a movie lover and this movie i rate a 10 on imbd's rating system. it is on my top 25 movies of all time and should be put out on video.<br /><br />mike porter
