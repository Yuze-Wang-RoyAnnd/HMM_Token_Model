four stories about the drug trade in europe become intertwined over the course of this 6 part miniseries. in germany a businessman is arrested on drug smuggling charges, and his wife attempts to save her family by continuing her husband's illegal trade. meanwhile the british home secretary travels to pakistan to negotiate an aid package that he hopes will stop the drug flow from that country. even as he does this however his own daughter succumbs to heroin addiction, tearing their family apart. this is the miniseries on which the american film and miniseries were based. the original is far superior to its two decendants. the poverty and desperation of the third world are portrayed very well. it is stark, uncompromising and brutal.
