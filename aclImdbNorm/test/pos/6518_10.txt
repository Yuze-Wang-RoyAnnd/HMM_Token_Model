wonderful family film that should be a staple at christmas time. it's a mystery to me why it isn't. a true lost film that i first encountered, flickering away on my old 19" black and white rca, when the million dollar movie was still in vogue on channel 9 in new york city. this rudolph mate directed fantasy should be nestled under everyone's christmas tree. but it has never been released on home video. too bad. i believe i saw part of it on amc a few years ago, before they cut many of their older films from the rotation. tcm should take up the slack and play it at easter or on christmas eve. any movie with santa, aunt bee, the hostess cupcake lady, and an actor with the first name king, can't be bad. ann blyth as "sally" is a bundle of energy. during her school years, she rushes over to the chapel to pray for st. ann to help and give guidance to her mixed-up and financially strapped family. it works. so, after she graduates, she places a statue of st. ann in her own bedroom. at one point the entire o'moyne residence is moved to another address. i think this was done to put an end to a neighbor dispute between the o'moynes and the dastardly fellow next door. blyth is cute as a button. edmund gwen can play the reclusive grandfather in his sleep. all-in-all, this is a satisfying movie experience.
