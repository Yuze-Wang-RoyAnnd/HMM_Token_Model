an example of genius filmaking. the epic story of three major stages of life for a young boy told with eloquence and raw fearlessness. rarely does a film come along that causes me to out loud say during most of the viewing, "this is a really good film...." again and again. that is exactly what happened when i watched this film. i really do not understand how anyone could not like it. i found myself at moments crying and laughing at the very same moment, unable to control how i felt about the scene. the acting is outstanding. eric mabius- why is he not all over movie screens? he was really extraordinary. his seemingly effortless attempt on the screen impacted me in deep visceral ways. i thank him. in my opinion, eric schaeffer is one of the best filmakers around, and i hope he continues to rise to the challenges that he faces while trying to give us art in the face of ferocious commercial filmaking.<br /><br />
