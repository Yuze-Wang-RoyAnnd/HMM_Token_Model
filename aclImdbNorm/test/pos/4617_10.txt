i have to confess i fell into the cynical trap of believing that australians couldn't make drama unless it meant a lot of crying, and i am an australian. sad, isn't it? while this movie does involve crying, its not dramatic crying, its honest emotion shining through.<br /><br />also, this film is a whodunnit. i knew what the final outcome was going to be when i started watching this, so i tried to guess who it was that was going to do it. i missed by a mile.<br /><br />i was stunned when i found out the director, murali thulluri was only around 21 when he made this film. i would love to shake his hand. he knows how to make a movie. i hope he has more coming.<br /><br />all of the characters we meet before the main title credit (about 12 minutes in) is an anti hero. all of them troubled in their own way and all of them as selfish as the next one. even when they are sympathetic.<br /><br />the saddest scene in the movie, and there are some that are difficult to watch) is the final scene where we're formally introduced to the real main character and we're told of their nephew. that scene made me cry.<br /><br />my faith in australian drama has been restored. we're masters at comedy, but i was getting bored with comedy.<br /><br />murali, if you happen to check this out, you touched my soul and for that i can only thank you.
