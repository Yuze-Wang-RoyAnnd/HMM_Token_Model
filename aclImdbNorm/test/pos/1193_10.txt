this is a cult film for many reasons. first because of the phenomenal success as a musical both in broadway and london, then as a musical film. the film is close to the play and some of the provocation of the play is no longer provocative twelve years later. the discourse against the vietnam war is no longer a protest song against the war itself, but a strong song demonstrating how the young people of these late 60s managed to bring the political establishment down. milos forman play with some situations at the end of the 70s like the narrow minded justice, the self-centered umbilical righteousness of the rich or of the little ones who have just one rank of power more than the powerless. he also heavily plays with the racial element and the sexual ambiguity he builds all the time. the film remains pleasant and thoughtful. and of course it is a tremendous thrill to remember these years when we have had the privilege, and that was not a chance, to live them. november 11, 1969, nixon ordering mass celebration for the 1918 armistice, which became the order for teachers at all levels to take their students to the celebration and the march, supporting thus the invasion of cambodia that was in full swing. and some dare give lessons in democracy to foreign countries. i also remember the long campaign for the impeachment of nixon in 1973-1974 that will eventually lead to his resignation and the swearing in of gerald ford, the first vice president, and eventually president, of the us who had not been elected, since he was appointed vice president by the senate after spiro agnew had to resign to face trial, conviction and sentence for embezzlement. of course that makes us think of today when in 2000 a president of the us was not elected by the people but by the supreme court, or of a war that was rejected by millions world wide from the very start, and even before the start, and was started against the better judgment of the united nations and of three permanent members of the security council. and some speak of a new world order based on the respect of others. modern western man seems to have some problems understanding that the world is changing and has already widely and wisely changed. modern western man seems to be kind of out of sync and to need special evening classes to learn that democracy wants the majority in the world to be the majority, and the west is far from that majority, and that if the soviet block had been able to understand that market economy is not capitalism but that market economy can be either socialist or capitalist the berlin wall would have fallen, but the other way round, and that china has learned that lesson marvelously well and is at the foot of the wall they have to climb over to learn that their socialist market economy has to lead to political democracy, but they will, just like vietnam was able to reconstruct itself after thirty years of vicious war aggression and damage. in other words, hair is a perfect food for thought.<br /><br />dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
