walter matthau is wonderful as the "philandering" dentist dr. julian winston whose frequent fibs to girlfriend goldie provide textbook proof of the dangers of lying. goldie hawn's touching kook toni simmons certainly deserved to win her oscar. ingrid bergman's work as the stiff-as-starch nurse stephanie is also touching to watch as she comes out of her shell, slowly and nervously. this is a great movie to watch in the springtime, or any time for that matter. it's very underrated; i never heard about it until i found it in the video store, and what a find!
