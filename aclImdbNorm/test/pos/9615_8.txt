the skeleton of the story is that the main character needs to win a public kung fu tournament with high stakes. the flesh of the story consists of lots of fighting, a love triangle, betrayals, rivalries, and revenge.<br /><br />there is a lot to this story. the main character is very likeable as an even tempered, mild mannered, and very tough country boy. a good versus bad movie is only as good as the villains and the main villains are tough and smart, not to mention ugly, devious and tricky.<br /><br />if there is one weakness, it's the scene where the fiance of the main character is imagining her and the protagonist running towards each other in a flowery field and hugging when they meet. i thought i was watching the sound of music for a second and nearly lost hope for the movie. luckily, the movie recovered quickly with a fight scene.
