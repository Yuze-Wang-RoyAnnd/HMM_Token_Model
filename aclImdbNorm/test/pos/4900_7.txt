a tight-knit musical family, cranky-benevolent father and four vivacious adolescent daughters, is up-rooted by, first, the appearance of felix, a dashing young composer, and, secondly and most profoundly, mickey, his insolently attractive orchestrator friend.<br /><br />it takes a while for michael curtiz to get this piece of americana floating. the first part looks almost like a paraphrasing of a cereal commercial, not without a certain quaint, highly bourgeois charm, and then john garfield enters the scene as the doomed mickey, making his first appearance in motion pictures, with mussed-up black curls, sleepy, hung-over eyes, rude and disheveled, the absolute opposite to jeffrey lynn's smoothly persuasive, madly charming felix. garfield is in complete, and direly needed, counterpoint to the rest of the household ("nothing i would do would surprise me", he muses), and suddenly the movie becomes interesting, although i agree with critics that find the plot-turns insufficiently motivated.<br /><br />the four sisters are rather blandly played and seriously underwritten, but claude rains as the pater familias has his moments.<br /><br />watch it for garfield, though, he is the only really lasting thing about it.
