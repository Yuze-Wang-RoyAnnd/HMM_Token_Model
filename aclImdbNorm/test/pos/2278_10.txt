you have to like baseball, and you have to at least sort of like tom selleck, but if you meet those criteria you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. selleck plays former major league star who finds himself traded (?) to japan as his career winds down. really well thought out and fascinating look at japanese customs and behavior. great supporting performances by selleck's manager ("japan's clint eastwood"), his girl friend takanashi, and his interpreter. the chemistry between selleck and takanashi works very very well, this is really a very nice romantic movie apart from the baseball. look for haysbert as fellow player well before he became a persistent shill for allstate. movie wraps up very nicely. easily in my top fifty all time movies and maybe my favorite one on baseball.
