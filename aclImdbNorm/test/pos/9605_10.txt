having obtained a copy of bostocks cup i must confess it is not as funny as i originally thought!! it is better!!!!! charlie williams ... eat your heart out. match fixing???? never! sloping pitch at 45%? ronnie and reggie kay? george best? the coach driver who thinks pontefract is in south wales ( it's all ponty this and ponty that)bertie masson's (tim healey's)lucky cup hat!! (not that he's into gimmicks) sugar plum fairy????? confused???? watch it again. the innovative use of real footage with bostock players was brilliant and the producer should be proud of giving us a masterpiece. come on itv do the viewers and yourself a favour - show it again!!! please>
