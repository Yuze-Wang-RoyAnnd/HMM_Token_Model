this movie was quite a pleasant surprise. i had anticipated it for a long time, and was afraid going in that it couldn't possibly live up to my expectations.<br /><br />it exceeded them.<br /><br />i adored this movie.<br /><br />hilarious from start to finish (stay until after the end credits!), it is absolutely remarkable how a movie about dumb and annoying characters can be so intelligent, witty, and engaging.<br /><br />with it's obvious matte paintings, the movie's future earth recalls the planet of the apes series and other sci-fi movies of that era.<br /><br />in fact, this movie is essentially planet of the apes, but with people who are the mental equivalent of apes.<br /><br />it moves at a fairly brisk pace, and luke wilson carries the movie quite well, with a character that recalls the one he played in "bottle rocket." (there's even a not-so-subtle nod to "bottle rocket" in an early scene).<br /><br />maya rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former "painter" who was frozen as well.<br /><br />despite all its strengths, "idiocracy" has the distinct feel of a movie that was taken away from the director/editor before it could be fine-tuned.<br /><br />i cannot for the life of me understand why a movie this funny would just be dumped into a few theaters with no advanced screenings, no trailers, no marketing whatsoever.<br /><br />it's as if the studio decided they were not going to spend any more on it and just walked away.<br /><br />or maybe they thought the movie had the makings of a cult classic, and the only way for it to become a true cult classic was to set it up to fail? <br /><br />whatever the case, it is a shame, because mike judge and this film in particular deserve better.<br /><br />i predict this movie will have real legs on dvd, and word of mouth will propel it to the success it deserves.<br /><br />perhaps the fox executives saw themselves in the characters, were confused, and thought it was a documentary?
