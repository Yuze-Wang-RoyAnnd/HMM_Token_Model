<br /><br />since cats have nine lives, i'll give you nine reasons to see this movie:<br /><br />* the kittens berlioz and toulouse playing the piano together (so unbelievably cute!) * the car-chasing dogs napoleon and lafayette * toulouse jumping like electrified every time he wants to be like a tough alley cat * marie sighing romantically while alley cat o'malley seduces her mom * scat cat and his jazz band, singing "ev'rybody wants to be a cat" * stupid but proper and nice english geese amelia and abigail who make the cats walk like geese * o'malley obtaining the "magic carpet" which puts the cheshire cat to shame * roquefort the brave mouse's journey to ask help from alley cats * edgar the butler chase scenes and transition from a nice guy to an insane cat hater due to cat riddance plan gone bad
