viva variety was a unique hybrid program that was both a parody of and a tribute to the programs it represented. <br /><br />it was most directly a mock up of the classic 1970s favorite, "the sonny & cher show," with thomas lennon and kerri kenney playing a divorced show biz couple who were somehow forced to host this program together, the female of the pair towering over the male, and the constant barrage of "insult humor" the couple tossed at each other, plus sketch comedy bits and performances from what are most kindly described as "specialty" acts! <br /><br />the "hybrid" was the mix of fact and fantasy. of course, there was no "mr. and former mrs. laupin," and the program's announcer, johnny bluejeans, was likewise equally fictional. but all the acts that performed were certainly real, and some were even entertaining! but there were also some acts that would have clearly been better suited for the old chuck barris "gong show." <br /><br />the show itself was really more like an extended sketch from "sctv" (it was borne from the mtv series, "the state," after all), and some would suggest that it would have been better as a five minute bit in the mix of a program like that one, rather than a stand alone series. but "viva variety" certainly should get high marks for original concepts, and even though it was often more odd than funny, it was certainly worthwhile, especially when they road tripped to las vegas and brought in even glitzier acts to perform. it's unlikely we'll ever see anything like this on television again.
