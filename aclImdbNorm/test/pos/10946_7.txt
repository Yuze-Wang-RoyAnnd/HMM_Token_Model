this movie, as my chinese girlfriend informed me, features two well-known hong kong pop stars. while this may make the movie a mere marketing stunt, i found the acting acceptable, and they're both cute.<br /><br />the story is pretty poor overall. the vampiric traits and weaknesses are, however, used in humorous ways, and created some uniquely entertaining bits. the quarreling between the two girls made me chuckle, and this gave a fine balance together with the well-executed action scenes to create an entertaining movie.
