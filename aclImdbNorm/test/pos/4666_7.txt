*spoiler alert!! please don't read if you don't want the movie spoiled!!*<br /><br />i was originally planning on seeing this movie this past weekend, but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it. so me & my friend made plans to see it after school today. boy, are we glad we did. the movie starts off in italy, with a planned heist with a group of guys (charlie croker [mark whalberg], steve frezelli [edward norton], lyle, also known as "napster" [seth green, you'll get the nickname later], handsome rob [jason statham], left ear [mos deaf], & john bridger [donald sutherland]) plan a heist to steal 32 gold bricks. this leads to the whole opening, which is a good 10 to 15 minutes, and involves a boat chase, which opens the movie up right. while driving away in their get away van, steve frezelli turns on the group, steals the gold, and kills john bridger, who is pretty much the (retiring) leader of the group. fast foward to a year later, where where stella bridger (charlize theron), john's daughter, is one of the top safe-crackers that anyone can ask for. charlie croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for her father's death, as he called him out of retirement for the heist) says that they've found steve (who has gone into hiding), and want to get back at him for what he did. she at first declines, but later agrees, and the teamgets back together, along with getting the help of wrench (franky g), a mechanic, to carry out the perfect heist, while creating one of the largest traffic jams in los angeles history. this movie is a perfect mix of action with funny bits thrown in throughout. there's an on-running joke about seth green's character, lyle, creating napster and how shawn fanning (who makes a cameo) stole it while he fell asleep, and eventually lyle will only answer if refered to as "napster". there's even a funny line in the movie by seth, who goes "he said in an interview he called it napster because it described his hair, like it was nappy. he callled it that because *i* was napping when he stole it!" the begining and ending sequences are pure genius, and everything in between fits perfectly. the only negative thing i can think of with the movie is that edward norton's acting was a bit weak. he wasn't a big, tough bad guy. he acted like he was being paid and just doing the bare-minimum (which is a fact, as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation). but, even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film, the movie is still very enjoyable, and i definetly recommend seeing it. and even if you're not interested in the actual movie, go to see seth green shine in the comedic role. he's perfect. rating: **** out of *****
