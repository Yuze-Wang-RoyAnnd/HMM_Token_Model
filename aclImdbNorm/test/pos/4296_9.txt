well, what's wrong with the title "separate lies" (accused elsewhere of not being "exciting"). it's cunning, subtle and a bit poetic. (of course there's a phil collins song and a james belushi film called "separate lives", which are alluded to here.) <br /><br />but the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. ok, it's not an "in-your-face" hilarious title, but then it's not an in-your-face hilarious film. please give british films like this a chance. they do try to make people think about important things, as here: how far do you go to protect your life (even if it is a bit rotten) against unexpected disaster. maybe you tell lies. maybe you ignore your loved ones' lies. that can wear a lot of people out. <br /><br />american movies on this theme are abundant, but they usually go much further by involving the use of firearms, which are not a part of everyday life here in europe. <br /><br />maybe we're not so "exciting" over here, but we don't expect slogan-like film titles for films that are not aimed at a massive public.
