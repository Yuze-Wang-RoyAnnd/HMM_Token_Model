there are two things that i noticed in this film. (this is not a spoiler, just a mistake in storytelling.) when cole takes bill to his first b&e, he finds the "box". as soon as cole finds it he says, "the box. everyone's got a box". a minute later, just before he dumps the contents on the floor he says, "we're actually very fortunate. you don't see these often".<br /><br />observation #2 (spoiler alert!)<br /><br />i had to watch the thing three times, i couldn't figure a couple of things out. then i watched the chronological version and saw that they were having flash backs from the latter to the previous during the time changes. so at some points we were actually watching three different times in about 1 min of wall time.<br /><br />that was a good thing because i don't know how many more times i could watch it before returning it to netflix.<br /><br />color me obsessive.
