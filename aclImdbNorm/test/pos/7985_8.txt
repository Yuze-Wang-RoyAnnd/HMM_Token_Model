what can i say, this film is amazing. it has its flaws like every film does for example wobbly headstones in a graveyard, a clearly visible slide board during the penguins death scene, max shreck losing his heavy coat in a split second between shots during the image consultancy scene, batman losing his black eye makeup all of a sudden between shots so he can reveal bruce wayne to catwoman, dialogue being recorded but is played back and spoken differently than when it was spoken in the first place and lastly catwoman all of a sudden knows how to use a bull whip without any training whatsoever. these flaws are minor compared to some you would see in for example batman forever where the riddler can obviously be seen waiting for his cue or val kilmer's hair changing between shots.<br /><br />what makes this film so deserving of an 8/10 is the great acting because the performances are absolutely amazing. michael keaton reprises his role as batman and has a lot more to do in this film. he looks more comfortable in the role the second time around and is on par with the villains performances. danny devito is the perfect penguin. i really like the conversion of the penguin into the grotesque penguin man instead of the non threatening character from the comics or tv show because now the character has more depth and has a far more interesting story that generates from the basic need of family and to feel accepted and wanted. this gives us an evil character who we feel sympathy for because he was rejected for being what he is which is not his fault. michelle pfeiffer is excellent as catwoman. she is sleet and sexy and she is also a villain we can feel sorry for because of the way she is victimised. christopher walken is a great secondary villain and is so interesting a character even though he is not even in the batman universe.<br /><br />the soundtrack is far better than the first and danny elfman gets more of a chance to show off his musical talents this time around. the sets are amazing. they are detailed, eye catching, sinister, gothic , unique, dark and so many other adjectives can describe how amazing they look. the costumes and make up are great and obviously a lot of work went into making them and all the work pays off because the batsuit is better, the cat suit is amazing to look at and the penguin make up and effects are so convincing.the animatronic penguins look really realistic and are played to good effect. the script is really good and the storyline in my opinion is a plausible one. overall, because of all these factors this film deserves an 8/10 and stands as my favourite of all the batman films
