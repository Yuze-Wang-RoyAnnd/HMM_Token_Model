i just saw "a tale of two sisters" last night and really enjoyed it. i've been a big fan of asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from south korea. there aren't many jump out at you scares as in the usual american horror film, but the director does maintain the off-kilter and foreboding mood very well, especially in the awkward character interactions with each other. most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone's "there's something under the bed" fears from when they were a child, but in this case, it's the closet and the sink. i also liked how the director was able to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together. he's also good at revealing people's inner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her make-up in the mirror or her sitting in front of the flickering tv. i think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt hanging over you.<br /><br />major spoilers ahead (do not read any further if you do not want the twists of the movie revealed) i was following the story pretty well, but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part. however, i think the flashback at the end definitely tied everything together. the film is very much like "the machinist" in the way two of the character's joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions.<br /><br />here's my interpretation of the film. the su-yeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of su-mi or the actual ghost of su-yeon that only su-mi can see and interact with. the initial stepmother that we see is, in my opinion a delusion of su-mi. there is a real stepmother, however, and she first appears in the film when she's wearing the gray pantsuit. i believe it's the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she doesn't appear until he pick her up and brings her to the house. the stepmother before that point is imagined by su-mi (perhaps part of her split personality?) that explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her like she's crazy and doesn't remember anything that she recounts. i think it was su-mi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality. the film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her make-up in the mirror, which is revealed later to actually be su-mi wiping her make-up in the mirror.<br /><br />i think the ghosts in the house aren't entirely imagined by su-mi, and are either of su-yeon or the mother or both. in the final flashback, it is revealed the su-yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. this is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink. also, it's the hairpin that su-yeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink.<br /><br />the real stepmother, in the end, gets punished by the ghost of su-yeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like the ring. after that, the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death, while su-mi unintentionally played a supporting role.<br /><br />i wonder if the "mother" that su-yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry, in the flashback, is a ghost already. perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet. that's left ambiguous.<br /><br />other things that are suggested, but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother, at some point, was a nurse, perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too. it's not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself. it's also suggested that the mother had mental issues too, requiring a nurse. the stepmother alludes to this when she tells su-mi, you're beginning to take after your mother. i don't think she meant just physically.<br /><br />also, if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually su-mi, then there's the suggestion of incest too, since the father sleeps with her. is that why su-mi freaks out and shouts, "don't touch me" each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes? is that the "filthy things that you've done" that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father? this film is interesting in it's capacity for different interpretations. a few of the scenes, however, were kind of derivative, such as the woman in the black crawling around scene, which reminded me of the herky-jerky movements of kayako in the ju-on/the grudge films. also, the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of the ring. furthermore, just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from "the sixth sense" or "the others".<br /><br />overall, i enjoyed it, however, and it will be interesting to see how the hollywood remake (that's already in production) turns out. i have to be honest, i liked both "the ring" and "the grudge", so i'm not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can't be good too. one remake that i'm really excited about is "dark water" coming out this summer. i haven't seen the original japanese version yet, but both films are definitely on my to-see list.
