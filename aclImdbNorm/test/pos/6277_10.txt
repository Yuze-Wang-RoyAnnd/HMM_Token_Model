to be frank, this is probably the best version in my book as a sound movie version of the jazz singer. the 1927 version is really a silent movie despite its build-up as the first talkie.<br /><br />danny thomas is a great comedian, and he sings very well. he does the jewish stuff with feeling. peggy lee is great and any film that has her is always entertaining. allan joslyn is not too entertaining and we could have done without him. one question: since when do cantors live in such luxurious houses???
