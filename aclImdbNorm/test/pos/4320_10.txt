*could contain spoilers, read only after seeing last episode season 2* think about it. the guys on the north pole? center of the earth? looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? they also said something about: "did we miss it again?" so there was another abnormality? of course that was when the plain crashed! i think this whole island is a setup. set up by her daddy. she found out about it and is looking for her desmond. how else can she know what to look for.<br /><br />so basically it's an island in a magnetic shield. all of it is fake. all the signs are there. fake beards, fake doors, fake medicine, fake observations stations, with fake air shafts that lead to nothing. it's a project indeed, and because of the final scene in the season 2 finale i know it has to do something with desmond, his chick and her dad (and probably libby, she's weird, maybe she actually has something to do with the plane crashing, ok now i'm drifting off).<br /><br />also in this episode, henry gail tells michael to go to some coordinates, and he'll find rescue their. this is probably some sort of door in the magnetic shield. "once you're gone. there is no way back".<br /><br />i think it's pretty obvious, despite of the numerous questions i still have and hope to get answers for in the next season. if you think back on what we've learned in season 1 and 2, i'm sure we'll get loads of answers in season 3.<br /><br />can't wait.<br /><br />can anyone agree on this theory? hope to hear from you...
