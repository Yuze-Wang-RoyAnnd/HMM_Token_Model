it took me years to finally catch this gem of a film and it was worth the wait. in nearly all of his films clint always plays the hero. be it hero, anti-hero or avenging hero. in this film he is pure villain and he plays it well.<br /><br />as a wounded union soldier he is brought into a confederate girls school by the students and teachers to heal. soon after he begins to seduce the ladies no matter their age and some are quite young. he also plays upon their jealousies and pits them against each other. in the end you are never so happy to see clint die a terrible death.<br /><br />that is what makes this film such a gem. clint has never done any other film like it and after seeing this film you wish he had. he plays the role of the villain so well it will make you wonder why he never did any more films like it. it also explains why the film is not seen very often. most people don't want to see clint as the villain and with dirty harry being released shortly after this film it has become a hidden gem. if you are a clint eastwood fan you owe it to yourself to see this film. you might not like what you will see but you won't soon forget it.
