this was the one movie to see about the civi war. my aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the justin and madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. the script was genuine, and accurate. the costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. i dearly love patrick swayze and james ried. they were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. the civil war is my favorite thing in american history, and i love movies about it. i have seen quite a few, and this movie and it's sequal north and south book 2 took the cake. if you haven't seen it, rent it. as soon as possible. it's quite an eduation.
