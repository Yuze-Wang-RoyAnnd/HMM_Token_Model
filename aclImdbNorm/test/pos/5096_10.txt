"chips" is an excellent blend of music, light comedy and drama with a picture perfect performance by peter o' toole and and effortless romantic supporting performance by petula clark. o' toole is able to show the shy, uncommunicative teacher that wishes so much to be loved by his students and is only able to express his love when he married katherine (clark). she brings him the world "what a lot of flowers" and he is forever changed. he becomes the beloved headmaster of brookfield through tragedy but knows he could only have achieved his goal through katherine's love. the songs (with the exception of the music hall number) are all "thought-songs" coming from character's emotions and thoughts and, the more you listen to them, the more beautiful they become - "walk through the world with me" and "you and i". o'toole's finest moment is the final speech he gives to the students (it was the reason for the oscar nomination). as a teacher, we question what "book" learning ever gets through - but, as chips says, we did teach them how to behave with each other and that is what really counts. beautifully filmed, perfectly orchestrated by john williams and one of the most moving films about love and how it can change you. "did i fill the world with love?" the boys sing their school song. by the end, chips realizes he was able to do it - but only cause catherine was there.
