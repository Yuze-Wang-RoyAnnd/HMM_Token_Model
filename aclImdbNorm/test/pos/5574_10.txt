after 2 years of using this site for movie reviews, i finally registered with imdb just so i could give farscape a "10." the show's writers, cast and crew have proven themselves the unambiguous masters of the science fiction genre. even those who do not normally appreciate sci-fi should be encouraged to give this exceptional series a chance!<br /><br />farscape's virtues are simply too numerous to list, but one of them stands out above all; the quality of the writing is amazing. i haven't heard dialogue this good since "blake's 7." in fact, farscape feels a lot like a "blake's 7" with good special effects and a bit more romance.<br /><br />everyone, enjoy!
