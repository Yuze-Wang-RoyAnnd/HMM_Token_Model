you know the saying "curiosity killed the cat"? well, i have heard so much about this film, from a magazine that named this one of the most shocking movies of all time, my 1001 movies you must see before you die, my sister who saw this at a film festival, and the i love the 70's show on vh1. i just had to see this movie since it was named the grossest movie of all time, and well, after viewing this film last night, i have to say that it really did live up to it's title. my god, this movie was so weird! i thought i really did see it all with some of the sickest movies and tv shows i've seen, some things i guess will always still feel like a shock.<br /><br />well, babs johnson, aka divine, has been named the filthiest person alive and a jealous couple named the marbles are competing for that title. they want to take divine out and be named the filthiest couple alive by kidnapping women, raping them, impregnating them, and selling their babies to lesbian couples. but it seems like divine and her family of well... i don't know, seems to keep the title by having sex with chickens, butt lip syncing, eating dog feces, stuffing meat up their skirts, incest, and it just gets grosser and grosser.<br /><br />pink flamingos is horribly acted, horribly made, and well, just plain horrible. the reason for the 10 rating i'm going to give it is due to the fact, well, how could you rate this film? i always rate, so i just figure what the heck? through the grossness of this film, you have got to give john waters some credit, who the heck would ever think of this movie over 35 years later? to the cast and crew who worked on this film, you guys are just plain nasty!<br /><br />10/10
