barry kane is an aircraft factory worker.suddenly sabotage takes place at the factory and starts a fire.his best friend is killed.they accuse him of the deed but kane knows it was a man named fry who was there.he becomes a fugitive and goes to find this man named fry.he's helped by a kind blind man.he lets his niece, the billboard model patricia martin take the man to a local blacksmith to have his handcuffs removed.they don't end up there for the woman doesn't believe barry and wants to take him to the police.but soon he changes her mind about barry and they find out about another sabotage attempt that's going to take place soon.there's a group of anti-american fascists.and frank fry is a member of that group.saboteur (1942) is another example of the fact alfred hitchcock could not make a bad movie.robert cummings plays barry kane and he's really good at that.priscilla lane with her good looks plays pat martin.also really good.otto kruger makes a great main villain as the leader of the fascist group, charles tobin.norman lloyd, still alive at 94, plays fry and makes a very believable crook.vaughan glaser is the most sympathetic character as the blind man philip martin.the dance hall sequence is fantastic.and also the moments on the circus train.in the end we're at the statue of liberty.
