"fame" had been one of my favorite movies for years! it is not just an 80's musical movie of "that" high school in nyc, it is legendary- people no longer refer to the high school of performing arts but "the fame school"!!<br /><br />the characters are real, they are not "hollywood" and their stories are real. the film follows them through the four years of school, starting with a powerful monologue by one student at auditions and finishing with a spectacular graduation show.<br /><br />apparently some find the broadway show better, however it is my opinion that you should definitely see this movie anyway, and then have your own view. for anyone who enjoys movie watching and would like to have the "classics" down, this is surely one of them. it is an example of one of those movies that was really great, with actors that we loved for those 2 hours, and then never saw them again... they are classic "fame students".<br /><br />make fame live forever.
