i don't really know when it was that tv stations began preferring to have handsome men as their reporters - regardless of the mens' iqs - but it was clearly a problem by the time that "broadcast news" came out, and the movie does a really good job looking at it. portraying a love triangle between pretty boy air-head reporter tom grunick (william hurt), intelligent but nervous reporter aaron altman (albert brooks) and producer jane craig (holly hunter), the movie pulls no punches. probably the best line in the movie is when tom says something like: "i don't really understand any of what i'm reporting." and in the era of fox news and such things, a movie like this becomes even more important.<br /><br />all in all, definitely a movie that i recommend. also starring robert prosky, lois chiles, joan cusack, and jack nicholson in a supporting role as the anchorman.
