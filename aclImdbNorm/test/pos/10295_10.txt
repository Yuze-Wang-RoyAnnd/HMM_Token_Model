i watched this film for the second time tonight after about three years and it was as wonderful as before...<br /><br />there are more than a dozen modern stunning french films from en couer de hiver to the three colours trilogy and all of them are special. this film is one of them. a true delight with so many great things going for it from the homage to hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in romane and monica. while monica is very beautiful, romane is a very sexy lady and steals many of the scenes she inhabits.<br /><br />i am not sure why people think this film is convoluted as the scenes are such a perfect blend of past and present acting as a counterpoint to the characters' own remarkable journey that the film simply flows and you barely realise that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery have left the viewed enchanted and bewitched. <br /><br />like most french and european films this story would never translate across the atlantic as no studio could capture the magic without throttling the life out of it with the hollywood bleaching common to most movies that become lost in translation. americans make brilliant films, but not of this type... perhaps if they let someone like a young polanski work on it then maybe they would not totally butcher an english version...<br /><br />for those who do not watch subtitled films you will spend a lifetime in ignorant bliss. for those who can read then you would be spiting yourself to miss films like this...<br /><br />i would describe this as neo-franco-noir, but only to cheese off the reviewer who called this film elitist. i think i saw him doing an add for four-and-twenty-pies. he thinks romane bohringer is a type of french mayonnaise...it is arty in the way that pulp fiction is arty...but with more gallic savoire faire...<br /><br />10 out of 10 with every viewing...and has anyone got romane's phone number...she is the perfect french salad dressing...
