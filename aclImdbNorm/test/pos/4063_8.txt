"showtime" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what i expected months ago when i first heard about eddie murphy and robert di niro teaming up for a comedy. overall, it was pretty good! as "real life" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but duh--- this is a comedy. also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a schwartzenegger movie, i found it a bit tiresome and overdone. 9/11 sensibilities aside, for myself, all that pyro-techno hyper-effect stuff had been getting really old these past few years. it seemed a lame substitute for characterization, story, and engaging emotions. i hope the lesser quantity of it in "showtime" is an indicator of a trend in hollywood. a trend downwards, of less use of the silly, less use of the exploding building.<br /><br />di niro and murphy are two of my favorites. their screen presence and charisma-- and even their character depth-- have been "a joy to behold" for many years. that can't be dismissed here--- they are engaging actors, and entertaining and appealing in this movie. i can't put my finger on it, but perhaps the explosions, the excessive fx, and all of that diminished the final product??? perhaps, or perhaps it was something else, or a combination of factors that gives one the sense that the movie didn't achieve its highest potential. whatever it was, "showtime" was entertaining-- i probably will buy the dvd when it comes out-- but i had the vibe that it nonetheless wasn't all it could have been. at least not all i had hoped for.<br /><br />very good movie, but not a great movie. i gave it an 8 out of 10.
