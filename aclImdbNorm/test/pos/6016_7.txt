based on the memoirs of gypsy rose lee, who painted a much more affectionate picture of their mother than did her sister, actress "baby" june havoc, in her autobiography, "early havoc" on which "they shoot horses, don't they?" was loosely based. i saw ethyl merman in the original broadway production of gypsy, and she was great as "mama rose" but certainly more "merman" than rose. i was disappointed with rosalind russell's portrayal in the 1962 movie version. an otherwise excellent actress, russell was a very wooden substitute for merman. bette midler, by contrast, was better and more believable than merman and i'd recommend her performance as the definitive one.
