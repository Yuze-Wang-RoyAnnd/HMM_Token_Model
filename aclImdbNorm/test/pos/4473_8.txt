a film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of "the english patient," even down to a scene similar to when ralph fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff. in "a passion in the desert," the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). historically expanded from a very short balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. final shot will haunt me for weeks.
