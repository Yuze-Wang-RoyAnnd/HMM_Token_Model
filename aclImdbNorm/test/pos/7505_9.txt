being a retired medical/health field "toiler in the vinyard" i never get tired of seeing this film. paddy chayefsky was a friend of my college comp teacher & visited him & us during several clases back in 1958. his writing ability has stood the test of time & the "hospital" is as fresh as it was in 1971. i can watch it every week & still find something new. so many of the supporting cast members went unto bigger & better roles in both tv & film. george scott made only a few comedies, but his timing & patter are as good as jackie gleason & steve msrtin. mental humour rather than physcial/slapstick wins in my book every time. and still a family film with only 1, four letter word during entire film
