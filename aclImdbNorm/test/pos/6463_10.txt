i cry at a lot of movies. call me sentimental. call me one of those viewers who always likes to see a happy ending. this movie, though it has a sad ending, was great! of all of the actors that i would love to have lunch with, it would be sidney poitier. his acting, along with john cassavetes and jack warden (of 12 angry men fame)is stellar. his character, who befriends a man on the run (cassavetes) and helps him out in every way possible is incredible.<br /><br />this is another one of those forgotten noirs made during the end of the noirish era. it is well done, has a superb cast, extremely talented acting, and great cinematography. it is a film worth watching over and over again. i highly recommend this one! this is just another truly great film done by mr. poitier and should be sold on dvd. even though i cried, kudos to such great art!
