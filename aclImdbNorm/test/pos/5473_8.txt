seriously any film with john malkovich is usually very good. and this includes clint eastwood, rene russo, john mahoney (frasier), dylan mcdermott (the practice), and many more great actors.<br /><br />clint is getting old now but thanks he is also an awesome director (in his own right).<br /><br />we are used to wolfgang "water films" like das boot, poseidon and perfect storm - this was really different but just as sublimely directed.<br /><br />the premise of the assassin is as serious as it comes, the film is well paced, some of the violence is a bit... but altogether recommended (but not for kids).
