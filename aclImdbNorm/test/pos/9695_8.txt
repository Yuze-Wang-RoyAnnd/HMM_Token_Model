does exactly what you expect, and then some. the first movie, was a step up from the tv show with sicker stunts airing uncensored and a gnarly factor that had increased. surprisingly, jackass number two is even more twisted.<br /><br />the stunts have become more dangerous and spectacular, with some mind blowing painful antics sprinkled with good fun skits to keep that smile turning into a curl of disgust.<br /><br />knoxville, like always, dominates the proceedings, but this time he has reason to take centre stage as he volunteers for the most dangerous and idiotic of all the stunts, with bam magera also proving himself as wild as ever, despite having had his image toned down in 'viva la bam'. surprisingly, the infamous wild boys (steve o and chris pontius) seem to take part in fewer of the skits, despite being focal in the previous outings.<br /><br />if you like jackass or dirty sanchez then you will definitely enjoy this film, and will laugh your guts out for the 100 minutes of its duration, if you see it as childish, disgusting or a sad snapshot of the youth culture of today, you will find it as offencive as ever. so f**k off.
