this is the greatest movie if you want inspiration on following your heart and never giving up on your dream. elizabeth taylor is velvet and in her prime (of her childhood, at least), mickey rooney is a cynical friend who eventually becomes her trainer and they go off to the grand national steeplechase with her beloved horse "the pi"--short for "pirate"--only to have velvet become the jockey and have a chance at victory. to those of you who have not seen it yet, i won't give away the ending but you should see it and once you do you'll love it. notice a very young angela lansbury as velvet's eldest sister.
