it's less visceral than the only other tsai film i've seen ("vive l'amour"), but the idea of doorways (holes) into others' emotions and existences is vividly portrayed here, as tsai sets up long shot after long shot, usually with long takes, suggesting a sense of alienation in taipei. the musical interludes, inspired by grace chang, are perplexing but welcome mile-markers that add new dimensions to the slowly evolving relationship between the young man upstairs and the woman downstairs. it's not necessarily an easy film to watch (although it's not heavy-handed by any means), so i'd warn any casual viewers who are looking for some "indie" entertainment (like tarantino or guy ritchie). but if you'd like to know something about isolation among city-dwellers in taiwan, and something more universal about city alienation and romantic yearning, then watch this film immediately.
