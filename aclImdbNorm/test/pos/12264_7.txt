james l. brook is one of those directors who always seems to take a quirky look at life. he isn't only the producer for "the simpsons," he has some classic comedies under his belt -- "broadcast news" is one of them.<br /><br />although it doesn't match his later effort "as good as it gets," "broadcast news" is still a very clever, funny and witty movie about a television broadcasting station and all the problems they suffer. there's a great comedic sequence of physical humor where joan cusack is running around the building trying to rush a news tape to the editing room in a matter of mere minutes before it is to be broadcast live on tv.<br /><br />this isn't only very truthful in terms of how hectic broadcasting stations are operated, but also a skillful and honest portrayal of human beings.<br /><br />a low-key, subtle movie with good acting (especially from hurt, who i don't always like so much) and apt direction.
