this was an excellent show. it came on pbs back home in chicago and i remember cindy herron (from envogue) played the teen aged daughter. the show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. it was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from oakland or somewhere (i can't remember). i remember several episodes but the one i remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time. i was probably 7-8 when i first watched it and i was able to keep up with the program. this was a great show. i can't remember the name of the guy who played the son on the show, but i always got him confused with kevin hooks.
