ok, ok, i must say i was impressed. it's hard to say what i'm more impressed with: my ability to choose the right romantic comedy to watch so that i don't gouge my eyes out, or the movie itself. either way, "hitch" was pretty darn good. hey, it was good enough for me to watch twice. will smith was funny and good. kevin james was just hilarious, and absolutely essential for the movie. as much as this movie centered around hitch (will smith), without kevin james it's just not the same.<br /><br />the story is: hitch is a match maker that helps the guy woo the girl. his job is to create the chance for the girl to notice the guy when she otherwise wouldn't. after the encounter, the rest is all up to the guy to make or break the relationship. he works on referral only and stays largely unnoticed during the process. albert (kevin james) is hitch's project this time around, and albert has eyes on allegra cole (amber valleta) a paris hilton type figure. while that plot unfolds, hitch himself has eyes on sara (eva mendes), a sharp, independent, fanged gossip columnist that wants nothing to do with a relationship.<br /><br />the two stories make for some funny moments and they tie together for a bit of a quagmire. of course no love story is complete without the obligatory miscommunication, misunderstanding, or mishap to send the guy chasing after the girl. fortunately, they make it brief and unsappy. hitch was a fun and funny movie that flowed very well and rolled along without a hitch.
