although i have definitely read this particular agatha christie book at some point, i didn't remember anything about it except the name "abernethie". which is a good thing, because seeing this story unfold without knowing how it will play out allowed me to appreciate once more the sheer genius of agatha christie: the way she misleads you and then pulls the rug out from under your feet is the main reason for her success and timelessness. in addition to her stories, the excellent production values, beautiful locations, wonderful music, top-notch acting, elegant directing, etc. are the reasons for this series' success and timelessness - and all those virtues are present in "after the funeral". a word of advice: be alert right from the start - there are clues dropped all over the place even in the opening sequence! there are some quite unnerving moments as well, in contrast to the peaceful-looking english-countryside locations, and some small touches of humor. a must-see for mystery buffs, and just a very good film in general.
