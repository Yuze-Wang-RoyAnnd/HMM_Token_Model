crossfire remains one of the best hollywood message movies because, unlike the admirably intentioned gentleman's agreement, which it beat to theatres by a few months, it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying "it's because i'm jewish, isn't it?" it's much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical. somewhat shamefully, the brief featurette on the warners' dvd doesn't mention that novelist richard brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti-semitic one, but it's interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is jewish, there's little doubt in sam levene's performance that the character is in fact also gay
