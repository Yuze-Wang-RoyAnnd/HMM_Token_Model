if you like cagney you'll like this film. it has the pretense of american integrity at any cost, personal or social. cagney plays the head of weights and measures in nyc. cagney goes up against crooked politicians, the criminal underground, a prominent philanthropist and simple grocers who add a few ounces to the price of a chicken. the chicken scene is hilarious where cagney finds a weight placed in the bird cavity by an unsuspecting butcher. the chicken gets tossed around the shop in a hilarious scene about who controls the "evidence". if you like old telephones there are interesting scenes of dials, phones and even bizarre phone cords. compared to a lot of film made today this is pure entertainment and includes mystery with comedy and a message that honesty above all should be the guiding principle of humanity. made in simpler times it reflects a world we can't find today. the fashion (especially hats) outwear and automobiles all play a prominent visual role in defining this little film.
