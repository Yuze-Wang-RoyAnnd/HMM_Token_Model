despite its ultra low budget, "sorte nula" is the most successful portuguese film of 2004. and i must say, a well deserved success. what i love about "sorte nula" the most is the intricate detail that fernando fragata went to keep you interested as to what is going on and just what will happen next. it's very detailed and superbly advanced for a seemingly simple love-story-gone-bad thriller. what's even more enjoyable and ironic about this is the fact that the characters are in the same situation, not one of them knows the entire story and are left to their own assumptions making "sorte nula" a cut above the rest. this is definitely not a film you want to walk out on for a bathroom break as you will undoubtedly miss something important. i feel one of the film's major attributes would have to be the environment that it establishes. it's creepy but hilarious at the same time. i read somewhere someone quoting this film by saying, "...it's was like watching hitchcock..." and i couldn't agree more!! i love movies like that, where you have to pay attention to everything in order to fully understand what is going on. 9/10
