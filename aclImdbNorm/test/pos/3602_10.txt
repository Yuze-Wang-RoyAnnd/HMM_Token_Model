these critics need to find a new job!!! this movie is based on a true story, which has made history. it illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all. the breathtaking chephallonia of greece has captured my heart and soul as if i too were there. the blue eyed cage & the delightful cruz were amazing! together they perfectly portrayed how a mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war. this movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it!!!!
