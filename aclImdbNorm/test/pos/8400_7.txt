this miniseries is a reasonable sequel to the original gone with the wind. if one views this on its own merit (and not immediately following the original), it comes out pretty good. i am sure that most viewers will question the performances of scarlett and rhett, but it seems unlikely that anyone else could have done better. many of the characters here are new to this storyline, so comparison in those cases (rhett's mother, uncle henry hamilton, will benteen)is not a problem. no one will every be vivien leigh or clark gable.<br /><br />the best part of the whole production is the beautiful scenery of springtime charleston and ireland. watch it for that alone. obviously, this was a high budget tv miniseries. it follows the book for a while, then has a totally new plot when scarlett goes to ireland.<br /><br />the acting is credible if nothing special--kind of the way i feel about roger moore following sean connery for james bond.
