when going to see rendition, i was expecting an exciting film on a controversial topic with big-name actors. i was not expecting a film that was so engrossing, exciting, poetic, and sad that picked me up from the very beginning and didn't let me go, even after i left the theater. a word of advice to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, don't let your politics come in the way of enjoying (or not enjoying) this film. take it for what it is. i saw this with my conservative jewish family (i'm the black sheep, the pseudo-liberal college student) and i thought they would write it off as "liberal propaganda". instead, they said it was a great film with excellent performances (they like to fancy themselves film critics).<br /><br />it's sad that a movie like this has to be marketed by its oscar-affiliated actors, while leaving out the constantly underrated sarsgaard as well as new talent like the truly excellent metwally. the entire cast gave good performances, with some standing out much more than others; my only problem with it was that there was a lot going on which didn't allow for much screen time for each of the characters. in fact, i felt like the "sub-plot" with fatima and khalid was just as prominent on screen as anwar's part of the story.<br /><br />the characters all have the potential to fall into stereotypes, but the actors do a good enough job to give them depth with the little screen time they have. streep is truly terrific, as a heartless senator, and as much as i don't want to see the actress in such a terrible role its impossible not to believe her. gyllenhaal, who will probably be one of the oscar nods for this movie, seems a bit unsure in his role at times. h's trying to portray his inner conflict but usually just comes off like he either forgot his lines or he doesn't know how he should feel. sarsgaard gave an excellent performance; his unforgettable confrontation with streep is easily one of the best parts of the movie. metwally, again, was terrific, and i hope to see him in more mainstream films. it's a shame that gyllenhaal with probably get nominated before him. yigal naor, as shown on imdb, has been is some films already but he is a newcomer in my eyes. he, along with mohammed khouas and zineb oukach, all gave great performances.<br /><br />the story of fatima and khalid was not given any credit in commercials, but it brings a sad humanity to the story. the narrative was interesting as i was trying to really connect the two story until it was plainly told to us at the end. i've read some comments on here that say the love story was useless, but i disagree. i think it definitely shows another side to the controversial issue as well as humanity in general. khalid was the real terrorist, but he was doing it to avenge his brother, and even though he is responsible for the attack, you see a humane side to him through the story with fatima. not that i think we should feel bad for actual terrorists, but i think the "we are all people" theme was definitely relevant.<br /><br />whatever your feelings on terrorism, politics, etc. leave it out of the theater. the bottom line is this is an interesting story with a message we all need to hear.
