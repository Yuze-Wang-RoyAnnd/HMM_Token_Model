i hadn't planned on seeing this movie, however i wasn't disappointed when a friend dragged me along. although there are no real surprises here, the guys do reasonably well with their obviously modest budget.<br /><br />if you've seen the trailer you probably know what to expect from this type of movie and there's a pretty constant stream of jokes here, with a couple of classic moments, with the highpoint probably being an excellent flashback to what the guys were like in the 1980's. also, i've read elsewhere that the ending was a disappointment, but i found it refreshingly different from what i had expected from this genre.<br /><br />overall, this movie wont change your life, but it's got enough laughs there to keep you entertained throughout.
