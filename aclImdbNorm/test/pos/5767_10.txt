this is probably the funniest thing i have ever seen - from start to finish it was perfect in timing, atmosphere, punch lines, background music, fighting sequences and every other possible aspect you can think of. to be absolutely honest i find this movie as funny as their (rik & ade's) sitcom "bottom" - maybe even funnier. i laughed constantly throughout the whole movie and can only recommend seeing this film... however, if you watch it without knowing (or liking?) the type of comedy rik mayall and ade edmondson has done before, you might not think it's funny at all - but i really can't understand those who dislike it - this is humour folks!!! (people getting hit with frying pans, guys running around wearing red rubber lingerie, green vomit filling the hallways, guys getting kicked in the b******s and getting candlesticks in the eyes - how can this not be funny???) 10/10
