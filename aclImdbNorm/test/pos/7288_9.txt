ok..you people need to settle down! this movie is not that bad. i saw it for the first time last night and fell in love with it! i do have to admit that i have never been a fan of leelee sobieski but she grew on me in this movie. i do think josh hartnett is good looking, but c'mon..chris klein is the most gorgeous man i think i have ever seen!!! he made that movie better for me. c'mon girls..when he has no shirt on and goes to get water i know your mouth dropped. yes, i know in the beginning he is a jerk, but in the end he realizes how he acted and learns to be a great guy. if he wouldn't have come at the end..then i would have been mad. i do think a couple of lines did not need to be said but all in all it was a great movie! i definitely recommend it!
