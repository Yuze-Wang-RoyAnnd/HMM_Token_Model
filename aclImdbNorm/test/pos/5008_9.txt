this show was a pleasant surprise after watching mad tv on a saturday night. spike is an excellent host that you can tell is still getting used to it but he is doing great adjusting to his new job. i can imagine it being a difficult transition from writer(seinfeld) to host however, unlike a lot of new talk show hosts he does not let airtime ride while trying to figure out what to do next. he is quick-minded and each segment and section rolls into one another smoothly. it also doesn't hurt that he's kinda sexy in a nerdy type of way so he's not hard on the eyes like leno or letterman. i can't remember the exact episode date that was my favorite but i especially loved the idiot paparazzi skit with a fake j-lo and katie holmes. great new show!!
