i was a marine at camp pendleton when the d.i. came out (1st marine division, 11th marine regiment, 3rd battalion, i-battery). i still remember standing in line with a bunch of other marines to see the movie at the "star" theater in oceanside, california.<br /><br />we did not remotely expect the movie to portray everything we experienced in boot camp but we were all pleasantly surprised at how well done the movie was. the idea of using real marines in the movie was a great idea (i believe they were all real drill instructors too). as good an actor as jack webb was, he just couldn't "call cadence" like a real marine drill instructor.<br /><br />all of us got a laugh when the "problem" recruit's mother came to boot camp to talk to the captain. never in a million years would this have happened, but that's hollywood, and we didn't let that episode keep us from enjoying the movie.<br /><br />i went through boot camp at mcrd in san diego during the summer of 1956, and at that time there was virtually no limits as to what the d.i.'s could do to you. the "ribbon creek" event at parris island had not yet affected boot camp, at least not at mcrd - san diego.<br /><br />i agree with what a lot of the other reviewers have commented on concerning sgt. moore's "stiffness" around his girl friend. i believe this was just webb's acting style, and although they could have deleted this part of the movie, it didn't really hurt the production that much.<br /><br />one minor note, the character (uncredited) of "pvt. rodriguez" was played by one of my drill instructors, sgt. peter j. o'neill. sgt. o'neill used to tell us that some day he wanted to be an actor. we secretly laughed at this, but he surprised us all. he was a great drill instructor, and i thought he did well in his bit part. also, he really did enjoy throwing knives. he often demonstrated his skill to us that summer in boot camp. i have often wondered if he is still alive.
