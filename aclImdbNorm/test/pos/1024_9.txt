postwar england, the dawn of the "atomic age". yet, the worries of a young schoolboy yearning to experience his first "kiss" cannot be derailed by something as inconsequential as the bomb. this was a delightful if not educational look at young love from the vantage point of an adolescent male and his world of the<br /><br />1940's. free of political correctness and preachy messages, this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the mind (and<br /><br />hormones) of a young teenager can create. wonderful subplots<br /><br />maintain character interest ala "gregory's girl", and plenty<br /><br />of well blocked shots help keep up the imagery of this era. this is a very good story for anyone, young or old, who has<br /><br />ever been in love, or ever wanted to be. does he ever get his wish? watch it and see.
