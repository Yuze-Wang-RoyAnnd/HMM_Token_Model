visconti's masterpiece! i admit that i am unfamiliar with much of his work but i cannot imagine his other work surpassing this fabulous film. last night i watched death in venice after an absence of about 25 years and was totally captivated by all that i saw. this captivation was a pastiche composed of many elements: the extraordinary shots directed by visconte, primarily his love of long, languorous shots of people dining, swimming, walking and containing a significant character passing through this mass of people; the cinematographers brilliant interpretation of visconti's shot selection; the acting by the principles without over-riding dialog and conveying the scenes complexity through facial features alone.<br /><br />it is true: young people watching this film for the first time must be aware that they are watching a unique film, a film that could not be made in 2006. a film whose time rests in those brief handful of years in the sixties and early seventies of the last century when artistic license was passed to film directors and money-men took secondary roles. as many of the recent imdb commentator's have written, this film, in their judgment, is long, boring (too little action) and pretentious. i suppose by the standards of hollywood pap, these comments contain merit. unfortunately they tragically minimize the amazing beauty and depth of this work and others like it from those years.<br /><br />please, if you have not seen death in venice, rent a copy and immerse yourself in a film and story from another time. you will be rewarded.
