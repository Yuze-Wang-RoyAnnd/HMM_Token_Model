watching this ppv, i had high expectations for it, since smackdown is the best show in wwe, this is a very good ppv as it is the last one before wrestlemania.<br /><br />first match-hardy boys & chris benoit vs. mvp & mnm w/ melina in a 6 man tag team match good way to start the match. it started a bit slow at the start, but later the pace quickened & the match got more exciting & entertaining. benoit rolls through & makes joey mercury tap out to get a victory for the hardy boys & himself. 6/10<br /><br />second match- gregory helms {champion} vs. shannon moore vs. funaki vs. chavo guerrero vs. daivairi vs. scotty 2 hotty vs. jamie noble vs. jimmy wang yang in an open cruiserweight invitational match for the wwe cruiserweight championship i'm a very big fan of cruiserweights, & i never get disappointed watching them, especially in this match here. chavo guerrero nails the frog splash on jimmy wang yang to get the win & become the new wwe cruiserweight champion. 5/10<br /><br />third match- finlay & little bastard vs. boogeyman & little boogeyman this was not really a wrestling match, it was more like a comedy match, despite not being a clear wrestling contest, it still entertained me with the funny antics. finlay nails the little boogeyman with the shillaegh to get the win. boogeyman does not deserve to be on a ppv, & does not deserve to be in wwe. 4/10<br /><br />fourth match- kane vs. king booker w/ sharmell this was a surprisingly good match, i thought it would be mediocre, but it turned out into a real competitive wrestling contest. hats off to both men, pulling a very entertaining match. kane wins after a chokeslam on king booker. 6/10<br /><br />fifth match- paul london & brian kendrick {champions} vs. deuce & domino w/ cherry for the wwe tag team championships not really that much of a good match, deuce & domino need more training to wrestle, & london & kendrick are the only ones keeping this match fast paced. london & kendrick retain their titles, after kendrick gets a roll-up on one of the guys for the win. 4/10<br /><br />sixth match- bobby lashley {champion} vs. mr. kennedy for the ecw championship mr. kennedy attacks lashley from behind, before the match starts. it was an okay match, but not really good. lashley & kennedy have a bit of chemistry, but not enough to pull a great match. kennedy wins by dq, after lashley nails him with a chair, then assaults him with the chair all the way to the entrance area. lashley still retains his title. 4/10<br /><br />seventh match- john cena & shawn michaels vs. batista & undertaker this is probably the greatest tag team match that i have ever seen. hats off to all of these men {yes even batista} for pulling off as close as a 5 star main event classic. all 4 of these men played their parts in the match very well, as this was a very great & entertaining tag team match. batista turns his back on undertaker spine-busting him, then leaving the ring, which prompts michaels to nail sweet chin music, then cena to nail an f-u for the hard fought victory. 7/10<br /><br />i don't know why everyone says that this ppv is not good enough, or it is boring, i just don't get it. it is a great ppv which smackdown always delivers. a great ppv indeed.<br /><br />overall i'll give it 8/10 & a b+
