this show is non stop hilarity. the first joke will make u wet your pants. and thats probably the weakest joke of them all. i started watching it when the second half of season 2 started airing. and straight away. i'm hooked. only 2 weeks after i started watching. i've downloaded episodes and bought the dvd's. reoccurring clips such as "the ad road test" and "current affairs" are quiet hilarious. then there's the ad's they take off "use emo. use your own tears for more effective use" also funny in the politics side of things. nothing is wrong with them doing this. it's funny. any australians who don't find this funny. don't complain and don't watch it. all australian tune in wednesday at 9 on abc
