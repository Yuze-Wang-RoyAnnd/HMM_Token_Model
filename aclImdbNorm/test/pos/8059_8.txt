after world war ii the ungoing crime in phenix city, alabama, encouraged by the money from an army base just across the river in georgia, got even worse. gambling, prostitution, loan sharking, and the like helped an organized crime apparatus in the city. soon it was too bad and violent to even tolerate anymore. this movie is based on the real story of that fight.<br /><br />by the standards of the 1950's it was shockingly explicit. although low-budget, that same small budget helped with the realism requiring location shooting. a very gritty film. richard kiley was marvelous as always, and john mcintire stolid.<br /><br />why this good movie isn't on video is a real puzzle!
