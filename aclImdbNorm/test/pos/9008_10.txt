it helps that the characters this show is based on are among the best disney has ever come up with. the writing is what really makes this show. it's a total classic. given, you need to appreciate the type of humor to enjoy it, and this is hard to explain. the humor is akin to the old school scenarios of 40's and 50's disney, with modern spins. it never degrades into fart jokes or anything of that type. it's not adam sandler humor either, though i have enjoyed that. it is the exact same humor of the movie, only expanded upon for the length of time a tv show permits. so if you didn't like it in the movie, you won't like it here, but imo the emperors new groove was the best thing to come out of disney since gargoyles.<br /><br />a+
