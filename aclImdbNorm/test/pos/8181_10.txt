this story documenting the rise of china's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in chinese history.<br /><br />it's worth every penny. visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.) please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
