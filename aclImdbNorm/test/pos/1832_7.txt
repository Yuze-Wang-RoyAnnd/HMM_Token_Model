i will start by saying i have always been a bonnie hunt fan.... she always adds life to any character she plays, and she did a wonderful job in her directorial debut.<br /><br />i have to admit this is a chick flick... but keeping that in mind, it is a wonderful story, it touches on many emotions and elicits all sorts of reactions.<br /><br />this film depicts real life like people with real life like situations. (tho i have to exclude the coincidence that is the major part of the film)<br /><br />it's a love story.. not just of a man and a woman, but the love of family, friends, and loved ones past. (even pets).<br /><br />i really enjoyed it. well worth the rental or the purchase.
