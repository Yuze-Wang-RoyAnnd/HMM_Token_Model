forget the recent dire american remake which sadly tarnished the reputation of the french original by virtue of the director's involvement in both. this is a deftly- drawn romantic 90s noir with many twists and turns. it works best as a gallic ode to hitchcock's rear window, because the notion of voyeurism is the constant theme that fires the intricate screenplay. the story is stunningly realized, like a picasso painting, offering multi-perspectives on the same event and demanding the viewer's participation throughout. the settings, music and haunting score are wonderful as well as the excellent contributions from the cast. watch it more than once.
