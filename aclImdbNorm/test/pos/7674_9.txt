i was given the solo "summertime" in 5th grade for our spring choral concert. from that time on, a great appreciation for gershwin's music arose in me. i love the haunting melodies of this opera by gershwin. back when i was in 5th grade (around age 10), i got the lp to practice with and also love the soundtrack very much. i recommend seeing this movie and if you can get the soundtrack, get it - you can sometimes find it on ebay - an old, used lp. i have been searching and searching to try to find the soundtrack on cd. the songs on this have marvelous musical arrangements and i truly wish it would be put on cd for purchase and also wish they would restore the movie and put it on dvd. this is truly a great work that i think present and future generations would enjoy and benefit from. some may think the movie slow and dull, but i find it quite the contrary. although poitier and dandridge have dubbed musical voices, i think the voices fit the faces and personalities well. a person's speaking voice and singing voice may be quite different. porgy and bess, and the songs in this opera, will always have a special meaning for me.
