my family (two 40-somethings, an 8 year old and my 71 yr old mother) saw this at a sneak preview on april 29th. we all enjoyed the movie very much. the story was a good one, and knowing it was based on real-life events made it that much more enjoyable. luke wilson was a hoot (pun intended) to watch as was tim blake nelson. and seeing neil flynn play something other than "the mean janitor from scrubs" was nice. the kids in movie did well and i'm sure they will all appeal to a certain demographic on the heartthrob level. the visuals were just lovely and the jimmy buffet music added to the "florida feel". ok, maybe the story was a little too neat and well packaged for some adults, but hey, who cares? i can't compare it to the book, i honestly hadn't heard of it until the movie came out. <br /><br />it was just a nice movie and it had a good message. plain and simple.
