the director, ramin niami, delivers the goods with somewhere in the city. this hilarious farce, i believe, is in the tradition of a mel brooks comedy. niami pokes fun at new york society by creating the believable, eccentric, and tragic characters of one tenement apartment building bringing them to life from the very opening one shots that introduce them. peter stormare's performance as a gay shakespearean actor is absolutely award worthy and the film in general does a good job at showing the hopelessness and laugh-ability of self-centered ambition. sandra bernhard is cast perfectly as the straight, self-obsessed therapist. i really enjoyed sandra's performance immensely especially since i haven't really been a very big fan until now. bai ling, ornella muti, and bulle ogier round out an international ensemble par excellence. i loved the scene with robert john burke and his gang of idiot criminals who couldn't plan a robbery if their lives depended on it. with a cameo appearance by mayor ed koch and a solid performance by paul anthony stewart, the revolutionary momma's boy, somewhere in the city entertains without missing a beat.
