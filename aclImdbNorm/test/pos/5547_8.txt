time does extraordinary things. it's the ultimate judge. time has granted "married to the mob" an extra doses of freshness. there aren't any dead moments or cheap shots. it's more of a delight now than it ever was. michelle pfeiffer creates a mafia widow that it's as far away from a caricature as anything she's ever done. a true original creation touching or hinting at the stereotype just to guide us through but her angela is quite unique. the legendary dean stockwell presents us with a a mafia boss that it's just as menacingly real as he is hilarious. and matthew modine? why did i think back then that he didn't have any chemistry with pfeiffer? i was wrong. they are wonderful together. they reminded me, this time, to the barbara stanwyck, fred macmurray of "remember the night" i'm writing this comment now to entice you to visit or revisit this jonathan demme gem.
