may contain spoilers!!! in no way, shape or form does this movie break the horror movie mold. not by a long shot. however, it does deliver a creepy atmosphere, believable enough characters and gore.<br /><br />the story is simple and doesn't bother to unfurl itself anymore than it needs to. a bunch of kids are killed in a mining accident back in the early 1900's. since then, they have stalked and killed the residence of their sleepy little pa town in the mountains.<br /><br />simple: they want revenge on the man that caused their death years and years ago. naturally, his great, great, great grandson is in town and he's a real prick.<br /><br />along with that, a mother and her two daughters inherit a run old house after the husband dies. the eldest daughter is rebellious, obnoxious...a typical teen. the younger is curious, bright-eyed and gets in with the ghost children.<br /><br />the creepiest part of this flick is the sheer emotionlessness of the children and they hack their way through victim after victim. excellent acting. it was so spooky! i mean, the children of the corn flicks are one thing...but this topped any of those (as for the creepy kids).<br /><br />worht a look. i bought it before seeing it and i was not unhappy. but i'm a horror fan through and through.
