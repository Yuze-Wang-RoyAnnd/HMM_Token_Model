i am really amazed how little fame this film had. i think it has to do with distribution companies and etc.<br /><br />don't be idiots - if you are looking for a good fun take this movie - this is very nice movie to pass few hours with and the music is great.<br /><br />it's about ..... well girls and boys and whats between them with not too much story but not all movies should be pulp fiction should they?? it's nice and cute and gives good time . the girls are also very good looking and this makes the whole movie even more enjoyable.<br /><br />why i gave it only a 9? well the story could be little more convincing from the middle and on. in some point you start to see events that are little less reliable. small spoiler: the baby is crying and the father goes in and tries to relax him. now i am not talking about some small cry but- no - hysteric cry and 30 sec after that the father goes out and "baby is sleeping"- excuse me , when and how exactly did you make him calm and sleep and be able to leave his room in 20-30 seconds. but ignore this kind of small picking because the film itself is not docudrama - it's fun and this should be overlooked.
