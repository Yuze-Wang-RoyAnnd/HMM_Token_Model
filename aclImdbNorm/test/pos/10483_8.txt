stephane audran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small danish community towards the end of the last century. two beautiful and musically talented sisters give-up their own prospects of happiness and marriage in order to look-after their ageing father. one day, a french woman, babette, comes to work for them. after some years she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who have taken her in. her solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous feast, which changes the lives of all those invited. this is a film about human and cultural interaction, reflected in the changing language of the dialogue from danish to french, and especially between the dutiful sobriety of protestant northern europe and the sensuousness of the catholic south. it is also about human needs, and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses. a profoundly uplifting film.
