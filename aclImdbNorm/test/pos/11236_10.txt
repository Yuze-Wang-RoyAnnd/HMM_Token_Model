keys to the vip, an original series by the canadian comedy network (comedynetwork.ca) scored big with this entertaining, yet inspirational gameshow. this show is hosted by four funny, good-looking guys who judge others on their 'game' (ability to pick up women). each episode features two guys who go head-to-head in various pick-up games. there are three different sections and the winner scores a night as a vip in an exclusive toronto night-club.<br /><br />being a guy, i naturally find this show hilarious. we all know that it's hard to confront women and watching these guys do it naturally sparks the curiosity of men. the guys who compete on this show might even give you a few pointers -- if you pay attention.
