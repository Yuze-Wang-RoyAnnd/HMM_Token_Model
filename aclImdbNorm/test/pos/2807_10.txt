i played sam (the porter, lou's sidekick) in the film "dead rail" which later aired as "alien express." and, i have to say that for my part i thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. as a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) turi(the director) and steve and scott (the producers) were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production. i made many friends (lou, todd, steven) and i consider myself very fortunate to have been able to work with these incredibly talented people. there was not a day that went by that i did not laugh my butt off. the real tragedy isn't so much the special effects, it's that every single person who watched this film didn't get to see what happened behind the scenes and all the talent that truly went into it. craftsmen building the set, prop masters, gaffers,wardrobe, makeup artists, script supervisors, the cinematographer, production assistants, extras, craft services, producers, director, and actors. it's a given that sci fi didn't spend a terrible amount of money on the film (2 million) but there was a lot of time, energy, and man power that was instilled into it. i look on the film now as a production that brought a lot of talented people together for a fun project that was shot without complications in less than two months. it was a magnificent cast and crew and i'm just so glad to be apart of it! on a further note to those of you who don't know lou diamond phillips, todd bridges, and steven brand. they are fantastic people who are incredibly funny. lou i still am working on my deniro impression and can't thank you enough for introducing me to "midnight run." todd, every time i hear an elvis song i can't forget the story you told me about hanging out with him at his house for dinner. "can you please pass me the pa tators?" (im a huge elvis fan!) steven, "mr. brand!" you are a true gent and all the advice and encouragement i received from you will always be appreciated. i miss you guys and hope you are well. thanks for the good memories, stories, jokes,and friendship. oh and miss utah says hello! wink wink.<br /><br />joe-
