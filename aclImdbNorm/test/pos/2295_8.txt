mr. baseball is a film of paradoxes. written and filmed as a "light, sports comedy" it truly has a heartwarming core as human and universal as some of capra's finest. at the plot level, you have the paradox of baseball, a fine old american game, as it is played in japan - turned around, with american values cast off and japanese values imprinted upon the game. (some of the superficial "sports comedy" results from jack's uncomprehending disbelief at how "basa-boru" is played in japan.) you also have a lead character who's presented as an over-the-hill, aging baseball star, but who is actually quite immature - pro ball allowed him to postpone growing up. and you have a lead character who is rudely resistant to the changes in his life that are being forced upon him, refusing to accept the curveball that life has given him, in the midst of a new country, a new manager, a new team, and a new girlfriend, who have all welcomed him and try to accept him. sound like heavy stuff? not really. it's a charming "clash of cultures" comedy that takes place on the national, sports, romantic, and professional levels. but if you watch it sensitively enough, you will also find a great story about a man who has to abandon his immaturity and grow up way too late in life (causing some amount of personal pain), and finds success in places he never expected it. i love the story, but i also have great respect for selleck's performance; he bares his tush (literally) to portray an ugly american, insulting people and throwing tantrums in public, then lets us inside this character to understand his dismay. it also doesn't hurt if you're a big fan of takakura ken like i am. mr. baseball is a surprising "loss of innocence" tale.
