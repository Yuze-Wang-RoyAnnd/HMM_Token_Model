the fact that after 50 years, it is still a highly watchable movie, says a lot about it. it is more intelligent and interesting than almost all recent movies of the same genre you can find, and has a certain endearing feeling of innocence to it. i am not a big fan of this type of movies, but i could watch the whole thing without being bored, which makes it a good movie to watch with someone who does not necessarily share your taste in films. i liked the black and white palette, the excellent casting, the clever heist scene that keeps you guessing about what trick they will pull next, and the ending like everyone else. watching the heist sequence makes one realize the power of silence, which is unfortunately so underused in today's cinema.
