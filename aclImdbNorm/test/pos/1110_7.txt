this film really used its locations well with some amazing shots, dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly, but constantly keeps you watching. modern love worked well in the gold coast film fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an australian cinema that is usually neglected. most importantly it is refreshing to see australian cinema not taking on the clich'e aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years. this film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings. the performances and characters are well developed, and the cinematography is fantastic. an interesting exploration into family relationships, and environments.
