the student nurses is not a typical sexploitation movie. sure, the nudity and sexual openness is there, but it's not all for laughs. stephanie rothman scripted a socially compelling, well-written tits & ass movie which confronts the topics of racism, socio-economic inequalities, rape, abortion, medical ethics, public health issues, human rights, the vietnam war, free love, lsd and drug experimentation. four sexy college roommates are taking their nursing internships at the same time. sharon (elaine giftos) is assigned to the terminal care ward, lynn (brioni farrell) to public health administration, priscilla (barbara leigh) to gynecology and phred (karen carlson) to psychiatry. these four beauties have ample opportunities to disrobe and fornicate, of which they take advantage, much to the delight of male viewers. these are liberated women at the height of the sexual revolution, after all, and are as intelligent as they are horny and beautiful. visceral yet low-budget action sequences are interspersed throughout. there's a very bloody gunfight at the resistance movement headquarters in which two policemen are shot and killed, along with several members of the group. an anti-(vietnam) war protest consisting of spookily-dressed young people of all races painted like skeletons becomes violent, with cops beating protesters. the effective trip sequence on the beach consists of beautiful, weird and confusing sensory and memory montages with hyper-sensual overtones. in short, the student nurses is a thoughtful and compelling reflection of the times, expressed through real women's perspectives (since it was written and directed by a woman). but, it's still fun and titillating, despite its sobering treatment of subject matter.
