people need to give this show a chance. the people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. one needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. all of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. they make mistakes, but they are realistic mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. also, for the most part the acting is superb. lauren graham has been snubbed of an emmy for six years now. someone needs to give this woman the credit she deserves. same goes for kelly bishop who plays emily gilmore so perfectly. also, it's nice to see a show that can have a young girl at the center of it, and not be filled with teen angst. rory is a smart girl, which is also not seen a lot on television today. if only other shows could capture the wholeness of this show...
