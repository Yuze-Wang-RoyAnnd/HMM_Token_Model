more and more french cinema demonstrates that's the only one able to confront hollywood's, and to spend high amounts on money in their movies. if bon voyage had been made in the usa no one would be surprised. perfectly set in france, in the 40's, when the nazi invasion, technically irreproachable, and with some of the most international french actors (depardieu, adjani, ledoyen...). bon voyage centerers on two parallel stories: an scientific and his disciple (ledoyen) who tries to hide one of his discoveries (a kind of water that may work as an atomic bomb) from the nazis; and a poor guy in love with a well known actress (adjani), which ends up in prison accused of a crime he's not committed in order to protect her. <br /><br />bon voyage seems to have been made in the old style, without unnecessary camera movements and effects. without big turns in the plot. as i said before, regarding to the production itself they've made a great job. but the main problem with this movie is about the script. is it a spy-movie? a romantic comedy? a spy comedy? a comedy of intrigue? it's not clear. that makes bon voyage a little unbalanced. when you think you're watching a comedy, suddenly changes to another story-line, a more dramatic one, more slow... i think they should've focused in one of the lines of argument (the one about the spy plot) and left the romantic parts in the background.<br /><br />my rate: 6.5/10
