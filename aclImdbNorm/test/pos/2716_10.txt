i resisted watching 15 park avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clich'ed topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.<br /><br />once in a while, movies like 15 park avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.<br /><br />the movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. aparna sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. the impeccable character development, "just right" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...<br /><br />i have a renewed respect for konkana sen sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic mithi. she beats expectation yet again after page-3 and mr.& mrs.iyer. prof. anjali's role is very well developed and shabana does full justice to the character. rahul bose, shefali chaya, waheeda rehman add incredible flavor to the movie.<br /><br />i define "shower moments" as thoughts of scenes from a movie that you ponder over in your shower endlessly, till your wife/girlfriend/mom bangs at the door. 15pa delivers many "shower moments" especially the conversation between anjali and her mother where the mother is cautious when talking to anjali about her thoughts. it immediately brings out anjali's personality to the audience.<br /><br />the end is a very bold statement by the director; probably too westernized for the indian audience; yet delivers the elements to promote the movie from a "good" to a "great" status.
