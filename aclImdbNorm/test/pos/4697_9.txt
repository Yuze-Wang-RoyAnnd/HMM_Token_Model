fantastic series, one of my few favorites (miami vice and tour of duty are the other two, and this series is right up there with them).<br /><br />these guys aren't into wearing frilly tights - they dress more like woodsmen. everything about this series breathes an aire of realism, artistic license or not.<br /><br />it paints a picture of a europe only slightly out of the grasp of paganism, as most of the villagers still have their local deities, and there are satan worshipping nuns, and magi, witches and sorcerers casting spells.<br /><br />however, what comes to the fore most, is that it's a series of it's time. rather than the version of the fifties, which was a lament against centralized government and the mccarthy era persecutions, this series is thoroughly grounded in the 1980s, thatcherist bleakness, and has a strong environmentalist leaning. robin's protector is a nature worshipper called hern the hunter, who often appears wearing the head of a deer, and is a personification (as is this robin) of the green man, an alternative version of osiris (the egyptian god of vegetation and resurrection - it is interesting to note that in these series, robin in the hood isn't a person, but a concept; when the old one is killed, a new one is summoned telepathically by hern - the person may die, but robin in the hood will live forever, hence the concept of resurrection).<br /><br />the music and score are really outstanding, and performed by the irish formation, clannad. when watching it, i couldn't help but think how _boring_ authentic medieval anglosaxon folk music would have been. :-)<br /><br />all this is beautifully shot in the lush forrests of wales, which pass for the new forrest.<br /><br />the only down side is that in the initial episodes of both series, the actors have to overcome their own skepsis, and convince themselves that this really is a serious work. after that, they get into it and the acting is great! michael praed as the first robin (the second is played by sean connery's son, jason), judi trott makes a beautiful and fragile redheaded marion, phil rose as the portly and really kind-hearted friar tuck, ray winstone as the volatile and lovelorn scarlet, clive mantle as the giant shepard little john, peter llewellyn williams as little john's bumpkin friend and fellow shepard, and mark ryan as the ex-hashashin/assassin nazir - all of them giving great performances. also great are the steady bad guys, nicholas grace as the bug-eyed, scheming sheriff of nottingham, and his aristocratic, bumbling sidekick (and robin's half brother, as it turns out) robert addie as sir guy of gisburne. really cool too is fashion designer richard o'brien, as the evil lord owen of clun's (olliver cotton) magician gulnar (he appears near the end of the first series and later in the second).<br /><br />the tithe barn in bradford on avon stood in for the sheriff's castle. (check it out on bradfordonavon.co.uk under "places of interest".)<br /><br />so, if you're at all into mythology, the middle ages, romanticism, don't waste your time on xena or hercules - this is the real thing, so go out and watch it!<br /><br />alex
