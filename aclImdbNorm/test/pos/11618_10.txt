finally watched this shocking movie last night, and what a disturbing mindf**ker it is, and unbelievably bloody and some unforgettable scenes, and a total assault on the senses. looks like a movie from the minds of lynch (specifically eraserhead), buttgereit, and even a little of "begotten". what this guy does to his pregnant sister is beyond belief, but then again, did it really happen or is it his brain's left and right sides doing battle. that's the main theme of this piece of art, to draw a fine line between fantasy and reality, and what would happen if the right side of the brain that dreams and fantasizes overtakes the reasoning and logical left side. and the music in this movie is unbelievable, a kind of electronic score that is absolutely perfect. even though this movie is totally shocking and pretty disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes (including hard core sex) you will ever see in any movie, i viewed it as a work of art, and loved it. and that music still amazes me, i have to try and find the soundtrack if is available. watching "subconscious cruelty" is a real event, and not something the viewer will easily forget. and a note to gorehounds, this is a must-have.<br /><br />warning... be careful buying this movie, because some prints have fogging on the graphic sex scenes and extreme gore, especially the copies from the japanese release.
