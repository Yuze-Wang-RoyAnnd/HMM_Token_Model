great, chris diamantopoulos has got to be the best robim williams that i have every seen.. he acts it up, perfectly. this was like watching robim williams as he really was and is.. it almost made me cry watching him.<br /><br />i had no idea that robin was as close a friend to john belushi as he was. the portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. very sad, what both of them went through.<br /><br />i really felt for both val and robin during his rough times. i am glad that they ended it in a high note!<br /><br />i hope robin puts a $100 bill in this guy's hat !!<br /><br />and it was great that it was filmed in vancouver!
