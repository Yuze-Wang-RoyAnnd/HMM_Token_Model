i watched this movie for the first time ever on the sci fi channel and i must say.. it was simply awesome. for those of you whom loves 'the never ending story' this is one that would bring back memories of that movie. even though it is a 1996 movie it has a hazy like setting and look which makes it feel like it is, a fantasy. the acting was brilliant and the music was great especially the beginning battle song and end song. to those of you who have yet to see it, watch it! i recommended completely!
