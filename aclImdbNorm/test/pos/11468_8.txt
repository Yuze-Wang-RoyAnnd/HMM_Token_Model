i found this flick enjoyable and involving to watch, and i'm surprised it's rated so lowly. actually i can see why it is; i imagine it's the fans of eric roberts and alyssa milano that have been giving most of the 1s and 2s, because if you put the tape into the machine expecting to enjoy watching something starring either or both of these two then you could be rather disappointed. eric appears for about half an hour towards the end of the movie, and alyssa for about 5 scenes in the second half, and in those she says little and wears less (although never nude if that's what you're looking for, stick with embrace of the vampire). although they're always a pleasure, it's a pity she, or eric, don't get much screen-time yet i still give this an 8.<br /><br />
