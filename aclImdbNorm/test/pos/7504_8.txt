another black comedy that won an oscar for best screenplay. starring george c scott, this redefines the phrase "tearing a new a$$hole." in this case, the target is america's medicare and grand hospital system. throughout the hospital, patients and doctors are dying because their names and prescriptions are being changed. scott roars, screams and blasts away his workers and bosses as they fail more and more. his comment about dachau to one of his many bosses is sure to elicit laughs. he even beats and rapes a hippie 3 times. this is one that has to be seen and heard as the monologues and soliloquies are the key points in the film.
