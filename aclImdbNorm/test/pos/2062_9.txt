i hadn't planned on leaving a review, but seeing some of the other dreadful reviews for this movie, i had to say something.<br /><br />i'm not going to give away the ending or anything, but i do give away some important plot points in this review, so you should be aware of that. the short (non-spoiler) version of my review - samuel l. jackson and geena davis both kick butt in this movie, and it's a lot of fun. watch it.<br /><br />this movie is one of my favorites of all time. geena davis is perfect as the action heroine, torn between her existing life as a housewife and mother, and the memories that are resurfacing of her former life as a cia assassin. her performance is superb as she plays both facets of this relatively complex character perfectly.<br /><br />samuel l. jackson's performance is, as always, also excellent, as the private investigator that geena davis' character hired to look into her forgotten past. he does a great job of playing the unwitting sidekick to geena davis' tough character. some of the lines he utters in this movie are the best he's ever used in any movie he's been in.<br /><br />seriously, if you haven't seen it, do. it's a fantastic story with lots of unexpected twists and turns, and it's extremely well directed and acted.
