i saw two hands back in sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. it's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). like much australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and jordan should justly feel proud of his work.<br /><br />anyway, it was on tv just now on channel 4 in london, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out! so if you watch this movie, make sure it's the original version.
