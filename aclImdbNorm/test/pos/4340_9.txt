this movie was great. it had everything a true action fan could want. plenty of people getting shot and/or maimed, minimal romance involving sex, a hero that can be identified with, violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end, and villains that are just asking for it. bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows. ed lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. the movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again. rather, you want to see kersey in action and the storyline just juices it up. this is great stuff.
