describing stalingrad as a war film may be a bit inaccurate. sure it centers on the longest and bloodiest battle in world history, in the most expansive theater of the most costly war in terms of lives, money, and mat'eriel that has ever occurred. yes it contains action scenes depicting bitter battles and terrible destruction. the visceral storytelling and harsh images though make it something more than a war film, even more than an anti-war film. stalingrad is instead a film about absolute and undeniable hell.<br /><br />the film is fraught with visual descriptions of the worst kind of war, one that is intensely personal and close, where days are spent in taking one city block, only to have it re-taken in a surprise assault. the early form of modern urban warfare that the germans came to call rattenkrieg (rat warfare) is depicted in brutal and uncompromising terms. the characters war in sewer tunnels, rail yards, and from building to building in the hellish bomb-scape of ruined stalingrad, only to be defeated by the unforgiving russian winter.<br /><br />the film deals with the issue of nazism and the vilification of germans in that period in the way that many other films from both germany and the rest of the world do. its characters are a group of soldiers swept along by the winds of war and simply attempting to make it out with themselves and as many of their comrades as possible alive. the characters do not fight the soviets out of any ideological hatred between national socialism and soviet communism, not for any grand dream of grossdeutschland or racial superiority. they fight only because if they do not the enemy will kill them, and if the enemy does not then their own officers certainly will for refusing to fight. this portrayal adds another layer to the suffocating envelope of trapped hopelessness that pervades the film.<br /><br />a sort of ground based companion to das boot, stalingrad frames the epic struggle of world war two in a personal light and from the unexpected perspective of the ordinary german soldier as a sort of hero made tragic by circumstance and a brutal government that would pervert his sacrifice.
