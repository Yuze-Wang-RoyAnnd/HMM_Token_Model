as the '70's drew to a close, rumours began to fly in the entertainment industry about the possible return of sean connery to the role he had made famous back in 1962 - james bond.<br /><br />cubby broccoli was asked on location in brazil during the making of 'moonraker' by the b.b.c.'s barry norman how he viewed the prospect. understandably, the producer was reluctant to commit himself to an opinion.<br /><br />when 'moonraker' opened, bond fans were outraged by what they perceived to be a cheapening of the character, and the jumping onto the 'star wars' bandwagon much as 'live & let die' had done with the blaxploitation craze a few years earlier. many publicly vocalised their hope that connery would return, if only to show eon how a real bond movie should look.<br /><br />years of legal battles followed. the original script, entitled 'james bond of the secret service' ( later retitled 'warhead' ) was written by kevin mcclory, len deighton, and connery, was never filmed, and remains one of the great unmade movie blockbusters.<br /><br />a new script, closer to the 'thunderball' storyline, was commissioned. it was written by lorenzo semple junior, best known as the man who put the camp into 'batman'. he had also written 'the parallax view', one of the decade's finest conspiracy thrillers. feeling the script needed a british touch, connery brought in dick clement and ian la frenais, writers of hit british sitcoms 'the likely lads' and 'porridge'. the witty title was suggested by connery's wife micheline. <br /><br />'never say never again' opened just before christmas 1983 to a shower of critical praise; normally sensible critics were so ecstatic at connery's return they ignored all other aspects of the film. many used it to viciously attack the roger moore series, particularly that year's 'octopussy'. in truth, 'octopussy' is superior in every respect. 'never' lacks the excitement and spectacle one associates with bond, at times it looks like a made-for-t.v. movie. the story had been done before and better in 1965's 'thunderball', hence 'never' was always going to come off second best. it was also hampered by not being part of the official series, meaning that monty norman's 'james bond theme' and maurice binder's gun-barrel logo could not be used. <br /><br />as bond, connery is magnificent, effortlessly stepping back into his most famous role. playing bond as an older, wiser agent worked. barbara carrera landed her best movie role as villainous 'fatima blush', a lady whose love for murder is such she dances after ( so she thinks ) killing bond. kim basinger smolders as 'domino'. as s.p.e.c.t.r.e. agent 'maximillian largo', klaus maria brandauer gives a chilling performance. a major disappointment though is max von sydow as 'blofeld'. the posters gave the impression he would be a major character, in fact he appears only in a few scenes. with a stronger script, he could have been one of the all-time great bond villains. <br /><br />'never' promised to be a throwback to the early eon bonds such as 'from russia with love', but did not deliver. the gadgets were there, but were used almost apologetically. bond's rocket-firing motorcycle was a tired gimmick even in the '60's. the film tried to compete with eon's bonds in terms of humour. bond saving himself by throwing his own urine sample into an assassin's face is a farcical a moment as any you will find in 'moonraker'. but the nadir comes with the introduction of rowan atkinson as bumbling foreign office official 'nigel small-fawcett'. he gives a performance so staggeringly awful you wonder if he thought he was in a footlights revue. <br /><br />michel legrand's music is horrible, the man seems to never to have seen a bond film in his life. <br /><br />though the film was a financial success, viewed years later it stands as the weakest bond of the '80's. connery himself was disappointed with it, and not did act in a movie again for some years.<br /><br />1983 was a good year for 007 maniacs, in addition to the connery and moore movies, george lazenby did a delightful cameo in the made-for-t.v. 'return of the man from u.n.c.l.e.: the fifteen years later affair'.
