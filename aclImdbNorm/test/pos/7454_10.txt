"duckman" is a great show. i first saw it when i was 10 years old at the time and after school i rushed home and turned on comedy central. i saw a cartoon called "duckman" and i loved it!! it's such a funny and cool show. it's created by klasky-csupo, who are great creators of cartoons. they animated some of my favorite shows ever, like "the simpsons" and "rugrats".<br /><br />i've seen lots of episodes of this show and i think they're all really funny and sweet. the voice actors did a great job voicing the characters, too.<br /><br />i wish that comedy central could bring this show back, along with "the critic" and "dilbert".<br /><br />but this is a great comedy central show. great job, klasky-csupo!
