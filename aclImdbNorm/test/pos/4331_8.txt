"death wish 3" brings back charles bronson as one time vigilante paul kersey,now retired.yeah,right.before long kersey is back to his old ways.but this time,its not just a few muggers at a time,its a gang who have taken over a run down part of the city(new york again,by the way.)this time its war,so kersy hauls out the big guns(literally) for this.the body count int his one rivals anything stallone or schwarzenegger have come up with.this movie is actually somewhat fun to watch,particularly for a few one liners and of course bad guys die,or get severely injured in creative ways,which is always a good thing.the violence is not as personal in this one,its,obviously on a much grander scale,sort of like bombing your victims from afar,rather than one on one combat.this movie is lighter in tone than the 1st 2,making it easier to watch.there's not much import to this film,its more escapism than anything.its also cheesy at times and pseudo-inspirational,but hose scenes fall flat. they should have left the original "death wish" on its own without sequels,but since they didn't,they should have stopped here. 8 /10
