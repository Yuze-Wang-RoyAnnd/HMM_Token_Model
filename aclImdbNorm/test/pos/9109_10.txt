calling all d-sciples! grab your friends, hit the theater and see the hell out of this movie. from the opening sequence until after the credits you'll be laughing your self breathless. <br /><br />this movie is a wild ride through the history of the d, and not just some bull-crap list of the things they've done, but a chronicling of their rise to power. i am a huge fan of rage kage(kyle gass) and jables(jack black), so naturally i loved the movie. <br /><br />it helps to know about the show they had, and their first cd, but it's just as funny if you don't. from the hilarious and vulgar lyrics, the rocking rhythms, the massive amount of pot smoking, and the cameos, down to the outright insanity that is the story line, this is a movie for d-sciples and newbies alike. <br /><br />many of their songs are referenced, such as two kings, tribute, and kielbasa to their many audio tracks like cock push-ups, every fan in the audience will be saying i remember that as well as new comers saying "that's f'ing hilarious!." i highly recommend this movie to any body that's ever rocked out. this movie is certainly in high competition for being the next "this is spinal tap." one of the best ever.
