man, i had my doubts. i love kathy bates, but i thought, how good can this be, i had never even heard of this thing...! you know, it was one of those things, we gave it "20 minutes and we'll turn it off if it sucks" and we were locked in from the get-go. this is a very winsome, fun movie. it's quirky, you know? i mean, you've got a lounge singer, a murderer (and a believable one), you have farce, then kathy bates in all her acting splendor, rupert everett finally acting to his real potential, dan ackroyd, and a dwarf that will make you laugh out loud. i tell ya, you'll laugh/you'll cry. <br /><br />maybe i had a weird week, but i think this film is on the level of fried green tomatoes. if you don't like that movie, maybe you won't like this, but i think it was a great movie. i went out and bought the dvd.
