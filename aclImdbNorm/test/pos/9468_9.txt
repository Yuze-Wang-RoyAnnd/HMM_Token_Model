i saw this film at a special screening. at first i thought the movie would be like a typical amanda bynes movie, but i was wrong. the movie is based on the shakespeares book "the twelth night" this movie tells the story of a girl who lives to play soccer. well when the girls team is cut she has to go to great lengths to get on the guys team at a different school to get revenge on the egotistical guys team at her old school. on her way she gets caught up in a long tangled web of love, lies, and deception. this movie is this years mean girls. i think it shows some great new actors abilities and there are defiantly some big stars to be featured in this movie.
