i'm a fan of zhang yimou and finally found this dvd title from the shelves of a shenzhen bookstore after a long search at many places.<br /><br />this is a huge departure from previous zhang yimou work, esp in terms of style and locale. the director himself has said that this is the first and only time he'll ever attempt to make a black comedy set in contemporary china. you may even say this work is experimental in nature, compared to his other well known big budget and formal pieces.<br /><br />filmed with a hand-held camera and wide angle lens throughout the duration of the whole film, the quick pace editing and high energy performance & naturalistic tone never let you go once it grips you from the start. it presents a very realistic account of modern chinese urban sensibilities, which in this case is set in beijing. if you appreciate and love this kind of black humor, you will love this film totally. also look out for hilarious cameos by zhao benshan (happy times)and the director zhang yimou himself.<br /><br />a last point of note: i find the characters in this film, as in all other zhang yimou films, exhibiting similar personality traits - stubbornness, always trying to beat the odds & up the ante. do let me know your thoughts on this.<br /><br />david lee
