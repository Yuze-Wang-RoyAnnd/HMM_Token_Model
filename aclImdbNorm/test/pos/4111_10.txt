this musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few. the wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly.<br /><br />this music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises. it is about a land "far away from it all" where "living things have room to grow." its people are "living and growing together" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age.<br /><br />the lyrics help us recognize the relativity of this "world that is spinning around" and to "look inside yourself; that is where the truth always lies." the absolute level of consciousness is more real than the ever changing world of the senses.<br /><br />i have been searching for the video for years . when i find it, or it comes out in dvd, it will help "share the joy" of being in "shangri-la" again. burt bacharach's music and hal david's lyrics made a masterpiece in turbulent times that is just now ready to be fully appreciated.<br /><br />may this cd inspire you to find your own "lost horizon" or recognize it when "peace of mind" has found you. - losthorizon.org
