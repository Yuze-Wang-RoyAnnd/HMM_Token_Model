this is yet another gem from the pen of daniele thompson - in fact that same year (1999) she wrote and directed la buche, the first of three writer/director credits so far. belle maman is first of all 'french' whatever that means which is, of course, different things to different folks. the premise is simple: at the altar where he is marrying mathilde seigner, the groom, vincent lindon, gets his first glimpse of her mother, catherine deneuve, and suffers what the french call a coup de foudre which we know as love at first sight. in theory the story is either 1) over right then and there assuming he called the wedding off or else 2)just the beginning as he goes through with the wedding and thus lives a lie until it is resolved one way or the other. thompson veers towards #2 but not without hitting us with the odd subplot along the way like, for example, deneuve's cigar-smoking lesbian mother line renaud (in real life, if anyone cares, renaud is in a long-term relationship with stephane audran, who co-stars here) and throws in a brilliant set-piece in a luxuriously appointed men's room at the wedding reception, which takes the form of a hilarious song-and-dance. consummate writer that she is thompson also leavens the comedy with drama like the brilliant climactic scene where vincent finally spews out his feelings for deneuve at a family gathering whilst simultaneously wrecking the joint. this is one to savour. again and again.
