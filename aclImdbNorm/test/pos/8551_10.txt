i was wrapped to see many other people also enjoyed this film. first watched it when i was in my early teens and then again several times late at night a few times after. then sadly, no more. i'm now nearly 49 and so wish it could be made available on dvd. why not? the best anthony quinn role, no one could have been more suited for the part or parts he plays - i've mentioned it to other film buffs of similar age and alas, no one i know recalls it. as the daughter of a generation that went through wwii and its aftermath (and myself deeply fascinated by what that generation endured) i guess this film at the time gave me a wonderful cinematic insight into some of the heartbreaking issues of the day. for classic final scenes this movie is a stand out.
