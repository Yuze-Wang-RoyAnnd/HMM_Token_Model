it has to be admitted that the best work of harold lloyd ended with his last great silent comedy "speedy" in 1928. after that he enters sound films (like chaplin and keaton and laurel & hardy and w.c. fields) and does do better than keaton, but not as well as the other three. chaplin was rich enough to make his own films as producer (but he paced his films so there were five years between productions). laurel & hardy were under the protection of hal roach, so production standards for their shorts and sound films were pretty good. fields first worked with mack sennett, than with paramount, and then free-lanced. lloyd tried the route that chaplin took, but with less success.<br /><br />he produced his own films, but unlike chaplin he did not own his own studio. also his first two choices were not good (especially "feet first"). but he did begin to choose more wisely and "movie crazy", "the cat's-paw", and "the milky way" were all good choices. these three (and possibly "the sin of harold diddlebock") were his best sound ventures. they are all entertaining, but none are up to "safety last", "the freshman", "the kid brother", or "speedy". <br /><br />of the top four sound films "the cat's paw" is the most controversial. ezekiel cobb's solution to ridding the city that elects him mayor is very extreme for the tastes of 2005. or is it? when a movie is made dictates what it's politics are: "the cat's paw" is from 1934. that second year of the roosevelt new deal (itself rather controversial for heavier government involvement) movie audiences saw films like "gabriel over the white house" and "the phantom president", where our leaders did extra-constitutional actions to rid the nation of internal enemies (and to force disarmament around the globe). even cecil b. de mille got into this act with "this day and age", where a bunch of teenagers use rats to force a gangster to confess his crimes.<br /><br />to us, the use of violence to force anyone (even a bunch of goons and boodlers like alan dinehart's gang) to confess is repellent. after all, the supreme court has protected us from confession under duress. what we forget is that the reforms we are thinking of did not occur until the warren court and the burger court made them. for example, although mr. justice sutherland's opinion in the powell ("scottsboro boys") case of 1932 guaranteed every criminal defendant had a right to counsel, gideon v. wainwright did not extend this to ordering court paid counsel to defendants until 1962. the miranda case, with it's now well-known anti-self-incrimination warning is from 1963. nothing like this were considered necessary in 1934.<br /><br />if you study other movies of the period up to 1954 (and even to 1960) tricks are used to get confessions - kirk douglas confesses his crimes in front of witnesses in "i walk alone" while burt lancaster holds a gun to him. when lancaster leaves, douglas sneers about confessing under duress, only to see the gun is unloaded. suddenly he realizes that (legally - in 1948) he has confessed without duress. hate to say it, to any civil libertarians reading this note, but what cobb/lloyd does to dinehart and his pals in the conclusion of "the cat's paw" was not only legal, but would have led to their jail sentences in 1934. we may call it heavy handed, fascistic, or horrid, but it would have worked legally when it was thought up.
