sherlock holmes (basil rathbone) begins this story in disguise, helping to smuggle famous physicist "dr. franz tobel" (william post) out of switzeralnad and under the watchful eye of the nazis, who want his bomb sight plans. the allies obviously want it, too, and sherlock is there to help. dr. tobel has invented an instrument which greatly aids in the accuracy of aerial bombardment. <br /><br />holmes and dr. tobel arrive safely back at baker street but the scientist would rather be alone, for some mysterious reason, although he had promised the english to help them, not the germans. he stays true to that promise but there are some desperate moments for holmes and the english along the way.<br /><br />it's an entertaining film and one in which our famous detective uses not one but three different disguises. he needs all the help he can get when he goes up against his arch-rival, "professor moriarity." one complaint: if moriarity was that evil, he would have dispensed with holmes without batting an eyelash, instead of giving him openings to escape. it's pretty sad, too, when the usual dim-witted dr. watson (nigel bruce) has to rescue his boss from certain death a couple of times!<br /><br />yes, there are some credibility issues in this story but if you can put your brain on hold a few times, it's a fun film to watch....and it looks beautiful, thanks to the great restoration job done on this dvd. it makes the old print come alive with some wonderful visuals, particularly the night-time shots.<br /><br />one other note: whoever did the english subtitles in here misspelled or misinterpreted at least a half dozen words. it's very sloppy work, and not the first time i've encountered this watching the entire series on the restored dvd set.
