when i first saw the poster of this movie, i discarded it off as another low-budget movie targeting youth. after some days, when it finally made it to the theaters, one of my friends told me it's a good one.<br /><br />a year later, the first time when i saw the advertisement that, anand was going to be aired on television and the moment finally came as i flipped channels and for a moment i stopped to watch and that's it i ended up watching the whole movie.<br /><br />and by now, 3 yrs later i'd have watched the movie at least 7-8 times and i don't really watch movies again and again!!<br /><br />this movie is great because it tries to be different, when all telugu movies were composed of 6 songs and 4 fights.<br /><br />it's a simple movie, a bit slow but a very gripping screenplay, there're no loose ends in the movie, very well-versed dialogues, which is really-really hard to find by.<br /><br />music is both classic and soothing, great renditions by radha krishnan, some great kirtanas also come in the bgmusic, through out the movie.<br /><br />cinematography, deserves a mention. editing is not slick but adequate for a romantic one such as this.<br /><br />but, what really blows you out in this movie is two things- 1.the way each scene has been treated with utmost respect by, the now famous, shekar kammula.<br /><br />2. the beautiful lyrics by veturi.<br /><br />and one more thing deserves a special mention, kamalini, part of her success attributed to sunitha, for lending her such a beautiful voice, really tell you, the voice does wonders to me.<br /><br />the other actors, are equally good, raja in the title character and the little girl, and the way she shouts when she gets a new dog.<br /><br />ultimately, i can tell you this movie is soon on its way to be another classic with those old classic romantic ones, along with kammula's another classic-romantic piece, godavari.
