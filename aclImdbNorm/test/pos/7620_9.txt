i loved this movie. not as great as "50 first dates", but it's definitely a repeater, especially on a rainy day or with a group of girlfriends. yes, the plot was "cute" and maybe even unbelievable, but what's so bad about a feel good movie. drew as josie and her romance with the teacher is so sweet and brother baseball wannabee adds to the movie's good feeling. with all the junk out there, what's so bad about a good movie the whole family can enjoy? without being embarrassed while watching with your kids! drew is an awesome actress that really seems to be unappreciated for the most part. this is definitely one of her best roles!
