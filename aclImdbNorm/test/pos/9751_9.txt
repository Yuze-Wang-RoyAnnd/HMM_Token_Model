i really enjoyed watching this movie! only a few parts were slow, but it was only setting the mood and building up to the action. i thought this movie was very educational, it taught me more about my croatian heritage. i also learned more about louise arbour, and i can say she has a very great influence on me. time magazine named louise arbour one of the world's 100 most influential people in april of 2004. i recommend this movie to people that like historical movies (obviously). this movie was very dramatic, but still told the truth of events in the former yugoslavia. louise arbour is a brave hero, and i'm glad they made a movie honouring her. if you see the movie, i hope you'll like it.
