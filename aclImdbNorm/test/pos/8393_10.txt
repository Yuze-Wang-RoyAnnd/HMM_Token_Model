this is about as good as gone with the wind was.i love this movie i could watch it over and over again.scarlett always gets what she wants no matter what the cost.she tries real hard to forget rhett but she just can't do it. she loves him so much. this is a story of real true love.it started in gone with the wind and ended up in this movie.the only real way to end this movie for real true love.was to have scarlett and rhett back together at the end.and thats the way it ended with them back together with their daughter.what more could you ask for. there's not a better ending to this great love story than this.what else can i say about this great movie.
