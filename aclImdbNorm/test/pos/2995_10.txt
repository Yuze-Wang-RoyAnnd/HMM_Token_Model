first of all - i'm not one to go all sappy over movies. i saw friends in the 70's when it was first released. i was about 17 years old at the time. even now, at age 50, i still can remember some of the scenes. the movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but i loved it. the story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home. at the time it was pretty risky to have a movie about a couple of young runaways who successfully setup house and have a baby on their own. i'm not surprised the movie and elton john's soundtrack are almost unknown today. the music is beautiful. it was unforgettable.
