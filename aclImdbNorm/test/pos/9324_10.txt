for those too young to remember, or too old to have been part of the "hype", the michael jackson fad in the early-to-mid 80's was at a fever pitch- like the hype about titanic, except this just didn't let up. every song, every video, every word uttered by michael was important. nothing similar had been seen since the heyday of the beatles.<br /><br />i remember seeing this video for the first time, at a roller skating rink. everyone stopped skating. there was no question as to whether you were a michael jackson fan or not; you were. everyone crowded around the projection screen, and watched the video...<br /><br />this is probably one of the longest music videos ever made, and definitely the best. it perpetually gets #2 on the annual mtv top 100 videos (#1 is always the flavor-of-the-month, and somehow whatever was #1 of all time slips past #2, to make way for the new #1. go figure.), and thriller became a phenomenon in and of itself.<br /><br />if you ever get the chance, you must watch the video; not just the excerpts shown on mtv or vh1. if necessary, you should search out making of thriller at a video rental store. hey... your parents probably made you watch beatles and woodstock footage because "it was important"... well, this is important too.
