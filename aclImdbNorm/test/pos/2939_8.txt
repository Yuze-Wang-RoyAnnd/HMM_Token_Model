america's next top model is a great reality show in every sense. it has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet: present a true america's next top model. of course this is not something easy to do, therefore usa and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.<br /><br />but it's obvious that its intention is not to present the america's next top model, but yes, the america's next pop model. the show gets together a bunch of models without any experience with different personalities and big personal, professional and financial problems, giving them a chance for bringing to life a dream or to make their lives something worthy. it's obvious that tyra banks uses all that for her advantage, she gives the dream, but in exchange for that she gains audience and more popularity. anyway, she deserves it, because she is intelligent and, if i might say that, a pioneer to this kind of show. tyra also is a great observer and knows how to give based opinions, differing herself of other models and hostess of foreign versions of the next top model franchise. in brazil, as an example, fernanda motta is its hostess and "once-upon-a-time"-top model. she doesn't have even 1/10 of tyra's professional skills, which keeps tyra banks on the top. tyra have professional and personal knowledge about what she says and she's a great mentor because she not only criticizes but she points the mistake and teaches the right way with wisdom.<br /><br />the show doesn't suffer from big problems, it does and fulfills what it promises during the cycles. the models chosen to work on the show in fact are not the best unknown models of entire country because tyra banks bets with the difference, and she is right, because she (and also good part of her audience) believes that it's time for the modeling world to change some straight parameters. during the cycles, she and her team really makes fair deliberations, where the weakest go away and the promising ones have new chances to prove their capacities but must be fast to do that, otherwise they lose it.<br /><br />other very interesting thing is that tyra also knows to decide who should or shouldn't win even when she's against people's opinion. she knows that whoever wins will be famous, but has a very few possibilities to truly be a worldwide recognized top model. at the same way she knows that, some times, the second place is more valuable than the first, because 1st place wins the title, but second doesn't gets the title stigma. hardly she makes mistakes when she decides the future of any model during the show.<br /><br />after 9 cycles the show is getting a little tired with some old ideas, it's time for tyra to change some things and lines because it's getting boring and comparing to the firsts cycles we can see that she's getting bored too, so she needs to do that if she wants the show to live a little longer.<br /><br />anyway, the show explores the fashion and modeling world, but it's also entertaining for those ones that live outside all of that. it gives the opportunity for some girls and also the market, and also gives great tips for those ones from the audience who shares the same dream.
