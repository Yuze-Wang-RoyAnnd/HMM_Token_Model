the last film of john huston, the great american director of the irish descent is an adaptation of the last short story in the early collection "dubliners", of the greatest writer ever came from ireland. the film is a family affair. the dying director made it based on the script adapted by his son tony huston from one of the most poignant, beautiful and profound short story ever written in this language and considered by many the best english language short story. john directed his daughter anjelica in what could be her finest screen performance. the film is short, only 83 minutes. it's got no action sequences, no plot, it is almost non-eventful, and it may seem slow. the guests, friends and relatives come to the party that takes place in dublin during the epiphany week in january 1904, at the house of two elderly sisters who give annual dinner with music and dance. what viewers see for the first hour, is the ensemble conversation piece. the guests talk, listen to the music, discuss the latest opera premiere, and make jokes, sometimes awkward. gradually, the conversation turns to the long dead friends or relatives the memory of whom never faded away.<br /><br />this is the film you have to stay with, let it pull you in, listen to what and how the guests at the party say, how they communicate. pay attention to the body languages, to the looks at their faces when they drift away from the light, laugh, and music of the present to the long gone but never in fact left most precious memories where the dead of the title are not dead but forever young and so alive. if you do, you will be awarded with the final scene of such emotional power and impact that it will always stay with you. it will break your heart to pieces, pull them together and put it back transfixed. the film as well as joyce's story centers on gabriel conroy (donal mccann as james joyce's alter ego gave a very moving understated performance) as one of the party guests who arrives with his wife gretta (anjelica huston). gabriel is still in love, feels close connection to and fascinated with her. it is after the party, he discovers that even after many years of closeness, he does not know all about her past, her pains, her regrets, and the unforgettable emotions and loss she had lived through as a young girl, and he is no part of. for the first time, he looks at her and thinks of her not as the indelible part of his existence but as another human being with her own inner world, her own loneliness and sadness, and for the first time, "a strange, friendly pity for her entered his soul." it is he who narrates the final most powerful and profound lines of the story: "snow is general all over ireland. . . falling faintly through the universe, and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead." <br /><br />if you have not seen the film or read the joyce's story, please do. they are truly the works of art that leave the everlasting impression and would change something in you to the best.
