ugh, what an embarrassing episode last night! it was either a failed script for "abc afterschool special", or the product of an earnest rookie writer, just out of college, making an homage to that classic pc anti-gun homily from 1974, "the gun". in fact hubby & were disappointed that the closing shot wasn't of the gun being melted down like in the movie!<br /><br />no, i'm not some nra shill. it's just that when the producer of an intelligent & nuanced series gets it in his head that i should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of his personal cause, i'd appreciate it if the lecture at least wasn't delivered via 2-by-4. geez!<br /><br />ok, the sociology lesson is over. the message has been delivered. the important episode has been aired. now let's get back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence.
