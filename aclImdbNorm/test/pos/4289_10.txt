can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels? tom wilkinson is no brutal othello, in the setting of modern day england. so, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven. and, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. and so the web of "separate lies" begins to fail and then hold together again. and life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives. how many webs of deceit are to be displayed in this growing tapestry? the impulse is to prop up sterling reputations and careers and relationships in this most civilized corner of the world. wilkinson gives an emotional performance, full of grace and discretion and decorum, and yet humanity, of those who have much to hide. those who desire clarity and openness on the way to justice will be disappointed with the wickedness of so much deception. and yet, who among us, has not something similar to hide about his loved ones? nevertheless, the viewer may wonder if this web is fated to crumble some day.
