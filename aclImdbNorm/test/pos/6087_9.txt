'the english patient' can rightly be compared to the films of david lean, whose sweeping epics such as 'lawrence of arabia' and 'bridge on the river kwai' must have inspired the director anthony minghella. the film is beautifully photographed, and like 'lawrence', is set in northern africa, but during the second world war. the story is complex, but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by ralph fiennes and a married woman played by kristin scott thomas.<br /><br /> the story, based on a novel by michael ondaatje, is told in flashbacks by fiennes' count laszlo de almasy - the titular character. the fact that his name does not sound like he's english plays a key role in what unfolds. he has been badly burned in a plane crash, occurring just as the film opens, and is being cared for back in europe by hana, an army nurse played by juliette binoche. what makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time, and the development of characters beyond that of the two ill-fated lovers. the film makes clear that true love and passion, even with dreaded consequences, can make life worth living, or worth dying for. if you're a romantic at heart, and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes, you may find that 'the english patient' speaks directly to you.<br /><br />
