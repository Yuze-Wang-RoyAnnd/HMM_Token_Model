pink flamingos: a representation of society's past<br /><br />pink flamingos, a film directed by john waters in 1972, is a very disturbing portrayal of the negative impact a traumatized childhood can have on future life. babs johnson grew up in a very non-typical home. blatantly, you can see the impact this had on society through her actions up to the ending where she engulfs dog feces. was this film just some sick and twisted perversion of endless gut-wrenching occurrences, or was it symbolic of something much deeper? to side with the first would be the easy way out and to the side with the latter might seem demented, but possibly true. the film does have some credible resemblance to actual events of our societal past. every leader that we as people view as `horrible' displays similar characteristics to those of babs johnson. ivan the terrible, genghis khan, adolph hitler, and joseph staling all had `troubling' childhoods. babs johnson had a troubling childhood and therefore is associated in the same class as all of the previous mentioned rulers. that is why a great deal of her actions throughout the film can be seen as disturbing. however, were her actions her own fault or society's for letting her grow up the way she did. furthermore, each character in this film represents either a past leader or event. another coincidence is edith's obsession with eggs. with an open mind this can be tied into the genocide and hitler's attempt to annihilate the jews. some view hitler as a genius, others a mad man. john waters must have seen him as a mad man because his representation edith was indeed mentally ill. edith's son crackers and traveling companion cotton are symbolic of what was wrong in our own backyard, slavery. both names, are slang terms that represent a time period that most of us would rather forget. theses characters are crucial in terms that it points out that in some times, our society in america was no better than what we often view as horrendous acts of social onslaught in other cultures. the chicken f**king scene is the epitome of what was wrong in our society in this time period and is still wrong. chicken, is a 1970's slang term for woman. therefore it might be possible that john waters were trying to bring out the subject of rape through cotton and crackers actions. the antagonist family, if a single antagonist can be determined in this film, was the marble's. marble is often mentioned in association with wealth. therefore this may be symbolic of the struggle between the poor and the wealthy a fight that still continues on today and will probably continue on forever. pink flamingos is a monumental film for its disturbing scenes but should also be noted for its camouflaged political agenda that waters displayed so affluently throughout its entirety.
