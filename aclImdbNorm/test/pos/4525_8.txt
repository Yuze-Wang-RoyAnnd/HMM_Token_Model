"murder over new york" is fun, but not as good as most of the other fox chans. this film would have been better named, "charlie chan in new york", the film's working title. this is toler's chance to play chan in the big apple. there is a lot to like here, though, including guest star shemp howard of the three stooges.<br /><br />this has one of my favorite chan sayings, "coincidence like ancient egg--leave unpleasant odour." toler and yung are good in this one and so is the supporting cast. but there is little or no mysterious atmosphere which i look for in these films. still, it is good to see.
