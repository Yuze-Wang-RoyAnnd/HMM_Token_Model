one of the better teen comedies to be filmed during the 80's, valley girl has a young nicolas cage in a starring role. deborah foreman is fun as the object of cage's desire (and whatever happened to her?). look for veteran actors colleen camp and frederic forrest as julie's hippie parents - they're quite funny!
