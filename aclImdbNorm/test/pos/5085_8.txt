some people think this was a rather bad tv series, with cheesy effects. (considering it was filmed between 1977-1979) but really, look back at those years and think, "we didn't have computers back then." so if you think about it, it's a rather good tv series.<br /><br />i always figured bad ratings killed the show, but no. the network did. they canceled out their theme as "the superhero network" and abandoned a short lived spider-man series. if it had gone on, it probably would have run well into the 80's, and if it was really lucky (and i mean really lucky), the early 90s.<br /><br />and no one wanted to pick this series up.<br /><br />anyways, jolly old (or young) nicholas hammond, of the sound of music fame, is brought to the tv screen as peter parker, the secret identity of the amazing spider-man. along the series, peter deals with a clone, a beautiful girl from a foreign country, and a corrupt politician.<br /><br />while the series is way out of timeline (being that peter is already graduated from university, and thats when he gets bit, and uncle ben is already dead,) the audience is treated to action, suspense, and the attitude that the characters have towards peter and his alter ego, spider-man.<br /><br />while it's also slightly disappointing that robert. f simon looks nothing like j.j.jameson, it's not so disappointing that betty grant isn't betty grant, but a hot african american girl (who reminds me of halle berry, who is one of the hottest women on the planet) so really, this one wasn't so bad.<br /><br />but considering the time, and how much drama they packed into this one, it kind of foreshadows what bad tv is today. either way, it's entertaining, even for today.<br /><br />8/10
