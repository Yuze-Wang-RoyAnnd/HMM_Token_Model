our family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. the theme was well handled by the director with great performances from shabana azmi, konkana sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. the climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called "good". we are still trying to understand what was the director trying to convey? were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? a better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship. this however should not take away credit that is due to konkana and shabana azmi for relating so well with the characters!
