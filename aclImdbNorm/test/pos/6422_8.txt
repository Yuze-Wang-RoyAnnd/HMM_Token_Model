i was very impressed with with this film which was directed by (luigi bazzoni). the story was about a young woman translator who suddenly has lost all memory of the last three days and has suffered nightmares about astronauts on the moon. she can not explained how this has happened to anyone. one day a postcard arrives for her from the island of garma, where she goes to visit. strangely though people seem to know her even though she has never been there before. also her dreams of astronauts on the moon come back to her.<br /><br />i thought that this was a very strange italian movie that seemed very haunting at times and there was also strange images in the film that seemed to stay with you throughout the the time you were watching the film. i would recommend this film to people just to see how good it is. highly recommended!
