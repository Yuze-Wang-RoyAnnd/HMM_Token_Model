hbo created this show for purposes of making us see the most realistic view of prison possible and they did a hell of a job. oz was created by the creators of homicide who wanted to show a raw version of prison. this show is what launched the idea of every other hbo original program such as the sopranos, sex and the city, the wire, arliss, deadwood, and six feet under amongst others. oz is the nickname for the oswald state penetentiary, a fictional prison in some us state which is never stated (though with the accents, crime scenes, and racial distribution ny is assumed). the main prison unit looked at on the show is emerald city, a seemingly ideal prison unit with more privlages than others thought out by a liberal unit manager named tim mcmanus. overall this show shows us what it is really like if one wishes to survive in prison.<br /><br />there are about 10 gangs shown on oz. first we have the muslims, a group of blacks who wish to destroy the injustices of the criminal justice system and help improve living conditions for blacks everywhere. they are led by kareem said a black militant minister who wishes to destroy everything racist about the judicial system. as a group they are not so much anti-white but rather anti-injustice. our second group of blacks is the homeboys who are essentially the street blacks who wish to keep all the bad ghetto behaviors up and run the drug trade. their leadership varies mainly because they are always losing members due to violence. in this group, one character who is acted terrifically is simon adebisi. adebisi is an african inmate who is essentially the most frighteningly evil character alive. this gang as a whole gets side help from the irish at times and is always in conflict with the latinos and sicilians for drug distribution purposes. being that oz is mostly black, the homeboys have the most soldiers of any gang inside.<br /><br />the latinos and sicilians, like the homeboys have varying leadership due to violent deaths that occur throughout the show. the sicilians pretty much have the most substantial say in how any illegal activity gets conducted in oz. the latinos make their presence known so that they can at least be coasting well if they are not in control. unlike the homeboys however, these gangs do not have as much internal battle for power and are usually more stable when it comes to drug usage. the irish who are mentioned above are a smaller gang led by a manipulative and snakelike ryan o'reily. o'reily always manages to stay in good graces with all the drug powers and manages to manipulate things in his way whenever he wants. they are in no illegal control but they are at least on good terms with all those who are.<br /><br />amongst the whiter inmates, we have the bikers and aryans. the bikers are merely a bunch of tattooed drug users who help the aryans out most of the time. the aryans are the most hated and hateful gang to most any viewer of oz. they are led by vern schillinger who is amongst the most racist, sickest, and sadistic characters one will ever see. both gangs control nothing illegal, they just merely let the darker skinned inmates see that they are a substantial threat to anyone who thinks all white inmates are soft. we also have the others. the others is a gang of outsider prisoners who are not necessarily a problem to any other inmate. in this group we see tobias beecher, a lawyer who accidentally killed a young girl whose life is forever altered by prison. we also see augustus hill, a black man bound to a wheelchair for killing a police officer who narrates the show and introduces the audience to every inmate. the character's crimes are shown as they are introduced and augustus lets us know how long they will be in prison. finally amongst gangs, there are the christians and gays. the christians merely stay religious to keep from going mental and the gays are a bunch of cross-dressers who are often raped by other inmates.<br /><br />this show gets in depth on a lot of issues dealing with the criminal justice system and is more explicit than any movie about prison. since language is unedited, we here more racial epithets and cuss words than we would on any other tv show. augustus hill's commentary provides a good way for us to truly understand each and every issue involved with oz. this show as good as it is is not at all for the light to medium hearted. it explicitly shows drug use and distribution by any means possible, prison rape, murders, fatal stabbings, and general gore than anything anyone else has seen. in my opinion it is the most influential and greatest show ever created but i can see at the same time why other people would be disturbed by this show. if you are at all interested by shows and movies about prison, oz is a must see.
