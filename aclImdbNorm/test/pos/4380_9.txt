it takes a rare movie to get better each time you see it. o brother does that and then some. the first time i saw it, i have to admit i had never seen anything like it. then i wanted to see it again, and now i'm up to double digits with this great movie, the coen brothers' finest movie they've ever done, with fargo and hudsucker proxy coming in a tight second and third for me.<br /><br />george clooney gives the performance of his career playing ulysses everett mcgee, a fast-talking know-it-all escaped convict who really doesn't know that much at all. tim blake nelson and john turturro are the perfect sidekicks for clooney, particularly nelson and his portrayal of delmar, a loyal albeit uneducated fellow escapee. john goodman is my favorite bit character as big dan, perfect. it reminds me of his part in raising arizona, he's just a perfect actor for this role. coen brothers' favorites holly hunter and charles durning also provide memorable performances. <br /><br />joel and ethan coen are masters of their trade. it's not like they try to win academy awards every time they make a film, they just try and tell a story that they want to tell, and it's entertaining. it's a loose adaptation of the odyssey, and i mean loose for all of you homer fanatics. it's just great.<br /><br />the most amazing part of this movie though is the coloring. i've watched how they got the dusty feel to the movie and i am still in awe just thinking about it. the coloring does become an important part of the movie. great great movie.
