the italian job requires daylight hours and no experience is required. this is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies. the plot is good, but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process. it's car chases, explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating "the bad guy" played by edward norton. for norton, it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as "the score". mark wahlberg and charlize theron deserve better scripts. warning: if you've seen the trailer, then you have seen the movie. if you're looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need the italian job.
