i think this tv film was first aired the same week that manchester utd played in the champions league final (1999), they run a lot of football related items that week and this one was an absolute standout.<br /><br />it played on all the clich'es that are churned out every season during the fa cup ie, plucky underdogs, lucky clothing/mascots, name on the cup etc and turned out to be brilliantly funny.<br /><br />i'm surprised it has never been repeated prior to other big football occasions, even now with the world cup just getting underway. <br /><br />a few previous posts from non-football fans have said they still love it, but a football fan will find it hilarious imho.
