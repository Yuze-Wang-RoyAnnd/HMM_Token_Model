though for most of us, sexiness is a variable quality, i cannot recall a movie that did for me what this one does. it transported me into an awfully familiar realm of longing and desire. all the compulsive attraction, uncertainty over the outcome, the palpable fear and excitement so attendant to that state of arousal were brought to fever pitch by this flick. so french and what i consider daring! no matter what your orientation, i think that the danger of chasing your desire is brought full-front and center here...much more so, say, than with kubrick's "eyes wide shut".
