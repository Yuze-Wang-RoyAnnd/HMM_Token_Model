if you like his show you might be a little disappointed. this movie has some very funny moments and the laughs are pretty constant but none are very memorable or as funny as the things on the show. the beginning sequence is really really silly and funny, and a great start. yes! borat does make a cameo appearance.<br /><br />if you are a fan then watch it! if you don't know him or don't like him then don't bother. 6.5/10
