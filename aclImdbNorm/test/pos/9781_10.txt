my family and i enjoy this show and find it a fair thumb nail sketch of what the people went through.<br /><br />my own father spent some time in changi before going onto the thailand-burma railway in "f" force. much as been said about the treatment the pow's received, i will just say that my father was 6 foot 1 inch and 196 lbs when singapore fell, at the end of the war he was 5 foot 11 inches tall and 91 lbs.<br /><br />no show could truly convey what the pow's went through, but this comes closer than most.<br /><br />as the ex pow's say, "if you didn't have mates you didn't survive." this show succeeds in getting this message across.
