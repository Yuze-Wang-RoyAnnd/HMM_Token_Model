of course, seeing a few boom mikes doesn't mean anything, does it? lord, rudy ray moore and d'urville martin really put this one together didn't they? i laughed a lot, as often happens in these types of movies, but i don't know what i was supposed to laugh at because i laughed at so many other things. i am not saying the movie was bad, but i will say that a little more editing would have done wonders. i am a huge fan of blaxploitation, so i don't think that it was horrid, but i know that "the human tornado" was several times better than this. i think that those who can make it through this movie might need a colt 45 or two afterward. i mean, it really helps you to not notice the boom mikes when you watch it again.
