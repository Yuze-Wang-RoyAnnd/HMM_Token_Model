** and 1/2 stars out of **** lifeforce is one of the strangest films i've ever seen, so ridiculous, yet at the time it's strangely compelling and never the least bit dull. whether it's due to the nonstop nudity, the large amount of violence and action, it all comes together to make an entertaining 2 hours of cinema.<br /><br />the spaceshuttle churchill has been sent to investigate halley's comet when they detect something hiding inside the coma of the giant rock. a small team, led by colonel carlsen (steve railsback), has been sent to search the area. what they discover includes hundreds of frozen bat-like creatures and three nude and seemingly unconscious humanoid beings inside strange crystalline containers, two male and one female (mathilda may). they decide to take all three back with them, which results in a catastrophe.<br /><br />when london receives no response from the crew, another crew is sent to find out what's going on. when they dock with the churchill, they find the remains of the crew, all dessicated beyond recognition. the humanoids are still in perfect condition, and they take them back to london.<br /><br />after various tests, the scientists still don't know what these beings really are. then, late one night, a security guard in the compound feels compelled to enter the room the female is being held. he touches her shoulder, and she awakens, stands up, and smiles at him in a seductive and wicked manner. she approaches him, and begins to kiss him, when it becomes clear that she's actually taking his lifeforce, sucking him of all of his energy (the effect is slightly cheesy).<br /><br />she escapes from the compound and begins to leave a trail behind. another man, colonel caine (peter firth), is brought in to track her down. then the men discover that there is a pattern to the lifeforce process. the corpse of the security guard awakens in 2 hours, and takes the lifeforce of a doctor. it seems in every 2 hours, this process is repeated by a victim. with the help of the churchill's sole survivor, carlsen, they attempt to track the girl down before it's too late.<br /><br />lifeforce is pretty good late night entertainment. it has all the elements one could look for in such a movie, loads of nudity, blood/gore, and plenty of special effects. this is certainly better than a similarly plotted film, species, thanks in large part to a more riveting finale.<br /><br />the performances range from decent to terrible. faring the worst is easily steve railsback, who overacts to no end. much better are peter firth, who comes through and convincingly, and the gorgeous mathilda may (she's as beautiful as french actresses sophie marceau and emmanuelle seigner). may does go through virtually the whole role without wearing clothing, and there were reports that it was hard on her while filming, so the fact that she is able to go through every scene without fidgeting and looking uncomfortable is impressive. there are times when she can be quite creepy, being simply seductive. most of the film manages to work because of her.<br /><br />
