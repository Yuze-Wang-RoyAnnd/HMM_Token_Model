without question, film is a powerful medium, more so now than ever before, due to the accessibility of dvd/video, which gives the filmmaker the added assurance that his story or message is going to be seen by possibly millions of people. use of this medium, therefore, attaches an innate responsibility to the artist, inasmuch as film can be educational, as well as entertaining, which dictates that certain subjects should be approached accordingly and with a corresponding sensitivity and sensibility. a film like spielberg's `schindler's list,' for example, is important, in that it keeps alive the memory of that which must not be forgotten, and as history tends to repeat itself, spielberg's film can be viewed as a valuable tool in preventing a recurrence of that tragedy. in that same vein, this film, `focus,' directed by neal slavin, is important, in it illuminates the problematic reality of anti-semitism, which for years beyond number has affected millions of people, is still unimaginably prevalent today, and like any manifestation of bigotry, will perpetuate itself if left unchecked or ignored. born of a xenophobic strain, it's a disease infecting society which, unabated, could be terminal; and with it's penetrating insights into the condition, this film is an effective vaccine that just may at the very least help stem the proliferation of it, and hopefully may act as a step toward eradicating it altogether.<br /><br />lawrence newman (william h. macy) served his country in the great war, and has since lived a quiet, conventional life in new york. he's had the same job as a personnel director for some twenty years, and owns the house, located in an average, middle-class neighborhood, in which he lives with his mother (kay hawtrey). lawrence is the kind of guy who gets by just fine by minding his own business and refusing to involve himself with matters that are not (he feels) his concern.<br /><br />all of that is about to change, however, as with the advent of world war 2, lawrence, along with the owner of the corner market, mr. finkelstein (david paymer), inexplicably finds himself a target of the neighborhood xenophobes, who have aligned themselves with the `union crusaders,' a national organization currently taken to channeling their fears and hatred upon jews, or anyone who even `looks' like a jew. and suddenly lawrence finds that he can no longer just stand on the sidelines and watch the game being played; because now, he is the game, whether he wants to be or not.<br /><br />working from an intelligent, well written screenplay by kendrew lascelles, which he adapted from arthur miller's novel, slavin presents a chilling scenario that incisively examines the effects of bigotry upon those against whom it is leveled; and when one considers the fact that this is not merely a hypothetical situation, but a depiction of reality, it becomes all the more disquieting, even unnerving. and what makes the film so effective is slavin's obvious grasp of his subject, and his studied presentation, which is thought-provoking in it's subtlety. in the opening scene, slavin establishes lawrence's `character,' and very soon afterward reaffirms it in another scene, which affords the audience the opportunity to observe and assimilate how lawrence's mind actually works; the thought processes that direct his life. with that in place, then, slavin is able to take his audience along with lawrence as his problems gradually begin to unfold. by so doing, he effectively illustrates how the problem evolves, rather than merely stating the problem and addressing it head on, which heightens the viewers emotional involvement, and ultimately enhances the impact of the film. <br /><br />slavin makes an important statement with this film, which is not only an indictment of bigotry, but carries a cautionary message about apathy, as well. and to his credit, he never hits you over the head with it or engages in subjective finger-pointing to make his case; instead, he proceeds carefully, taking great pains to be as objective as possible with all that he is submitting for your consideration. his approach is that of a cinematic diplomat; and it's an approach that serves slavin-- and his film-- quite well.<br /><br />as lawrence, william h. macy-- one of the best character actors in the business-- gives an amazing performance, establishing the credibility and believability of his character with a sensitive, honest and introspective portrayal. he never attempts to circumvent the personal flaws of lawrence's nature, but uses them, instead, to create a character that is decidedly three-dimensional, which not only makes him convincing, but serves to reaffirm the integrity of the portrayal. what makes it so compelling is macy's ability to convey the process by which he examines his own conscience, which successfully enables the viewer to share in the experience of his personal epiphany. in the final analysis, it's the strength of macy's performance, more than anything else, that makes this film so significantly distinct. <br /><br />another of the film's strengths is the performance turned in by laura dern, as gertrude hart, a portrayal that effectively complements macy's work, as well as that of slavin. dern lends tremendous substance to her character, capturing her physically as well as emotionally, and her colorful zeal crates a striking contrast to lawrence's reserve that works extremely well, for her character as well as the film itself.<br /><br />and just as sean combs recently (in `monster's ball') made a good case against dismissing out-of-hand the acting endeavors of an established `rock star,' meat loaf aday gives a powerful performance here, as fred, lawrence's next-door neighbor. it demonstrates, too, that a true artist will produce, regardless of the kind of canvas he's given to work with.<br /><br />the supporting cast includes michael copeman (carlson), kenneth welsh (father crighton), joseph ziegler (gargan) and arlene meadows (mrs. dewitt). the kind of film that makes a filmmaker proud of his craft, `focus,' offers a memorable experience that hopefully will prove to be enlightening, as well, to those unaware that such conditions have existed, and still do-- even in this, the land of the free. 10/10. <br /><br /> <br /><br />
