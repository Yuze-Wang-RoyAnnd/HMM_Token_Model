i really thoroughly enjoyed this movie. for one it didn't have the corny special effects that the big budget movies have. the acting was decent in this one, only you can tell right off the bat that it's dubbed, but once you get over that fact, and that you can't switch languages on the dvd version it's cool. the plot line was very unique, you take a situation like a heat wave very common around the world, especially in frankfurt which i've been to many times, and you take a garbage strike which happens often enough in this country and you have a recipe for disaster. i loved how the hordes of rats just went everywhere and how the idea that if you picked up the garbage, that's the last thing you wanna do, you pick it up, the rats don't get what the want, they are in essence following the garbage pick up, so you ask well if garbage men are on strike , who picks up the garbage, private contractors, anyway military wants to quarantine off the city oops wrong thing to do, then you would have all the rats take over the city, then throw in a mayor who wants to keep a lid on the budget, and line her pockets, you have a realistic movie, and the female lead is also a pleasure to watch on the screen, a very decent movie i thought, wish more were made like this, another small nitpick is the depiction of frankfurt could have been done a little better, but for the average viewer who's never been to frankfurt... i was born in germany and been to frankfurt many times.. it won't matter, but all in all a great big thumbs up.
