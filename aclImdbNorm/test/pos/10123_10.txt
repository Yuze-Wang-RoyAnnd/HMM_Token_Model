cuba gooding,jr. will win the oscar for best actor in 2003.and ed harris will win for best supporting actor. what a beautiful and poignant film it is but be sure to bring along a box of tissues because if this film doesn't get to you, then you have ice water in your veins.<br /><br />it was 1976. the setting was in south carolina and the civil rights act was about ten years old. we have a white high school football coach and teacher, ed harris. then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow, cuba gooding, whose greatest possessions, including a radio, are piled into a shopping cart which is also used as his bicycle.<br /><br />ed harris takes a keen interest in the fellow for a reason explained much later on in the film. he gives cuba the nickname "radio" and what follows is an absoutely riveting, engrossing, poignant exploration of the human soul.<br /><br />the movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.
