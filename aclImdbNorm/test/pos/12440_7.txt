the happiest days of your life showcases some of britain's greatest comedy talents of its time in a traditionally farcical and upper-class-twit like fashion. generally it is a whistle-stop tour of stuffy english behaviour with the girls-only school providing a great setting for the dotty goings-on. margaret rutherford, alastair sim and - most especially! - joyce grenfell are all fantastic, giving us a lot of laughs as they express their utter horror at what they are having to deal with. as the film moves on, things get sillier and sillier with the tour around the school for the parents being a suitably crackers high point.<br /><br />at this point i will give special mention, again, to joyce grenfell and her wonderful character miss gossage. she is so extraordinarily innocent, silly, apologetic and ineffectual that she seems to steal the whole film. she provides the greatest laugh of the film when she flirts with a male teacher ("call me sausage!").<br /><br />whilst some of the film is slow or dated, and not always very involving, it still maintains most of its sparkle and barely pauses for romance. good for a silly, harmless giggle.<br /><br />7/10
